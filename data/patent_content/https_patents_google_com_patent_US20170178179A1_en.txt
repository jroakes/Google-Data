- This information parcel can include information, such as an identifier of the selected ad 225 , an identifier of the publisher 104 , and the date/time the ad 225 was selected by the user. This information parcel may facilitate processing of conversion activities or other user transactions.
- the user access device 108 may then be redirected to the advertiser 102 associated with the selected ad 225 .
- the user access device 108 may send a request 214 to the associated advertiser 102 and then load a landing page 216 from the advertiser 102 .
- the user may then perform a conversion action at the landing page 216 , such as purchasing a product or service, registering, joining a mailing list, etc.
- An advertiser code snippet 218 which may be provided by the AMS 106 , may be included within a conversion confirmation page script, such as a script within a web page presented after the purchase.
- the user access device 108 may execute the advertiser code snippet 218 .
- the advertiser code snippet 218 may contact the AMS 106 and report conversion data 220 to the AMS 106 .
- the conversion data 220 may include conversion types and numbers as well as information from cookies.
- the conversion data 220 may be maintained in the conversion data repository 136 .
- the AMS 106 may perform one or more actions to increase the likelihood of users finding relevant ads and performing conversion actions.
- the AMS 106 may modify or retarget the presentation of ads by modifying aspects of the ad portion 208 .
- the AMS 106 may also determine user attention related to the ads 225 displayed on the content page 204 and modify the ad portion 208 based on the determined attention.
- the user may return to the content page 204 without performing a conversion activity.
- the AMS 106 may evaluate this “click-back” activity and then make a decision whether to show the user an option to view additional ads related to the ad 225 . This decision may be based on an amount of time the user spent on the landing page 216 before returning to the content page 204 .
- FIG. 3 illustrates exemplary modifications to the ad portion 208 , which may occur during data flow 200 in order to retarget the presentation of ads.
- the ad portion 208 may include one or more ads including ad 225 .
- ad 225 could be an automobile related ad.
- Ad portion 208 may also include one or more user-interface elements, such as scrolling elements 310 , that allow the user to navigate additional ads.
- the scrolling elements 310 may allow the user to scroll from one set of ads to another set of ads. Depending on the layout of the content page 204 and the ad portion 208 , the scrolling elements 310 may facilitate vertical and/or horizontal scrolling. In some examples, the scrolling elements 310 may include any type of scrolling controls, such as selectable arrows (or other) icons and/or custom scroll bar controls. Other types of user-interface elements could also be used, in addition to or instead of scrolling type elements. For example, various menus (e.g., pull-down menus, pop-up menus, etc.), buttons, radio buttons, sliders, lists, frames, windows, selection boxes, listboxes, text, graphics, etc. may be used. The user-interface elements could be static and/or dynamic (e.g., animated). The user-interface elements could include visual elements, aural elements, and even kinesthetic or physical elements.
- the additional ads through which the user may scroll or otherwise navigate may be added to the content page 204 by the AMS 106 .
- the additional ads may be related to the ad originally selected by the user (e.g., the ad 225 ) or the landing page (e.g., 216 ) associated with that ad.
- the additional ads may include ads that were previously retrieved by the AMS 106 in response to a request and/or may include ads subsequently retrieved by the AMS 106 .
- the ad portion 208 could also include one or more topical ad links 315 , such as an “Automobile Tires” link.
- the topical ad links 315 may include words, phrases or other representations that summarize all or a portion of the displayed content 206 of the content page 204 or topical variations related to the displayed content 206 .
- the ad links 315 could summarize related topical variations, such as automobile rentals, repair, and tires.
- the topical ad links 315 may be operable to allow users to navigate to or through additional ads.
- the links 315 may be associated with navigation links (e.g., hyperlinks) that direct users to one or more dedicated ad landing pages.
- These dedicated ad landing pages may be maintained by the AMS 106 and include additional ads related to the topics represented by the selected links.
- the user may be directed to a dedicated ad landing page 325 , maintained by the AMS 106 , that includes additional ads 335 related to the topic represented by the selected link—in this example, tires.
- the ad portion 208 may be modified to include a direct ad link 317 , which could be labeled as “Show More Ads.”
- the direct ad link 317 may direct users to a dedicated landing page, maintained by the AMS 106 , that includes additional ads related to the selected ad 225 .
- the user may be redirected to a dedicated landing page 327 , which lists additional ads related to the ad 225 , e.g., automobiles.
- the AMS 106 may be configured to cycle ads in response to user selections of the topical ad links 315 . For example, when the user selects the “Automobile Tires” link 315 , the AMS 106 could replace the existing ads in the ad portion 208 with new ads (not shown) related to the selected link 315 . In some implementations, the AMS 106 may perform the cycling so that a user is presented with the new ads when the user returns to the content page 204 after viewing one or more landing pages (e.g., the dedicated ad landing page 325 ).
- the AMS 106 may perform the cycling so that a user is presented with the new ads when the user returns to the content page 204 after viewing one or more landing pages (e.g., the dedicated ad landing page 325 ).
- the AMS 106 may modify aspects of the ad portion 208 (e.g., to include the elements 310 or the links 315 ) based on user attention to ads.
- the AMS 106 may determine user attention related to the ads 225 displayed on the content page 204 .
- the AMS 106 may determine the amount of time the user spends on an advertiser landing page.
- the AMS 106 may also determine whether or not a conversion action is performed at the landing page and whether or not the user returns to the content page 204 .
- the AMS 106 may modify aspects of the ad portion 208 based on this determined user attention.
- the AMS 106 may determine user attention to ads by sending the user access device 108 code 222 (e.g., JavaScript®), which could automatically determine and maintain various user device and/or other information and be used to determine the amount of time spent on the landing page 216 .
- the user access device 108 and the AMS 106 could exchange requests and responses (not shown) related to various user activity. A combination of approaches may also be used.
- the AMS 106 may modify or retarget the presentation of ads, which may include modifying aspects of the content page 204 including aspects of the ad portion 208 .
- the AMS 106 may send the user access device 108 modification information 224 , which modifies aspects of the ad portion 208 .
- the modification information 224 may populate the ad portion 208 with additional and different ads related to the selected ad 225 and/or related to the content 206 on the content page 204 .
- the modification information 224 may also include one more links (e.g., the links 315 ) to dedicated advertising landing pages maintained by the AMS 106 .
- the modification information 224 could also include information for modifying an interface of the ad portion 208 .
- the modification information 224 could modify the ad portion 208 to include additional and/or different user interface elements, such as elements 310 .
- FIGS. 2 and 3 are exemplary only and not intended to be restrictive. Other data flows may therefore occur in the environment 100 and, even with the data flow 200 , the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. Further, the illustrated events may overlap and/or may exist in fewer steps. Moreover, certain events may not be present and additional and/or different events may be included.
- the publisher 104 could send an ad request to the AMS 106 prior to sending a content page (e.g., the content page 204 ) to the user access device 108 .
- the AMS 106 may respond by sending relevant ads (e.g., the ad 225 ) to the publisher 104 .
- the publisher 104 may combine the received ads with requested content in the content page 204 and then send the content page 204 , including the ad portion 208 , to the user access device 108 for display to a user.
- Other modifications to the data flow 200 are also possible.
- FIG. 4 is flow diagram depicting an exemplary advertising process 400 for modifying or retargeting an ad presentation.
- the process 400 may be performed by the AMS 106 .
- the process 400 could be performed by other systems, such as the publisher 104 , in conjunction with or instead of the AMS 106 .
- the process 400 may include generating an ad presentation ( 410 ), determining user interest ( 420 ), determining user satisfaction ( 430 ), and modifying the ad presentation ( 440 ) based on the determined user interest and/or the determined satisfaction.
- the process 400 may begin when an ad presentation is generated ( 410 ).
- ad presentation may refer to, for example, to any type of rendering of ads to a user. Generating an ad presentation could also occur when ads are audibly displayed, visually displayed, or even kinesthetically or physically displayed.
- generating an ad presentation ( 410 ) may occur when the publisher 104 provides to the user access device 108 the content page 204 , which includes the ad portion 208 containing various ads, such as ads 225 .
- the content page 204 may be related to content retrieved by the publisher 104 in response to a request from a particular user access device 108 .
- Generating an ad presentation may involve retrieving ads to populate the ad presentation. This could involve, for example, the AMS 106 retrieving ads from the ad repository 126 in response to requested content. It could also involve the publishers 104 retrieving ads from the AMS 106 or other source and/or the publishers 104 retrieving locally stored ads previously received from the AMS 106 or other source.
- the process 400 may then determine user interest ( 420 ). Determining user interest may involve evaluating user interaction with the ad presentation, for example, content page 204 and the ad portion 208 . In some examples, determining user interaction may include determining that the user has selected (e.g., clicked) on a displayed ad (e.g., the ad 225 ). Determining user interest may also involve evaluating other user selections as well as a number of selections made by a user. In some examples, determining user interest may involve generating and providing code to the user access devices 108 (or some other network element).
- determining user interest ( 420 ) could include determining that a user has interacted with a displayed ad without visiting a landing page. That is, the determining ( 420 ) could determine some user interaction with an aspect of the displayed ad 225 that does not result in the user being redirected to the landing page 216 . For example, the determining could detect cursor movement in or near the ad portion 208 and/or movement over or near the displayed ad 225 .
- Determining user interest ( 420 ) could also involve analyzing historical information. For example, the determining could involve determining user preferences (e.g., pages visited, ads selected, etc.) and determining user interest in a particular product, service, and/or ad based on past preferences.
- user preferences e.g., pages visited, ads selected, etc.
- the process 400 may also determine user satisfaction ( 430 ).
- determining user satisfaction may involve determining that the user was not presented with ads relevant to the user's interest. Determining user satisfaction may include determining that the user selects an ad (e.g., the ad 225 ) from the ad presentation (e.g., the ad portion 208 ) and investigates the advertiser (e.g., visits the advertiser landing page 216 ) but then returns to the ad presentation without performing a conversion action. Determining user satisfaction could include various other actions, such as analyzing historical information, user preferences and/or analyzing website data. Determining user satisfaction could also include obtaining satisfaction information directly from a user, for example, by presenting an inquiry to the user.
- FIG. 4 depicts determining user interest ( 420 ) and determining user satisfaction ( 430 ) as separate elements. All or portions of the functionality associated with these elements, however, could overlap. Moreover, these elements could be represent aspects of more general functionality for determining user attention to ads. That is, process 400 could involve determining user attention to ads, which may include functionality associated with determining user interest ( 420 ) and/or determining user satisfaction ( 430 ).
- the process 400 may modify the ad presentation ( 440 ) based on at least one of the determined user interest and the determined user satisfaction. Modifying the ad presentation may involve performing any activity that could increase the likelihood of the user finding an ad that results in a conversion action. In some implementations, modifying the ad presentation ( 440 ) may involve modifying the content page (e.g., the content page 204 ) containing the originally selected ad (e.g., the ad 225 ) using various techniques.
- the content page e.g., the content page 204
- the originally selected ad e.g., the ad 225
- One modification technique involves modifying the ad presentation to include a set of user-interface elements that allow the user to navigate from one set of ads to another set of ads.
- the content page 204 could include one or more scrolling elements (e.g., the elements 310 ) that allow the user to scroll through additional ads.
- Other types of user-interface elements could also be used, such as static or dynamic menus, buttons, sliders, lists, boxes, and the like.
- the user-interface elements could include visual elements, aural elements, and even kinesthetic or physical elements.
- Another modification technique involves presenting to the user one or more links (e.g., the links 315 and 317 ) or other options for viewing additional ads related to a previously selected ad or related to requested content. These additional ads may be displayed at one or more dedicated ad locations (such dedicated ad landing pages 325 and 327 ), which could be maintained, for example, by the AMS 106 .
- Other modification techniques may involve cycling through ads. This may involve cycling out old ads and replacing them with new ads, which may be related to various user selections (e.g., an ad selection).
- FIG. 5 illustrates another exemplary advertising method 500 for modifying or retargeting an ad presentation.
- the process 500 may be performed by the AMS 106 .
- the process 500 could be performed by other systems, such as the publisher 104 , in conjunction with or instead of the AMS 106 .
- the process 500 may determine a user selection in an ad presentation ( 510 ). This may involve, for example, determining a user selection of the ad 225 from the ad portion 208 of the content page 204 .
- the process 500 may then initiate a timer ( 520 ). This could be implemented, in some examples, using a software-based timer. For example, the determining may include providing code (e.g., JavaScript® or the like) to the user access devices 108 or other network element. Other implementation techniques could also be used.
- the process 500 may determine whether the user returns to the ad presentation after selecting the ad ( 530 ). For example, this decision may involve determining whether a user returns to the content page 204 after viewing the advertiser landing page 216 associated with the selected ad 225 . If the user does not return to the ad presentation ( 530 ), then the process 500 may continue to determine additional user selections ( 510 ) or, alternatively, it may terminate.
- the process 500 may analyze the elapsed time ( 540 ). For example, the process 500 may analyze the amount of time the user spent at the advertiser landing page before returning to the content page that directed the user to the landing page. Analyzing the elapsed time may involve comparing the elapsed time to various thresholds.
- the analyzing ( 540 ) may involve making assumptions about user interest based on the elapsed time and deciding whether or not to perform a modification based on the elapsed time. For example, if a user selects an ad and then browses an advertiser landing page for three seconds before returning to the content page, the process 500 may assume that there was little or no interest in the landing page or the associated advertiser.
- the process 500 may assume that there was some interest in the landing page and/or the associated advertiser. Different time thresholds may trigger different interest assumptions. For example, 15 seconds may indicate a low interest and 30 seconds may indicate a medium interest.
- the process 500 may decide whether or not to perform a modification to the ad presentation. For example, if the user spends two seconds on an advertiser landing page, the process 500 may assume that the user is not interested in viewing additional ads related to the selected ad. Using this assumption, the process 500 may decide not to modify the ad presentation. In another example, the user may spend 30 seconds on the advertiser landing page. In this case, the process 500 may decide that a modification to the ad presentation would be appropriate.
- the process 500 may also determine a degree or level of modification to perform. For example, if the user interest is assumed to be low, a first level of modification could be determined. If the user interests is determined to be medium or high, a second level of modification may be applied.
- the process 500 may modify the ad presentation ( 550 ).
- The may involve modifying the ad portion 208 of the content page 204 to include a set of user-interface elements (e.g., the elements 310 ) that allow the user to scroll through additional ads.
- Modifying the ad presentation ( 550 ) may also involve presenting to the user one or more selectable links (e.g., the links 315 and 317 ) for viewing additional ads related a previously selected ad, related to advertisers and advertiser landing pages, and/or related to requested content on a content page.
- Modifying the ad presentation ( 550 ) may also involve cycling through ads. This may involve cycling out ads from the ad portion of a content page and inserting new ads related to the user selections.
- the modifying ( 550 ) may include selecting and performing different modifications based on the determined user interest. For example, user-interface elements may be added in response to a low user interest and topical links may be added in response to a high interest. In other examples, a single topical link could be added in response to a low user interest and multiple topical links could be added in response to a high user interest. Of course, other variations and techniques are also possible.
- FIG. 6 illustrates another exemplary advertising process 600 for modifying an ad presentation.
- the process 600 may be used to modify ad presentations when the amount of time a user spends at an advertiser landing page before returning to a content page cannot be analyzed.
- the process 600 may be performed by the AMS 106 .
- the process 600 could be performed by other systems, such as the publisher 104 , in conjunction with or instead of the AMS 106 .
- the process 600 may determine a user selection in an ad presentation ( 610 ). This may involve, for example, determining a user selection of the ad 225 from the ad portion 208 of the content page 204 .
- the process 600 may modify the ad presentation prior to the user leaving the ad presentation ( 620 ). For example, the process 600 may modify aspects of the ad portion 208 of the content page 204 prior to the user being redirected from the content page 204 to an advertising landing page (e.g., the landing page 216 ).
- Modifying the ad presentation ( 620 ) may involve performing one or more modifications similar to those described above in connection with elements 440 and 550 of FIGS. 4 and 5 .
- Modifying the ad presentation ( 620 ) may involve, for example, modifying the content page to include a set of user-interface elements (e.g., the elements 310 ) that allow the user to scroll through additional ads.
- Modifying the ad presentation ( 620 ) may also involve presenting to the user one or more selectable links (e.g., the links 315 and 317 ) for viewing additional ads related a previously selected ad, related to advertisers and advertiser landing pages, and/or related to requested content on a content page.
- Modifying the ad presentation ( 620 ) may involve cycling out ads from the ad portion of a content page and inserting new ads related to the user selections.
- the process 600 may then present the modified ad presentation ( 630 ) to the user. This may involve detecting that the user returns to the content page 204 from the advertiser landing page (e.g., the landing page 216 ) and presenting various modifications to ad portion 208 of the content page 204 .
- the advertiser landing page e.g., the landing page 216
- FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary process 700 for processing ad impressions.
- the process 700 may be performed by the AMS 106 .
- the process 700 could also be performed by other systems.
- the process 700 may begin when an ad presentation is generated ( 710 ). This may involve presenting the ad portion 208 in the content page 204 to a user.
- the ad portion 208 may include a displayed ad, such as the ad 225 .
- the process 700 may then retrieve or fetch additional ads ( 720 ) for display to the user. This may occur, for example, in response to determined user interest and/or determined user satisfaction (e.g., stages 420 and 430 ) and/or in response to a user selection of an ad from the ad presentation (e.g., stage 610 ).
- Retrieving additional ads ( 720 ) may involve the AMS 106 retrieving or fetching additional ads from the ad repository 126 .
- Retrieving additional ads ( 720 ) could also involve the publishers 104 retrieving additional ads from the AMS 106 or other source and/or the publishers 104 retrieving locally stored ads previously received from the AMS 106 or other source.
- the process 700 may modify the ad presentation to include the retrieved additional ads ( 730 ).
- Modifying the ad presentation ( 730 ) may involve, among other things, modifying the ad presentation to allow a user to navigate through the retrieved additional ads.
- the modifying may involve performing modifications similar to those described above in connection with element 550 of the process 500 .
- the modifying ( 730 ) could include modifying the ad presentation to include a set of user-interface elements (e.g., the elements 310 ) that allow the user to scroll through the additional ads.
- the process 700 may then detect ad impressions ( 740 ). This may involve detecting presentations of the retrieved additional ads. For example, if two additional ads are retrieved and presented in a modified ad presentation, the detecting ( 740 ) may detect an ad impression for each additional ad. Detecting impressions ( 740 ) may also involve detecting the lack of ad impressions (i.e., potential impressions). That is, the detecting could detect that an ad has not been presented.
- detecting impressions ( 740 ) could involve detecting “delayed” impressions of retrieved ads. That is, the detecting could involve detecting impressions of ads that are available for presentation but not initially presented. As an example, the retrieving ( 720 ) could yield five additional ads (e.g., Ad- 1 , Ad- 2 , Ad- 3 , Ad- 4 , and Ad- 5 ).
- the ad presentation (e.g., ad portion 208 ) could be modified so that some of those additional ads (e.g., Ad- 1 , Ad- 2 ) are initially presented while the remaining additional ads (e.g., Ad- 3 , Ad- 4 , Ad- 5 ) are viewable when the user navigates through the presentation using a scroll or other user-interface control (e.g., the elements 310 ).
- detecting ad impressions ( 740 ) may involve detecting if and when any of those remaining additional ads not initially presented (e.g., Ad- 3 , Ad- 4 , Ad- 5 ) are presented.
- the detecting may involve detecting when a user activates a scroll or other user-interface control to cause the remaining ads (e.g., Ad- 3 , Ad- 4 , Ad- 5 ) to be displayed. If any of the remaining ads (e.g., Ad- 3 , Ad- 4 , Ad- 5 ) are not presented to the user, the detecting ( 740 ) may detect this information as well. In this fashion, the process 700 may serve to track delayed impressions of retrieved ads.
- the remaining ads e.g., Ad- 3 , Ad- 4 , Ad- 5
- detecting ad impressions may involve determining and maintaining the ratio of ad impressions to potential impressions. It may also involve determining and maintaining the ratio of the number of click-throughs associated with a particular ad to the number of impressions of that ad. Detecting ad impressions could also involve determining and maintaining various other ratios, metrics, parameters, performance indicators and the like.
- the process 700 may then report the detected ad impressions ( 750 ), which may include reporting information associated with detected impressions. This could involve reporting that an ad was presented to and/or selected by a user.
- the reporting ( 750 ) could also involve reporting that an ad was retrieved but not presented and/or selected.
- the reporting ( 750 ) could involve the publishers 104 reporting impressions information to the AMS 106 and/or the AMS 106 reporting impressions information to the publishers 104 , the advertisers 104 and/or another entity.
- the reporting ( 750 ) could involve routing information with a given system. For example, the reporting could involve the AMS 106 routing impressions information from one AMS component or related system to another AMS component or related system.
- the reported ad impressions information may be used to facilitate various performance analyses and/or financial transactions. In some examples, the impressions information could be used in crediting accounts associated with the publishers 104 and debiting accounts of the advertisers 102 .
- FIGS. 4-7 are consistent with exemplary implementations.
- the sequences of events in FIGS. 4-7 are exemplary and not intended to be limiting. Other processes may therefore be used and, even with the processes depicted in FIGS. 4-7 , the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. Further, the illustrated events may overlap and/or may exist in fewer steps. Moreover, certain events may not be present and additional events may be included in the illustrated processes.

Abstract
An advertisement presentation is generated for display to a user. The presentation may include an advertisement that is associated with an advertiser and with content requested by the user. User attention to the advertisement may be determined based on user activity. The advertisement presentation may be modified based on the determined user attention.
Description
- This disclosure is generally related to online advertising.
- Advertising through interactive media is gaining popularity. The Internet in particular is becoming a dominant advertising medium. Internet users often search the internet for products and services, and advertisers frequently use the Internet to target audiences interested in available products and services.
- One form of Internet advertising involves distributing advertisements to online publishers for display on websites. For example, an online publisher (e.g., an online newspaper) can place brand-specific automobile advertisements for a given automobile manufacturer on a published automobile-related or other web page, in order to drive online customers to the manufacturer website. Another example of Internet advertising involves presenting advertisements in response to searches initiated by users of online searching services, such as www.google.com. In response to user queries containing keywords, such searching sites can present search results to the users as well as advertisements pertaining to the queries or results.
- Users viewing online content may be directed to advertisements that relate to, but do not match, their interests. For example, a potential purchaser of an automobile part may be directed to advertisements related to automobiles generally but not advertisements related to the particular part of interest. This may occur, for example, with small advertisers who lack the financial power to have their advertisements positioned prominently on websites. Users may not find advertisements related to such advertisers even though these advertisers may offer products and services that are of particular interest to the users. In these situations, relevancy of advertisements may be compromised and the advertisements may fail to translate into real revenue.
- In one general aspect, an advertisement presentation is generated for display to a user. The presentation includes an advertisement associated with an advertiser and with content requested by the user. User attention to the advertisement is determined based on user activity. The advertisement presentation is modified based on the determined user attention.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, generating the advertisement presentation may include presenting the advertisement on a portion of a web page. Generating the advertisement presentation may include presenting the advertisement in a printed publication, a television channel, and/or a radio channel.
- Determining user attention to the advertisement may include determining user interest in the advertisement based on user activity and determining user satisfaction with the advertisement based on user activity associated with the advertiser. Determining user attention may include determining an amount of time a user views information associated with the advertiser and comparing the determined amount of time with a threshold value.
- Modifying the advertisement presentation may include providing an option for navigating at least one additional advertisement related to the advertisement in the advertisement presentation. At least one additional advertisement may be selected from retrieved advertisements and information associated with the selecting may be tracked.
- Modifying the advertisement presentation may include presenting on a user interface display scrolling interface elements that allow a user to scroll through additional advertisements related to the advertisement in the advertisement presentation. Modifying the advertisement presentation may include presenting on a user interface display at least one link that navigates to a dedicated advertising page maintained by an entity other than the advertiser. The dedicated advertising page may include additional advertisements related to the advertisement in the advertisement presentation.
- Modifying the advertisement presentation may involve generating a descriptor that summarizes the content requested by a user and associating the generated descriptor with a navigation link to a web page displaying additional advertisements related to the displayed advertisement. The navigation link may be presented on a user interface display. Generating the descriptor may involve generating a phrase of one or more words that summarizes the requested content.
- In another general aspect, a system includes an advertising management modules. The advertising management modules is configured to generate an advertisement presentation for display to a user. The presentation includes an advertisement associated with an advertiser and with content requested by the user. The management module is further configured to determine user attention to the advertisement based on user activity and modify the advertisement presentation based on the determined user attention.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the advertising management module may be configured to present the advertisement on a portion of a web page. The advertising management module may be configured to present the advertisement in a printed publication, a television channel, and/or a radio channel.
- The advertising management module may be configured to determine user attention by determining user interest in the advertisement based on user activity and determine user satisfaction with the advertisement based on user activity associated with the advertiser. The advertising management module may be configured to determine user attention by determining an amount of time a user views information associated with the advertiser and comparing the determined amount of time with a threshold value.
- The advertising management module may be configured to modify the presentation by presenting on a user interface display scrolling interface elements that allow a user to scroll through additional advertisements related to the advertisement in the advertisement presentation.
- The advertising management module is configured to modify the presentation by presenting on a user interface display at least one link that navigates to a dedicated advertising page. The dedicated advertising page may be maintained by an entity other than the advertiser. The dedicated advertising page may include additional advertisements related to the advertisement in the advertisement presentation.
- The advertising management module may be configured to modify the presentation by generating one or more words that summarize the content requested by a user and associating the one or more words with a navigation link to a web page displaying additional advertisements related to the displayed advertisement. The advertising management module may be configured to present the navigation link on a user interface display.
- In another general aspect, a system includes means for generating an advertisement presentation for display to a user. The presentation includes an advertisement associated with an advertiser and with content requested by the user. The system includes means for determining user interest in the at least one advertisement based on user activity and means for determining user satisfaction with the at least one advertisement based on user activity associated with the advertiser. The system further includes means for modifying the advertisement presentation based on at least one of the determined user interest and the determined user satisfaction.
- In another general aspect, a computer readable medium stores a computer program. The computer program includes instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor to generate an advertisement presentation for display to a user. The presentation includes an advertisement associated with an advertiser and with content requested by the user. Instructions cause at least one processor to determine user interest in the at least one advertisement based on user activity and determine user satisfaction with the at least one advertisement based on user activity associated with the advertiser. Instructions cause at least one processor to modify the advertisement presentation based on at least one of the determined user interest and the determined user satisfaction.
- In another general aspect, a computer-implemented method includes receiving a request for advertisements from a user device. The request for advertisements includes information associated with a content presentation received by the user device. The content presentation includes a content portion having content and an advertisement portion for displaying advertisements. The method further involves providing at least one advertisement to the user device in response to the request, the at least advertisement populating the advertisement portion of the content presentation. The method involves receiving information from the user device reflecting a user interaction with the at least one advertisement. The method involves providing, to the user device, information that modifies an aspect of the advertisement portion based on the user interaction.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the content presentation may include a web page. The web page includes the content portion having content and an HTML element for displaying advertisements. Receiving the request for advertisements may involve receiving a URL of the web page and parameters associated with the HTML element. Providing at least one advertisement may involve selecting the at least one advertisement based on the received URL.
- Providing the information that modifies an aspect of the advertisement portion may involve providing a graphical user interface control, providing a selectable navigation link, and/or providing at least one additional advertisement.
- In some implementations, the method may involve analyzing the user interaction information, deciding whether or not to modify the advertisement portion of the content presentation based on results of the analyzing, and determining a degree of modification for the advertisement portion, based on results of the deciding.
- In another general aspect, a computer-implemented method involves sending a request for content to a publisher and receiving a content presentation from the publisher in response to the request. The content presentation includes a content portion having content and an advertisement portion for displaying advertisements. The method involves sending a request for advertisements to an advertisement server in response to receiving the content presentation from the publisher. The request for advertisements includes information associated with the received advertisement portion and information identifying the received content. The method involves receiving at least one advertisement related to the received content from the advertisement server, the at least advertisement populating the advertisement portion. The method also involves sending information to the advertisement server reflecting a user interaction with the at least one advertisement and receiving, from the advertisement server, information that modifies an aspect of the advertisement portion based on the user interaction.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, receiving the content presentation may involve receiving a web page. The web page includes the content portion having content and an HTML element for displaying advertisements.
- Sending the request for advertisements may involve sending a URL of the content page. Receiving information that modifies an aspect of the advertisement portion may include receiving a graphical user interface control, receiving a selectable navigation link, and/or receiving at least one additional advertisement.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating anexemplary advertising environment 100. Theenvironment 100 may include one ormore advertisers 102, one ormore publishers 104, an ad management system (AMS) 106, and one or more user access devices 108, which may be coupled to anetwork 110. In some examples, each of theelements elements - The
advertisers 102 may include any entities that are associated with advertisements (“ads”). An advertisement or an “ad” refers to any form of communication in which one or more products, services, ideas, people, organizations or other items are identified and promoted. Ads may include communicated via various mediums and in various forms. In some examples, ads may be communicated through an interactive medium, such as the Internet, and may include graphical ads (e.g., banner ads), textual ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, or any form of electronically delivered advertisement. Ads may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. Ads could also be communicated through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, radio channels, television channels, print media, and other media. - In some implementations, the
advertisers 102 may provide (or be otherwise associated with) products and/or services related to ads. Theadvertisers 102 may include or be associated with, for example, retailers, wholesalers, warehouses, manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, educational establishments, financial establishments, technology providers, energy providers, utility providers, or any other product or service providers. - The
advertisers 102 may directly or indirectly generate, maintain and/or track ads, which may be related to products or services offered by or otherwise associated with the advertisers. Theadvertisers 102 may include or maintain one or moredata processing systems 112, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. Theadvertisers 102 could include or maintain one or more processes that run on one or more data processing systems. - The
publishers 104 may include entities that generate, maintain, provide, present and/or otherwise process content in theenvironment 100. In some implementations, thepublishers 104 may include content providers with an Internet presence, such as online publication and news providers (e.g., online newspapers, etc.), online service providers (e.g., financial service providers, health service provider, etc,), and the like. The term “content” refers to various types of web-based and/or other information, such as articles, discussion threads, reports, analyses, financial statements, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds (e.g., RSS feeds), television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, printed publications, etc. Thepublishers 104 may receive requests from the user access devices 108 (or other elements in the environment 100) and provide or present content to the requesting devices. The publishers may provide or present content via various mediums and in various forms, including web based and non-web based mediums and forms. Thepublishers 104 may generate and/or maintain such content and/or retrieve the content from other network resources. - In some implementations, the
publishers 104 could provide searching services and provide content in the form of search results. A search service can receive queries for search results and retrieve relevant search results from various sources, such as an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages). Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages. - In addition to content, the
publishers 104 may be configured to integrate or combine retrieved content with ads that are related or relevant to the retrieved content for display to users. These relevant ads may be provided from theAMS 106 and be combined with content for display to users. As described further below, the user access devices 108 could also process ads for display to users. In some examples, thepublishers 104 could retrieve an article for display on a particular user access device 108 and then forward the article to the user access device 108 along with code that causes one or more ads from theAMS 106 to be displayed to the user. In other examples, thepublishers 104 could retrieve an article, retrieve one or more relevant ads (e.g., from theAMS 106 or the advertisers 102), and then integrate the ads and the article to form a content page for display to the user. - The
publishers 104 may include or maintain one or moredata processing systems 114, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. They may include or maintain one or more processes that run on data processing systems. In some examples, thepublishers 104 may include one ormore content repositories 124 for storing content and other information. - The
AMS 106 may manage ads and provide various services to theadvertisers 104, thepublishers 106, and the user access devices 108. TheAMS 106 may include one or moredata processing systems 116, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. It could also include one or more processes, such as server processes. - In some implementations, the
AMS 106 may allow elements inenvironment 100 to store, select and/or retrieve ads for presentation to users. For example, theAMS 106 may facilitate the distribution of ads from theadvertisers 102 to the user access devices 108 via thepublishers 104. TheAMS 106 may also manage and process various agreements and transactions among and between elements inenvironment 100. For example, theAMS 106 may credit accounts associated with thepublishers 104 and debit accounts of theadvertisers 102. - The
AMS 106 may allow theadvertisers 102 to directly or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ads for presentation on user access devices 108. In some examples, the ads may be stored in anad repository 126. TheAMS 106 may allow theadvertisers 102 to select and/or specify new or existing ads as well as conversion types for ads. A “conversion” may occur when a user consummates a transaction related to a given ad. What constitutes a conversion may vary. For example, a conversion could be defined to occur when a user clicks on an ad, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. In another example, a conversion could be defined as the display of an ad to a user and a corresponding purchase on the advertiser's web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days). Each conversion type may correspond to a conversion action that a user may perform, such as a purchase of a product or service, a selection of a banner ad (click-through) or other action. TheAMS 106 may store conversion data and other information in aconversion data repository 136. - The
AMS 106 may also allow theadvertisers 102 to input description information associated with ads. This information could be used to assist thepublishers 104 in determining ads to publish. Theadvertisers 102 may additionally input a cost/value associated with selected conversion types, such as a five dollar credit to thepublishers 104 for each product or service purchased. - The
AMS 106 may provide ads to thepublishers 104 and/or the user access devices 108. In some examples, theAMS 106 may send ads to a requesting user device 108 when the user device loads content from aparticular publisher 104. The ads can be placed with or embedded in a publisher's content (e.g., videos, articles, etc.), which can be stored in thecontent repository 124 at the publisher, and/or placed with content received from other sources (e.g., other publishers, advertisers). - The
AMS 106 may provide ads to publishers and/or user access devices such that the ads are displayed in ad presentations. An ad presentation may refer to any type of communication or display of one or more ads. TheAMS 106 may present ads via various mediums and in various forms, including web based and non-web based mediums and forms. In some examples, ads may be presented in an “ad portion” of a user display. The term “ad portion” refers to any portion (which could include all) of a display in which ads can be situated. The ad portion can be a discrete, isolated portion of a display or it can be blended and dispersed throughout a display. - In some examples, the ad portion may include a portion of a web page or browser display, which also displays content. The ad portion may separate and distinct from other content in the display. For example, the ad portion could be a window or frame that is separate from displayed content. The ad portion could also be integrated and blended with displayed content. For example, the ad portion could include several sub portions dispersed throughout a web page and integrated with displayed content.
- The
AMS 106 may allow thepublishers 104 to search and select specific products and services as well as associated ads to be displayed with content provided by thepublishers 104. For example, thepublishers 104 could search through ads in thead repository 126 and select certain ads and block or filter out other ads. In some examples, theAMS 106 may contextually determine or recommend specific items and ads based on, for example, relevance to the publishers site content. TheAMS 106 could also determine specific items and ads based on user behaviors, such as particular search queries performed on a search engine website, a geographical location of the user, etc. TheAMS 106 could, in some examples, store user-related information (e.g., personal profiles of users, geographic locations of users, ad context information) in ageneral data repository 146. A combination of these and other approaches could also be used to provide ads to thepublishers 104. The ad selections and preferences specified by thepublishers 104 can be used by theAMS 106 when it selects ads for display to the user devices 108. - The
AMS 106 may include or access one or more network searching, crawling and indexing modules (not shown). These modules may crawl thenetwork 100 to search, identify, index and store content. TheAMS 106 or another element may associate content keywords or other information with crawled content using various algorithms and logic. The content keywords may summarize aspects of the content. TheAMS 106 may maintain or access an index or listing of identifiers (e.g., URLs) associated with crawled content. The identifiers may be associated with the keywords and/or other information. In some implementations, theAMS 106 may include or access a listing of URL-keyword pairings. - Using crawled and indexed network content, the
AMS 106 may be configured to identify advertisements in thead repository 126 relevant to a user's interest. TheAMS 106 may be configured to compare information associated with requested content (e.g., URLs) with indexed identifiers associated with crawled content. TheAMS 106 may use associated content keywords to identify and retrieve relevant ads. In some implementations, theAMS 106 could receive information (e.g., ad keywords) from theadvertisers 102 relevant to the advertisers' products and services, which could be used in identifying relevant ads. - As an example, the
AMS 106 can receive a URL of a requested content page (e.g., from the user access device 108 or the publisher 104). TheAMS 106 may use the URL to identify the user interest (i.e., the requested content). For example, theAMS 106 may match the URL to indexed content keywords associated with the URL. TheAMS 106 may then match the user interest with ads in therepository 126 relevant to the interest. TheAMS 106 may use ad keywords from theadvertisers 102 and/or other ad information to identify the ads. In some examples, theAMS 106 could compare ad keywords from theadvertisers 102 or other information to content keywords and/or content in the content page to identify relevant ads. - In some examples, the ad preferences and selections specified by the
publishers 104 and/oradvertisers 102 may be used in determining relevant ads. For example, theAMS 106 may reject certain ads based on publisher preferences, even though the rejected ads may be relevant to the determined user interest. - The
AMS 106 may be configured to perform one or more operations and/or processes to increase the likelihood of users finding relevant ads that lead to conversions. TheAMS 106 may therefore serve to increase ad relevancy and effectiveness, as well as revenues associated with ads. In some implementations, as discussed below in connection withFIGS. 2-6 , theAMS 106 may modify aspects of how ads are displayed to users and/or make determinations to present new or additional ads to users. TheAMS 106 could be configured to determine user attention with respect to ads displayed on the user access devices 108 and modify the presentation of ads based on the determined user attention. For example, theAMS 106 could determine user interest in a particular ad and then present one or more options to the user for viewing or navigating additional ads. In this fashion, theAMS 106 may serve to increase the likelihood of users finding relevant information and performing conversions. - The
AMS 106 may also be configured to determine and maintain information about ad impressions and report the information to other elements in theenvironment 100. The term ad “impression” refers to any form of presentation of an ad such that it is viewable to a user. In some examples, an ad impression may occur when an ad is displayed on a display device of a user access device. TheAMS 106 may be configured to determine and maintain the number of ad impressions relative to the number of potential ads useable for presentation. TheAMS 106 may also determine and maintain the ratio of the number of click-throughs to the number of impressions of the ad. The term “click-through” refers, for example, to a user selection of an ad. A “click-through” may also refer to other types of user selections. Further details of this “impressions” functionality are discussed below in connection withFIG. 7 . - In some implementations, the
AMS 106 may manage and process financial transactions among and between elements in theenvironment 100. For example, theAMS 106 may credit accounts associated with thepublishers 104 and debit accounts of theadvertisers 102. These and other transactions may be based on conversion data, impressions information and/or click-through rates received and maintained by theAMS 106. - The user access devices 108 may include any devices capable of receiving information from the
network 110 and displaying or otherwise presenting ads. In some implementations, the user access devices 108 may receive ads and ad related information from theAMS 106 and present the ads (e.g., via a browser or other viewer) to users. The user access devices 108 may combine ads received from theAMS 106 with content received from thepublishers 104 or other sources for presentation to users. Additionally or alternatively, the user access devices 108 may receive combined ads and content from thepublishers 104 and present (e.g., in a viewer) this information to viewing users. - The user access devices 108 could include general computing components and/or embedded systems optimized with specific components for performing specific tasks. Examples of user systems include personal computers (e.g., desktop computers), mobile computing devices, cell phones, smart phones, media players/recorders, music players, game consoles, media centers, media players, electronic tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs), television systems, audio systems, removable storage devices, navigation systems and the like. The user access devices 108 could also include various other elements, such as processes running on various machines.

network 110 may include any element or system that facilitates communications among and between various network nodes, such aselements network 110 may include one or more telecommunications networks, such as computer networks, telephone or other communications networks, the Internet, etc. Thenetwork 110 may include a shared, public, or private data network encompassing a wide area (e.g., WAN) or local area (e.g., LAN). In some implementations, thenetwork 110 may facilitate data exchange by way of packet switching using the Internet Protocol (IP). Thenetwork 110 may facilitate wired and/or wireless connectivity and communication. - For purposes of explanation only, certain aspects of this disclosure are described with reference to the discrete elements illustrated in
FIG. 1 . The number, identity and arrangement of elements in theenvironment 100 are not limited to what is shown. For example, theenvironment 100 could include any number of geographically-dispersedadvertisers 102,publishers 104 and/or user access devices 108, which may be discrete, integrated modules or distributed systems. Similarly, theenvironment 100 is not limited to asingle AMS 106 and may include any number of integrated or distributed AMS elements. - Furthermore, additional and/or different elements not shown may be contained in or coupled to the elements shown in
FIG. 1 , and/or certain illustrated elements may be absent. In some examples, the functions provided by the illustrated elements could be performed by less than the illustrated number of components or even by a single element. The illustrated elements could be implemented as individual processes run on separate machines or a single process running on a single machine. -
FIG. 2 illustrates anexemplary data flow 200 within theenvironment 100. Thedata flow 200 is exemplary only and not intended to be restrictive. Other data flows may therefore occur in theenvironment 100 and, even with thedata flow 200, the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. - In the
data flow 200, aparticular publisher 104 may receive acontent request 202 from a particular user access device 108. Thecontent request 202 may, for example, include a request for an article on a given topic (e.g., automobiles). In response to therequest 202, thepublisher 104 may retrieve relevant content (e.g., an automobile article) from thecontent repository 124 or some other source. - The
publisher 104 may then respond to thecontent request 202 by sending acontent page 204 or other content presentation to the requesting user device 108. Thecontent page 204 may include the requested content 206 (e.g., the automobile article) as well as a code “snippet” 203 associated with an ad presentation. A code “snippet” refers, for example, to a method used by one device (e.g., a server) to ask another device (e.g., a browser running on a client device) to perform actions after downloading information. In some examples, a code “snippet” may be implemented in JavaScript® code or may be part of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or other web page markup language or content. - In some implementations, the
AMS 106 may provide thecode snippet 203 to thepublisher 104 and/or the user access device 108. The code snippet could originate and/or be provided from other sources. As the requesting user device 108 loads thecontent page 204, thecode snippet 203 causes the user device 108 to contact theAMS 106 and receive additional code (e.g., Java Script® or the like), which causes thecontent page 204 to load with anad portion 208. - The
ad portion 208 may include any element that allows information to be embedded within thecontent page 204. In some examples, thead portion 208 may be implemented as an HTML element, such an I-Frame (inline frame) or other type of frame. In some examples, thead portion 208 may be hosted by theAMS 106 or thepublisher 104 and may allow content (e.g., ads) from theAMS 106 or thepublisher 104 to be embedded inside thecontent page 204. Parameters associated with the ad portion 208 (e.g., its size and shape) can be specified in the content page 204 (e.g., in HTML), so that the user access device 108 can present thecontent page 204 while thead portion 208 is being loaded. Other implementations ofad portion 208 may also be used. - At this stage in the
data flow 200, thead portion 208 in thecontent page 204 may send theAMS 106 formatting andcontent information 210. Thisinformation 210 may include information describing the manner (e.g., how, when, and/or where) in which ads can be rendered by the user access devices 108. Theinformation 210 could include ad attributes and parameters, such as size, shape, color, font, presentation style (e.g., audio, video, graphical, textual, etc.), etc. Theinformation 210 may also specify a quantity of ads desired. - The formatting and
content information 210 could also include information associated with thecontent 206 being displayed incontent page 204. Such information may include a URL (Universal Resource Locator) associated with the requestedcontent page 204. In some implementations, theinformation 210 could include the requested content itself (e.g., web page, content document, etc.), a category corresponding to the requested content or the content request (e.g., automobiles, arts, business, computers, movies, music, etc.), part or all of thecontent request 202, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, and the like. - In response to the
information 210, theAMS 106 may provide the user access device 108 withad information 212. Thead information 212 may include one ormore ads 225 for placement in thead portion 208 of thecontent page 204. Thead information 212 sent from theAMS 106 may also include a signed or encoded specification of an ad. - The
ad information 212 may include ads that are relevant to the user's interest, as determined by the requested content. TheAMS 106 may retrieve and provide relevant ads based on theinformation 210 received from the user access device 108. TheAMS 106 may retrieve thead information 212 from thead repository 126, which may include ads associated with one ormore advertisers 102. TheAMS 106 may retrieve relevant ads using information from a crawling module, various statistical associations between ads and content, and/or preference information associated with the publishers. - After receiving the
ad information 212, thead portion 208 displayed by the user access device 108 may populate with ads included in theinformation 212. For example, thead portion 208 may populate withads 225. As illustrated inFIG. 2 , thead portion 208 and the displayedads 225 may occupy a portion of thecontent page 204, which may be distinct from other content (e.g., the content 206) presented in thecontent page 204. - When a user clicks on the displayed
ad 225 in thecontent page 204, an embedded code snippet may direct the user access device 108 to contact theAMS 106. During this event, the user access device 108 may receive an information parcel, such as a signed browser cookie, from theAMS 106. This information parcel can include information, such as an identifier of the selectedad 225, an identifier of thepublisher 104, and the date/time thead 225 was selected by the user. This information parcel may facilitate processing of conversion activities or other user transactions. - The user access device 108 may then be redirected to the
advertiser 102 associated with the selectedad 225. The user access device 108 may send arequest 214 to the associatedadvertiser 102 and then load alanding page 216 from theadvertiser 102. The user may then perform a conversion action at thelanding page 216, such as purchasing a product or service, registering, joining a mailing list, etc. Anadvertiser code snippet 218, which may be provided by theAMS 106, may be included within a conversion confirmation page script, such as a script within a web page presented after the purchase. The user access device 108 may execute theadvertiser code snippet 218. Theadvertiser code snippet 218 may contact theAMS 106 andreport conversion data 220 to theAMS 106. Theconversion data 220 may include conversion types and numbers as well as information from cookies. In some implementations, theconversion data 220 may be maintained in theconversion data repository 136. - During
data flow 200, theAMS 106 may perform one or more actions to increase the likelihood of users finding relevant ads and performing conversion actions. In some examples, theAMS 106 may modify or retarget the presentation of ads by modifying aspects of thead portion 208. TheAMS 106 may also determine user attention related to theads 225 displayed on thecontent page 204 and modify thead portion 208 based on the determined attention. - For example, if the user is not satisfied with the information on the
advertiser landing page 216, the user may return to thecontent page 204 without performing a conversion activity. TheAMS 106 may evaluate this “click-back” activity and then make a decision whether to show the user an option to view additional ads related to thead 225. This decision may be based on an amount of time the user spent on thelanding page 216 before returning to thecontent page 204. -
FIG. 3 illustrates exemplary modifications to thead portion 208, which may occur duringdata flow 200 in order to retarget the presentation of ads. As illustrated inFIG. 3 , thead portion 208 may include one or moreads including ad 225. In this example,ad 225 could be an automobile related ad.Ad portion 208 may also include one or more user-interface elements, such as scrollingelements 310, that allow the user to navigate additional ads. - The scrolling
elements 310 may allow the user to scroll from one set of ads to another set of ads. Depending on the layout of thecontent page 204 and thead portion 208, the scrollingelements 310 may facilitate vertical and/or horizontal scrolling. In some examples, the scrollingelements 310 may include any type of scrolling controls, such as selectable arrows (or other) icons and/or custom scroll bar controls. Other types of user-interface elements could also be used, in addition to or instead of scrolling type elements. For example, various menus (e.g., pull-down menus, pop-up menus, etc.), buttons, radio buttons, sliders, lists, frames, windows, selection boxes, listboxes, text, graphics, etc. may be used. The user-interface elements could be static and/or dynamic (e.g., animated). The user-interface elements could include visual elements, aural elements, and even kinesthetic or physical elements. - The additional ads through which the user may scroll or otherwise navigate may be added to the
content page 204 by theAMS 106. The additional ads may be related to the ad originally selected by the user (e.g., the ad 225) or the landing page (e.g., 216) associated with that ad. The additional ads may include ads that were previously retrieved by theAMS 106 in response to a request and/or may include ads subsequently retrieved by theAMS 106. - As illustrated in
FIG. 3 , thead portion 208 could also include one or moretopical ad links 315, such as an “Automobile Tires” link. Thetopical ad links 315 may include words, phrases or other representations that summarize all or a portion of the displayedcontent 206 of thecontent page 204 or topical variations related to the displayedcontent 206. For example, if thecontent 206 relates to automobiles, the ad links 315 could summarize related topical variations, such as automobile rentals, repair, and tires. - The
topical ad links 315 may be operable to allow users to navigate to or through additional ads. For example, thelinks 315 may be associated with navigation links (e.g., hyperlinks) that direct users to one or more dedicated ad landing pages. These dedicated ad landing pages may be maintained by theAMS 106 and include additional ads related to the topics represented by the selected links. For example, when a user selects the “Automobile Tires”link 315, the user may be directed to a dedicatedad landing page 325, maintained by theAMS 106, that includesadditional ads 335 related to the topic represented by the selected link—in this example, tires. - In addition to the
topical ad links 315, thead portion 208 may be modified to include adirect ad link 317, which could be labeled as “Show More Ads.” Thedirect ad link 317 may direct users to a dedicated landing page, maintained by theAMS 106, that includes additional ads related to the selectedad 225. For example, when a user selects the “Show More Ads”link 317, the user may be redirected to adedicated landing page 327, which lists additional ads related to thead 225, e.g., automobiles. - In some examples, the
AMS 106 may be configured to cycle ads in response to user selections of thetopical ad links 315. For example, when the user selects the “Automobile Tires”link 315, theAMS 106 could replace the existing ads in thead portion 208 with new ads (not shown) related to the selectedlink 315. In some implementations, theAMS 106 may perform the cycling so that a user is presented with the new ads when the user returns to thecontent page 204 after viewing one or more landing pages (e.g., the dedicated ad landing page 325). - Consistent with some implementations, the
AMS 106 may modify aspects of the ad portion 208 (e.g., to include theelements 310 or the links 315) based on user attention to ads. TheAMS 106 may determine user attention related to theads 225 displayed on thecontent page 204. For example, theAMS 106 may determine the amount of time the user spends on an advertiser landing page. TheAMS 106 may also determine whether or not a conversion action is performed at the landing page and whether or not the user returns to thecontent page 204. TheAMS 106 may modify aspects of thead portion 208 based on this determined user attention. - Referring back to the
data flow 200 ofFIG. 2 , theAMS 106 may determine user attention to ads by sending the user access device 108 code 222 (e.g., JavaScript®), which could automatically determine and maintain various user device and/or other information and be used to determine the amount of time spent on thelanding page 216. Other techniques could also be used. For example, the user access device 108 and theAMS 106 could exchange requests and responses (not shown) related to various user activity. A combination of approaches may also be used. - Based on the determined user attention, the
AMS 106 may modify or retarget the presentation of ads, which may include modifying aspects of thecontent page 204 including aspects of thead portion 208. In some examples, theAMS 106 may send the user access device 108modification information 224, which modifies aspects of thead portion 208. - The
modification information 224 may populate thead portion 208 with additional and different ads related to the selectedad 225 and/or related to thecontent 206 on thecontent page 204. Themodification information 224 may also include one more links (e.g., the links 315) to dedicated advertising landing pages maintained by theAMS 106. Themodification information 224 could also include information for modifying an interface of thead portion 208. For example, themodification information 224 could modify thead portion 208 to include additional and/or different user interface elements, such aselements 310. -
FIGS. 2 and 3 are exemplary only and not intended to be restrictive. Other data flows may therefore occur in theenvironment 100 and, even with thedata flow 200, the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. Further, the illustrated events may overlap and/or may exist in fewer steps. Moreover, certain events may not be present and additional and/or different events may be included. For example, in alternative data flows, thepublisher 104 could send an ad request to theAMS 106 prior to sending a content page (e.g., the content page 204) to the user access device 108. TheAMS 106 may respond by sending relevant ads (e.g., the ad 225) to thepublisher 104. Thepublisher 104 may combine the received ads with requested content in thecontent page 204 and then send thecontent page 204, including thead portion 208, to the user access device 108 for display to a user. Other modifications to thedata flow 200 are also possible. -
FIG. 4 is flow diagram depicting anexemplary advertising process 400 for modifying or retargeting an ad presentation. In some implementations, theprocess 400 may be performed by theAMS 106. Theprocess 400 could be performed by other systems, such as thepublisher 104, in conjunction with or instead of theAMS 106. Theprocess 400 may include generating an ad presentation (410), determining user interest (420), determining user satisfaction (430), and modifying the ad presentation (440) based on the determined user interest and/or the determined satisfaction. - The
process 400 may begin when an ad presentation is generated (410). The term “ad presentation” may refer to, for example, to any type of rendering of ads to a user. Generating an ad presentation could also occur when ads are audibly displayed, visually displayed, or even kinesthetically or physically displayed. In some examples, generating an ad presentation (410) may occur when thepublisher 104 provides to the user access device 108 thecontent page 204, which includes thead portion 208 containing various ads, such asads 225. Thecontent page 204 may be related to content retrieved by thepublisher 104 in response to a request from a particular user access device 108. - Generating an ad presentation (410) may involve retrieving ads to populate the ad presentation. This could involve, for example, the
AMS 106 retrieving ads from thead repository 126 in response to requested content. It could also involve thepublishers 104 retrieving ads from theAMS 106 or other source and/or thepublishers 104 retrieving locally stored ads previously received from theAMS 106 or other source. - The
process 400 may then determine user interest (420). Determining user interest may involve evaluating user interaction with the ad presentation, for example,content page 204 and thead portion 208. In some examples, determining user interaction may include determining that the user has selected (e.g., clicked) on a displayed ad (e.g., the ad 225). Determining user interest may also involve evaluating other user selections as well as a number of selections made by a user. In some examples, determining user interest may involve generating and providing code to the user access devices 108 (or some other network element). - In some implementations, determining user interest (420) could include determining that a user has interacted with a displayed ad without visiting a landing page. That is, the determining (420) could determine some user interaction with an aspect of the displayed
ad 225 that does not result in the user being redirected to thelanding page 216. For example, the determining could detect cursor movement in or near thead portion 208 and/or movement over or near the displayedad 225. - Determining user interest (420) could also involve analyzing historical information. For example, the determining could involve determining user preferences (e.g., pages visited, ads selected, etc.) and determining user interest in a particular product, service, and/or ad based on past preferences.
- The
process 400 may also determine user satisfaction (430). In some examples, determining user satisfaction may involve determining that the user was not presented with ads relevant to the user's interest. Determining user satisfaction may include determining that the user selects an ad (e.g., the ad 225) from the ad presentation (e.g., the ad portion 208) and investigates the advertiser (e.g., visits the advertiser landing page 216) but then returns to the ad presentation without performing a conversion action. Determining user satisfaction could include various other actions, such as analyzing historical information, user preferences and/or analyzing website data. Determining user satisfaction could also include obtaining satisfaction information directly from a user, for example, by presenting an inquiry to the user. - For clarity of explanation,
FIG. 4 depicts determining user interest (420) and determining user satisfaction (430) as separate elements. All or portions of the functionality associated with these elements, however, could overlap. Moreover, these elements could be represent aspects of more general functionality for determining user attention to ads. That is,process 400 could involve determining user attention to ads, which may include functionality associated with determining user interest (420) and/or determining user satisfaction (430). - The
process 400 may modify the ad presentation (440) based on at least one of the determined user interest and the determined user satisfaction. Modifying the ad presentation may involve performing any activity that could increase the likelihood of the user finding an ad that results in a conversion action. In some implementations, modifying the ad presentation (440) may involve modifying the content page (e.g., the content page 204) containing the originally selected ad (e.g., the ad 225) using various techniques. - One modification technique involves modifying the ad presentation to include a set of user-interface elements that allow the user to navigate from one set of ads to another set of ads. For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 3 , thecontent page 204 could include one or more scrolling elements (e.g., the elements 310) that allow the user to scroll through additional ads. Other types of user-interface elements could also be used, such as static or dynamic menus, buttons, sliders, lists, boxes, and the like. The user-interface elements could include visual elements, aural elements, and even kinesthetic or physical elements. - Another modification technique involves presenting to the user one or more links (e.g., the
links 315 and 317) or other options for viewing additional ads related to a previously selected ad or related to requested content. These additional ads may be displayed at one or more dedicated ad locations (such dedicatedad landing pages 325 and 327), which could be maintained, for example, by theAMS 106. Other modification techniques may involve cycling through ads. This may involve cycling out old ads and replacing them with new ads, which may be related to various user selections (e.g., an ad selection). -
FIG. 5 illustrates anotherexemplary advertising method 500 for modifying or retargeting an ad presentation. As with theprocess 400, theprocess 500 may be performed by theAMS 106. Theprocess 500 could be performed by other systems, such as thepublisher 104, in conjunction with or instead of theAMS 106. - The
process 500 may determine a user selection in an ad presentation (510). This may involve, for example, determining a user selection of thead 225 from thead portion 208 of thecontent page 204. Theprocess 500 may then initiate a timer (520). This could be implemented, in some examples, using a software-based timer. For example, the determining may include providing code (e.g., JavaScript® or the like) to the user access devices 108 or other network element. Other implementation techniques could also be used. - The
process 500 may determine whether the user returns to the ad presentation after selecting the ad (530). For example, this decision may involve determining whether a user returns to thecontent page 204 after viewing theadvertiser landing page 216 associated with the selectedad 225. If the user does not return to the ad presentation (530), then theprocess 500 may continue to determine additional user selections (510) or, alternatively, it may terminate. - If the user returns to the ad presentation (530), then the
process 500 may analyze the elapsed time (540). For example, theprocess 500 may analyze the amount of time the user spent at the advertiser landing page before returning to the content page that directed the user to the landing page. Analyzing the elapsed time may involve comparing the elapsed time to various thresholds. - In some implementations, the analyzing (540) may involve making assumptions about user interest based on the elapsed time and deciding whether or not to perform a modification based on the elapsed time. For example, if a user selects an ad and then browses an advertiser landing page for three seconds before returning to the content page, the
process 500 may assume that there was little or no interest in the landing page or the associated advertiser. - If the user selects an ad and then spends a more significant amount of time on the landing page 216 (e.g., 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds, etc.) before returning to the content page, then the
process 500 may assume that there was some interest in the landing page and/or the associated advertiser. Different time thresholds may trigger different interest assumptions. For example, 15 seconds may indicate a low interest and 30 seconds may indicate a medium interest. - Using the assumptions about interest, the
process 500 may decide whether or not to perform a modification to the ad presentation. For example, if the user spends two seconds on an advertiser landing page, theprocess 500 may assume that the user is not interested in viewing additional ads related to the selected ad. Using this assumption, theprocess 500 may decide not to modify the ad presentation. In another example, the user may spend 30 seconds on the advertiser landing page. In this case, theprocess 500 may decide that a modification to the ad presentation would be appropriate. - The
process 500 may also determine a degree or level of modification to perform. For example, if the user interest is assumed to be low, a first level of modification could be determined. If the user interests is determined to be medium or high, a second level of modification may be applied. - Using results of the analysis (540), the
process 500 may modify the ad presentation (550). The may involve modifying thead portion 208 of thecontent page 204 to include a set of user-interface elements (e.g., the elements 310) that allow the user to scroll through additional ads. Modifying the ad presentation (550) may also involve presenting to the user one or more selectable links (e.g., thelinks 315 and 317) for viewing additional ads related a previously selected ad, related to advertisers and advertiser landing pages, and/or related to requested content on a content page. These additional ads may be displayed at one or more dedicated ad landing pages (such as thepages 325 and 327), which could be maintained, for example, by theAMS 106. Modifying the ad presentation (550) may also involve cycling through ads. This may involve cycling out ads from the ad portion of a content page and inserting new ads related to the user selections. - In the
process 500, the modifying (550) may include selecting and performing different modifications based on the determined user interest. For example, user-interface elements may be added in response to a low user interest and topical links may be added in response to a high interest. In other examples, a single topical link could be added in response to a low user interest and multiple topical links could be added in response to a high user interest. Of course, other variations and techniques are also possible. -
FIG. 6 illustrates anotherexemplary advertising process 600 for modifying an ad presentation. In some examples, theprocess 600 may be used to modify ad presentations when the amount of time a user spends at an advertiser landing page before returning to a content page cannot be analyzed. Theprocess 600 may be performed by theAMS 106. Theprocess 600 could be performed by other systems, such as thepublisher 104, in conjunction with or instead of theAMS 106. - The
process 600 may determine a user selection in an ad presentation (610). This may involve, for example, determining a user selection of thead 225 from thead portion 208 of thecontent page 204. Theprocess 600 may modify the ad presentation prior to the user leaving the ad presentation (620). For example, theprocess 600 may modify aspects of thead portion 208 of thecontent page 204 prior to the user being redirected from thecontent page 204 to an advertising landing page (e.g., the landing page 216). - Modifying the ad presentation (620) may involve performing one or more modifications similar to those described above in connection with
elements FIGS. 4 and 5 . Modifying the ad presentation (620) may involve, for example, modifying the content page to include a set of user-interface elements (e.g., the elements 310) that allow the user to scroll through additional ads. Modifying the ad presentation (620) may also involve presenting to the user one or more selectable links (e.g., thelinks 315 and 317) for viewing additional ads related a previously selected ad, related to advertisers and advertiser landing pages, and/or related to requested content on a content page. Modifying the ad presentation (620) may involve cycling out ads from the ad portion of a content page and inserting new ads related to the user selections. - The
process 600 may then present the modified ad presentation (630) to the user. This may involve detecting that the user returns to thecontent page 204 from the advertiser landing page (e.g., the landing page 216) and presenting various modifications toad portion 208 of thecontent page 204. -
FIG. 7 illustrates anexemplary process 700 for processing ad impressions. Theprocess 700 may be performed by theAMS 106. Theprocess 700 could also be performed by other systems. - The
process 700 may begin when an ad presentation is generated (710). This may involve presenting thead portion 208 in thecontent page 204 to a user. Thead portion 208 may include a displayed ad, such as thead 225. Theprocess 700 may then retrieve or fetch additional ads (720) for display to the user. This may occur, for example, in response to determined user interest and/or determined user satisfaction (e.g., stages 420 and 430) and/or in response to a user selection of an ad from the ad presentation (e.g., stage 610). Retrieving additional ads (720) may involve theAMS 106 retrieving or fetching additional ads from thead repository 126. Retrieving additional ads (720) could also involve thepublishers 104 retrieving additional ads from theAMS 106 or other source and/or thepublishers 104 retrieving locally stored ads previously received from theAMS 106 or other source. - The
process 700 may modify the ad presentation to include the retrieved additional ads (730). Modifying the ad presentation (730) may involve, among other things, modifying the ad presentation to allow a user to navigate through the retrieved additional ads. The modifying may involve performing modifications similar to those described above in connection withelement 550 of theprocess 500. For example, the modifying (730) could include modifying the ad presentation to include a set of user-interface elements (e.g., the elements 310) that allow the user to scroll through the additional ads. - The
process 700 may then detect ad impressions (740). This may involve detecting presentations of the retrieved additional ads. For example, if two additional ads are retrieved and presented in a modified ad presentation, the detecting (740) may detect an ad impression for each additional ad. Detecting impressions (740) may also involve detecting the lack of ad impressions (i.e., potential impressions). That is, the detecting could detect that an ad has not been presented. - In some implementations, detecting impressions (740) could involve detecting “delayed” impressions of retrieved ads. That is, the detecting could involve detecting impressions of ads that are available for presentation but not initially presented. As an example, the retrieving (720) could yield five additional ads (e.g., Ad-1, Ad-2, Ad-3, Ad-4, and Ad-5). The ad presentation (e.g., ad portion 208) could be modified so that some of those additional ads (e.g., Ad-1, Ad-2) are initially presented while the remaining additional ads (e.g., Ad-3, Ad-4, Ad-5) are viewable when the user navigates through the presentation using a scroll or other user-interface control (e.g., the elements 310). In this example, detecting ad impressions (740) may involve detecting if and when any of those remaining additional ads not initially presented (e.g., Ad-3, Ad-4, Ad-5) are presented. For example, the detecting may involve detecting when a user activates a scroll or other user-interface control to cause the remaining ads (e.g., Ad-3, Ad-4, Ad-5) to be displayed. If any of the remaining ads (e.g., Ad-3, Ad-4, Ad-5) are not presented to the user, the detecting (740) may detect this information as well. In this fashion, the
process 700 may serve to track delayed impressions of retrieved ads. - In some examples, detecting ad impressions (740) may involve determining and maintaining the ratio of ad impressions to potential impressions. It may also involve determining and maintaining the ratio of the number of click-throughs associated with a particular ad to the number of impressions of that ad. Detecting ad impressions could also involve determining and maintaining various other ratios, metrics, parameters, performance indicators and the like.
- The
process 700 may then report the detected ad impressions (750), which may include reporting information associated with detected impressions. This could involve reporting that an ad was presented to and/or selected by a user. The reporting (750) could also involve reporting that an ad was retrieved but not presented and/or selected. The reporting (750) could involve thepublishers 104 reporting impressions information to theAMS 106 and/or theAMS 106 reporting impressions information to thepublishers 104, theadvertisers 104 and/or another entity. In some implementations, the reporting (750) could involve routing information with a given system. For example, the reporting could involve theAMS 106 routing impressions information from one AMS component or related system to another AMS component or related system. The reported ad impressions information may be used to facilitate various performance analyses and/or financial transactions. In some examples, the impressions information could be used in crediting accounts associated with thepublishers 104 and debiting accounts of theadvertisers 102. -
