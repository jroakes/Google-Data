Fig. 3 A illustrates the example of the process 300A of the automatic Synthesis process for digital picture.
In step 305, from the set of digital picture, select in two or more repetition digital pictures every.
As a part for this selection, the digital picture in set compares to identify repetition in every way.In one embodiment, can the metadata of comparative figures image.The metadata of digital picture such as can comprise date and time information (such as, timestamp), camera arrange (such as, camera manufacturer and model, orientation, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, metering model, ISO speed), and geographic position, file size, file creation date and image resolution ratio information.In this embodiment, once have identified the digital picture of repetition based on its corresponding metadata, each image repeated in set just can be selected.
The strong instruction that can repeat completely each other as them is mated completely between the metadata be associated with two digital pictures.But, when based on complete match selection image in metadata, even if fine difference or the change to a digital picture also can cause digital picture to be considered to unique.Such as, when using high speed camera to catch some frames p.s., although user cannot visually be distinguished them, every photos can be considered to unique (such as, based on the difference of filename, timestamp).Therefore, according to some aspect of the present disclosure, in metadata, but the Incomplete matching image but with substantially the same metadata still can be considered to the image of repetition each other.In some respects, 98%, 95%, 93%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, 70%, 65% or 60% image mated is had at least can be considered to the image of repetition in metadata each other.
In step 310, for each the computed image quality score in selected digital picture.When the picture quality score value of digital picture selected by calculating, consider its uniqueness about the digital picture selected by other.With regard in selected digital picture by with regard to anyone degree described, the various aspects of this people can both be considered.
The uniqueness of selected digital picture can be determined based on the picture material of the picture material of selected digital picture about the digital picture selected by other.Exemplarily, when the digital picture selected by first and the second digital picture describe people, the set of the people described in the digital picture selected by first can compare with the set of people described in the digital picture selected by second.
In some cases, user may have the multiple digital pictures from different visual angles of same subject.This theme can be terrestrial reference, object, people etc.As the example of terrestrial reference, user may have the multiple digital pictures from each visual angle of Mount Rushmore.As another example of terrestrial reference, user may have multiple digital pictures of Eiffel Tower.
When multiple visual angle of relatively theme (such as, terrestrial reference, object, people), the outward appearance of theme can compare with the known digital image of this theme.Such as, the digital picture from each visual angle of Mount Rushmore or Eiffel Tower can easily obtain.
Geographic position data can also be used when the visual angle of relatively theme.Such as, when the digital picture selected by two has high similarity based on its corresponding contents, geographic position data can be used to improve further or reduce this digital picture selected by two in the shooting of roughly the same position and may be the possibility of same subject.
Comprise (such as about selected digital picture, in the metadata) from the degree of the azimuth information of the equipment of such as compass or gyroscope and so on, the digital picture selected by such azimuth information also can be used to improve further or reduce is the possibility at two visual angles of same subject.
Based on geographic position and/or azimuth information, selected digital picture more strictly can be analyzed for its uniqueness level.Such as, the digital picture comprising the Eiffel Tower of the geographical location information of the position of instruction France more strictly can compare with same another image of the Eiffel Tower of the position of France that indicates.On the contrary, the digital picture comprising the Eiffel Tower of the geographic position data of the position of instruction France can make a distinction with the visually same or analogous digital picture of Eiffel Tower duplicate of the geographic position data comprising the position (such as, amusement park, gambling house) indicating the U.S..
When theme is people, the digital picture from each visual angle can compare based on to the appearance of people and/or the analysis of background.Such as, such as the attribute of the people of height, the colour of skin, hair color, hair lengths, body contour, clothing, tooth, eye shape, eye color etc. can compare.Visual angle in selected digital picture can compare with the visual angle of extrapolating based on algorithm.
Any descriptor that another example for the method compared the visual angle of people comprises to be provided based on user builds the three-dimensional rendering of people.Such as, if the descriptor of such as " JohnSmith " is associated with multiple digital picture by user, then can use this digital picture to build the three-dimensional rendering of " JohnSmith ", and the visual angle of optional network specific digit image and this three-dimensional rendering are compared.This plays up the time that can also comprise as component.That is, playing up of " JohnSmith " in a date range may be different from playing up of " JohnSmith " in another date range.
When selected digital picture describes multiple people, everyone in this digital picture can both compare with the people in other digital picture.Such comparison can be useful when determining the uniqueness level of unique number image, particularly with background and combining comparing of other metadata.Such as, when the digital picture of the guests when multiple user catches party, each digital picture can compare mutually to identify unique digital picture.In one embodiment, such comparison can make the unique number image comprising more people be identified.
Picture quality score value can also based on the relation of the people described in user (such as, the owner of digital picture) and unique number image.The relation of the people described in user and unique number image can be determined based on various information.Such as, the people described in photo can compare with the people that describes in the social networks of user.As another example, the title be associated with digital picture or descriptor can be used as the instruction of the relation between the people that describes in user and this digital picture.
In the unique number image describing people, the quality score of this unique number image can based on the orientation of face about the camera of this unique number image of seizure.Such as, describe not see that the digital picture to the people of camera may have lower quality score compared with describing to see in digital picture the photo of the people of its eyes.It is also conceivable to the orientation of the eyes of people.Such as, describe such as may have lower quality score in the absent-minded at that time and digital picture just looking at the people of elsewhere towards camera compared with the digital picture describing simultaneously also to see to the people of camera towards camera.
It is also conceivable to people whether to blink when catching digital picture.Such as, the digital picture describing the people that its eyes are opened with describe may have higher quality score compared with its eye portion or the digital picture of people closed completely.
It is also conceivable to people whether to smile when shooting digital pictures.Such as, the digital picture describing the people smiled may have higher picture quality score value compared with describing the digital picture of the people do not smiled.
State nictation of digital picture can associate with aptitude manner with smile state.Such as, people may close one's eyes owing to laughing at.Under these circumstances, the smile profile of people, the inclination of its head can also be considered in conjunction with whether people smiles (such as, laughing).
In step 315, based on its corresponding calculated picture quality score value, rank can be associated with each selected digital picture.Such as, image can carry out rank according to numeric scale (such as, 0 to 5,1 to 10,1 to 100), progression scale (such as, from " best " to " the poorest ", " 5 star " are to " 1 star "), percentage scale etc.This rank also can be binary, such as 0 and 1, " good " and " poor ", " thumb is upwards " and " thumb is downward ".
In one embodiment, the scope of picture quality score value can correspond to particular rank.In another embodiment, rank can based on the adjustment of picture quality score value or manipulation.Such as, picture quality score value can being normalized, manipulating as meeting Gaussian function, percent etc.
In some embodiments, the digital picture through rank can be provided to be further processed based on its corresponding picture quality score value and/or rank.Such as, based on its picture quality score value and/or rank, the digital picture of some or all can be provided to be shared by user.User can share digital picture by various means.Such as, provided digital picture can be uploaded to social networks, image trusteeship service (such as, website, backup services), position (such as, file) etc. by user.
As another example, the digital picture provided can be used as other digital picture provided, the digital picture selected in step 305 or therefrom select the representative without the digital image set repeating digital picture in step 305.The example of representative number image can be front cover photo, (such as file) thumbnail or icon etc. of (such as, on website) digital picture photograph album.
Based on picture quality score value and/or rank, the digital picture that cannot repair can also be identified." cannot repair " as the term is used herein and cover it usually and the implication of routine, include but not limited to be considered to quality too low thus regulate the digital picture that may its quality can not be made obviously to improve.
Except a variety of causes described above, digital picture may have low picture quality score value due to many reasons.Such as, fuzzy (such as, motion blur, camera shake, out of focus), incorrect exposure (such as, over-exposed, under-exposed), the digital picture that has noise, granular sensation or have an incorrect white balance may have low picture quality score value.Other reason that picture quality score value is low can comprise does not have identifiable theme.Digital picture such as unexpectedly may be stayed on camera lens at lens cap, or object (such as, point) blocks whole frame or certain part wherein and do not have identifiable theme.
The digital picture selected in step 305 can be cancelled selection based on having low picture quality score value.When digital picture is cancelled selection, the explanation that this cancellation can be provided to select is to show.This explanation can comprise the text describing reason (such as, fuzzy, repetition).This explanation can show on the display screen of client computing device 110 or other output device 204.
User can cancel and select the cancellation of digital picture.Such as, in one embodiment, can provide and cancel option to show together with this explanation.When providing this explanation, user can use mouse or other input equipment 202 to select the option selected for cancelling this cancellation.When receiving user to when cancelling the instruction of selection of option (such as, by client computing device 110 or server 170), this digital picture can be reselected.
The cancellation can cancelling the digital picture being cancelled selection as user is selected, and user can cancel other step in process 300A.Such as, about step 305, user may make the digital picture of repetition (it is not selected in step 305) be selected for all the other steps of process 300A.Similarly, about step 310, the picture quality score value of digital picture that user can change (such as, by manual input).Further, about step 315, regardless of picture quality score value, user can change the rank be associated with digital picture.
Fig. 3 B illustrates another example of the process 300B of the automatic Synthesis process for digital picture.
Step 320 is owing to being similar to step 310 for one or more digital picture computed image quality score.In step 320, the importance (such as, weight) of metadata may with step 310 in identical or different.
In some embodiments of step 320, the metadata of digital picture can be considered more.Such as, when the metadata rotating mirror skull of digital picture does not take off when catching digital picture, the content of this digital picture can be thoroughly not analyzed, or can analyze not together.More emphasize that an effect of metadata may be to reduce the processing time of the time of such as execution involved by step 320 and so on.
In other embodiment of step S320, the metadata of digital picture can less be considered.Such as, when the metadata instruction of digital picture exists red-eye effect, picture material can be analyzed more up hill and dale to determine whether such red-eye effect exists really.
Step 325 is similar to step 315 owing to rank can be associated with digital picture based on picture quality score value.
In step 330, one or more digital picture can be provided to share based on its corresponding rank.This rank is based on the picture quality score value calculated in step 320.
In some embodiments, this rank can be those ranks that user provides (such as, covering).Or the picture quality score value that this rank can provide based on user (such as, covering).
Fig. 3 C illustrates another example of the process 300C of the automatic Synthesis process for digital picture.
Step 335 is owing to being similar to step 310 for digital picture computed image quality score.This picture quality score value is referred to as the first picture quality score value here.
In step 340, the one or more hypothesis based on digital picture regulate and calculate other picture quality score value for this digital picture.Exemplarily, when digital picture has incorrect white balance, the second picture quality score value can be calculated based on the white balance adjusting of this digital picture.As another example, such as when dimness, the second picture quality score value can be calculated based on the adjustment of the exposure of this digital picture or illumination level because illumination is not good or under-exposed in digital picture.
Computed image quality score can be carried out for each hypothesis adjustment or their various combinations.Such as, when the first hypothesis regulates (such as, white balance) and the second hypothesis regulates (such as, exposure correction) can improve the quality score of digital picture, nearly four picture quality score values can be calculated.In this example, these four picture quality score values can correspond to (1) first hypothesis and regulate, (2) second hypothesis regulate, and (3) first hypothesis regulate heel second to suppose to regulate, and (4) second hypothesis regulate heel first to suppose to regulate.
It should be noted that and can carry out this hypothesis adjustment for the copy of digital picture.That is, although carried out supposing to regulate, digital picture also can remain unchanged or be retained.
The calculating of the second picture quality score value the picture quality score value of digital picture and/or rank low time may be useful.Exemplarily, when digital picture has low picture quality score value, at user option option can be provided to suppose to regulate with (multiple) implementing to make picture quality score value improve.
In one embodiment, the second picture quality score value that the copy of digital picture can regulate based on hypothesis accordingly together with it provides.Then user can use mouse or other input equipment 202 to regulate to select one or more hypothesis.
In step 345, in response to the instruction that received user selects, (multiple) can be implemented and regulate.In some embodiments, (multiple) should suppose that adjustment can be implemented original digital image.In other embodiments, (multiple) should suppose to regulate and can implement the copy of original digital image.
Step 350 is similar to step 315 owing to rank can be associated with digital picture based on its picture quality score value.In step 350, this rank is based in step 340 for the second picture quality score value that this digital picture calculates.
Fig. 4 illustrates can how by the set of the step application of process 300A-C in digital picture.
In the example of fig. 4, the set of digital picture comprises 10 digital picture 410-428.Digital picture 410-428 has used different cameral to catch, and may be positioned at multiple position (such as, on server 170 and client computing device 110).For the object of this example, digital picture 410-428 is considered to a part for identical digital image set.
In step 450, as the above digital picture about selecting described by step 305 without repeating.In this example, digital picture 416 and 426 is the copy of digital picture 410 completely, and they are created when digital picture 410 repeats to import in digital image set 410-428.As the result of step 450, digital picture 416 and 426 is not selected.
