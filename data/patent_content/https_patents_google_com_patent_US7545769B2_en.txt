Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly to mobile handoff functionality using an asynchronous channel in a communication system, such as a code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular telephone system.
- a communication system such as a code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular telephone system.
- CDMA code division multiple access
- Direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) communication systems are for use in cellular telephone systems with traffic channels located at 800 MHz and in the personal communication system (PCS) frequency band at 1800 MHz.
- PCS personal communication system
- a DS-CDMA system all base stations in all cells may use the same radio frequency for communication.
- One known DS-CDMA system is defined in Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industry Association (TIA/EIA) Interim Standard IS-95, “Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System” (IS-95).
- each base station broadcasts a pilot channel, a synchronization channel, and a paging channel.
- the pilot channel or pilot signal is a pseudorandom noise or PN code.
- the pilot channel is commonly received by all mobile stations within range and is used by the mobile station for identifying the presence of a CDMA system, initial system acquisition, idle mode hand-off, identification of initial and delayed rays of communicating and interfering base stations, and for coherent demodulation of the synchronization, paging, and traffic channels.
- the pilot signal transmitted by each base station in the system uses the same PN code but with a different phase offset.
- the base stations are uniquely identified by using a unique starting phase or starting time for the PN sequences.
- the sequences are of length 2 15 chips and are produced at a chip rate of 1.2288 Mega-chips per second and thus repeat every 262 ⁇ 3 milliseconds.
- the minimum time separations are 64 chips in length allowing a total of 512 different PN code phase assignments for the base stations.
- the received RF signals include pilot, synchronization, paging, and traffic channels from all nearby base stations.
- the mobile station must search for pilot signals with the strongest pilot channel. If a mobile station is not on the strongest pilot channel, the mobile station is a candidate for handoff.
- Idle hand-off is the process of attaching to and listening to the paging channel of the base station with the strongest pilot as identified by the pilot search.
- the mobile station receives a page or accesses the system to place a call, it is important that the mobile station is listening to the page from or tries to access the base station associated with the strongest received pilot.
- This requires a fast pilot phase searching element, particularly when the mobile station is in motion.
- the searching element needs to be nimble, that is, able to look across the entire phase space as well as looking only at specific PN offsets. Unfortunately, the long times of the prior art searching mechanism adversely affects the soft handoff performance of the mobile station.
- MAHHO Mobile Assisted Hard Handoff
- the mobile would determine when to leave the current channel to perform candidate search on target channel.
- the infrastructure may not know the timing for when the mobile leaves the source channel. Therefore, after the mobile leaves the source channel, the infrastructure may think there is bad reverse link, and would raise the reverse link power control loop set point unnecessarily.
- the mobile returns to the serving channel, it needs to reacquire the forward link before turning on reverse link. Since there is no forward power control during MAHHO period, the base station may not be transmitting with the appropriate power, and since the reverse link is not turned on, the mobile unit can not control the forward link power to help the forward link acquisition either. If the forward link is not acquired in time, a drop call will be experienced.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a communication system, in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method of operating the mobile station of FIG. 1 .
- a communication system 100 includes a plurality of base stations 102 , 106 configured for radio communication with one or more mobile stations such as mobile station 104 .
- the mobile station 104 is configured to receive and transmit direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) signals to communicate with the plurality of base stations, including base station 102 .
- DS-CDMA direct sequence code division multiple access
- the communication system 100 operates according to TIA/EIA Interim Standard IS-95, “Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,” operating at 800 MHz.
- the communication system 100 could operate in accordance with other DS-CDMA systems including PCS systems at 1800 MHz or with any other suitable DS-CDMA system.
- the description herein is particularly suited for CDMA networks, it is envisioned that the present invention can be utilized in many other communication system employing handoff modes, such as UMTS, TDMA, GSM, and the like.
- the base station 102 transmits spread spectrum signals to the mobile station 104 .
- the symbols on the traffic channel are spread using a Walsh code in a process known as Walsh covering.
- Each mobile station such as the mobile station 104 is assigned a unique Walsh code by the base station 102 so that the traffic channel transmission to each mobile station is orthogonal to traffic channel transmissions to every other mobile station.
- Communications between particular base stations and mobile stations is determined by a mobile switching center 101 (MSC), as is known in the art.
- MSC mobile switching center 101
- each base station broadcasts a pilot channel, a synchronization channel and a paging channel.
- the pilot channel is formed using an all-zero data sequence that is covered by Walsh code 0, which consists of all zeros.
- the pilot channel is commonly received by all mobile stations within range and is used by the mobile station 104 for identifying the presence of a CDMA system, initial system acquisition, idle mode hand-off, identification of initial and delayed rays of communicating and interfering base stations, and for coherent demodulation of the synchronization, paging, and traffic channels.
- the synchronization channel is used for synchronizing mobile station timing to base station timing.
- the paging channel is used for sending paging information from the base station 102 to mobile stations including the mobile station 104 .
- PN pseudorandom noise
- All base stations in the communication system 100 are uniquely identified by using a unique starting phase, also referred to as a starting time or phase shift, for the pilot channel sequence.
- the spread pilot channel modulates a radio frequency (RF) carrier and is transmitted to all mobile stations including the mobile station 104 in a geographic area served by the base station 102 .
- RF radio frequency
- the PN sequence is complex in nature, comprising both in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components. It will be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the art that all processing of the pilot signal described herein involves both I and Q components, as is known in the art.
- the mobile station 104 comprises an antenna 108 , an analog front end 110 that can include a tunable duplexer, a receiver 114 (Rx) operable on a forward link (downlink) channel and that can include an analog-to-digital converter, a rake receiver and a searcher receiver, a transmitter 112 (Tx) transmitter operable on a reverse link (uplink) channel and that can include a digital-to-analog converter, and a processor 116 for controlling the transceiver and digitally processing signals, as are known in the art.
- Rx receiver 114
- Tx transmitter 112
- uplink reverse link
- processor 116 for controlling the transceiver and digitally processing signals
- the antenna 108 receives pilot RF signals from the base station 102 and from other base stations 106 in the vicinity. Received pilot RF signals are converted to electrical signals by the antenna 108 and provided to the analog front end 110 .
- the analog front end 110 filters the signals and the receiver 114 converts the signals to streams of digital data for further processing by the processor 116 , as is known in the art.
- Each base station 102 controls a transmit power level of mobile stations under its domain. This is done using a power control loop that compares a measured power level against a power control setpoint to control Tx power, as is known in the art. If a mobile station's power level exceeds the power control setpoint, then the mobile station lowers its Tx power. If a mobile station's power level is less than the power control setpoint, then the mobile station raises its Tx power. Each host base station 102 also directs its mobile stations 104 to periodically measure pilot signals from other base stations 106 for hand off purposes.
- the searcher receiver of the receiver detects pilot signals received by the mobile station 104 from the plurality of base stations 102 , 106 .
- the searcher receiver despreads pilot signals using a correlator with PN codes generated in the mobile station 104 .
- a quality and/or power level of the pilot signals of the various local base stations 102 , 106 can be transmitted back to a host base station 102 through the transmitter 112 of the mobile unit 104 , for handoff purposes.
- This information is passed to the MSC 101 which transfers communication from one base station 102 to a targeted handoff base station 106 for ultimate delivery to the mobile station 104 .
- MAHHO Mobile Assisted Hard Hand Off
- a host base station can request a mobile station to perform pilot signal measurements on the host base station pilot signal and also on other pilots of a candidate target frequency.
- the host base station can direct the mobile station to either provide a one time measurement or periodic measurements.
- the mobile station makes RF quality and/or power level measurement of the pilot signals, which are then transmitted to the host base station.
- the host base station then communicates (through the MSC) with a potential target base station having a strong pilot signal (based on the mobile station's measurements) to provide a channel for hard handoff, if available.
- the particular pilot signals for the mobile station to measure are provided by a candidate neighbor list provided by the host base station or pre-determined by the mobile station.
- the mobile station cannot only measure a pilot power level, but can also measure a bit error rate (BER), frame error rate (FER), block error rate (BLER), and the like, on a traffic channel.
- BER bit error rate
- FER frame error rate
- BLER block error rate
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a method for operating the mobile station 104 of FIG. 1 for acquiring a pilot signal in a CDMA receiver using a MAHHO protocol, in accordance with the present invention.
- a novel aspect of the present invention is operating 200 a mobile station (MS) to receive on a forward link (downlink channel A) traffic channel from a base station (BS 1 ) asynchronously and transmit on a reverse link (uplink channel B) traffic channel to the base station (BS 1 ), where the forward and reverse link channels are different.
- This mode of operation can be undertaken by the MS processor without external instructions, or it can be directed to operate in this mode by the communication system (e.g. BS or MSC).
- the communication system e.g. BS or MSC
- the MS would receive 202 a command to measure a pilot signal (e.g. determine a pilot power level) of a BS 2 channel that is targeted for handoff.
- the MS processor proceeds to direct the receiver to drop 204 the forward link (channel A) while having the transmitter maintain a connection to the reverse link channel (channel B).
- the mobile would continue to use the reverse link.
- the BS 1 would continue to decode the reverse link. As such, the reverse link communication is not interrupted.
- the MS decides when to drop the forward link channel, unbeknownst to BS 1 , and switch to a new targeted forward link channel.
- the MS processor proceeds to direct the receiver to acquire 206 a pilot signal of a new forward link channel (C) from BS 2 targeted for handoff, while having the transmitter maintain the previous reverse link channel (B) to BS 1 .
- the MS processor then directs the receiver to measure ( 208 ) the pilot signal (e.g. power level) of the targeted channel (C) from BS 2 .
- the MS attempts to return to BS 1 to report its measurement results.
- BS 1 does not know when MS has disconnected the source channel (A)
- BS 1 may believe that there is bad reverse link (B), and will raise the reverse link power control loop setpoint unnecessarily.
- the MS returns to the serving traffic channel, it needs to reacquire the forward link (A) before engaging the reverse link (B). Since there is no forward power control during MAHHO period, the base station may not be transmitting with the appropriate power, and since the reverse link is not engaged, the mobile unit can not control the forward link power to help the forward link acquisition either. If the forward link is not acquired in time, a dropped call will be experienced.
- the MS processor raises 210 a forward link power control setpoint to assist with a quick forward link restoration and improve the probability of re-acquiring 212 the previous forward link. Since the reverse link remains active, the mobile would be able to control the previous forward link power to assist in re-acquiring the forward link.
- the MS processor Upon re-acquisition, the MS processor immediately lowers 214 the forward link power control setpoint to normal operation, to limit interference, and directs the transmitter to report 216 the pilot signal power level of the targeted channel to BS 1 on the reverse link channel (B).
- the invention can be implemented in any suitable form including hardware, software, firmware or any combination of these.
- the invention may optionally be implemented partly as computer software running on one or more data processors and/or digital signal processors.
- the elements and components of an embodiment of the invention may be physically, functionally and logically implemented in any suitable way. Indeed the functionality may be implemented in a single unit, in a plurality of units or as part of other functional units. As such, the invention may be implemented in a single unit or may be physically and functionally distributed between different units and processors.
