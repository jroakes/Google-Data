Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to the field of optics, and in particular but not exclusively, relates to contact lenses.
- an accommodating lens includes one or more liquid crystal elements and circuitry to apply an electrical current to change the index of refraction of the one or more elements.
- Another of the three cue for depth perception commonly referred to retinal disparity, relates to a right-left difference between the respective locations of an object as viewed by a left eye and as viewed by a right eye.
- the third cue is vergence: the tendency of two eyes to be directed more for gazing towards each other when viewing an object nearby (and to be directed more for gazing away from each other when viewing an object farther away).
- the human brain has evolved to expect a close correspondence of these three cues to one another when viewing physical objects in the real world.
- 3D three-dimensional
- the blur cue is absent because the display is placed at a fixed optical distance from the eye. This results in a discrepancy in the correspondence between the cues that can be perceived, however subconsciously, by many viewers. Consequently, viewers often tend to have difficulty perceiving the 3D effect of a stereoscopic display, and can experience headaches, nausea or other symptoms.
- FIG. 1 illustrates elements of an environment in which an eye-mountable device is to operate, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating elements of a method to determine an accommodation level of an eye-mountable device according to an embodiment.
- FIG. 3 is a functional block diagram of an eye-mountable device for auto-accommodation along with an external reader, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
- FIG. 4A is a top view of an eye-mountable device, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
- FIG. 4B is a perspective view of an eye-mountable device, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
- FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a system to determine an accommodation level of an eye-mountable device according to an embodiment.
- FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a system to determine an accommodation level of an eye-mountable device according to an embodiment.
- FIG. 7 is a functional block diagram illustrating elements of a system to communicate with an eye-mountable device according to an embodiment.
- Embodiments of an apparatus, system and methods of determining operation of an eye-mountable, accommodation-capable device are described herein.
- numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments.
- One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the techniques described herein may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc.
- well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring certain aspects.
- Certain embodiments variously provide techniques and/or mechanisms to determine a level of accommodation to be provided by an eye-mountable device (EMD) disposed in or on an eye of a user who is viewing a stereoscopic display (e.g., a stereoscopic presentation of a still image or a video).
- EMD eye-mountable device
- the stereoscopic display may be presented using one or more display screens which are opaque to the outside world and which present graphical information in an immersive display.
- a stereoscopic display is presented using one or more transparent display screens which superimpose graphics on a view of the external environment.
- the user of a stereoscopic display system wears a contact lens or other EMD that is capable of providing any of various levels of accommodation.
- the EMD may include or communicate with sensors or circuitry configured to determine a vergence angle between respective directions of gaze by the eyes of the user. Based on the vergence angle, the EMD may provide a particular level of accommodation during the presentation of the stereoscopic display.
- the level of accommodation provided by the EMD in combination with a concurrent accommodation provided by the eye on which (or in which) the EMD is disposed, results in a blurred viewing of an object in the stereoscopic display.
- This blur may induce the user, consciously or unconsciously, to change the level of accommodation provided by that eye. Inducing such a change in accommodation by the user's own eye may approximate changes to accommodation that would take place during viewing of a real world physical object. Consequently, certain embodiments may provide for a correspondence between depth perception visual cues (blur, retinal disparity, and vergence) that more closely follows a correspondence expected by the human brain.
- FIG. 1 illustrates features of a system 100 to operate according to an embodiment while a user 110 is viewing a stereoscopic display 115 with at least one eye-mountable device 112 disposed in or on an eye of user 110 .
- Stereoscopic display 115 which is represented symbolically in FIG. 1 as a pair of screens showing respective versions of an image, may include functionality to present a 3D display to user 110 .
- Stereoscopic display 115 may include content representing, for example, a virtual reality, an augmented reality or a real world environment that is remote from system 100 and user 110 . Presentation of such a 3D display may include operations adapted from any of a variety of conventional stereoscopic imaging and display techniques, which are not detailed herein and are not limiting on certain embodiments.
- Stereoscopic display 115 may be included in or, alternatively, coupled to (and distinct from) system 100 , in different embodiments.
- eyes 152 a , 152 b of a user may have EMDs 112 a , 112 b disposed thereon, respectively.
- a direction of gaze 154 a of eye 152 a and a direction of gaze 154 b of eye 152 b are in parallel with one another, as well as with a mid-line 156 extending between eyes 152 a , 152 b . This may correspond to the user attempting to view an object at an effectively unlimited (“horizon”) distance.
- a direction of gaze 162 a of eye 152 a and a direction of gaze 162 b of eye 152 b may cross with one another at a vergence angle ⁇ 1 .
- This vergence angle ⁇ 1 may correspond, for example, to the user attempting to view in a medium range of distances.
- a direction of gaze 172 a of eye 152 a and a direction of gaze 172 b of eye 152 b may cross with one another at a vergence angle ⁇ 2 .
- the vergence angle ⁇ 2 may correspond, for example, to the user attempting to view in a shortest range of distances.
- System 100 may include a vergence detector 120 to determine an angle of vergence between a direction of gaze by a first eye of a user and a direction of gaze by a second eye of the user during presentation of a stereoscopic display. Determining such an angle of vergence (or “vergence angle”) may include calculating, selecting or otherwise determining an angle of convergence (and/or an angle of divergence) between respective directions of gaze by the user's eyes.
- Detecting the angle of vergence may be based on any of various sensor operations including, but not limited to, sensing a position or orientation of EMD 112 relative to a magnetic field, capturing an image of the user's eyes with a camera of an eye tracking system, and sensing a distance between different EMDs used by user 110 . Such sensing may be performed at EMD 112 or, alternatively, performed with a device that is remote from EMD 112 .
- Vergence detector 120 may be a component of EMD 112 , although certain embodiments are not limited in this regard.
- Vergence detector 120 may output to evaluation logic 130 a signal 125 specifying or otherwise indicating the angle of vergence between the eyes of user 110 .
- Evaluation logic 130 and vergence detector 120 may reside in one device or, alternatively, may be in different respective devices that, for example, communicate wirelessly with one another.
- evaluation logic 130 determines a level of accommodation that is associated with the angle of vergence indicated by signal 125 .
- evaluation logic 130 may include or otherwise have access to a predetermined lookup table, equation or other reference information (not shown) that indicates an association of one or more vergence angles each with a respective accommodation level.
- evaluation logic 130 may perform a look up, a calculation or other operation to identify a level of accommodation to be provided by EMD 112 .
- identifying the level of accommodation includes determining that some predetermined marginal change in accommodation is to be applied to the current accommodation level provided by EMD 112 (e.g., regardless of what the current accommodation level is).
- Evaluation logic may then send a signal 135 to an accommodation controller 140 that, for example, resides on EMD 112 .
- accommodation controller 140 may transition EMD 112 to a mode to provide the identified level of accommodation.
- the determining of an accomodation level by evaluation logic 130 is based on one or more additional variables.
- variables may include a level of illumination or brightness of at least some region of a display screen, information describing a texture or other property of an object represented in the stereoscopic display, an opthalmic prescription of the user and/or other related information.
- FIG. 2 illustrates elements of a method 200 to determine an accommodation by an EMD according to an embodiment.
- Method 200 may include operations performed with some or all components of system 100 , for example. Certain embodiments include performance of only some operations of method 200 .
- a method according to one embodiment includes only some operations of method 200 , where such operations are performed at an EMD.
- a method according to another embodiment includes only some operations of method 200 , where such operations are performed at a remote device that communicates wirelessly with an EMD.
- Method 200 may include, at 210 , detecting a direction of gaze by a first eye of a user, wherein a first eye-mountable device (EMD) is disposed in or on the first eye.
- the detecting may be performed at 210 with a sensor during a presentation of a stereoscopic display that is viewed by the user.
- one or more sensors may perform respective sensing while a first accommodation-capable EMD is disposed in or on a first eye of the user and, in some embodiments, while a second accommodation-capable EMD is disposed in or on a second eye of the user.
- Such one or more sensors may include a sensor that is integrated within an EMD, within a stereoscopic display device, within a device that can be removably attached to a stereoscopic display device, or within a handheld device.
- the one or more sensors may sense a first direction of gaze by the first eye and a second direction of gaze by the second eye.
- such sensing may, in some embodiments, be based on an interaction between an EMD and a magnetic field in the surrounding environment.
- such an interaction may result in a current being induced at the EMD, where the current is measured to detect an orientation of the EMD (and thus an orientation of the user's eye) relative to a direction of the magnetic field.
- the magnetic field is generated in a first EMD disposed in or on a first eye of the user, and sensed in a second EMD disposed in or on a second eye of the user, thus giving a relative measurement of the vergence angle.
- each EMD senses its absolute angle relative to an external magnetic field, where a vergence angle is derived from the two separate absolute measurements.
- sensing a direction of gaze may be based on an evaluation, by an eye-tracking unit, of a captured image that represents one or both of the user's eyes.
- an eye-tracking unit may calculate, based on the image, a proximity of a first iris to a second iris, a proximity of a first pupil to a second pupil, or the like.
- sensing a direction of gaze is further or alternatively based on a wireless communication between two EMDs.
- a first EMD may calculate, based on timing information associated with the exchange of the wireless communication, a distance between respective communication circuits of the first EMD and the second EMD.
- method 200 may further determine, at 220 , an angle of vergence based on the direction of gaze of the first eye.
- the angle of vergence may be an angle between the respective directions of gaze by the first eye of the user and a second eye of the user.
- Determining the vergence angle at 220 may include selecting, calculating or otherwise determining an angle value at a HMD (or other stereoscopic display device), at a device that is removably coupled to the EMD, at an EMD, or at a handheld device.
- Such determining may include performing an addition, subtraction or other mathematical operation based on one or more values representing gaze direction detected at 210 .
- determining the angle of vergence at 220 may include, or be based on, sensor information being communicated—e.g., wirelessly—from one device to another device, the sensor information indicating a direction of gaze of a user's eye.
- the sensor information may need to be communicated for processing with other sensor information which indicates a direction of gaze of the user's other eye.
- the sensor information may include or be derived from a captured image that is to be sent from a camera—e.g., disposed in or on a HMD—to a processing unit of an eye tracking system.
- sensor information includes a current that is magnetically-induced at an EMD, where the current is sent to signal processor circuitry and/or other evaluation logic of the EMD.
- Any of a variety of exchanges of sensor information may be performed, according to different embodiments.
- sensor information may be sent from a HMD or other stereoscopic display device.
- sensor information may be sent to handheld device, such as a smart phone, a tablet computer or a special-purpose device (for brevity, referred to herein as an “auxiliary device”) that has dedicated logic to configure, communicate with and/or otherwise access the EMD.
- sensor information may be sent to (or alternatively, from) an EMD—e.g., where the sensor information identifies a first direction of gaze of that EMD or identifies a second direction of gaze of another EMD.
- a direction of gaze may be identified with respect to some reference direction that, for example, is unmoving in a frame of reference of a stereoscopic display device. For example, such a reference direction may be normal to a plane of the stereoscopic display.
- Method 200 may further comprise, at 230 , determining a level of accommodation associated with the angle of vergence.
- the determining at 230 may be performed at an EMD that is to provide the level of accommodation, for example.
- the determining at 230 may be performed at a remote device that can communicate wirelessly with the EMD—e.g., at another EMD, at a HMD, at hardware that is removably coupled to such a HMD, or at a handheld device.
- Determining the level of accommodation at 230 may include accessing predetermined reference information that associates multiple vergence angles each with a different respective accommodation level.
- the reference information may be selected, calculated or otherwise determined based on information indicating a visual acuity of the user.
- determining the level of accommodation at 230 may include, or be based on, vergence angle information being communicated—e.g., wirelessly—from one device to another device.
- the vergence angle determined at 220 may be communicated from a stereoscopic display device, from hardware that is removably coupled to a stereoscopic display device, or from a handheld device.
- the vergence angle may be communicated to an EMD, in some embodiments.
- Method 200 may further comprise, at 240 , signaling circuitry of a first EMD to perform a transition to provide the level of accommodation.
- the transition degrades a focus on the stereoscopic display by the user with the EMD.
- reference information used to determine the accommodation level at 230 may be based on a particular level of acuity (or range of such levels) that corresponds to the acuity of an eye of the user.
- that eye's own accommodation in combination with the level of accommodation to be provided by an EMD in or on that eye, may contribute to a desired amount of blur in the user's viewing of the stereoscopic display.
- the reference information may associate with a given vergence angle an accommodation level that is sub-optimal, given the acuity of the user's eye, for the user to focus on an object represented in the stereoscopic display.
- the resulting blur may induce the user to adjust the eye's own accommodation in a way which would similarly take place when viewing an actual physical object (or objects), rather than a stereoscopic representation of the object/objects.
- method 200 further comprises one or more operations (not shown) to subsequently readjust the level of accommodation provided by the first EMD.
- Such readjustment may be based on an expectation that the user has adjusted, or is trying to adjust, the eye's own level of accommodation in response to image blur resulting from the signaling at 240 .
- the accommodation readjustment may improve a focus on the stereoscopic display by the user with the EMD.
- the degree and timing of such readjustment may be based, for example, on clinical evaluation of the user's viewing behavior and/or statistical information describing viewing behavior of a sampled population of people.
- FIG. 3 is a functional block diagram of an accommodation-capable eye-mountable device 300 to be accessed via an auxiliary device 305 , in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
- An exposed portion of EMD 300 may include an enclosure material 310 formed to be contact-mounted to a corneal surface of an eye.
- a substrate 315 may be embedded within or surrounded by enclosure material 310 to provide a mounting surface for a power supply 320 , a controller 325 , an accommodation actuator 330 , a capacitive sensor system 335 , an antenna 340 , and various interconnects 345 and 350 .
- the illustrated embodiment of power supply 320 includes an energy harvesting antenna 355 , charging circuitry 360 , and a battery 365 .
- controller 325 includes control logic 370 , accommodation logic 375 , and communication logic 380 .
- auxiliary device 305 includes a processor 382 , an antenna 384 , and memory 386 .
- memory 386 includes data storage 388 and program instructions 390 .
- Controller 325 may be coupled to receive feedback control signals from capacitive sensor system 335 and further coupled to operate accommodation actuator 330 .
- Power supply 320 supplies operating voltages to the controller 325 and/or the accommodation actuator 330 .
- Antenna 340 may be operated by the controller 325 to communicate information to and/or from eye-mountable device 300 .
- antenna 340 , controller 325 , power supply 320 , and capacitive sensor system 335 are all situated on the embedded substrate 315 .
- accommodation actuator 330 may be embedded within enclosure material 310 , but is not disposed on substrate 315 . Because eye-mountable device 300 includes electronics and is configured to be contact-mounted to an eye, it is also referred to herein as an ophthalmic electronics platform, contact lens, or smart contact lens.
- the enclosure material 310 may have a concave surface configured to adhere (“mount”) to a moistened corneal surface (e.g., by capillary forces with a tear film coating the corneal surface). Additionally or alternatively, the eye-mountable device 300 may be adhered by a vacuum force between the corneal surface and enclosure material 310 due to the concave curvature. While mounted with the concave surface against the eye, the outward-facing surface of the enclosure material 310 may have a convex curvature that is formed to not interfere with eye-lid motion while the eye-mountable device 300 is mounted to the eye.
- the enclosure material 310 may be a substantially transparent curved disk shaped similarly to a contact lens.
- Enclosure material 310 may include one or more biocompatible materials, such as those employed for use in contact lenses or other ophthalmic applications involving direct contact with the corneal surface. Enclosure material 310 may optionally be formed in part from such biocompatible materials or may include an outer coating with such biocompatible materials.

Abstract
Techniques and mechanisms for determining a level of accommodation to be provided by an eye-mountable device (EMD) for a user viewing a 3D stereoscopic display. In one embodiment, the EMD in disposed in or on an eye of the user, and an angle of vergence between the user's eyes is detected. Based on the angle of vergence, the EMD provides a level of accommodation that results in the user having a blurred viewing of an object in the stereoscopic display. The blur induces the user to change the accommodation provided by the eye on which, or in which, the EMD is disposed. Inducing the user to perform such a change in the eye's accommodation more closely approximates what the user would do when viewing real world physical objects. This tends to result in a better viewing experience by the user. In another embodiment, the angle of vergence is detected based on exposure of the EMD to a magnetic field.
Description
This disclosure relates generally to the field of optics, and in particular but not exclusively, relates to contact lenses.
Humans use three main cues for the depth component of three dimensional (3D) visual perception. One cue is the increasingly blurred viewing of an object as it gets closer to a viewer's eye. Accommodation is a process by which an eye adjusts its focal distance to maintain focus on objects of varying distance. Accommodation is controlled by contractions of the ciliary muscle. The ciliary muscle encircles the eye's elastic lens and applies a force on the elastic lens during muscle contractions that change the focal point of the elastic lens. Recent technologies have begun to provide for various devices that operate in or on a human eye to aid the visual focus of a user. For one type of these devices, an accommodating lens includes one or more liquid crystal elements and circuitry to apply an electrical current to change the index of refraction of the one or more elements.
Another of the three cue for depth perception, commonly referred to retinal disparity, relates to a right-left difference between the respective locations of an object as viewed by a left eye and as viewed by a right eye. The third cue is vergence: the tendency of two eyes to be directed more for gazing towards each other when viewing an object nearby (and to be directed more for gazing away from each other when viewing an object farther away).
The human brain has evolved to expect a close correspondence of these three cues to one another when viewing physical objects in the real world. However, in existing three-dimensional (3D) display technologies the blur cue is absent because the display is placed at a fixed optical distance from the eye. This results in a discrepancy in the correspondence between the cues that can be perceived, however subconsciously, by many viewers. Consequently, viewers often tend to have difficulty perceiving the 3D effect of a stereoscopic display, and can experience headaches, nausea or other symptoms.
The various embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings and in which:
Embodiments of an apparatus, system and methods of determining operation of an eye-mountable, accommodation-capable device are described herein. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the techniques described herein may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring certain aspects.
Reference throughout this specification to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrases “in one embodiment” or “in an embodiment” in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.
Certain embodiments variously provide techniques and/or mechanisms to determine a level of accommodation to be provided by an eye-mountable device (EMD) disposed in or on an eye of a user who is viewing a stereoscopic display (e.g., a stereoscopic presentation of a still image or a video). The stereoscopic display may be presented using one or more display screens which are opaque to the outside world and which present graphical information in an immersive display. In another embodiment, a stereoscopic display is presented using one or more transparent display screens which superimpose graphics on a view of the external environment.
In one embodiment, the user of a stereoscopic display system, such as an immersive head mountable device (HMD), wears a contact lens or other EMD that is capable of providing any of various levels of accommodation. The EMD may include or communicate with sensors or circuitry configured to determine a vergence angle between respective directions of gaze by the eyes of the user. Based on the vergence angle, the EMD may provide a particular level of accommodation during the presentation of the stereoscopic display. In some embodiments, the level of accommodation provided by the EMD, in combination with a concurrent accommodation provided by the eye on which (or in which) the EMD is disposed, results in a blurred viewing of an object in the stereoscopic display. This blur may induce the user, consciously or unconsciously, to change the level of accommodation provided by that eye. Inducing such a change in accommodation by the user's own eye may approximate changes to accommodation that would take place during viewing of a real world physical object. Consequently, certain embodiments may provide for a correspondence between depth perception visual cues (blur, retinal disparity, and vergence) that more closely follows a correspondence expected by the human brain.
At different times while viewing content of stereoscopic display 115, user 110 may be induced, consciously or unconsciously, to change an angle of vergence between his eyes—e.g., as image elements are variously represented as being at different distances from user 110. As illustrated in the top-side view represented in inset 150, eyes 152 a, 152 b of a user (e.g., user 110) may have EMDs 112 a, 112 b disposed thereon, respectively. At the time represented in inset 150, a direction of gaze 154 a of eye 152 a and a direction of gaze 154 b of eye 152 b are in parallel with one another, as well as with a mid-line 156 extending between eyes 152 a, 152 b. This may correspond to the user attempting to view an object at an effectively unlimited (“horizon”) distance. At the time represented in inset 160, a direction of gaze 162 a of eye 152 a and a direction of gaze 162 b of eye 152 b may cross with one another at a vergence angle θ1. This vergence angle θ1 may correspond, for example, to the user attempting to view in a medium range of distances. Finally, at the time represented in inset 170, a direction of gaze 172 a of eye 152 a and a direction of gaze 172 b of eye 152 b may cross with one another at a vergence angle θ2. The vergence angle θ2 may correspond, for example, to the user attempting to view in a shortest range of distances.
In some embodiments, the determining of an accomodation level by evaluation logic 130 is based on one or more additional variables. By way of illustration and not limitation, such variables may include a level of illumination or brightness of at least some region of a display screen, information describing a texture or other property of an object represented in the stereoscopic display, an opthalmic prescription of the user and/or other related information.
For example, one or more sensors may perform respective sensing while a first accommodation-capable EMD is disposed in or on a first eye of the user and, in some embodiments, while a second accommodation-capable EMD is disposed in or on a second eye of the user. Such one or more sensors may include a sensor that is integrated within an EMD, within a stereoscopic display device, within a device that can be removably attached to a stereoscopic display device, or within a handheld device. The one or more sensors may sense a first direction of gaze by the first eye and a second direction of gaze by the second eye. As detailed herein, such sensing may, in some embodiments, be based on an interaction between an EMD and a magnetic field in the surrounding environment. For example, such an interaction may result in a current being induced at the EMD, where the current is measured to detect an orientation of the EMD (and thus an orientation of the user's eye) relative to a direction of the magnetic field. In one embodiment, the magnetic field is generated in a first EMD disposed in or on a first eye of the user, and sensed in a second EMD disposed in or on a second eye of the user, thus giving a relative measurement of the vergence angle. In another embodiment, each EMD senses its absolute angle relative to an external magnetic field, where a vergence angle is derived from the two separate absolute measurements.
Alternatively or in addition, sensing a direction of gaze may be based on an evaluation, by an eye-tracking unit, of a captured image that represents one or both of the user's eyes. By way of example and not limitation, such an eye-tracking unit may calculate, based on the image, a proximity of a first iris to a second iris, a proximity of a first pupil to a second pupil, or the like. In some embodiments, sensing a direction of gaze is further or alternatively based on a wireless communication between two EMDs. For example, a first EMD may calculate, based on timing information associated with the exchange of the wireless communication, a distance between respective communication circuits of the first EMD and the second EMD.
Based on the detecting at 210, method 200 may further determine, at 220, an angle of vergence based on the direction of gaze of the first eye. The angle of vergence may be an angle between the respective directions of gaze by the first eye of the user and a second eye of the user. Determining the vergence angle at 220 may include selecting, calculating or otherwise determining an angle value at a HMD (or other stereoscopic display device), at a device that is removably coupled to the EMD, at an EMD, or at a handheld device. Such determining may include performing an addition, subtraction or other mathematical operation based on one or more values representing gaze direction detected at 210.
Although some embodiments are not limited in this regard, determining the angle of vergence at 220 may include, or be based on, sensor information being communicated—e.g., wirelessly—from one device to another device, the sensor information indicating a direction of gaze of a user's eye. For example, the sensor information may need to be communicated for processing with other sensor information which indicates a direction of gaze of the user's other eye. The sensor information may include or be derived from a captured image that is to be sent from a camera—e.g., disposed in or on a HMD—to a processing unit of an eye tracking system. In another embodiment, sensor information includes a current that is magnetically-induced at an EMD, where the current is sent to signal processor circuitry and/or other evaluation logic of the EMD. Any of a variety of exchanges of sensor information may be performed, according to different embodiments. For example, sensor information may be sent from a HMD or other stereoscopic display device. Alternatively or in addition, sensor information may be sent to handheld device, such as a smart phone, a tablet computer or a special-purpose device (for brevity, referred to herein as an “auxiliary device”) that has dedicated logic to configure, communicate with and/or otherwise access the EMD. In some embodiments, sensor information may be sent to (or alternatively, from) an EMD—e.g., where the sensor information identifies a first direction of gaze of that EMD or identifies a second direction of gaze of another EMD. A direction of gaze may be identified with respect to some reference direction that, for example, is unmoving in a frame of reference of a stereoscopic display device. For example, such a reference direction may be normal to a plane of the stereoscopic display.
Determining the level of accommodation at 230 may include accessing predetermined reference information that associates multiple vergence angles each with a different respective accommodation level. The reference information may be selected, calculated or otherwise determined based on information indicating a visual acuity of the user. Although some embodiments are not limited in this regard, determining the level of accommodation at 230 may include, or be based on, vergence angle information being communicated—e.g., wirelessly—from one device to another device. For example, the vergence angle determined at 220 may be communicated from a stereoscopic display device, from hardware that is removably coupled to a stereoscopic display device, or from a handheld device. The vergence angle may be communicated to an EMD, in some embodiments.
In some embodiments, method 200 further comprises one or more operations (not shown) to subsequently readjust the level of accommodation provided by the first EMD. Such readjustment may be based on an expectation that the user has adjusted, or is trying to adjust, the eye's own level of accommodation in response to image blur resulting from the signaling at 240. The accommodation readjustment may improve a focus on the stereoscopic display by the user with the EMD. The degree and timing of such readjustment may be based, for example, on clinical evaluation of the user's viewing behavior and/or statistical information describing viewing behavior of a sampled population of people.
To facilitate contact-mounting, the enclosure material 310 may have a concave surface configured to adhere (“mount”) to a moistened corneal surface (e.g., by capillary forces with a tear film coating the corneal surface). Additionally or alternatively, the eye-mountable device 300 may be adhered by a vacuum force between the corneal surface and enclosure material 310 due to the concave curvature. While mounted with the concave surface against the eye, the outward-facing surface of the enclosure material 310 may have a convex curvature that is formed to not interfere with eye-lid motion while the eye-mountable device 300 is mounted to the eye. For example, the enclosure material 310 may be a substantially transparent curved disk shaped similarly to a contact lens.
In some embodiments, power supply 320 and controller 325 (and the substrate 315) may be positioned away from the center of eye-mountable device 300 and thereby avoid interference with light transmission to the eye through the center of eye-mountable device 310. In contrast, accommodation actuator 330 may be centrally positioned to apply optical accommodation to the light transmitted to the eye through the center of eye-mountable device 310. For example, where eye-mountable device 300 is shaped as a concave-curved disk, substrate 315 may be embedded around the periphery (e.g., near the outer circumference) of the disk. In some embodiments, capacitive sensor system 335 includes one or more discrete capacitance sensors that are peripherally distributed to sense the eyelid overlap. In some embodiments, one or more capacitance sensors may also be positioned in the center region of eye-mountable device 300. Capacitive sensor system 335 and/or substrate 315 may be substantially transparent to incoming visible light to mitigate interference with light transmission to the eye.
In the illustrated embodiment, power supply 320 includes a battery 365 to power the various embedded electronics, including controller 325. Battery 365 may be inductively charged by charging circuitry 360 and energy harvesting antenna 355. In one embodiment, antenna 340 and energy harvesting antenna 355 are independent antennae, which serve their respective functions of energy harvesting and communications. In another embodiment, energy harvesting antenna 355 and antenna 340 are the same physical antenna that are time shared for their respective functions of inductive charging and wireless communications with auxiliary device 305. Additionally or alternatively, power supply 320 may include a solar cell (“photovoltaic cell”) to capture energy from incoming ultraviolet, visible, and/or infrared radiation. Furthermore, an inertial power scavenging system may be included to capture energy from ambient vibrations.
Eye-mountable device 300 may include various other embedded electronics and logic modules. For example, a light source or pixel array may be included to provide visible feedback to the user. An accelerometer or gyroscope may be included to provide positional, rotational, directional or acceleration feedback information to controller 325.
It is noted that the block diagram shown in FIG. 3 is described in connection with functional modules for convenience in description, but does not necessarily connote physical organization. Rather, embodiments of eye-mountable device 300 may be arranged with one or more of the functional modules (“sub-systems”) implemented in a single chip, multiple chips, in one or more integrated circuits, or otherwise.
Eye-mountable device 400 may have dimensions similar to a vision correction and/or cosmetic contact lenses, such as a diameter of approximately 1 centimeter, and a thickness of about 0.1 to about 0.5 millimeters. However, the diameter and thickness values are provided for explanatory purposes only. In some embodiments, the dimensions of eye-mountable device 400 may be selected according to the size and/or shape of the corneal surface of the wearer's eye. Enclosure material 410 may be formed with a curved shape in a variety of ways. For example, techniques similar to those employed to form vision-correction contact lenses, such as heat molding, injection molding, spin casting, etc. may be employed to form enclosure material 410.
Returning to FIG. 4A , loop antenna 440 is a layer of conductive material patterned along the flat surface of the substrate to form a flat conductive ring. In some examples, to allow additional flexibility along the curvature of the enclosure material, loop antenna 440 may include multiple substantially concentric sections electrically joined together. Each section may then flex independently along the concave/convex curvature of eye-mountable device 400. In some examples, loop antenna 440 may be formed without making a complete loop. For instances, antenna 440 may have a cutout to allow room for controller 425 and power supply 420, as illustrated in FIG. 4A . However, loop antenna 440 may also be arranged as a continuous strip of conductive material that wraps entirely around the flat surface of substrate 415 one or more times. For example, a strip of conductive material with multiple windings may be patterned on the backside of substrate 415 opposite controller 425, power supply 420, and capacitive sensor system 435. Interconnects between the ends of such a wound antenna (e.g., the antenna leads) may then be passed through substrate 415 to controller 425.
In the illustrative embodiment shown, system 500 includes a HMD 520 to provide a stereoscopic display and EMDs 512 variously disposed each in or on a respective eye of a user 510 using system 100. EMDs 512 may variously provide functionality such as that of EMD 112, EMD 300, EMD 400 or the like. In some embodiments, system 500 further comprises another device 530—e.g., a handheld device—to communicate with EMDs 512. However, functionality of device 530 may be integrated into HMD 520 and/or into one or both of EMDs 512, in other embodiments.
In a detail view of one example embodiment, shown in inset 540, an EMD 560 is disposed on an eye 550, where an enclosure material of EMD 560 has formed therein N coils 562 of a conductor (where N is some positive number). The N coils 562 may encircle a region 564 having a cross-sectional area A. When EMD 560 is exposed to a varying magnetic field B, a current may be induced in N coils 562. The current may be based on an angle of the magnetic field B relative to the cross-sectional plane having area A. The equations in inset 570—representing Faraday's Law—describe an inducing of current in N coils 562 by an electromotive force due to magnetic field B. In the equations of inset 570, ε is an electromotive force (voltage), ΔΦm is a change Δ in a magnetic flux Φm, Δt is a change in time t. In the equation describing Φm, N is a number of loops in the coils, B is that magnetic field strength, A is the cross-sectional area encircled by the N coils, and θ is the angle between a line normal to plane of coil and a line of direction of B.
In some embodiments, two magnetic field generators may be arranged in a configuration relative to the head of user 510 such that they can generate respective magnetic fields having two different directions at one location. As each of these field generator is variously activated, separately or in combination, the current induced in N coils 562 may be indicative of rotations about more than one axis—e.g., in order to distinguish between rotation of eye 550 about a vertical axis and rotation of eye 550 about a horizontal axis.
In one embodiment, one of EMDs 512 communicates a direction of gaze to a remote device—e.g., via wireless communication to device 530 (or alternatively, to signal processing logic integrated into HMD 520). The remote device may receive similar gaze direction information from the other of EMDs 512 and determine a vergence angle between the eyes of user 510. In some embodiments, the remote device further determines for one or each of EMDs 512 a respective accommodation level to be applied by that EMD. The remote device may then communicate accommodation level information wirelessly to EMDs 512. In another embodiment, the remote device instead communicates the vergence angle to one or both of EMDs 512—e.g., where the EMDs 512 are responsible for determining locally whether some change to accommodation is to be performed based on the indicated vergence angle.
Some embodiments, such one having features of system 500, may require a calibration, training or other initial configuration process—e.g., to account for a particular user's face. By way of example and not limitation, such a configuration process may include configuration software and/or other such logic—e.g., included in or coupled to HMD 520—operating to display some sequence of visual targets to user 510 while field generator 525 is exposing EMDs 512 to a magnetic field. The configuration logic may prompt the user—e.g., through visual and/or audio output—to variously view such targets at different times, where the targets each have a known position, apparent distance (depth) from a reference plane, etc. In response, user 512 may provide to system 500 input (e.g., via a microphone, handheld device or the like) variously indicating when such targets are being viewed. The calibration target may continuously move to different positions and perceived depths, where the user indicates by a button press, verbal and/or other means when they are or are not visually tracking the moving target. The calibration software may then variously communicate with EMDs 512 to exchange information indicating various amounts of current generated by coils of EMD 512 during the viewing of respective targets. The various amounts of current generated by coils of EMD 512 may then be associated, directly or indirectly, with respective directions of gaze by user 512.
In the illustrative embodiment shown, system 600 includes a HMD 620 to provide a stereoscopic display, EMDs 612 variously disposed each in or on a respective eye of a user 610 using system 600 and an eye-tracking camera 622. EMDs 612 may provide functionality such as that of EMD 112, EMD 300, EMD 400 or the like. The example embodiment of system 600 does not require any additional device—i.e., other than HMD 620 (and the logic incorporated therein) and EMDs 612. However, in another embodiment, functionality of HMD 620 and EMDs 612 may be distributed across additional devices—e.g., including a handheld device (not shown) such as a smart phone, tablet or an auxiliary device with specialized logic for configuring or otherwise accessing EMDs 612. In one embodiment, an additional device of system 600 includes hardware that is pluggable or otherwise capable of being removably coupled to HMD 620.
Eye-tracking camera 622 may capture one or more images representing the eyes of user 610. Such one or more images may be processed by detection/communication unit 624 to measure respective directions of gaze by the eyes of user 610. The processing may include operations adapted from conventional eye-tracking techniques, which are not detailed herein and which are not limiting on certain embodiments. The directions of gaze may then be evaluated to identify an angle of vergence between the eyes of user 610.
Detection/communication unit 624 may communicate the vergence angle to one or more remote devices—e.g., to one or each of EMDs 612 or some additional device of system 600—where the one or more remote devices each determine a respective accommodation level to be provide by one of EMDs 612. In another embodiment, detection/communication unit 624 determines one or more accommodation levels based on the vergence angle, and further signals EMDs 612 to variously provide such one or more accommodation levels.
A user may enter commands and information into the computer 710 through input devices 740 (e.g., keyboard, keypad, a pointing device, a mouse, stylus, touchpad, touch screen, motion detector, camera, microphone or any other device that allows the user to interact with the computer 710). A monitor or other type of display device may be also connected to the system bus 722 via an interface, such as output interface 750. In addition to a monitor, computer 710 may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers and a printer, which may be connected through output interface 750.
The computer 710 may operate in a networked or distributed environment—e.g., including computer 710 accessing a wireless network 790 with one or more antennae 780—using logical connections to one or more other remote device. The remote device may be a EMD, HMD, handheld device, personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, or any other remote media consumption or transmission device, and may include any or all of the elements described above relative to the computer 710. The logical connections depicted in FIG. 7 include a network 770, such local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), but can also include other networks e.g., cellular networks.
