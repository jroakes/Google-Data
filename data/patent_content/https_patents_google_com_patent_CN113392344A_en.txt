Detailed Description
SUMMARY
In general, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for saving content and rendering content based on the saved content. The computer system may display one or more web pages, documents, or other types of content. A user may browse and/or navigate between various web pages using a computer application of a computer system, such as a web browser application. The user may identify content of particular interest to the user. At a first time, the user may highlight or otherwise provide a first user input directed to a portion of the web page and/or requesting that the portion be saved for later viewing. The computing system may be configured to later re-render the highlighted content and/or content selected based on the highlighted content. For example, the computing system may receive a second user input describing the search query at a second time after the first time. The computing system may display data describing portions (e.g., highlighted portions) of the web page in response to receiving the second user input. The computing system may display the search result list and the data describing the highlighted portion of the web page may be displayed in the search result list and/or in a separate area or panel. For example, highlighted web pages may be included in the search result list, and data describing the highlighted portions of the web pages may be displayed in the search result list. However, in other embodiments, the web page and/or data describing the highlighted portion of the web page may be displayed in a panel and/or area separate from the search result list (e.g., based on relevance to the search results and/or search query). Thus, the computing system may intelligently present previously highlighted content and/or content selected on previously highlighted content at some time after the content is highlighted.
In some embodiments, the first user input may be directed to a text segment of a web page (e.g., a web page displayed in a user interface). The first user input may include a touch input requesting highlighting and/or selection of a text segment, such as a click/drag input on a touch sensitive display. The computing system may provide for display, in response to receiving the second input describing the search query, at least a portion of a text segment of the web page.
In some embodiments, the computing system may display the search results, which may include previously highlighted web pages. As one example, the search results may include a list of items, which may include web pages. Text indicating that the user has previously highlighted something from the web page may be displayed near the web pages in the list. As another example, some or all of the portion of the web page pointed to by the first user input (e.g., previously highlighted content from the web page) may be displayed in the search results list.
However, in other embodiments, the computing system may provide the search results for display in the first area of the user interface in response to receiving the second user input describing the search query. The search results may include a list of items, and data describing portions (e.g., previously highlighted portions) of the web page may be displayed in a second area of the user interface that is outside of the list of items of the search results and/or different from the first area. For example, search results may be displayed in a first panel and data describing portions of a web page may be displayed in a second panel. For example, a list of previously highlighted web pages and/or content from previously highlighted web pages may be displayed concurrently with the search results. The previously highlighted web page may be selected based on being associated and/or relevant to the search query and/or search results.
In some embodiments, providing for display data describing a portion of a web page may include providing data describing a first time at which a first user input was received. As one example, text describing the date and/or time (e.g., first time) at which the previous highlighting occurred may be displayed, such as "you highlighted the page at [ insert date and/or time ]. As another example, a relative time interval may be displayed that describes how long ago the first user input (e.g., the time at which the previous highlight occurred) was received. For example, the computing system may display "you highlighted content on the web page three days ago". As another example, the computing system may display "you highlighted some or all of the [ highlighted text rendered ] on the web page two weeks ago. As another example, the snippet may be provided in terms of one or more terms in the search result list. The computing system may display data describing the portion of the web page by including the portion of the web page in the respective snippet of the web page. Accordingly, the computing system may provide data describing the receipt of the first user input.
In some embodiments, the computing system may display some or all of the previously highlighted content in a separate area or panel adjacent to the search results. Previously highlighted content may be displayed based on the highlighted content being similar to the search results and/or relevant to the search query. As another example, the computing system may select one or more web pages or other documents relevant to the search query based on previously highlighted content.
In some embodiments, the computing system may select additional web pages that are different from the web page pointed to by the first user input based on the portion of the web page pointed to by the first user input. The computing system may display data describing the additional web page in response to receiving a second user input describing the search query. As one example, the computing system may display "based on your highlighting of [ highlighted content ] on [ web page pointed to by first user input ], you may be interested in the following web page.
In some embodiments, in response to receiving user input requesting display of a web page that a user has previously visited, the computing system may automatically display the last viewed portion of the web page. When the user revisits a web page that the user has previously visited, the computing system may automatically navigate to the last viewed portion of the web page. The computing system may automatically display an indicator, such as "continue from where you left" or the like, to explain or describe the automatic navigation within the web page to the last viewed portion of the web page.
In some embodiments, the computing system may establish one or more automatic bookmarks based on how the user navigates the web page. For example, if the user has stayed on a particular portion of the web page, the computing system may save the auto bookmark in the particular portion of the web page. For example, the computing system may automatically save the bookmark in response to the user scrolling slower than a threshold scrolling speed and/or statically viewing a particular portion of the web page for more than a threshold period of time.
Further, in some embodiments, eye tracking techniques may be employed to more accurately automatically bookmark web pages, for example. Movement of one or more of the user's eyes, gaze location, gaze duration, etc. may be detected. For example, the computing system may include a forward-facing camera capable of detecting one or more images of the user's eyes. The computing system may determine a focus of the user's eyes relative to the web page. The focus may be detected or tracked over a period of time during which the user views the web page. In response to the focus (e.g., eye movement(s), gaze location(s), and/or gaze duration (s)) satisfying one or more threshold criteria, portions of the web page correspond to the gaze location(s) and may be automatically bookmarked for display when the user returns to the web page.
When the user returns to the web page at a later time, the computing system may choose to automatically navigate to one or more automatic bookmarks. Further, in some embodiments, when the user returns to the web page, the computing system may display one or more indicators that visually describe the relative location of the one or more automatic bookmarks.
In some embodiments, the computing system may automatically display the portion of the web page in response to receiving user input requesting display of a web page that the user has previously highlighted or otherwise provided input requesting saving of the portion of the web page, or the like. For example, the computing system may automatically navigate to highlighted portions of a web page within the web page. If multiple portions of a single web page are highlighted, the computing system may automatically navigate to the last highlighted portion and/or provide multiple windows and/or panels that display the various highlights within the web page.
In some embodiments, in response to receiving a user input requesting display of a web page that the user has previously visited, the computing system may display a previously highlighted portion of the web page and/or a portion pointed to by the first user input. For example, the computing system may automatically navigate to the portion of the web page that was previously highlighted.
In some embodiments, the computing system may display one or more indicators that may describe the relative position of various highlighted portions of the currently displayed web page. For example, one or more on-screen indicators may correspond to various highlighted portions that are currently displayed in the user interface. One or more off-screen indicators may be displayed to indicate the relative position of the off-screen highlight of the web page with respect to the currently displayed portion of the web page. The off-screen indicator may be spaced apart in a vertical direction in proportion to a respective vertical positioning of the off-screen highlighted portion of the web page. In this example, the indicator may be located along an edge of the user interface. However, the indicator may be located at any suitable location within the user interface. Additionally, in some embodiments, the indicators may convey information about the color, category, and/or style of various highlighted portions of the web page. For example, the indicator may include a respective color corresponding to a respective color of the highlighted portion to which the indicator corresponds. Accordingly, the computing system may display one or more indicators to convey one or more of the number, relative location, and/or color/style of the highlighted portions within the currently displayed web page to the user.
In some embodiments, in response to detecting a user input pointing to an off-screen indicator, the computing system may navigate to a previously highlighted portion of the web page corresponding to the indicator pointed to by the user input. Thus, the indicator may facilitate navigation within the web page between previously highlighted portions of the web page.
Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to facilitating switching between highlighted versions of web pages and newer versions of web pages. The computing system may be configured to detect when a previously highlighted web page is updated and display a notification indicating that the requested web page has been updated since the user highlighted the web page. For example, the notification may include a first button configured to open a copy or version of the highlighted web page that includes the user. The notification may include a second button configured to open an updated or "live" version of the web page. In response to selecting one of the buttons, the computing system may display the requested version of the web page. For example, in response to receiving a user input directed to a button, the button is configured to open a version of the highlighted web page that includes the user.
The computing system may identify when a previously highlighted web page was updated and notify the user (e.g., when the user attempts to access the highlighted web page again). The computing system may provide the user with the ability to switch between an outdated highlighted version of the web page and a newer, updated version. More specifically, the computing system may be configured to receive a first user input from a user at a first time directed to a portion of a first version of a web page. For example, a user may highlight text on a web page at a first time. The computing system may receive a second user input requesting display of the web page at a second time after the first time. For example, the user may revisit or return to the web page that the user previously highlighted. The computing system may detect that the second version of the web page has been created after the first time and may display a user interface including at least one of the first version of the web page and the second version of the web page. The computing system may receive a third user input requesting display of the other of the first version of the web page and the second version of the web page (e.g., requesting switching between versions of the web page). The computing system may update the user interface to display the other of the first version or the second version of the web page. For example, the computing system may switch between displaying a currently displayed version of the web page and a version of the web page that is not displayed.
In some embodiments, the computing system may associate data describing the web page and/or the portion of the web page pointed to by the first user input with a user profile associated with the user. The computing system may select a previously highlighted web page and/or select search results for display based on the user profile. For example, aspects of the present disclosure may be provided as and/or in conjunction with a personal assistant.
The systems and methods of the present disclosure may provide a number of technical effects and benefits, including reducing the computing resources required to navigate to a desired portion of a document (e.g., a web page). For example, in response to receiving user input describing a search query, the computing system may automatically navigate to the last viewed portion of the web page and/or the previously highlighted portion of the web page. The computational resources required to open a web page to the beginning of the web page and then navigate to the last viewed and/or previously highlighted portion of the web page may be reduced.
Aspects of the present disclosure may be included in the context of an operating system, a system level operating layer, an application, a web browser plug-in, or in other contexts, or otherwise employed. Accordingly, in some implementations, aspects of the present disclosure may be included in, or otherwise stored and implemented by, a user computing device, such as a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. As yet another example, aspects of the present disclosure may be included in, or otherwise stored and implemented by, a server computing device in communication with user computing devices according to a client-server relationship. For example, some aspects may be implemented by a server computing device as part of a network service (e.g., a network email service).
Referring now to the drawings, example embodiments of the disclosure will be discussed in further detail.

The user interface 200 may include a copy button 208, a share button 210, a select all button 212, and/or a network search button 214. In response to selecting copy button 208, the computing system may save portion 202 of web page 204 (e.g., for pasting into a document). In response to selecting the share button 210, the computing system may facilitate sending, posting, and/or transmitting the portion 202 of the web page 204 to, for example, a message, an email, a social media website, and/or the like. In response to selecting the all select button 212, the computing system may select all of the text of the web page 204. In response to selecting the web search button 214, the computing system may be configured to facilitate a web search using some or all of the portion 202 of the web page 204 as a search query.
FIG. 3A depicts another user interface 300 in which the computing system receives a second user input describing a search query 302 at a second time after the first time. The computing system may provide, for display, data 304 describing a portion of a web page 306 in response to receiving the second user input. For example, the computing system may display search results that include a list of terms 308 that includes web page 306 in response to receiving a second user input that describes search query 302. Data 304 describing portions of web page 306 may be included in item list 308. Data 304 may include text indicating that the user has previously highlighted something from the web page. In this example, the text says "you brighten part of the page yesterday". As another example, the computing system may display "you highlighted content on the web page three days ago". As another example, the computing system may display "you highlighted [ highlighted text rendered ] on the web page two weeks ago". Accordingly, the computing system may provide data describing the first user input and/or contextual data associated with receiving the first user input.
As another example, snippet 310 may be provided in accordance with one or more terms in search result list 308. The computing system may display data describing portion 312 of the web page by including portion 312 in the corresponding snippet 310 of the web page.

For example, data describing one or more previously highlighted web pages 360 and/or content from previously highlighted web pages may be displayed in user interface 350 concurrently with search results (e.g., list 354). The previously highlighted web page may be selected based on being associated and/or relevant to search query 352 and/or search results list 354.
FIG. 4A depicts a first user interface 400, and FIG. 4B depicts a second user interface 402, according to aspects of the present disclosure. The first user interface 400 may display a list 404 of web pages that the user previously highlighted. The first user interface 400 may include a panel 406 that provides various options. The panel 406 may allow the user to filter and/or sort the list of web pages 404 that the user previously highlighted. For example, panel 406 may include buttons for sorting and/or filtering by "last highlight" 408, "last visit" 410, "website" 412, and/or "color" 414. In response to selecting "last highlight" 408, the computing system may sort list of web pages 404 according to the time the user last accessed each web page. In response to selecting "last access" 410, the computing system may sort the list of web pages 404 according to the time the user last accessed the web pages. In response to selecting "web sites" 412, the computing system may rank and/or filter the list of web pages 404 according to the various web sites in which the web pages are included. For example, a user may view all web pages that the user highlights for a particular website. In response to selecting "color" 414, the computing system may rank and/or filter the list of web pages 404 according to the color and/or style selected by the user for highlighting.
The second user interface 402 may be configured to allow a user to search for portions of text that the user previously highlighted, for example, using the search bar 416. For example, in response to receiving a search query in search bar 416, the computing system may search each portion of text that the user previously highlighted. As another example, in response to receiving a search query in search bar 416, the computing system may search each web page for the portion of text that the user previously highlighted.
Referring to FIG. 4B, the second user interface 402 may allow the user to sort and/or filter search results from a search using the search bar 416 and/or filter the body of material that the search bar 416 may use to search. For example, the user may enter a search query in search bar 416 and user interface 402 may return a list of search results. The user may then filter the search results by color/style 418 and/or by highlighted date 420. Additionally and/or alternatively, the user may apply one or more filters by color/style 418 and/or by highlighted date 429 to the body of material to which the search is to be applied. For example, the user may apply a filter that is (1) highlighted 420 for the last 7 days and (2) colored 418 pink and/or purple. The user may then enter a search query in search bar 416 and search only for highlights that were highlighted in the past 7 days, assigned pink or purple.
According to aspects of the present disclosure, a computing system may be configured to allow a user to switch between a highlighted (e.g., outdated) version and an updated (e.g., newer) version of a web page. The computing system may be configured to receive a first user input from the user at a first time directed to a portion of the first version of the web page, e.g., as described above with reference to fig. 2. For example, a user may highlight text on a web page at a first time. Later, the user may access the highlighted web page again. The computing system may receive a second user input requesting display of the web page at a second time after the first time. For example, the user may navigate to web pages in the search result list and/or web pages in the list of previously highlighted and/or highlighted web pages, e.g., as described above with reference to fig. 4A and 4B. The user may return to the web page that the user previously highlighted.
Fig. 5A illustrates a user interface 500, the user interface 500 displaying a notification 502: the requested web page 504 has been updated since the user has highlighted the web page 504. The computing system may be configured to identify when a previously highlighted web page 504 has been updated and provide a display notification 502 in response to user input requesting that web page 504 be displayed. FIG. 5B illustrates a user interface 520 configured to allow a user to switch between multiple versions of a web page. Referring to FIG. 5A, notification 502 may include a first button 506, which first button 506 is configured to open a copy or version of highlighted web page 504 that includes the user. Notification 502 may include a second button 508, where second button 508 is configured to open an updated or "live" version of web page 504. In response to selecting one of the buttons 506, 508, the computing system may display the requested version of the web page 504. For example, in response to receiving a user input directed to a button 506 configured to open a version of the web page 504 that includes the user's highlight, the computing system may display the user interface 520 of fig. 5B.
Referring to fig. 5B, the computing system may display a user interface 500 including at least one of the first version of the web page and the second version of the web page. In this example, the user interface 520 includes a highlighted version 521 of the web page. User interface 520 may display one or more text strings 522, 524 that indicate that the displayed web page is not current. One example text string 522 may include "you are viewing offline copies" or the like. Another example text string 524 may include a date that the web page was archived and/or highlighted, such as "copy from 12/09/2019".
The user interface 520 may include interactive objects 526, such as buttons, sliders, and the like, for switching between the highlighted version 521 of the web page and the updated "live version" of the web page. The highlighted version 521 of the web page may include one or more highlighted portions 523. The computing system may facilitate switching between the first version and the second version of the web page. The computing system may receive a third user input requesting display of the other of the first version of the web page and the second version of the web page. For example, the user may provide a third user input directed to interactive object 526 requesting that another version of the web page be displayed. The computing system may update the user interface to display the other of the first version or the second version of the web page. In this example, the computing system may switch between displaying the currently displayed highlighted version 521 and the real-time version of the web page.
In some embodiments, the computing system may display one or more indicators 528, 530. For example, the on-screen indicator 528 may indicate that the highlight 523 is currently displayed in the user interface 520. One or more off-screen indicators 530 may be displayed to indicate the relative position of the off-screen highlight of the web page with respect to the currently displayed portion of the web page 21. The off-screen indicator 530 may be spaced apart in the vertical direction 532 in proportion to the respective vertical positioning of the off-screen highlighted portion of the web page 521. In this example, the indicators 528, 530 may be located along an edge of the user interface 520. However, the indicators 528, 530 may be located at any suitable location within the user interface 520. Additionally, in some embodiments, indicators 528, 530 may convey information regarding the color, category, and/or style of the various highlights of web page 521. For example, the indicators 528, 530 may include respective colors corresponding to respective colors of the highlighted portions to which the indicators 528, 530 correspond. Accordingly, the computing system may display one or more indicators 528, 530 to convey to the user one or more of the number, relative location, and/or color/style of the highlighted portions within the currently displayed web page 521.
In some embodiments, in response to detecting a user input pointing to the off-screen indicator 530, the computing system may navigate to a previously highlighted portion of the web page 521 corresponding to the indicator 530 to which the user input is pointing. Thus, indicators 528, 530 may facilitate navigation between previously highlighted portions of web page 521 within web page 521. Indicators 528, 530 are also shown in fig. 2.
Fig. 5C depicts a user interface 550 of the user computing device. In some embodiments, in response to receiving user input requesting display of a webpage 554 that the user has previously visited and/or highlighted, the computing system may automatically display the last viewed portion of the webpage or the portion 552 of the webpage 554 to which the first user input was directed (e.g., the previously highlighted portion of the webpage). For example, when the user revisits the user's previously highlighted webpage 554, the computing system may display the webpage 554 and automatically navigate to the previously highlighted portion 552 of the webpage 554.
As another example, when the user revisits web page 554 that the user previously visited, the computing system may automatically navigate to the last viewed portion of web page 554. The computing system may automatically display an indicator 556, such as "continue from where you left" or the like, to provide the user with information explaining or describing the automatic navigation within web page 554. However, it should be understood that returning to the last viewed portion of web page 554 may include returning to a web page that the user did not previously highlight.
In some embodiments, the computing system may establish one or more automatic bookmarks 554 based on how the user navigates the web page. For example, if the user has stayed on a particular portion 554 of the web page, the computing system may save an automatic bookmark describing the particular portion of the web page. For example, the computing system may automatically save the bookmark in response to the user scrolling slower than a threshold scrolling speed and/or statically viewing a particular portion of web page 554 for more than a threshold period of time.
Further, in some embodiments, eye tracking techniques may be employed to more accurately automatically bookmark web page 554, for example. Movement of one or more of the user's eyes, gaze location, gaze duration, etc. may be detected. For example, the computing system may include a forward-facing camera capable of detecting one or more images of the user's eyes. The computing system may determine a focus 554 of the user's eyes relative to the web page. Focus may be detected or tracked over a period of time during which the user views webpage 554. In response to the focus (e.g., eye movement(s), gaze location(s), and/or gaze duration (s)) satisfying one or more threshold criteria, portions of web page 554 correspond to the gaze location(s) and may be automatically bookmarked for display when the user returns to web page 554.
When the user returns to the web page at a later time, the computing system may automatically navigate to one or more automatic bookmarks. Further, in some embodiments, when the user returns to the web page, the computing system may display more indicators 528, 530 that visually describe the relative location of the one or more automatic bookmarks. The indicator corresponding to the automatic bookmark may be displayed differently than the indicator corresponding to the previously highlighted portion. For example, the indicator (e.g., indicator 530) corresponding to the automatic bookmark may differ in brightness/darkness, color, size, etc. relative to the indicator (e.g., indicator 530) corresponding to the previously highlighted portion of web page 554.

At 606, method 600 may include providing, for display, data describing a portion of the web page in response to receiving the second user input, e.g., as described above with reference to fig. 3A and 3B.
In some embodiments, search results including a list of items comprising a web page may be displayed in response to receiving a second user input describing a search query. As one example, the list of items may include text indicating that the user has previously highlighted something from the web page. As another example, the list of items may include some or all of the portion of the web page pointed to by the first user input (e.g., previously highlighted content from the web page).
However, in other embodiments, the search results may be provided for display in the first area of the user interface in response to receiving the second user input describing the search query. The search results may include a list of items. Data describing a portion (e.g., a previously highlighted portion) of the web page may be displayed in a second area of the user interface that is outside of the item list of the search results. The search results may be displayed in the first panel. Data describing portions of the web page may be displayed in the second panel. For example, a list of previously highlighted web pages and/or content from previously highlighted web pages may be displayed concurrently with the search results. The previously highlighted web page may be selected based on being associated and/or relevant to the search query and/or search results.
In some embodiments, providing for display data describing a portion of a web page may include providing data describing a first time at which a first user input was received. For example, text may be displayed that describes the date and/or time (e.g., first time) at which the previous highlighting occurred. As another example, a relative time interval may be displayed that describes how long ago the first user input (e.g., the time at which the previous highlight occurred) was received. For example, the method may include displaying "you highlighted content on the web page three days ago". As another example, the method may include displaying "you highlighted some or all of the highlighted text on the web page two weeks ago. Accordingly, the method may include providing data describing the first user input and/or information associated with receiving the first user input.
In some embodiments, the computing system may display some or all of the previously highlighted content in a separate area or panel adjacent to the search results, for example, based on the highlighted content being similar to the search results and/or relevant to the search query. As another example, the computing system may select one or more web pages or other documents relevant to the search query based on previously highlighted content.
In some embodiments, the method may include selecting additional web pages that are different from the web page pointed to by the first user input based on the portion of the web page pointed to by the first user input. The method may include providing, for display, data describing the additional web page in response to receiving a second user input describing the search query. As an example, the method may include displaying "based on your highlighting of [ the rendered highlighted content ] on [ the webpage to which the first user input is directed ], you may be interested in these webpages.
FIG. 7 depicts a flowchart of an example method for saving content and rendering content based on the saved content. Although fig. 7 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the specifically illustrated order or arrangement.
