Abstract
Techniques and apparatus for integrated access backhaul using adaptive phase change devices (APDs) are described. In various aspects, the hosting base station determines (1505) that the APD is included in a communication path for a wireless backhaul link with the node base station, and assigns (1510) APD access to the APD of the node base station. The host base station then uses the surface of the APD and communicates with the node base station based on the assigned APD access by exchanging wireless signals with the host base station using the surface.
Description
Background
Wireless communication systems, such as fifth generation (5G) technology and sixth generation (6G) technology, are continually evolving, using various technologies that increase data capacity relative to previous wireless networks. For example, 5G technology uses a higher frequency range (such as a frequency band above 6GHz or a terahertz frequency band) to transmit data. As another example, 5G technology supports multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications using multiple transmit and/or receive paths.
The higher frequency range of the 5G system can provide bandwidth to support Integrated Access Backhaul (IAB) between 5G base stations. While these techniques can increase data capacity, the use of these higher frequency ranges to transmit and recover information also presents challenges. For example, higher frequency signals and MIMO transmissions are more susceptible to multipath fading and other types of path loss, which can lead to recovery errors at the receiver. In order to provide a reliable and flexible IAB link using wireless communications, it is desirable to compensate for signal distortion to obtain the performance benefits (e.g., increased data capacity) provided by these approaches.
Disclosure of Invention
This document describes techniques and apparatus for integrated access backhaul with adaptive phase change devices (APDs). In various aspects, a hosting (donor) base station determines that an APD is included in a communication path for a wireless backhaul link with a node base station and assigns (app) the APD access to the APD of the node base station. The hosting base station then exchanges wireless signals with the node base station using the surface of the APD and based on the assigned APD access, communicating with the node base station over a wireless backhaul link.
In various aspects, a node base station determines to establish a wireless backhaul link with a host base station. The node base station receives an APD access assigned to the APD from the host base station, wherein the assigned APD access includes at least an assigned reflection access for using a surface of the APD. The node base station then communicates with the host base station by exchanging wireless signals with the host base station using the surface of the APD and based on the assigned APD access.
In various aspects, an APD receives an indication of a node index from a base station over an APD control channel. The APD uses the node index to identify a surface configuration and then uses the surface configuration to modify the surface of the APD.

Detailed Description
The base stations communicate with each other to coordinate various types of wireless network services, such as dual connectivity, carrier aggregation, coordinated multipoint (CoMP), and the like. Often, successful coordination of these services relies on low latency and/or high throughput backhaul communications (e.g., base station-to-base station communications, base station-to-core network communications) between base stations. In some aspects, the base stations exchange backhaul communications over fiber optic cables. However, deploying fiber optic cables can be cost prohibitive and sometimes inconvenient. To illustrate, consider a portable base station that an operator deploys to a different location to temporarily augment and/or enhance services provided by a wireless network, such as to an outdoor concert, then to a running race, then to an outdoor three-to-three basketball tournament, and so forth. While portable base stations allow operators to accommodate temporary pressures on wireless networks caused by large groups of people carrying mobile devices, connecting portable base stations to stationary base stations via fiber optic cables can be problematic.
Integrated Access Backhaul (IAB) uses part of the wireless network spectrum, e.g., the fifth generation (5G) millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum, to provide wireless backhaul links between base stations. For example, a home base station in a wireless network maintains a connection with a core network. The hosting base station assigns air interface resources of the wireless network to the wireless backhaul link and communicates with the node base station over the wireless backhaul link to provide the node base station with access to the core network. In other words, the hosting base station serves a node base station with core network access in a similar way as the UE is served over the access link, such as by: the assigned air interface resources are used and various logical channels of the wireless network (e.g., physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH), physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), physical downlink shared channel (PDCCH)). In some aspects, the node base station optionally maintains separate links to the core network (e.g., without using the home base station) and communicates with the home base station over the IAB link to coordinate various services. Thus, the node base station may access the core network via the backhaul link (and the hosting base station) or a separate link.
While higher frequencies provide higher data throughput for the backhaul link, channel conditions can negatively impact signal quality. For example, millimeter wave signals have high throughput under line of sight (LoS) conditions, but reflections create multipath and frequency selective fading, which may increase recovery errors at the receiver. The changing environment can affect LoS conditions such as new foliage growth, precipitation, and/or new building structures that obstruct the LoS path. As another example, the portable base station may be moved to different locations, each with a different obstruction.
An adaptive phase change device (APD) includes a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) that, when properly configured, modifies a propagated signal to correct or reduce errors introduced by a communication path(s), such as small scale fading and fading MIMO channels. In general, RIS comprises configurable surface materials that determine how incident signals striking the surface of the material are transformed. To illustrate, the configuration of the surface material can affect the phase, amplitude, and/or polarization of the converted signal. Thus, modifying the surface configuration of the RIS changes the way the signal transitions when reflected off the RIS.
In aspects of an integrated access backhaul utilizing APDs, a host base station includes APDs in a communication path with a node base station and uses surfaces of the APDs to maintain a wireless backhaul link with the node base station. For example, the host base station and the node base station may establish an initial direct connection using low-band communications (e.g., below 6 gigahertz (GHz)) and then use the low-band communications to configure high-band (e.g., above 6 GHz) wireless backhaul links using APDs. As another example, the home base station and the node base station establish an initial high-band wireless backhaul link using APD and location information, and then perform a beam scanning procedure to improve the high-band wireless backhaul link. Configuring APDs to maintain (wireless) IAB links allows the hosting base station and node base station to improve signal quality by routing wireless signals around obstacles to mitigate channel impairments. This helps to improve the data rate, spectral efficiency, data throughput and reliability of communications exchanged over the IAB, which also improves the reliability of communications exchanged in the wireless network.
While the described features and concepts of the systems and methods for integrated access backhaul utilizing APDs may be implemented in any number of different environments, systems, devices, and/or various configurations, various aspects of integrated access backhaul utilizing APDs are described in the context of the following example devices, systems, and configurations.
Example Environment
Fig. 1 illustrates an example environment 100 that includes a plurality of user equipment 110 (UE 110) illustrated as UE 111, UE 112, and UE 113. Each UE is capable of communicating with base station 120 (illustrated as base stations 121 and 122) via one or more wireless communication links 130 (wireless link 130), illustrated as wireless links 131, 132, 133, and 134. To illustrate, UE 111 communicates with base station 121 and base station 122 simultaneously using wireless links 131 and 132, respectively. UE 112 communicates with base station 121 using radio link 133 and UE 113 communicates with base station 122 using radio link 134. For simplicity, UE 110 is implemented as a smart phone but may be implemented as any suitable computing or electronic device, such as a mobile communication device, modem, cell phone, gaming device, navigation device, media device, laptop, desktop computer, tablet computer, smart home appliance, in-vehicle communication system, or internet of things (IoT) device (e.g., sensor, relay, or actuator). The base station 120 (e.g., evolved universal terrestrial radio access network node B, E-UTRAN node B, evolved node B, eNodeB, eNB, next generation node B, gNode B, gNB, ng-eNB, etc.) may be implemented in a macrocell, microcell, small cell, picocell, distributed base station component, etc., or any combination thereof.
Radio links 131, 132, 133, and 134 include control plane information and/or user plane data, such as downlink user plane data and control plane information transmitted from base station 120 to UE 110, uplink other user plane data and control plane information transmitted from UE 110 to base station 120, or both. Wireless link 130 may include one or more wireless links (e.g., radio links) or bearers implemented using any suitable communication protocol or standard or combination of communication protocols or standards, such as third generation partnership project long term evolution (3 GPP LTE), fifth generation radio (5G NR), sixth generation (6G), etc. Multiple wireless links 130 may be aggregated in carrier aggregation or multiple connection techniques to provide higher data rates for UE 110. The plurality of wireless links 130 from the plurality of base stations 120 may be configured for coordinated multipoint (CoMP) or dual connectivity communications with the UE 110.
Wireless link 130 includes a wireless link 135 between base station 121 and base station 122, where wireless link 135 corresponds to an IAB link between a home base station (e.g., base station 121) and a node base station (e.g., base station 122). In various aspects, wireless link 135 utilizes wireless signals and intermediate devices (e.g., adaptive phase change device 180 (APD 180)) that reflect or convert the omnidirectional wireless signal (illustrated as signal ray 191, signal ray 192, and signal ray 193) ray(s) 190. In environment 100, signal rays 191 and 192 correspond to wireless signal rays from a host base station to a node base station, but these rays can alternatively or additionally correspond to wireless signals from a node base station to a host base station. A first ray of the wireless signal (e.g., signal ray 191) propagates in line of sight (LoS) toward the node base station, but is dynamically blocked and/or attenuated by the obstruction 170 (illustrated as a leaf). A second ray of the wireless signal (e.g., signal ray 192) propagates toward APD 180. Signal ray 192 impinges on the surface of APD 180 and is converted to signal ray 193 that propagates toward base station 122. In various aspects, signal ray 192 impinges on the RIS surface of APD 180, which diverts the reflected signal ray (e.g., signal ray 193) to base station 122. While rays 190 are described as omnidirectional, they may form a wide beam (as shown) or a narrow beam (e.g., in a direction similar to rays 192).
In aspects, wireless link 130 includes wireless link 136 and/or wireless link 137 between at least one of base stations 120 and one of APDs 180 to control a surface configuration of APDs 180, where the surface configuration directs how RIS changes signal properties (e.g., direction, phase, amplitude, polarization) of an incoming wireless signal. Base station 120 can also include a wired interface for communicating control information with APD 180. For example, base station 121 uses wireless link 136 to communicate RIS surface configuration information to APD 180. To illustrate, wireless link 136 can correspond to a control channel used by base station 121 to transmit APD control information to APD 180, such as by transmitting a large amount of control data (e.g., a codebook) using an adaptive phase change device slow control channel (APD-slow control channel), and/or transmitting time-sensitive control information quickly using an adaptive phase change device fast control channel (APD-fast control channel) (e.g., applying a surface configuration at the beginning of the next time slot). As another example, base station 122 communicates RIS surface configuration information to APD 180 using wireless link 137, which can include APD-slow control channels and/or APD-fast control channels. In some aspects, wireless link 136 and wireless link 137 correspond to APD control channels shared between base station 121 and base station 122, such as through assigned physical resources.
In various embodiments of integrated access backhaul using APDs, base station 120 (e.g., base station 121, base station 122) transmits an index (e.g., node index, home index, codebook index) to APD 180 indicating a surface configuration to be applied to the RIS. In some aspects, the base station 120 indicates an index assigned to a particular base station, such as a node index associated with the node base station 122 or a home index associated with the home base station 121. Alternatively or additionally, the base station 120 transmits time information indicating when the surface configuration is applied to the RIS, such as time slots, start time, duration, periodic time information (e.g., periodically applying the surface configuration), dynamic time information (e.g., applying the surface configuration once). The base station 120 can transmit direction information (e.g., host-to-node communication direction, node-to-host communication direction) with a surface configuration such that the APD 180 configures the RIS to reflect wireless signals in the indicated direction (e.g., by determining or using mutual reflection angles). Base station 120 can also determine the surface configuration(s) of APD 180 based on signal quality measurements, link quality measurements, location information, historical data records, beam scanning processes, and the like.
The base stations 120 together form part of a radio access network 140 (e.g., RAN, evolved universal terrestrial radio access network, E-UTRAN, 5G NR RAN, or NR RAN). In RAN 140, base station 121 is connected to core network 150 using interface 102, and base station 122 is connected to core network 150 through base station 121 using an IAB link (e.g., wireless link 135). In alternative embodiments, however, the base station 122 includes a direct connection to the core network 150, illustrated in fig. 1 as an optional interface 104. In various aspects, interface 102 and/or optional interface 104 includes an NG2 interface for control plane signaling and an NG3 interface for user plane data communications when connected to a 5G core network, or uses an S1 interface for control plane signaling and user plane data communications when connected to an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network. Base stations 121 and 122 can exchange user plane data and/or control plane information over wireless IAB link 135. UE 110 may connect to a public network (e.g., the internet) via core network 150 and base station 120 to interact with a remote service (not shown).
Example apparatus
Fig. 2 illustrates an example device diagram 200 of UE 110 and base station 120. In general, device diagram 200 depicts a network entity capable of implementing aspects of an integrated access backhaul utilizing APDs. Fig. 2 shows respective examples of UE 110 and base station 120. For visual brevity, UE 110 or base station 120 may include additional functions and interfaces omitted from fig. 2. UE 110 includes an antenna 202, a radio frequency front end 204 (RF front end 204), and one or more wireless transceivers 206 (e.g., radio frequency transceivers), such as any combination of LTE transceivers, 5G NR transceivers, and/or 6G transceivers for communicating with base station 120 in RAN 140. RF front end 204 of UE 110 may couple or connect wireless transceiver 206 to antenna 202 to facilitate various types of wireless communications.

BS APD manager 266 also indicates surface configuration (e.g., RIS configuration), timing information, and/or direction information to the APD. In some implementations, such as when base station 120 acts as a hosting base station, BS APD manager 266 dispatches APD accesses to node base stations, such as dispatch reflection accesses for use with the surface of the APD and/or dispatch control accesses for communication directly with the APD. In other implementations, such as when base station 120 acts as a node base station, BS APD manager 266 receives the assigned APD accesses and allocates some of the assigned APD accesses for communication with UE 110 over an access link and/or for communication with another node base station by using the surface of the APD to direct or divert wireless signals.

Fig. 3 illustrates an example device diagram 300 of APD 180. In general, device diagram 300 depicts an example entity with which aspects of an integrated access backhaul with an APD can be implemented, but may include additional functions and interfaces omitted from fig. 3 for visual clarity. APD 180 includes one or more antennas 302, a radio frequency front end 304 (RF front end 304), and one or more wireless transceivers 306 (e.g., radio frequency transceivers) for wireless communication with base station 120 and/or UE 110. APD 180 can also include a position sensor, such as a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module, that provides position information based on the position of APD 180.
The antenna(s) 302 of APD 180 may include an array of multiple antennas configured in a similar or different manner from one another. Further, antenna 302, RF front end 304, and transceiver(s) 306 may be configured to support beamforming for transmission and reception of communications with base station 120 and/or UE 110. By way of example and not limitation, antenna 302 and RF front end 304 can be implemented for operation in sub-gigahertz frequency bands, sub-6 GHz frequency bands, and/or above 6GHz frequency bands. Thus, antenna 302, RF front end 304, and transceiver(s) 306 provide APD 180 with the ability to receive and/or transmit communications with base station 120 and/or UE 110, such as information transmitted using APD control channels (e.g., including APD-slow control channels and/or APD-fast control channels), as further described.
APD 180 includes processor(s) 310 and computer-readable storage medium 312 (CRM 312). Processor 310 may be a single-core processor or a multi-core processor implemented in a homogeneous or heterogeneous core architecture. The computer-readable storage media described herein do not include a propagated signal. CRM 312 may include any suitable memory or storage device, such as RAM, SRAM, DRAM, NVRAM, ROM or flash memory, that may be used to store device data 314 for APD 180. Device data 314 includes user data, multimedia data, applications, and/or operating systems of APD 180, which can be executed by processor(s) 310 to enable dynamic configuration of APD 180, as further described. The device data 314 also includes one or more codebooks 316 of any suitable type or combination, as well as position information 318 for APD 180. The position information 318 may be obtained or configured, such as during installation, using the position sensor 308 or programmed into the APD 180. The location information 318 indicates the location of the APD 180 and may include location, geographic coordinates, position, altitude information, and the like. Base station 120 and/or UE 110 may calculate angle or distance information, such as between base station 120 and APD 180 and/or between APD 180 and UE 110 of interest, respectively, using location information 318 via BS APD manager 266 and/or UE APD manager 216. Codebook 316 can include a surface configuration codebook that stores surface configuration information for the RIS of the APDs and a beam scanning codebook that stores pattern, sequence, or timing information (e.g., phase vectors and reflective identifiers) for implementing a plurality of surface configurations that can be used to direct the APDs to perform various reflective beamforming. In some aspects, the surface configuration codebook and the beam scanning codebook include phase vector information, angle information (e.g., calibrated to corresponding phase vectors), and/or beam configuration information.
In terms of utilizing an integrated access backhaul for APDs, CRM 312 of APD 180 includes an adaptive phase change device manager 320 (APD manager 320). Alternatively or additionally, APD manager 320 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry that is integrated with or separate from other components of APD 180. Typically, APD manager 320 manages the surface configuration of APD 180, such as by: information exchanged with the base station over wireless link 136 and/or wireless link 137 is processed and used to configure reconfigurable intelligent surface 322 (RIS 322) of APD 180.
To illustrate, APD manager 320 receives an indication of a surface configuration over wireless link 136 and/or 137 (APD control channel), uses the indication to extract the surface configuration from codebook 316, and applies the surface configuration to RIS 322. This includes receiving a node index associated with a particular node base station, a home index associated with a particular home base station, and/or a surface configuration index, all of which can be used to access entries in codebook 316, as further described. In some aspects, APD manager 320 receives timing information with surface configuration communications, where the timing information indicates when the surface configuration is applied to RIS 322 (e.g., duration, periodic time information, dynamic time information). Alternatively or additionally, APD manager 320 receives direction information having a surface configuration that indicates a signal configuring the surface to reflect RIS 322 based on the direction information. For example, APD manager 320 selects a first surface configuration having a first reflection angle that reflects wireless signals to a node base station when the direction information indicates a direction of host-to-node communication. When the direction indicates the direction of node-to-host communication, APD 320 selects a second surface configuration having a second angle of reciprocal reflection that reflects the wireless signal toward the host base station.
APD manager 320 initiates transmission of uplink messages, such as acknowledgements/negative acknowledgements (ACK/NACK) for various APD configuration or management commands, to base station 120 over wireless links 136 and/or 137. In some aspects, APD manager 320 receives an indication of beam scanning mode (e.g., a beam scanning mode index) over wireless links 136 and/or 137 and applies a sequence of various surface configurations to the RIS based on the beam scanning mode and/or according to synchronization or mode timing indicated by or received with the indication.
RIS 322 of APD 180 includes one or more configurable surface elements 324, such as configurable electromagnetic elements, configurable resonator elements, or configurable reflective array antenna elements. In general, the configurable surface element 324 can be selectively or programmatically configured to control how the RIS 322 reflects (e.g., directivities) and/or converts incident waveforms. By way of example and not limitation, the configurable electromagnetic element includes electronically connected scattering particles (e.g., via a PIN diode). Embodiments use electronic connections to arrange scattering particles, such as based on reflection principles, to control the directionality, phase, amplitude, and/or polarization of the converted waveform (from the incident waveform). RIS 322 can comprise an array(s) of configurable surface element(s) 324, wherein the array can comprise any number of elements having any size.
In some aspects, the position and/or orientation of APD 180 is configurable, and APD 180 includes a motor controller 326 in communication with one or more motors 328, which motors 328 are operably coupled with the physical chassis of APD 180. Based on commands and control information, such as received from base station 120, motor controller 326 can send commands to motor 328 to alter one or more kinematic behaviors of motor 328, which motor 328 can include any suitable type of stepper motor or servo. For example, the motor controller 326 may issue commands or control signals that specify the shaft rotation of the stepper motor in degrees, the shaft rotation rate of the stepper motor in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM), the linear motion of the linear motor in millimeters (mm), and the linear speed of the linear motor in meters per second (m/s). The one or more motors 328, in turn, may be linked to a mechanism that mechanically positions a physical chassis or platform (e.g., avionics of an unmanned aerial vehicle, drives of a linear track system, gimbals within a base station, linear bearings within a base station) that supports the APD 180. The physical position, location, or orientation of APD 180 (and/or the platform supporting APD 180) may be altered by commands and signals generated by motor controller 326 and sent to motor 328. In response to receiving the position configuration from the base station, APD manager 320 communicates a movement command to motor controller 326 based on the position configuration, for example, through a software interface and/or a hardware address. In an integrated access backhaul aspect utilizing APDs, base station 120 can reposition or redirect one or more APDs 180 to improve or enable wireless signal reflection to be directed to UE 110.
Typically, APD 180 can be packagedIncludes a plurality of motors, wherein each motor corresponds to a different rotational or linear direction of movement. Examples of motors 328 that can be used to control the orientation and position of the APD include linear servo motors, which may be part of: (i) rail system mounting of APD, (ii) motors to control direction and pitch, yaw, roll of the drone carrying the APD, (iii) radial servos or stepper motors to rotate the shaft if the APD is in a fixed position or on a gimbal, etc. For clarity, motor controller 326 and motor 328 are illustrated as part of APD 180, but in alternative or additional embodiments APD 180 communicates with a motor external to the motor controller and/or APD. To illustrate, APD manager 320 communicates the position configuration to a motor controller that mechanically positions a platform or chassis supporting APD 180. In various aspects, APD manager 320 uses a local wireless link (such as Bluetooth TM Zigbee, IEEE 802.15.4, or hard-wired link) communicates the position configuration to the motor controller. The motor controller then adjusts the platform according to the position configuration using one or more motors. The platform may correspond to or be attached to any suitable mechanism that supports rotational and/or linear adjustment, such as a drone, rail propulsion system, hydraulic lift system, or the like.
As shown in FIG. 3, the position of APD 180 can be defined relative to a three-dimensional coordinate system in which X-axis 330, Y-axis 332, and Z-axis 334 define a spatial region and provide a framework for indicating a positional configuration by rotational and/or linear adjustment. While these axes are generally labeled as the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis, other frames can be used to indicate position configuration. For purposes of illustration, the aero-frame will refer to the axes as the vertical (yaw), lateral (pitch) and longitudinal (roll) axes, while the other motion frames will refer to the axes as the vertical, sagittal and anterior axes. For example, position 336 generally points to a center position of APD 180 (e.g., a position (0, 0) using XYZ coordinates) corresponding to the baseline position.
In various aspects, APD manager 320 communicates a rotation adjustment (e.g., rotation adjustment 338) about X-axis 330 to motor controller 326, wherein the rotation adjustment includes a direction of rotation (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise), an amount of rotation (e.g., degrees), and/or a rotational speed. Alternatively or additionally, APD manager 320 communicates a linear adjustment 340 along the X-axis, wherein the linear adjustment includes any combination of direction, speed, and/or distance of adjustment. Sometimes APD manager 320 also communicates adjustments about other axes, such as any combination of rotational adjustments 342 about Y-axis 332, linear adjustments 344 along Y-axis 332, rotational adjustments 346 about Z-axis 334, and/or linear adjustments 348 along Z-axis 334. Thus, the position configuration can include a combination of rotational and/or linear adjustments in all three spatial degrees of freedom. This allows APD manager 320 to communicate physical adjustments to APD 180. Alternatively or additionally, the APD manager communicates the RIS surface configuration, as further described.
Integrated access backhaul with APD
The base stations communicate with each other to coordinate various types of wireless network services, such as dual connectivity, carrier aggregation, coordinated multipoint (CoMP), and the like. Often, successful coordination of these services relies on low latency and/or high throughput backhaul communications (e.g., communications directed to the core network) between the base stations. In an integrated access backhaul aspect utilizing APDs, a hosting base station allocates air interface resources of a wireless network spectrum (e.g., a 5G millimeter wave spectrum) to provide a wireless backhaul link between base stations. The hosting base station and the node base station then communicate with each other using air interface resources and various channels (e.g., PUCCH, PDCCH, PUSCH, PDSCH) associated with the wireless network. While higher frequencies provide higher data throughput for the IAB link, channel conditions can negatively impact these techniques. To compensate for poor channel conditions, the wireless network includes APDs in the communication path between the hosting base station and the node base station. For example, the host base station and the node base station exchange wireless signals for an IAB link using APD surfaces. APDs allow wireless networks to improve signal quality by routing wireless signals around obstacles. This helps to improve the data rate, spectral efficiency, data throughput, and reliability of communications exchanged over the IAB.
Fig. 4 illustrates an example environment 400 that implements aspects of an integrated access backhaul utilizing APDs. Environment 400 includes a hosting base station 402 (also labeled "hosting"), a node base station 404 (also labeled "node 1"), and APD 180 of fig. 1. In various aspects, the hosting base station 402 and the node base station 404 represent examples of the base station 120 of fig. 1. The home base station 402 and the node base station communicate with each other using a wireless link 406 that is a high-band IAB link. For example, the home base station 402 transmits wireless signals to the node base station 404 (and/or receives wireless signals from the node base station 404) as part of an IAB link. In some aspects, the hosting base station 402 and the node base station 404 alternatively or additionally communicate with each other using a low-band wireless link 440. To illustrate, the hosting base station 402 and the node base station 404 communicate over a low-band wireless link 440 to establish a high-band IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406) using the surface of APD 180, as further described with reference to fig. 6 and 9.
In environment 400, a host base station 402 communicates with a node base station 404 over a high-band wireless link 406 by transmitting a wireless signal 490 to the node base station 404. In environment 400, ray 490 is depicted as an omni-directional wireless signal, but ray 490 may form a wide beam (as shown) or a narrow beam (e.g., in a direction similar to ray 492). The wireless signal 490 includes a first signal ray 491 propagating in a LoS manner to the node base station 404, a second signal ray 492 propagating to the APD 180, and a third signal ray 493 propagating to an obstruction 408 (illustrated as a leaf) blocking the signal ray 493 from reaching the node base station 404. When the host base station 402 transmits radiation 490 to the node base station 404, the node base station 404 can also communicate with the host base station 402 (via wireless link 406) by transmitting wireless signals to the host base station and/or APD 180 in a manner reciprocal to the further described radiation 494 and 492. In various aspects, host base station 402 and/or node base station 404 transmits wireless signals to APD 180 in a high frequency band at or above 6GHz such that signal rays 491, 492, and/or 493 may be blocked by an obstacle (e.g., a temporary LoS obstacle for signal ray 491, not shown). The respective signal rays 491, 492, 493 of the wireless signal 490 may be transmitted simultaneously or at different times. Alternatively or additionally, the hosting base station 402 and the node base station 404 communicate with each other using low frequency communications (e.g., below 6GHz, sub-6 GHz) that are less susceptible to degradation of the obstacle signals relative to high frequency communications, such as by using the low frequency band wireless link 440.
In various embodiments, APD 180 (or other APDs) participate in wireless link 406 (e.g., an IAB link) between the host base station and node base station 404 by converting (e.g., reflecting) the waveform using an RIS having a surface configuration APD 180 determined and/or indicated by the host base station and/or node base station. To illustrate, signal ray 492 impinges on a portion or all of the surface of APD 180 shown with reconfigurable intelligent surface 410 (RIS 410) and is converted to signal ray 494, which is directed to node base station 404. As part of receiving wireless signal 490, node base station 404 may receive signal ray 491 and signal ray 494 (but not blocked signal ray 493).
In an embodiment, host base station 402 and/or node base station 404 configures RIS 410 to control how signal radiation 492 is reflected from APD 180 and converted to signal radiation 494 directed to the node base station. Alternatively or additionally, RIS 410 converts incident signal radiation from a node base station on a path that is reciprocal to signal radiation 494 reflected from APD 180 and reaching the host base station along a path that is reciprocal to the path of signal radiation 492.
In some aspects, to configure RIS 410, the host base station and/or node base station selects a surface configuration from a codebook and/or LUT based on signal quality measurements, link quality measurements, measurement reports, estimated node base station location information, beam scanning procedures, and/or other values. For example, assume that home base station 402 resides in a fixed location and node base station 404 corresponds to a portable base station. The host base station 402 determines the estimated location of the node base station 404, such as by: analyze link quality measurements for low-band or high-band communications and/or receive location information (e.g., GNSS information, global Positioning System (GPS) information) from node base station 404. The host base station 402 may use the estimated position to select a surface configuration from a surface configuration codebook and/or LUT. For example, the hosting base station 402 accesses a historical data record that maps locations to surface configurations using the estimated locations of the node base stations, and selects a surface configuration (indicated by the historical data record) with an acceptable level of performance (e.g., converts signals to arrive at the estimated location of the (portable) node base station 404).
The host base station 402 and/or the node base station 404, for example, analyze the signals and/or link quality measurements to identify channel impairments, such as those caused by obstructions (e.g., leaves, buildings). By way of example and not limitation, various signal and/or link quality measurements that do not meet acceptable performance levels can indicate channel impairments such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), power information, interference signal to noise ratio (SINR) information, reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), channel Quality Indicator (CQI) information, channel State Information (CSI), doppler feedback, block error rate (BLER), quality of service (QoS), hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) information (e.g., first transmission error rate, second transmission error rate, maximum retransmission), uplink SINR, timing measurements, error metrics, and the like. In response to identifying the channel impairment(s), the host base station 402 and/or the node base station 404 initiates a beam scanning process, such as described in fig. 12 and 13, with the APD to determine a new surface configuration.
In various aspects, the hosting base station 402 associates a particular entry in the surface configuration codebook with a particular node base station (e.g., portable node base station 404) and communicates a node index to APD 180, as described with reference to fig. 5. The host base station may alternatively or additionally transmit timing information with a node index to indicate when to apply the surface configuration. In some aspects, the hosting base station optionally transmits direction information (e.g., a hosting-to-node direction, a node-to-hosting direction) with the node index, the direction information indicating which direction reflects the converted incident signal rays. For illustration, assume that the hosting base station 402 controls the surface configuration of APD 180 for both host-to-node and node-to-host communications, as described with reference to fig. 8, 11, and 14. The hosting base station 402 can transmit direction information with a node index such that APD 180 (via APD manager 320) selects a first surface configuration with a first angle of reflection that reflects wireless signals toward the node base station 404 when hosting direction information is indicated, and such that APD 180 (via APD manager 320) selects a second surface configuration with a second angle of reciprocal reflection that reflects wireless signals toward the hosting base station 402 when hosting direction information is indicated. In a similar manner, node base station 404 can indicate to the APD a hosting index, timing information, and/or direction information associated with hosting base station 402. APD 180 configures RIS 410 using any combination of node index (or host index), timing information, and/or direction information, such as by: the node index (or host index) is used to access entries in a look-up table (LUT) and/or a surface configuration codebook that stores surface configurations, as further described.
In various aspects, the wireless network associates each node index with a respective node base station, such that a device (e.g., APD, hosting base station, node base station) can use the node index to access a respective entry in a surface configuration codebook and/or LUT and obtain a respective surface configuration associated with the respective node base station. The corresponding surface configuration, when applied to RIS 410, configures the surface of the APD to direct wireless signals to or from the corresponding node base station. Alternatively or additionally, the wireless network associates each home index with a respective home base station.
For illustration, assume that the home base station 402 and the node base station 404 each reside at a fixed location during operation. Because the base station location is fixed, wireless signals propagating from the host base station to the node base station (or vice versa) repeatedly follow the same path. Thus, the wireless network (e.g., through the hosting base station, through the core network) assigns the corresponding node index to the node base station 404 and stores the corresponding surface configuration at the node index entry that configures the RIS 410 to direct or divert wireless signals from the hosting base station to the node base station 404 in a LoS manner. To configure RIS 410 for host-to-node communication, host base station 402 can transmit node index and/or direction information to APD 180.APD 180 then selects a surface configuration (using at least the node index) that configures RIS 410 to convert signal ray 492 to signal ray 494 upon striking the surface of APD 180 (or vice versa when the host base station indicates the node-to-host direction), such as by: modifying one or more desired phase characteristics, one or more amplitude characteristics, polarization characteristics, etc. In various aspects, node base station 404 can also communicate node indices, host indices, direction information, and the like to APD 180 to configure a surface for node-to-host communication. To illustrate, the node base station can asynchronously transmit communications to the host base station 402, such as through a Sounding Reference Signal (SRS), and configure the surface of APD 180 for node-to-host communications, as further described.
In various embodiments, the hosting base station 402 and/or the node base station 404 communicates the surface configuration information to the APD 180 over a wireless link, such as the wireless link 136 of fig. 1. In some aspects, the host base station represents an APD surface of a node base station configuration APD 180, such as described with reference to fig. 8. The hosting base station 402, for example, dispatches APD access to the node base station 404 and determines when the node base station 404 uses APD 180. Because the hosting base station 402 determines when the node base station 404 uses APD 180, the hosting base station 402 can configure the APD surface on behalf of the node base station 404 and based on the assigned APD access.
In various aspects, wireless link 136 operates as an adaptive phase change device slow control channel (APD-slow control channel), where hosting base station 402 and/or node base station 404 transmit a message to APD 180 indicating a surface configuration, similar to a layer 2 or layer 3 control message that uses Information Elements (IEs) to convey information. Alternatively or additionally, wireless link 136 includes an adaptive phase change device fast control channel (APD fast control channel), wherein host base station 402 and/or node base station 404 use signaling to indicate control information, sometimes on a slot-by-slot basis, for fast surface configuration changes (e.g., surface configuration applied on a slot-by-slot basis).
In some aspects, node base station 404 uses APD 180 to serve UE 412, where UE 412 represents a first instance of UE 110 of fig. 1. For example, assume that the hosting base station 402 assigns an allocation of APD access to the node base station 404, as described with reference to fig. 6. Node base station 404 sometimes determines to communicate with home base station 402 over wireless link 406 using a first portion of the assigned APD access and maintains an access link with UE 412 using a second portion of the assigned APD access, as described with reference to fig. 9-11. To illustrate, the node base station 404 transmits (and/or receives) wireless signals associated with the access link using the communication path 414 to compensate for the obstruction 416 blocking LoS transmissions between the node base station 404 and the UE 412. The wireless signal along communication path 414 impinges on the surface of APD 180 and is redirected to the intended recipient (e.g., node base station 404 or UE 412). As further described, this can occur concurrently with communication over wireless link 406 (e.g., an IAB link) based on the assigned APD access such that node base station 404 gains access to the core network through hosting base station 402 to serve UE 412.
Alternatively or additionally, node base station 404 uses APD 180 to service a second node base station 418 (also labeled "node 2"), where second node base station 418 represents an example of base station 120 of fig. 1. For example, as described with reference to fig. 14, the node base station 404 uses a portion of the assigned APD access (received from the hosting base station 402) to establish and maintain a second (wireless) IAB link with the second node base station 418, such as in a manner similar to the access link with the UE 412. The node base station 404 establishes and maintains a second IAB link by transmitting (and receiving) wireless signals using the communication path 420 to compensate for the obstacle 422 blocking LoS transmissions between the first node base station 404 and the second node base station 418. Based on the assigned APD access, node base station 404 can also communicate with host base station 402 using APD 180 to gain access to the core network and service a second node base station. Second node base station 418 may use a second IAB link with node base station 404 to indirectly access the core network (e.g., through home base station 402 and node base station 404) and to serve UE 424, UE 424 representing a second instance of UE 110 of fig. 1. Thus, the node base station 404 can utilize the APD 180 to maintain multiple wireless communication links, such as any combination of a first IAB link with a home base station, one or more access links with a UE, and/or a second IAB link with a second node base station.
In some aspects, the hosting base station uses APD 180 to serve UE 426, which represents a third instance of generic UE 110 of fig. 1. For example, assume that the hosting base station 402 assigns a first allocation of APD access to the node base station 404 and a second allocation of APD access to itself as the hosting base station 402. In a manner similar to node base station 404, home base station 402 sometimes uses a portion of its assigned APD access to maintain an access link to UE 426 by: wireless signals along communication path 428 are transmitted (and/or received) to compensate for an obstruction 430 blocking LoS transmissions between host base station 402 and UE 426. This may occur concurrently with communication over wireless link 406 (e.g., an IAB link) based on the assigned APD access, as further described.
Fig. 5 illustrates an example 500 of configuring a surface of APD 180 in accordance with one or more aspects of an integrated access backhaul utilizing the APD. Example 500 includes an example of base station 120 and APD 180, which may be implemented similarly as described with reference to fig. 1-4. The RIS implemented by APD 180 includes an array of "N" configurable surface elements, such as configurable surface element 502, configurable surface element 504, configurable surface element 506, and the like, where "N" represents the number of configurable surface elements of the RIS.
In an embodiment, base station 120 manages the configuration of the RIS of APD 180 by using surface configuration codebook 508, which can be preconfigured and/or learned by base station 120 and APD 180. In some cases, base station 120 uses one or more messages to transmit surface configuration codebook 508 and/or beam scanning codebook using wireless link 136 and/or wireless link 137, such as through an APD slow control channel. In various aspects, the base station 120 uses APD slow control channels to transmit large amounts of data, transmit data without low delay requirements, and/or transmit data without timing requirements. Sometimes, base station 120 transmits a plurality of surface configuration codebooks, such as a phase vector codebook, a beam scanning codebook, etc., to APD 180. In response, APD 180 stores surface configuration codebook(s) 508 and/or other codebooks in CRM, which represents codebook 316 in CRM 312, as described with reference to fig. 3. Alternatively or additionally, APD 180 obtains the surface configuration and other codebooks through a manufacturing (e.g., programming), calibration, or installation process that stores surface configuration codebook 508 and other codebooks in CRM 312 of APD 180 during assembly, installation, calibration, verification, or by an operator manually adding or updating codebook(s).
Surface configuration codebook 508 includes configuration information specifying the surface configuration for some or all of the configurable surface elements (e.g., elements 324) forming the RIS of APDs 180. For example, each index of the codebook corresponds to a phase vector having configuration information for each configurable surface element of APD 180. For example, index 0 maps phase configuration 0 to configurable surface element 502, phase configuration 1 to configurable surface element 504, phase configuration 2 to configurable surface element 506, and so on. Similarly, index 1 maps phase configuration 3 to configurable surface element 502, phase configuration 4 to configurable surface element 504, phase configuration 5 to configurable surface element 506, and so on. The surface configuration codebook 508 can include any number of phase vectors that specify configurations for any number of configurable surface elements such that a first phase vector corresponds to a first surface configuration of APD 180 (through the configuration of each configurable surface element in the RIS), a second phase vector corresponds to a second surface configuration of APD 180, and so on. Alternatively or additionally, codebook 508 can specify configuring phase vectors of a subset of the configurable surface elements. In various aspects, one or more surface configurations or phase vectors may be mapped or calibrated to particular angle information of incident and/or reflected wireless signals (e.g., reference signals), signal rays, beamformed transmissions, etc. of the base station 120.
Although the surface configuration codebook 508 of fig. 5 includes phase vector information, an alternative or additional codebook stores beam configuration information, such as a first surface configuration specifying a first beam having a first (propagation) direction, a second surface configuration specifying a second beam having a second direction, etc. Thus, in various embodiments, the surface configuration codebook 508 corresponds to a beam codebook that can enable APD 180 to beamform an incident wireless signal. Similarly, to configure the surface of APD 180, base station 120 determines a desired beam configuration for the converted signal and identifies an entry in a beam codebook corresponding to the desired beam configuration. In some aspects, the beam scanning codebook indicates a surface configuration and/or a pattern of beam configurations, such as a surface configuration and/or a beam configuration, as indicated by the surface configuration codebook 508 and the beam configuration specified by the beam codebook. To illustrate, the beam scanning codebook indicates the order of surface configuration and optionally APD reflection identifiers to cycle through for beam scanning in the horizontal or vertical direction. Alternatively or additionally, the beam scanning codebook indicates a duration for applying each surface configuration effective to steer the reflected beam in a particular direction for that duration.
The surface configuration information stored in the codebook can correspond to a complete configuration (e.g., configured with the value) specifying an exact or absolute configuration or an incremental configuration (e.g., with the value modifying the current state) specifying a relative configuration. In one or more embodiments, the phase configuration information specifies a direction increment and/or an angular adjustment between the incident signal and the converted signal. For example, phase configuration 0 can specify an angular adjustment configuration for element 502 such that configurable surface element 502 reflects an incident waveform with a "phase configuration 0" relative angular or directional offset. As shown in fig. 5, base station 120 and/or UE 110 transmits an indication of a specified surface configuration to APD 180. In this example, the indication specifies an index 510 (index 510) that maps to a corresponding surface configuration of APD 180. In some aspects, index 510 represents a node index, a home index, a beam scan index, or a surface configuration index, each of which can be mapped to an entry in a surface configuration codebook. In response to receiving the indication, APD manager 320 retrieves the surface configuration from surface configuration codebook 508 using the index and applies the surface configuration to the RIS. For example, APD manager 320 configures each configurable surface element (or each configurable surface element of a subset of configurable surface elements) as specified by a corresponding entry in surface configuration codebook 508.
In various embodiments, base station 120 communicates timing information (not shown) to APD 180, which may be included in a surface configuration or beam scanning index. For example, base station 120 may indicate to APD 180 the start time of the application-indicated surface configuration or beam scanning pattern using wireless link 136 or 137, respectively. This can include indicating static timing information (e.g., periodic) and/or dynamic timing information (e.g., one-time-use). In various aspects, the base station 120 transmits a stop time indicating when to remove and/or change the surface configuration or beam scanning pattern. Upon changing the surface configuration, APD 180 can control the direction in which APD 180 reflects the wireless signal by APD manager 320 applying a default surface configuration, returning to a previous surface configuration (e.g., a surface configuration used prior to the indicated surface configuration), and/or applying a new surface configuration. To maintain synchronization timing, APD 180 can receive and/or process base station synchronization signals.
By specifying timing information, base station 120 can use time division to assign access to APD 180. Alternatively or additionally, base station 120 can use configurable surface element partitioning to distribute access to APDs 180. For example, the hosting base station shares access to APD 180 with the node base station, as described with reference to fig. 6-8. As another example, as described with reference to fig. 9-11, the node base stations share access to APD 180 to communicate with the hosting base station over the IAB link and with the UE over the access link. Alternatively or additionally, the node base stations share access to APD 180 to communicate with (and service) the second node base station over the second IAB link, as described with reference to fig. 14. Sometimes, the base station 120 updates one or more entries in the surface configuration codebook, as described with reference to fig. 12 and 13.
Signaling and control transactions with integrated access backhaul for APDs
Fig. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 illustrate example signaling and control transaction diagrams according to one or more aspects of an integrated access backhaul utilizing APDs. In various aspects, the operations of signaling and control transactions may be performed by any combination of devices including a host base station (e.g., host base station 121, host base station 402), a first node base station (e.g., node base station 122, node base station 404), an APD (e.g., APD 180), a UE (e.g., UE 110, UE 412, UE 424, UE 426), and/or a second node base station (e.g., node base station 418) using aspects described with reference to any of fig. 1-5.
A first example of signaling and control transactions for an integrated access backhaul utilizing APDs is illustrated by signaling and control transaction diagram 600 of fig. 6, wherein diagram 600 results in (a) additional signaling and control transactions as illustrated in fig. 7, or (b) additional signaling and control transactions as illustrated in fig. 8. Diagram 600 includes signaling and control transactions between node base station 404, APD 180, home base station 402, and UE 110. Fig. 6-8 together illustrate an example embodiment in which a host base station and a node base station communicate over an IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406) using the surface of an APD. In some aspects, the node base station uses an IAB link with the host base station to serve UE 110 without using APDs in the communication path to the UE (e.g., communication path 414).
As illustrated, at 605, the node base station 404 and the home base station 402 establish a wireless connection with each other. To illustrate, the node base station 404 and the host base station 402 initially establish a wireless connection using low-band communications (e.g., low-band wireless link 440). For example, node base station 404 may identify poor quality of high-band communications (e.g., millimeter waves) with host base station 402 (and/or host base station 402 may identify poor quality of high-band communications), such as by: signal or link quality measurements associated with high-band communications are analyzed and a determination is made as to whether the measurements are below an acceptable performance threshold. Alternatively or additionally, the node base station 404 fails to receive a response from the host base station 402 (or vice versa) when transmitting the high-band IAB communication. In response to identifying that the high-band communication quality is poor and/or failing to receive a response, node base station 404 and/or home base station 402 determines to establish a wireless low-band connection (e.g., low-band wireless link 440) with another base station.
In some aspects, the node base station 404 indicates the location information to the host base station 402 using a low-band connection (e.g., low-band wireless link 440), such as by transmitting GNSS and/or GPS location information to the host base station. In establishing the wireless low-band connection, node base station 404 and host base station 402 bypass the APD surface as long as neither base station has the intention to actively configure or transmit signals to the APD surface to reflect and/or redirect wireless signals as further described.
At 610, node base station 404 optionally requests a high-band IAB link from home base station 402, such as an IAB link implemented using millimeter wave resources of a RAT (e.g., 5G). For example, node base station 404 transmits a request to home base station 402 after establishing 605 a low band connection. Similar to that described at 605, node base station 404 bypasses APDs when transmitting a request (e.g., does not actively configure APD surfaces, does not intentionally reflect signals of APD surfaces). In some aspects, the node base station 404 indicates a request to include an APD in a communication path between the hosting base station and the node base station, such as implicitly requesting the APD by forwarding a signal or link quality measurement associated with the high-band communication, or explicitly requesting with a boolean value, a field value, or an enumerated type. However, in alternative or additional aspects, the hosting base station 402 determines to establish the high-band IAB link without receiving the request from the node base station 404. In various aspects, the hosting base station 402 analyzes the signal or link quality measurements, either received from the node base station over the low-band connection or generated by the hosting base station from the high-band communication, and determines that the measurements indicate channel impairment. In response to identifying the channel impairment, the hosting base station 402 determines to include an APD in the high-band communication path with the node base station 404.
At 615, the hosting base station 402 selects APD for establishing and/or maintaining a (high-band, wireless) IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406) with the node base station 404. To select an APD, the host base station 402 can identify one or more APDs within an operating range, such as by monitoring APD broadcast signals and/or messages transmitted from the APD(s) advertising the presence of the APD to the host base station. Alternatively or additionally, the hosting base station 402 can access a server that indicates APD records for APDs within a cell service area or that queries for information about APDs within a cell service area. The home base station 402 uses the location information received from the node base station 404 (or obtained using a beam scanning procedure) by low band communication and identifies APDs within the operating range of both the home base station 402 and the node base station 404. In some aspects, the host base station 402 analyzes the APD capabilities (e.g., number of configurable surface elements, configuration bit resolution of the configurable surface elements, supported surface configuration codebook, APD surface sharing capabilities) of each candidate APD and selects APD 180 based on the APD capabilities. For example, the host base station chooses to support surface-shared APDs. For another example, the host base station can select an APD that includes the greatest number of configurable surface elements, has the greatest configurable surface area, or has the surface angular capability most suitable for reaching the node base station among the candidate APDs.
Alternatively or additionally, the hosting base station 402 performs a beam scanning procedure to identify wireless high-band communication paths to the node base station, such as beam scanning procedures similar to those described at 1225 of fig. 12 and 13, and/or uses low-band communication to transmit/receive feedback (e.g., measurement reports). For example, assume that node base station 404 receives an input identifying the locations of APD 180 and host base station 402, such as by: the network operator manually configures the portable node base station and inputs APD location information and/or host base station location information. In various aspects, the node base station 404 transmits a message to the host base station 402, such as by: messages are transmitted using low-band communications (e.g., low-band wireless link 440) and/or transmissions are directed to the surface of APD 180 based on APD location information. The message may or may not include location information for the node base station 404. In response to receiving the message, the hosting base station 402 performs a beam scanning process to identify a surface configuration of the APD that improves communication with the node base station 404, such as by: the beam scanning process is used to identify the angle of incidence and angle of reflection of the high-band wireless signal that results in better signal quality at the receiving device.
At 620, the hosting base station 402 assigns and assigns APD access to the node base station 404. To illustrate, the hosting base station 402 uses the time division to assign reflected access to APD 180 and assign a first duration to node base station 404 and/or assign a second duration to itself as hosting base station 402. This can include assigning the duration statically (e.g., on a periodic basis) or dynamically (e.g., one-time-use). Based on the time-division access, node base station 404 agrees to use (and/or configure) the surface of APD 180 during a first duration and not use (and/or not configure) the surface of APD 180 during a second duration. The time partitions determined by the home base station need not be equal and may depend on various factors such as the number of node base stations served (directly or indirectly) by the home base station, the number of UEs served (directly or indirectly) by the node base station, and so on.
Alternatively or additionally, the host base station 402 uses configurable surface element partitioning to dispatch reflected access to APD 180, such as by dispatching a subset of the configurable surface elements forming the RIS. For example, referring to fig. 5, base station 120 assigns configurable surface element 502 to node base station 404 and assigns configurable surface element 506 to host base station 402. This can include any type of configurable surface element division, such as a horizontal division of element groupings in the same horizontal row, a vertical division of element groupings in the same vertical column, a quadrant division, and the like. The configurable surface element partitions need not be equal and may depend on various factors such as the number of node base stations served (directly or indirectly) by the host base station, the number of UEs served (directly or indirectly) by the node base stations, and so on.
As part of assigning APD access to APD 180, the hosting base station 402 sometimes assigns control access to APD. Such as when APD 180 supports only a single physical APD control channel, rather than multiple physical APDs, host base station 402, for example, allocates the physical resources of the APD control channel (e.g., wireless link 136 of fig. 1). However, a single physical APD control channel may support direct reception of APD control messages from different devices (e.g., host base station, node base station). For example, the hosting base station 402 assigns a first resource block of the APD control channel to the node base station 404 and a second resource block of the APD control channel to the hosting base station 402. Alternatively or additionally, the host base station 402 assigns a first Control Channel Element (CCE) (e.g., resource Element (RE), resource Element Group (REG)) to the host base station 402 and a second CCE to the node base station 404. For another example, the hosting base station 402 assigns a first time slot of the shared APD control channel to the hosting base station and a second time slot of the APD control channel to the node base station 404. When sharing APD control channels, the base station can include a device identifier in the APD control message. Alternatively, the hosting base station 402 assigns a particular APD control channel (of the plurality of APD control channels) to the node base station 404. However, other forms of partitioning can also be utilized, such as coding scheme partitioning, which assigns one of several coding schemes (e.g., orthogonal codes used to encode communications on APD control channels); and/or frequency division that assigns different frequency (sub-) bands of APD control channels to different entities.
At 625, the hosting base station 402 indicates the assigned APD access to the node base station 404. This can include any combination of reflected access indicating the assignment determined at 620 and/or control access of the assignment.
Diagram 600 illustrates a host base station indicating assigned APD access using low band communications (e.g., low band wireless link 440) that bypass APDs, as further described. However, in alternative embodiments, the host base station can utilize APDs to indicate assigned APD access to node base station 404, for example, by: the surface of APD is configured for host-to-node communication as depicted at 725 of fig. 7, and wireless signals are transmitted to the surface of APD 180 as depicted at 730 of fig. 7.
In general, transactions 605, 610, 615, 620, and 625 correspond to sub-graph 630 in which hosting base station 402 and node base station 404 establish assigned APD accesses. Sub-graph 630 can include alternative or additional transactions that are not shown for visual brevity.
At this point, graph 600 may proceed to at least two alternative paths: option "a" (depicted in fig. 7) or option "B" (depicted in fig. 8). Fig. 7 depicts a signaling and control transaction diagram 700 in which a node base station communicates a surface configuration directly to an APD over an APD control channel. Fig. 8 depicts a signaling and control transaction diagram 800 in which a host base station configures a surface of an APD on behalf of a node base station.
Fig. 7 continues to option "a" where, at 705, node bs 404 optionally establishes a wireless connection with UE 110. For example, as described with reference to fig. 1, the node base station 404 transmits wireless signals to (and/or receives wireless signals from) UEs, such as by: millimeter waves are typically transmitted/received in LoS with UE 110 and APD 180 (e.g., wireless link 134 of fig. 1) is not included in the communication path. In other words, node base station 404 and UE 110 exchange wireless signals without using APD surfaces (e.g., high-band communications, low-band communications that bypass APDs). In alternative embodiments, such as those described with reference to fig. 9-11, node b 404 includes APD 180 in a communication path with UE 110 (e.g., communication path 414 of fig. 4). In some aspects, node bs 404 and UE 110 establish a wireless connection by performing various procedures, such as a Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection setup procedure to establish a wireless link.
At 710, ue 110 optionally transmits first access link communications, such as control plane information and/or user plane data, to node base station 404. For illustration, assume that UE 110 transmits a registration request to node bs 404. In response to receiving the registration request, node base station 404 initiates communication with the core network through host base station 402 using the IAB link and APD 180. However, in alternative embodiments, node base station 404 determines to communicate with home base station 402 without being triggered by a request from UE 110. For example, the node base station 404 detects poor signal quality and/or channel impairments in the IAB link and determines to indicate the poor signal quality and/or channel impairments to the host base station 402.
At 715, node base station 404 configures the surface of APD 180 for node-to-host communication, which can sometimes be optional, such as when node base station 404 indicates periodic timing information and/or when node base station configures a subset of the configurable surface elements assigned to node base station 404 without time constraints (e.g., node base station has continuous access). Node base station 404 communicates the surface configuration to APD 180, for example, using control access assigned to the APD control channel (and indicated to node base station 404 at 625 of fig. 6). In various aspects, the node base station 404 transmits an identifying hosting base station 402 hosting index for the desired APD configuration, or the node base station 404 transmits node index and direction information for the desired APD configuration, as further described. Node base station 404 can indicate timing information, such as duration and periodicity time information, such that APD 180 repeatedly and periodically applies the surface configuration to the RIS corresponding to the index without other guidance. Thus, node base station 404 can indicate once periodic time information to APD 180 and avoid configuring the surface of the APD until a trigger event occurs (e.g., identifying channel impairment, change in location) when transmitting subsequent node-to-host communications. Alternatively or additionally, node base station 404 can configure a subset of the configurable surface elements assigned to node base station 404 once and avoid reconfiguring APD surfaces until a triggering event occurs. Sometimes, in a manner similar to indicating the home or node index, node base station 404 analyzes signal and/or link quality measurements for wireless signals received from home base station 402 (e.g., at 625 of fig. 6), selects a surface configuration from a surface configuration codebook, and indicates the surface configuration index to APD 180.
At 720, node base station 404 uses the IAB link and transmits a first IAB link communication to host base station 402 by transmitting a wireless signal (e.g., millimeter wave) to a surface of APD 180, as further described. To illustrate, the node base station 404 transmits control plane information to the home base station 402 associated with the IAB link, transmits control plane information associated with the access link to the UE, and/or transmits user plane data associated with the access link to the UE. For example, node base station 404 transmits wireless signals to the surface of APD 180 based on assigned reflected accesses (e.g., time-divided reflected accesses, configurable surface element divisions). In some aspects, the first IAB link communication corresponds to a request from UE 110, while in other aspects, node base station 404 may transmit a communication unrelated to the UE's access link communication, such as a Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) and/or control plane information associated with an IAB link, as further described.
At 725, the hosting base station 402 configures the surface of APD 180 for host-to-node communication, which can sometimes be optional, such as when the hosting base station 402 indicates periodic timing information. Similar to node base station 404, the hosting base station can use dispatch control access to APD control channels to communicate the surface configuration to APD 180, such as by communicating any combination of node index, direction information, and/or timing information. Alternatively or additionally, the host base station 402 analyzes signal and/or link quality measurements with respect to wireless signals received from the node base station 404, selects a surface configuration from a surface configuration codebook, and indicates a surface configuration index to the APD 180. In various aspects, host base station 402 instructs guided APD 180 to repeatedly and periodically apply the corresponding surface configuration to periodic timing information of the RIS without other guidance. Thus, the host base station can indicate periodic timing information with surface configuration once and avoid configuring the surface of the APD when transmitting subsequent host-to-node communications. Alternatively or additionally, the host base station 402 indicates the surface configuration to the APD 180 prior to each host-to-node transmission.
At 730, the hosting base station 402 uses the IAB link and transmits a second IAB link communication to the node base station by transmitting a wireless signal (e.g., millimeter wave) to a surface of APD 180. For example, the hosting base station 402 transmits wireless signals to the surface of the APD 180 based on assigned reflected accesses (e.g., time-divided reflected accesses, configurable surface element divisions) assigned to the hosting base station 402. In some aspects, the second IAB link communication corresponds to a request from UE 110 such that home base station 402 serves node base station 404 through an access core network. Alternatively or additionally, the communication transmitted by the hosting base station 402 is independent of the access link communication of the UE. Thus, at 740, the node base station optionally transmits a second access link communication to UE 110.
In general, transactions 715, 720, 725, and 730 correspond to sub-graph 735, where the hosting base station serves the node base station, and the node base station controls the surface configuration of the APD. Subgraph 730 can include alternate or additional transactions that are not shown for visual brevity. Further, while the transactions in sub-graph 735 illustrate that the hosting base station 402 responds to the first IAB link communication initiated by the node base station 404, in other aspects, the hosting base station 402 initiates the IAB link communication (e.g., does not receive the first IAB link communication from the node base station 404). To illustrate, the hosting base station 402 can initiate transmitting control plane information associated with an IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406) to the node base station 404.
Fig. 8 depicts a signaling and control transaction diagram 800 in which a host base station configures APD surfaces on behalf of a node base station. Returning to the completion of the diagram 600 of FIG. 6, the diagram can alternatively continue to option "B" depicted in FIG. 8. At 705, node base station 404 and UE 110 optionally establish a wireless connection, and at 710, the UE optionally transmits a first access link communication to the node base station.
At 805, the hosting base station 402 configures the surface of APD 180 for node-to-hosting communications, which can sometimes be optional, such as when hosting base station 402 indicates periodic timing information and/or when hosting base station configures a subset of the configurable surface elements assigned to node base station 404 without time-divided APD access. Because the hosting base station 402 determines when the node base station 404 uses the APD 180, the hosting base station 402 can synchronize and/or configure the APD surface based on the assigned APD access assigned to the node base station. When the host base station 402 configures the APD surface, the host base station may indicate periodic timing information with the surface configuration once and avoid configuring the APD surface when transmitting subsequent host-to-node communications until a trigger event occurs (e.g., identify channel impairment, change in location). As another example, the hosting base station 402 can configure a subset of the configurable surface elements allocated to the node base station 404 (without time limitation) once and avoid reconfiguring the surface until a triggering event occurs. Alternatively or additionally, the hosting base station 402 indicates the surface configuration prior to each planned node base station transmission. The hosting base station 402 can indicate a node index and/or direction to configure the surface of APD 180.
Thus, at 720, the node base station 404 transmits the first IAB link communication to the hosting base station 402 using an IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406), wherein the node base station transmits the IAB link communication based on the assigned reflected access (e.g., time division, configurable surface element division). For example, the node base station 404 directs transmissions toward a subset of the configurable surface elements and/or transmits during a first duration assigned to the node base station. By allowing the host base station to configure the APD surface, the node base station 404 can communicate with the host base station 402 using the surface of APD 180 rather than directly with APD 180 to control the surface configuration. This in turn provides the host base station with more control over the APD configuration.
At 725, the hosting base station 402 configures the surface of APD 180 for hosting to node communication, which can be optional (e.g., when the hosting base station previously indicated periodic timing information or a portion of the configured APD surface), as further described. At 730, the hosting base station 402 transmits a second IAB link communication to the node base station 404 using the IAB link and the surface of the APD. In some aspects, the second IAB link communication corresponds to a first access link communication associated with UE 110. Alternatively, the second IAB link communication is independent of the access link communication of the UE, such as Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) and/or control plane information associated with the IAB link. Thus, at 740, the node base station optionally transmits a second access link communication to UE 110.
In general, transactions 805, 720, 725, and 730 correspond to subgraph 810, where the hosting base station serves the node base station, and the hosting base station controls the surface configuration of the APD. Subgraph 810 can include alternative or additional transactions that are not shown for visual brevity. The hosting base station 402 can alternatively initiate the IAB link communication with the node base station 404, such as by transmitting control plane information associated with the IAB link to the node base station 404, similar to that described with reference to sub-graph 735.
Fig. 9 illustrates a second example of signaling and control transactions for an integrated access backhaul with an APD using a signaling and control transaction diagram 900, wherein the diagram 900 results in (c) additional signaling and control transactions, as illustrated in fig. 10, or (d) additional signaling and control transactions, as illustrated in fig. 11. Graph 900 includes signaling and control transactions between node base station 404, APD 180, home base station 402, and UE 110. Fig. 9 and 11 together illustrate an example embodiment in which a node base station communicates with a host base station over an IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406) using APD 180 and with a UE over an access link (e.g., using communication path 414).
At 630, the hosting base station 402 and the node base station 404 establish assigned APD access using similar signaling and control transactions as described with reference to fig. 6. For example, the node base station and the host base station establish a low-band connection, the node base station requests a high-band IAB link, and the host base station determines to use APD 180 in a communication path associated with the IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406). The hosting base station assigns APD access to APD 180 and indicates the assigned APD access to the node base station. This can include the host base station indicating assigned APD access to the node base station using the low band connection or using the high band connection and the surface of APD 180, as further described.
At 705, node bs 404 and UE 110 establish a wireless connection with each other, as described with reference to fig. 7. To illustrate, node base station 404 transmits wireless signals to (and/or receives wireless signals from) UEs, such as by transmitting/receiving millimeter waves with UEs 110, typically in a LoS manner, and not including APDs 180 in the communication path. Alternatively or additionally, node base station 404 and UE 110 exchange low band communications.
As part of establishing the wireless connection, and/or in response to establishing the wireless connection, the node base station 404 receives 905 a signal and/or link quality measurement. In some aspects, UE 110 transmits a measurement report to a node base station, wherein UE 110 generates the measurement report based on a downlink transmission or reference signal from node base station 404. Alternatively or additionally, node b 404 generates signals and/or link quality measurements based on uplink transmissions or sounding reference signals from UE 110.
At 910, node b 404 determines to use APD 180 to establish and/or maintain an access link to UE 110. To illustrate, the node base station 404 analyzes the measurements received at 905 and determines that the measurements indicate channel impairments, as further described. However, the node base station may determine to use APD 180 based on other factors, such as based on not receiving a response from UE 110 (not shown) when using high-band communications.
At 915, node base station 404 assigns a portion of the APD access received at 630 to an access link with UE 110. For example, the node base station determines to use a first portion of the reflected access received at 630 (and assigned by the home base station 402 to the node base station 404) for communication with the access link of the UE 110 (and using the communication path 414) and to use a second portion of the reflected access received at 630 for communication with the IAB of the home base station 402 (using the wireless link 406).
In this regard, the graph 900 can proceed to at least two alternative paths: option "C" (depicted in fig. 10) or option "D" (depicted in fig. 11). Fig. 10 depicts a signaling and control transaction diagram 1000 in which a node base station uses an APD surface for access link and IAB link communications, wherein the node base station communicates a surface configuration to an APD directly over an APD control channel. Fig. 11 depicts a signaling and control transaction diagram 1100 in which a node base station uses APD surfaces for access link and IAB link communications, wherein a host base station configures APD surfaces on behalf of the node base station.
Fig. 10 continues to option "C" where, at 1005, the node base station configures the APD surface for access link communications (e.g., using communication path 414). For example, the node base station 404 uses the signal and/or link quality measurements described with reference to fig. 4 and 5 to analyze the surface configuration codebook or LUT and select a surface configuration from the surface configuration codebook for access link communications. Alternatively or additionally, node bs 404 uses the estimated location of UE 110 to select a surface configuration, such as by querying the core network or access history, as further described. For example, the UE indicates the estimated location to a node base station (not shown), and/or node base station 404 uses signal and/or link quality measurements (e.g., power level, angle of departure or arrival, and/or timing information (e.g., observed time of arrival) for uplink or downlink communications with UE 110) to generate the estimated location. In various aspects, node base station 404 uses control access (e.g., APD control channel) assigned to the assignment of node base station 404 to indicate the surface configuration index to APD 180. Additionally, the node base station optionally indicates timing information (e.g., periodic timing information, dynamic timing information, duration) to APD 180.
At 1010, node base station 404 indicates an access link APD access allocation to UE 110. In other words, the node base station 404 indicates the access link APD access allocation determined by the node base station at 915. To illustrate, the node base station indicates timing information and directs UE 110 to use the surface of the APD based on the timing information. For another example, node b 404 may optionally indicate a subset of the configurable surface elements to UE 110 and direct UE 110 to direct transmissions toward the subset of the configurable surface elements. In some aspects, as illustrated in diagram 1000, node base station 404 indicates access link APD assignments to UE 110 using high-band wireless signals transmitted to the surface of APD 180 and/or by using low-band communications (e.g., low-band communications established at 705).
In 1015, UE 110 transmits a first access link communication (e.g., control plane information associated with the access link, user plane data associated with the access link) to node base station 404 using the surface of the APD (e.g., by transmitting wireless signals to the surface of APD 180) in a manner similar to that described at 710 of fig. 7. To illustrate, UE 110 transmits a registration request, uplink user data, a non-access stratum (NAS) authentication message, and the like. In various aspects, the UE transmits the first access link communication based on the access link APD access allocation indicated at 1010, such as by transmitting to a subset of the configurable surface elements and/or based on the timing information. In response to receiving the communication from UE 110, node base station 404 determines to communicate with home base station 402 using the IAB link and APD.
At 735, the host base station uses the APD to service the node base station, such as by using similar signaling and control transactions as described with reference to fig. 7. This can include node base station 404 configuring the surface of APD 180 for node-to-host communication (optionally) using control access to the dispatch of APD 180. For example, the hosting base station 402 and the node base station 404 communicate using the wireless link 406 described and illustrated with reference to FIG. 4.
At 1020, the node base station optionally configures an APD surface for access link communications. For illustration, assume that at 1005 node base station 404 does not indicate periodic timing information to APD 180. Because node base station 404 does not configure APD 180 to periodically apply access link surface configuration, node base station 404 (re) configures the APD surface for access link communications at 1020, such as by: the index mapped to an entry in the surface configuration codebook is transmitted in a manner similar to that described at 1005 and/or with reference to fig. 5. Alternatively, assume that at node 1005 the base station indicates periodic timing information to APD 180. In this scenario, APD 180 periodically configures the surface for access link communications and the node base station does not need to reconfigure the surface at 1020.
In 1025, node b 404 transmits a second access link communication to UE 110 in a manner similar to that described at 740 of fig. 7, wherein the node b uses the surface of APD 180. To illustrate, the node base station 404 transmits the second access link communication using the communication path 414 of fig. 4. In other words, node base station 404 communicates a response by transmitting a wireless signal to the APD surface and accessing based on the access link APD.
Fig. 11 continues to option "D" where the host base station configures the APD surface for access link communications between the node base station and the UE. At 805, the host base station optionally configures the APD surface for node-to-host communication, as described with reference to fig. 8.
At 1105, the node base station indicates access link APD configuration information to the hosting base station. For illustration, and similar to that described at 1005 of fig. 10, node b 404 determines a surface configuration for access link communications and/or a portion of APD access for access link communications. Thus, the node base station transmits APD configuration information (e.g., surface configuration, part of APD access for access link communications) using the surface of the APD and the IAB link, as further described.
At 1110, the hosting base station 402 directs the APD to configure the APD surface using the access link configuration information. To illustrate, the host base station 402 transmits an index that maps to entries in a surface configuration codebook and/or indicates timing information. In some aspects, the access link surface configuration corresponds to a subset of the configurable surface elements.
At 1010, the node base station indicates an access link APD access allocation to UE 110. At 1015, ue 110 transmits a first access link communication (e.g., control plane information associated with the access link, user plane data associated with the access link) to node base station 404.
At 810, the hosting base station 402 serves a node base station, as described with reference to fig. 8. Here, the host base station 402 (optionally) configures the surface of APD 180 on behalf of the node base station 404 as needed.
At 1115, the hosting base station 402 optionally configures an APD surface for access link communications between the node base station 404 and the UE 110, such as in the case 1110 the hosting base station does not indicate periodic timing information to the APD. Based on the access link APD access, node base station 404 transmits a second access link communication to UE 110 using the surface of the APD, 1025, as described with reference to fig. 10.
Fig. 12 illustrates a third example of signaling and control transactions for an integrated access backhaul with an APD using a signaling and control transaction diagram 1200. In various aspects, the host base station determines an update of a surface configuration that configures APD surfaces used in the IAB communication path, as further described. The signaling and control transactions illustrated by diagram 1200 can be used in conjunction with any of the features described with reference to fig. 1-11.
At 630, the hosting base station 402 and the node base station 404 establish assigned APD access using similar signaling and control transactions as described with reference to fig. 6. For example, the node base station and the host base station establish a low band control signaling connection, the node base station requests a high band IAB link, and the host base station determines to use APD 180 in a communication path associated with the IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406). The hosting base station assigns APD access to APD 180 and indicates the assigned APD access to the node base station. This can include the host base station indicating assigned APD access to the node base station using the low band connection or using the high band connection and the surface of APD 180, as further described.
At a later point in time, node b 404 optionally detects channel impairments in the IAB link at 1205. For example, the node base station 404 analyzes the transmissions received from the host base station 402 by the IAB (e.g., the received transmissions as described at 730 of fig. 7), such as by generating signals regarding the transmissions and/or link quality vehicles and determining that the measurements are below (or tend to be below) a threshold. In response to detecting the channel impairment, node base station 404 indicates the channel impairment to host base station 402 by transmitting a wireless signal to the surface of APD 180 and based on the assigned access determined at 630. When the node base station 404 does not detect channel impairments, the node base station 404 does not transmit an indication at 1210, thereby making the signaling/control transaction 1210 optional.
At 1215, the host base station 402 detects channel impairments. In some aspects, the host base station detects channel impairments by receiving an indication from the node base station transmitted at 1210. Alternatively or additionally, the host base station analyzes the transmissions received from the node base station 404 by the IAB (e.g., the received transmissions as described at 720 of fig. 7), such as by: signal and/or link quality measurements are generated for the transmission and the measurements are determined to be below (or tend to be below) a threshold.
Based on detecting the channel impairment, the host base station 402 initiates a beam scanning process by directing the node base station 404 and APD 180 to perform the beam scanning process at 1220. This can include the host base station 402 initiating a full beam scanning process associated with sweeping all of the surface configurations in a set of surface configurations (e.g., a set of surface configurations that cover the entire range of predetermined reflection angles), or initiating a partial beam scanning process sweeping a subset of the surface configurations of the set of surface configurations. To illustrate, the host base station 402 can initiate a full beam scanning process in which the APD 180 applies a full sequence of surface configurations corresponding to a wide beam scanning pattern. The wide beam scanning mode configures the RIS to reflect the incident beam such that the reflected beam widely spans or scans a region of space (e.g., about 150 to 30 degrees over the duration of the beam scanning process, about 10 to 3 points on the clock face). In other words, the entire sequence of surface configurations corresponds to a set of phase vectors in the surface configuration codebook, where each phase vector corresponds to a respective reflection angle. For another example, the hosting base station 402 can initiate a partial beam scanning process in which the APD 180 applies a subset of the surface configurations from the full sequence such that the (resulting) partial beam scanning pattern configuration RIS scans the reflected beam over a smaller spatial area (e.g., about 90 degrees to 60 degrees, about 12 points to 1 point on the clock face).
In various aspects, the home base station 402 selects a beam scanning mode based on location information associated with the node base station 404. For example, assume that the home base station 402 does not have location information for the node base station 404. In this case, the home base station 402 may select a full beam scanning mode to increase the likelihood of locating the node base station 404. For another example, assume that the home base station 402 has an estimated location of the node base station 404. Using the estimated position, the home base station 402 can select a partial beam scanning pattern centered on the estimated position to quickly select a surface configuration by performing a shorter beam scanning pattern with fewer surface configurations in the sequence.
For illustration, it is assumed that APD 180 stores a phase scan and/or beam scan codebook that indicates the order of surface configurations that are cycled through at APD (e.g., a first phase vector applied in a sequence for a first duration, a second phase vector applied in a sequence for a second duration, etc.). After synchronizing node base station 404 and APD 180 to perform the beam scanning process, host base station 402 transmits high-band wireless signal(s), such as a beamformed signal (e.g., a reference signal), to the APD surface at 1225. APDs configure APD surfaces based on the order (and/or duration) of the surface configuration. At 1230, node b 404 generates a measurement report based on the different surface configurations applied at the APD surfaces. For example, the node base station generates signal quality measurements, such as generating a first signal quality measurement based on a transmission received over a first duration when APD 180 applies a first surface configuration to the APD surface, generating a second signal quality measurement based on a transmission received over a second duration when APD 180 applies a second surface configuration to the APD surface, and so on. Alternatively or additionally, as part of the beam scanning process and as described with reference to fig. 13, node b 404 transmits SRS to the surface of APD 180.
At 715, node base station 404 optionally configures the APD surface for node-to-host communication, as described with reference to fig. 7. For example, node base station 404 indicates a home index or node index, and optionally direction information, to APD 180. Alternatively, host base station 402 can optionally configure APD surfaces (not shown in fig. 12), as depicted at 805 of fig. 8. At 1235, the node base station transmits the measurement report generated at 1230 to the host base station, such as by transmitting the measurement report over the IAB link and using the surface of the APD.
In general, transactions 1225, 1230, 715, and 1235 correspond to sub-graph 1240, where hosting base station 402, APD 180, and node base station 404 perform a beam scanning process using APDs and transmissions from the hosting base station to the node base station. Sub-graph 1240 can include alternative or additional transactions that are not illustrated in fig. 12 for visual brevity. For example, sub-graph 1240 can alternatively or additionally include a transaction as described with reference to fig. 13, wherein the hosting base station receives the transmissions from the node base station.
At 1245, the hosting base station 402 determines an updated surface configuration for APD 180 that configures the APD surface for IAB link communications (e.g., node-to-hosting transmission, hosting-to-node transmission). For example, the host base station analyzes the measurement report received at 1235 and identifies a surface configuration update by selecting a surface configuration with an acceptable measurement report. To illustrate, the host base station analyzes the measurement report to identify a surface configuration (of the plurality of surface configurations applied by the APD during the beam scanning process) that has the best measurement report relative to other surface configurations (e.g., the surface configuration with the highest signal quality measurement).
At 1250, host base station 402 directs the APD to update the surface configuration codebook and/or LUT with the updated surface configuration determined at 1245. For example, the host base station 402 communicates (e.g., using wireless link 136) the updated surface configuration (determined by the host base station at 1245) to APD 180, e.g., by: the indication points to a pattern index of the surface configuration applied in the (full or partial) sequence corresponding to the updated surface configuration. Alternatively or additionally, the hosting base station 402 transmits the node index value to the APD 180. The host base station 402 implicitly or explicitly directs APD 180 to use the node index to locate an entry in the surface configuration codebook and to update the entry with the updated surface configuration (indicated by the mode index). In response to receiving the guidance, APD 180 updates 1255 entries in the surface configuration codebook and/or LUT.
Fig. 13 illustrates a signaling and control transaction diagram 1300 that includes alternative or additional signaling and control traffic that can be used to implement sub-graph 1240 of fig. 12 for various aspects of an integrated access backhaul utilizing APDs. Thus, sub-graph 1240 illustrated by diagram 1300 includes alternative or additional transactions that can be combined with or substituted for the signaling and control transactions of sub-graph 1240 illustrated by diagram 1200.
The diagram 1300 begins at 1305, where the node base station 404 optionally initiates a beam scanning procedure. For example, suppose the diagram 1300 begins after 1220 of fig. 12 (not shown in fig. 13). In various aspects, at 1220, the hosting base station 402 can initiate a first beam scanning procedure (e.g., diagram 1200) corresponding to the hosting base station 402 transmitting signals to the APD 180, and the directing node base station 404 initiates a second beam scanning procedure in which the node base station 404 transmits signals to the APD 180. Thus, in a manner similar to that described at 1220, node b 404 optionally initiates a beam scanning process, such as a full beam scanning process and/or a partial beam scanning process, at 1305, as further described. Alternatively or additionally, at 1220, the host base station 402 synchronizes the node base station 404 and APD 180 to perform the beam scanning process described by diagram 1300.
At 1310, node base station 404 transmits wireless signal(s) (e.g., beamformed wireless reference signals) to the APD surface. APD configures the APD surface based on the order (and/or duration) of the surface configurations, and at 1315, the host base station 402 uses the transmissions received at the host base station and generates measurement reports based on the different surface configurations applied at the APD surface. For example, the host base station generates signal quality measurements, such as generating a first signal quality measurement based on a transmission received over a first duration when APD 180 applies a first surface configuration to the APD surface, generating a second signal quality measurement based on a transmission received over a second duration when APD 180 applies a second surface configuration to the APD surface, and so on.
Fig. 14 illustrates a fourth example of signaling and control transactions for an integrated access backhaul with an APD using a signaling and control transaction diagram 1400. The diagram 1400 includes signaling and control transactions between the first node base station 404, APD 180, the host base station 402, and the second node base station 418. In various aspects, the first node base station 404 uses a first IAB link (e.g., wireless link 406 of fig. 4) with the host base station to serve a second node base station 418 that uses a second IAB link (e.g., using communication path 420 of fig. 4). The signaling and control transactions illustrated by diagram 1400 can be used in combination with any of the features described with reference to fig. 1-13.
At 630, the hosting base station 402 and the first node base station 404 establish assigned APD access using similar signaling and control transactions as described with reference to fig. 6. For example, the first node base station and the host base station establish a low band connection, the first node base station (optionally) requests a high band IAB link, and the host base station determines to use APD 180 in a communication path associated with the IAB link. The hosting base station assigns APD access to APD 180 and indicates the assigned APD access to the node base station. This can include the host base station indicating to the node base station the assigned APD access using the low band connection or using the high band connection and the surface of APD 180, as further described.
At 1405, the second node base station 418 establishes a low band connection with the first node base station 404. To illustrate, the second node base station 418 (or the first node base station 404) identifies that the high-band communication (e.g., millimeter waves) with the first node base station (or the second node base station 418) has poor quality, such as by: signal or link quality measurements associated with high-band communications are analyzed and it is determined that these measurements have fallen below an acceptable performance threshold. As another example, the second node base station 418 fails to receive a response from the first node base station 404 after transmitting a request using high frequency communications (or vice versa). In response to identifying that the high-band communication has poor quality (or fails to receive a response), the second node base station 242 and the first node base station 404 establish a wireless low-band connection to the first node base station 404. In some aspects, the second node base station 418 indicates the location information to the first node base station 404 using a low band connection (not shown), such as by transmitting GNSS and/or GPS location information. In establishing the wireless low-band connection, the first node base station 404 and the second node base station 418 bypass the surface of the APD as long as the base stations are not actively configuring the surface of the APD nor are they transmitting signals to the APD surface with the intent to reflect and/or redirect wireless signals, as further described.
At 1410, the second node base station 418 optionally requests a high band IAB link with the first node base station 404. For example, the second node base station 418 transmits a request to the first node base station 404 by using the low band connection established at 1405 and bypassing the APD in a manner similar to that described at 610 of fig. 6. In an alternative aspect, the first node base station 404 determines to establish the high-band IAB with the second node base station 418 without receiving the request.
At 1415, the first node base station assigns a portion of the APD access received at 630 (and assigned to the first node base station 404 by the hosting base station 402) to a second IAB link with the second node base station 418. For example, the first node base station 404 determines that a first portion of the reflected access received at 630 is to be used for communication with the IAB of the host base station 402 (using a first IAB link) and a second portion of the reflected access is to be used for communication with the IAB of the second node base station 418 (using a second IAB link). Sometimes, the first node base station 404 may allocate a third portion of the reflected access to access link communications with the UE (not shown in fig. 14) in a manner similar to that described with reference to fig. 9-11.
At 1420, first node base station 404 and/or host base station 402 configures an APD surface of APD 180 for communication associated with the second IAB link. In some aspects, the first node base station 404 directly configures the APD surface, for example, in a manner similar to that described at 715 of fig. 7 and 1005 of fig. 10. In other aspects, the host base station 402 configures the APD surface on behalf of the first node base station, such as in a manner similar to that described at 1105 and 1110 of fig. 11.
At 1425, the first node base station 404 indicates the second backhaul link APD access to the second node base station 418. For example, in a manner similar to that described at 1010 of fig. 10, the first node base station 404 indicates a subset of the configurable surface elements and/or timing information to the second node base station 418. In some aspects, as illustrated in diagram 1400, node base station 404 indicates a second backhaul link APD access allocation to second node base station 418 by transmitting a wireless signal to a surface of APD 180.
At 1430, the second node base station 418 transmits the first second IAB link communication (e.g., control plane information, user plane data) to the first node base station 404 using the second IAB link (e.g., using the communication path 420). Sometimes the second node base station bases the first second IAB link communication on an access link with a UE (e.g., UE 424) served by the second node base station (not shown), and at other times the second node base station 418 does not base the first second IAB link communication on an access link communication with the UE.
The host base station 402 uses signaling and control transactions similar to those described at 735 of fig. 7 or 810 of fig. 8 to serve the first node base station 404. Thus, the host base station 402 can serve the first node base station 404 by (optionally) controlling the surface configuration of the APD 180 or by (optionally) controlling the surface configuration of the APD 180 by the first node base station 404.
At 1435, the first node base station 404 and/or the host base station 402 optionally configures the surface of the APD for second backhaul link communication using signaling and control transactions similar to those described at 1020 of fig. 10 or 1115 of fig. 11. At 1440, first node base station 404 transmits a second IAB link communication to second node base station 418 using the second IAB link and a surface of APD 180, as further described.
Example methods of integrated access backhaul with APDs
With reference to fig. 15, 16, and 17, and in accordance with one or more aspects of integrated backhaul access using APDs, example methods 1500, 1600, and 1700 are described. Fig. 15 illustrates an example method 1500 for using an APD to perform aspects of integrated backhaul access, such as a hosting base station assigning access to the APD for use in an IAB link with a node base station. In some embodiments, the operations of method 1500 are performed by host base station 402, as described with reference to any one of fig. 1-14.
At 1505, the host base station determines to include an APD for the wireless backhaul link in the communication path with the node base station. For example, the hosting base station 402 determines to include the APD 180 in the communication path with the node base station 404, as described at 615 of fig. 6.
At 1510, the hosting base station assigns APD access to the node base station, e.g., assigned APD access for communication over the wireless backhaul link using APD. For example, the hosting base station 402 assigns the reflected access and/or the control access to the node base station 404, as described in 620 of fig. 6.
At 1515, the host base station communicates with the node base station over a wireless backhaul link using the surface of the APD and based on the assigned APD access, e.g., by exchanging wireless signals using the surface. For example, the host base station 402 communicates with the node base station 404 as described in 735 of fig. 7, 10, and 14 and/or as described in 810 of fig. 8, 11, and 14.
Fig. 16 illustrates an example method 1600 for using APDs to perform aspects of integrated backhaul access, such as a node base station receiving dispatch access to an APD for use in an IAB link with a host base station. In some implementations, the operations of method 1600 are performed by node b 404, as described with reference to any of fig. 1-15.
At 1605, the node base station determines to establish a wireless backhaul link with the home base station. To illustrate, the node base station 404 determines to establish a wireless backhaul link with the host base station 402, as depicted at 605 and/or 610 of fig. 6.
At 1610, the node base station receives an assigned APD access to the APD from the host base station, the assigned APD access including at least an assigned reflection access to the APD surface. To illustrate, node base station 404 receives assigned reflected access and/or control access to APD 180 from host base station 402, as depicted at 625 of fig. 6.
At 1615, the node base station uses the surface of the APD and communicates with the host base station over a wireless backhaul link based on the assigned APD access, such as by exchanging wireless signals with the host base station using the surface. For illustration, the node base station 404 communicates with the host base station 402 as described in 735 of fig. 7, 10, and 14 and/or as described in 810 of fig. 8, 11, or 14.
Fig. 17 illustrates an example method 1700 for performing aspects of integrated backhaul access using APDs, such as APDs using node index information configuration surfaces. In some implementations, the operations of method 1700 are performed by APD 180, as described with reference to any of fig. 1-16.
At 1705, the APD receives an indication of a node index from the base station over an APD control channel. To illustrate, APD 180 receives a node index from either host base station 402 or node base station 404, as described in 735 of fig. 7, 10, and 14 and/or 810 of fig. 8, 11, and 14.
At 1710, the apd uses the node index to identify the surface configuration. For example, APD 180 identifies a surface configuration, as described with reference to fig. 7, 10, and 14 at 735, with reference to fig. 8, 11, and 14 at 810, and/or as described with reference to fig. 4 and 5.
At 1715, the APD modifies a surface of the APD using the surface configuration. For example, APD 180 modifies the surface of the APD as described with reference to fig. 7, 10, and 14 at 735, with reference to fig. 8, 11, and 14 at 810, and/or as described with reference to fig. 4 and 5.
The order in which the method blocks of methods 1500, 1600, and 1700 are described is not intended to be construed as a limitation, and any number of the described method blocks can be skipped or combined in any order to implement a method or alternative method.
