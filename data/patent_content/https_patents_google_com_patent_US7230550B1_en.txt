- This invention generally relates to encoding and decoding an information signal.
- the invention relates to a method for information signal encoding and decoding using combinatorial and concatenation codes.
- CDMA code division multiple access
- variable rate speech codec and specifically a Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) codec for use in communication systems compatible with IS-95, is defined in the document (TIA/EIA/IS-127) entitled “Enhanced Variable Rate Codec, Speech Service Option 3 for Wideband Spread Spectrum Digital Systems” (1997), published by the Electronics Industries Association (EIA), 2500 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va., 22201.

- a method for encoding a speech signal using factorial packing is described in “Factorial Packing Method and Apparatus for Information Coding”, U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,960 by Peng et al., issued May 22, 2001.
- This speech coder utilizes four characteristics to uniquely describe any given pulse combination: number of degenerate pulses, signs of pulses, positions of non-zero pulses, and pulse magnitudes.
- a four-stage iterative classification of the pulse combination is performed, starting with the number of non-zero pulses and then determining the remaining parameters.
- the most significant bits in FP have most of the information about the number of non-zero pulses, while the least significant bits have primarily sign information showing a partial segregation of constituent information in FP. There is no complete segregation in this method, and therefore an error in the central bits does not always ensure that the number of degenerate pulses can be decoded correctly.
- the pyramid vector quantization (PVQ) method as described by Fischer, “A Pyramid Vector Quantizer”, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. IT-32, July 1986, pp. 568-583, is an example of an enumeration method.
- the enumeration technique may be very sensitive to bit errors.
- Hung et al., in the article “Error-Resilient Pyramid Vector Quantization for Image Compression”, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 7, October 1998, pp. 1373-1386 proposed some PVQ enumeration methods that are less sensitive to bit errors than those proposed by Fischer.

- addition and multiplication functions would not be used to combine constituent codewords into a complete codeword, as these operations may add to the complexity of the coding process, and also tend to decrease segregation.
- the codeword should be formed by a concatenation of the constituent codewords, thus maintaining complete information segregation for higher error resilience.
- a method for coding an information signal based on parameters inherent to the information signal is described in “Method and Apparatus for Coding an Information Signal”, U.S. Pat. No. 6,141,638, W. Peng and J. Ashley, issued Oct. 31, 2000.
- the method selects one of a plurality of configurations based on predetermined parameters related to the information signal, each of the plurality of configurations having a codebook; and searches the codebook over the length of an excitation vector which is shorter than a sub-frame length, to determine a codebook index from the codebook corresponding to the selected configuration; and transmits the predetermined parameters and the codebook index to a destination.

The multi-precision operations can be computationally demanding with excess precision and can result in high-bit error sensitive combined codewords.
- a concatenation method can append two or more long codewords together to form a combined codeword which generally does not require multiply and divide operations.
- the concatenation technique generally requires more bits than the combinational technique and is not as efficient with regard to the number of bits required to represent the combined codeword.

- MSP most significant bits part
- LSP least significant bits part
- the method can further include splitting one or more additional codewords for producing one or more MSPs and one or more LSPs, combining a MSP of the first codeword with the one or more MSPs of the one or more additional codewords for producing a first group, concatenating a LSP of the first codeword with the one or more LSPs of the one or more additional codewords for producing a second group, and multiplexing the first group and the second group to form the multiplexed codeword.
- a bit-length for the first group and a bit-length of the second group can be precomputed to reduce a computational complexity and increase a bit-error robustness of the combining codewords.
- the precomputing can include determining a number of codewords to include in the first group, determining a number of most significant bits (MSBs) in the codewords, computing a plurality of maximal values for the MSPs of the first group based on the MSBs, multiplying together the plurality of maximal values for producing a product, and determining a bit-length of the product.
- a bit-length of the multiplexed codeword can be set equal to or less than a combined bit-length by selecting the bit-length for the one or more MSPs. For example, a bit-length for the one or more MSPs can be selected that minimizes a bit-length of the first group to reduce a computational complexity and reduce bit-sensitivity.
- a higher proportion of error protection can be assigned to the first group than the second group to reduce bit-sensitivities.
- One advantage of the method is that bit-errors in the second group only correspond to decoding errors in a codeword associated with the LSP of the second group. That is, any bit-errors in the LSPs do not affect the decoding of other codewords.

- Huffman Coding can be employed to generate the one or more factorial packed codewords.
- the method can further include calculating a maximal value for both the C ⁇ MSB and the C ⁇ MSB for the plurality of factorial packed codewords, and multiplying together the maximal values of the plurality of factorial packed codewords to produce a first portion of C ⁇ .
- the first portion of C ⁇ can be multiplied by left shift by a number of bits corresponding to the bit-length of the second group.
- a bit-length of the C ⁇ LSP and a bit-length of the C ⁇ LSP can be included in a power term providing the left shift.

- an example of the method 200 is briefly presented in contrast to the conventional concatenation coding and conventional combinational coding.
- the example is provided in the context of a CELP based speech coding system.
- the inventive aspects are not herein limited to CELP coding and can be applied to other forms of speech coding such as AMR, AMBE, VSELP, ACELP, and the like.
- a speech frame of length 160 samples (20 ms) can be divided into 3 subframes of length 53, 53, and 54 samples.
- a factorial packing method is used to code the FCB excitation in each of the three subframes. For example, a 6 pulse factorial packing codebook is used for the coding purposes.
- the number of bits to code an FCB excitation using a 6 pulse factorial packing codebook in the three subframes is determined from a table to be 31, 31, and 32 bits, respectively. That is, the three codewords C 1 , C 2 and C 3 ( 110 ) are of length 31, 31, and 32. Directly concatenating the three codewords using a concatenational coder requires 94 bits. Alternatively, a combinational coder such as that described in EQ (1) can generate a uniquely decodable codeword using 93 bits. However, the combinational method requires 93 bit multiplications during encoding and 93 bit divisions during decoding.
- the method 200 can code the constituent codewords into a uniquely decodable multiplexed codeword which requires only 93 bits. Furthermore, only 24 bit multiplication and 24 bit division are required in the method 200 instead of the 93 bit multiplication and 93 bit divisions required in a combinational coding.
- a bit-error in a second part of a codeword only causes an error in the decoding of that codeword.
- the erroneous decoding is limited to the constituent codeword.
- the 23 bits of the first group can be chosen to have better error protection than the 70 bits of the second group.
- the multiplex coder 100 can include error protection to decrease coding errors on selected bits.
- a first error protection unit 135 can be coupled to the output of the combiner 130 for protecting the first group 132 , G.
- a second error protection unit 145 can be coupled to the output of the concatenator 140 for protecting bits of the second group 134 , H.
- the first error protection unit 135 and the second error protection unit 145 can be the same unit, and are shown as distinct units for purposes of illustration.
- the error protection unit can be directly applied to the multiplexed codeword or to stages involved with the multiplexing for applying error protection.
- the first group 132 can be allocated higher error protection than the second group.
- a bit error in a second part of the second group results in an erroneous decoding only for the codeword associated with the second part.
- a bit error in a first part of the first group can result in erroneous decoding for the set of M codewords.
- higher error protection can be applied to the first group that the second group to limit the erroneous decoding of more than one codewords. For example, if only 3 bits of protection are provided, and the first part (MSB) of each codeword is 3 bits, then all the protection can be applied to the first group to ensure that erroneous decodings are limited to single codewords.
- the decoder 400 can include a splitter 410 for partitioning a multiplexed codeword into a first group and one or more LSPs, a decombiner 420 for partitioning the first group into one or more MSBs, and one or more concatenate units 430 for concatenating the one or more first parts with the one or more second parts.
- a multiplexed codeword 150 can be received by a device hosting the decoder 400 .
- the device can be a radio, a cell phone, a communications device or any other device capable of receiving a multiplexed codeword.
- the device can include a radio frequency modulation unit for extracting the multiplexed codeword from a communications signal.
- the splitter 410 can split the codeword into the first group, G 132 , and the LSPs H 1 , H 2 , H 3 of the second group H, 134
- the decombiner 132 can partition the first group, G 132 , into one or more MSBs G 1 , G 2 , G 3 of the one or more code words C 1 , C 2 , C 3 .
- the concatenate units 420 can concatenate each MSB 112 with a corresponding LSP 114 for producing the codeword 110 .
- a Code Excited Linear Predictive (CELP) speech coding system employing a factorial packing (FP) method can be considered for coding a fixed codebook (FCB) excitation of a speech signal in accordance with the invention.
- the speech signal can represented as an excitation signal and a source signal.
- the source signal can represent changes of the speech spectral envelope
- the excitation can represent the fine spectral envelope, such as the pitch.
- the excitation sequence can be represented by a series of pulses spaced at intervals corresponding to the pitch of the spoken voice.
- the pulse excitation parameters can include the number of pulses, the sign of the pulses, the position of the pulses, and the magnitude of the pulses.
- the factorial packing method can encode a fixed codebook excitation by representing the excitation as a combined sequence of these pulse parameters.
- the number of factorial packing codewords depends on the number of subframes in a speech frame.
- a speech frame can be represented by three or four factorial packing codewords.
- the length of these codewords can be between 35 to 60 bits.
- Combining the factorial packing codewords of all the subframes of a given frame to form a single combined codeword may require multi-precision (precision of 100 bit or more) multiply and divide operations. These operations can be complex and can result in a combined codeword that may more sensitive to bit errors. Accordingly, the method 200 can be employed to reduce the number of multi-precision multiply and divide operations.
- Factorial packing is an efficient method of representing FCB excitation wherein the FCB excitation is coded using a fixed number of unit magnitude pulses.
- any combination of unit magnitude pulses on a given subframe of length (n) can be described by the following basic properties: (i) Number of non-zero or occupied positions (v), (ii) Location of non-zero positions in track ( ⁇ ), (iii) Magnitude or number of unit magnitude pulses in each non-zero position ( ⁇ ), and (iv) Signs of pulses in non-zero positions ( ⁇ ).
- F(n, v) be the combinations of v non-zero positions in a subframe of length n and D(m, v) be the combinations of placing m unit magnitude pulses in v non-zero positions.
- the codeword C v for number of non-zero positions v is given by EQ (7):
- the factorial packing codeword is formed by first combining the codeword C ⁇ for position ⁇ , codeword C ⁇ for magnitude ⁇ , and codeword C ⁇ for sign ⁇ using EQ (1).
- the combined codeword can be added with C v to form a factorial packing codeword.
- the lengths of C ⁇ and C ⁇ are sufficiently large and hence combining them may require multi-precision multiply and divide operations.
- Prior art methods such as PVQ and HCFP can avoid these multi-precision operations. However, these methods may require additional bits and are not as efficient as factorial packing. Accordingly, the method 200 can be extended for factorial packed codewords.
- the method can include the steps of determining a plurality of pulse parameters based on the sequence of pulses, and generating the combined codeword from one or more factorial packed codewords.
- embodiments of the invention herein concern combinations of codewords, which can be advantageously applied for the combination of C ⁇ and C ⁇ to generate a bit-error robust factorial packing codeword.
- the term combinations can include linear combinations and multiplexing.
- G ⁇ and G ⁇ be the MSB parts (MSP) of C ⁇ and C ⁇ , and g ⁇ (v) and g ⁇ (v) be their respective lengths.
- G ⁇ max (v) and G ⁇ max (v) can be defined as the maximum of G ⁇ and G ⁇ . Accordingly, the MSB parts G ⁇ and G ⁇ can be combined using EQ (3) and then concatenated with LSB parts along with codeword for sign, C ⁇ . The combined codeword thus formed is summed with the codeword for the number of non-zero positions, C v . In particular, the codeword for v, is now given by EQ (8):
- the length of the MSB part determines the complexity and the bit error sensitivity.
- the complexity and the coding process increase with an increase in the bit-length of the MSB.
- the bit error sensitivity also increases as the bit-length of the MSB increases. Accordingly, the length of the MSB parts are selected to be smallest such that the codeword length N obtained in EQ (10) is identical to the length of codeword in a standard factorial packing method.
- h ⁇ (v) and h ⁇ (v) can be chosen to be a number not less than that one obtained in EQ (9) and provided that the bit-lengths do not increase the total bit-length, N, in EQ (10) for the computation of C v and N.
- This can improve bit segregation and can consequently improve error robustness.
- a further inspection of EQ (8) reveals how the choice of h ⁇ (v) and h ⁇ (v) can improve the bit segregation property.
- the term 2 i+h ⁇ (i)+h ⁇ (i) in EQ (8) provides a left shift of i+h ⁇ (i)+h ⁇ (i), thereby forcing the i+h ⁇ (i)+h ⁇ (i) least significant bits in the summation of EQ (8) to be equal to zero.
- the power term includes a summation of a bit-length of the C ⁇ LSB part and a bit-length of the C ⁇ LSB part. That is, the first portion of C ⁇ is multiplied by a power term of 2 to left shift the value of C ⁇ by a number of bits corresponding to the bit-length of the second group.
- h ⁇ (i) and h ⁇ (i) can be chosen such that the minimum value of i+h ⁇ (i)+h ⁇ (i) over all i is as large as possible and N in EQ (10) does not increase.
- a metric can be defined to impose a limit on the bit-length of the factorial packed codeword as shown in EQ (11):
- K max h ⁇ , h ⁇ ⁇ ( min i ⁇ ( i + h ⁇ ⁇ ( i ) + h ⁇ ⁇ ( i ) ) ) ( 11 ) EQ (11) ensures that that N in EQ (10) does not increase. Accordingly, the choice of h ⁇ (v) and h ⁇ (v) will make C v independent of the K LSB bits. Hence, bit errors in K LSB bits will not result in erroneous decoding of v.
- Huffman Coding can be incorporated with the generating of the one or more factorial packed codewords to encode the number of non-zero positions.
- One of the motivations and benefits of using a Huffman code is the segregation of constituent information, with increased robustness to bit errors.
- the bits may be classified into groups on the basis of their sensitivity to bit errors, and then may use better channel error protection for bits that are more sensitive, and less channel error protection for bits that are less sensitive.
- Huffman code bits may be sensitive to bit errors and use of shorter length Huffman codes may reduce the number of sensitive bits.
- a Huffman code is desirable in that the length of the longest Huffman code is smallest, and at the same time the length L of the complete codeword C is not lengthened.
- the present embodiments of the invention can be realized in hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software. Any kind of computer system or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein are suitable.
- a typical combination of hardware and software can be a mobile communications device with a computer program that, when being loaded and executed, can control the mobile communications device such that it carries out the methods described herein.
- Portions of the present method and system may also be embedded in a computer program product, which comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods described herein and which when loaded in a computer system, is able to carry out these methods.
Abstract
Description
where φ is the combined codeword that ranges between
which may be less than L, the number of bits of the concatenated codeword. In practice, the combined codewords can be sent over a communication channel which can be decoded to produce information represented by the original codewords. The original codewords, C1 . . . CM, can be obtained from the combined codeword, EQ (1), from an iterative decoding process. The encoding can require M multiply operations and the decoding can require M divide operations, yielding a total of 2M operations. This may not be a concern when the lengths Ii of the constituent codewords Ci are small. However, Ii may be large (larger than 40 bits) for codewords in certain situations which can require a significant computational processing requirements. EQ (1) is a bit efficient coding method for creating combined codewords that requires multi-precision divide and multiply operations. However, a bit error at any location of the combined codeword using EQ (1) may result in decoding error in several or all of the constituent codewords C1 . . . CM, making the method very sensitive to bit errors.

The length of the MSB part determines the complexity and the bit error sensitivity. The complexity and the coding process increase with an increase in the bit-length of the MSB. The bit error sensitivity also increases as the bit-length of the MSB increases. Accordingly, the length of the MSB parts are selected to be smallest such that the codeword length N obtained in EQ (10) is identical to the length of codeword in a standard factorial packing method.
EQ (11) ensures that that N in EQ (10) does not increase. Accordingly, the choice of hπ(v) and hμ(v) will make Cv independent of the K LSB bits. Hence, bit errors in K LSB bits will not result in erroneous decoding of v.
