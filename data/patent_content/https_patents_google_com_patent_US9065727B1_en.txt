Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to similar device identifiers.
- placing content on a web page may or may not be of interest or useful for the end users viewing the web page.
- the content of a web page may be used to help select more relevant content to be provided with the web page.
- a content provider selling golf clubs may provide content on a website devoted to golf, since visitors to the website may share a common interest in golf.
- Such systems may use keywords located in the text of the website to identify the content and the topics discussed on the website.
- a computerized method and system operable to build a device identifier similarity model with online event signals and determine similar network device identifiers.
- a processing circuit receives a first set of network device identifiers. The processing circuit represents each network device identifier of the first set by feature data associated with each network device identifier's network activity, where the feature data is associated with the content clicked-on or converted-on. The processing circuit applies abstractions on the feature data to form concepts. The processing circuit derives at least one hierarchy of feature data based on the keywords and concepts of the feature data. The processing circuit expands the feature data based on the derived at least one hierarchy of feature data and generates the device identifier similarity model based on the expanded feature data. The processing circuit is also capable of determining long-term and short-term history events.
- the processing circuit is capable of representing each device identifier as a vector of the feature data with dimension and value.
- the processing circuit is capable of applying a clustering algorithm on each vector to identify a plurality of clusters of device identifiers that share a common interest.
- the processing circuit is also capable of providing at least one subset of network device identifiers corresponding to each cluster.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with an illustrative implementation.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example web page having content.
- FIG. 3 is an example process for identifying similar online device identifiers.
- FIG. 4 is an example process for dividing a non-homogenous set of device identifiers into subsets based on strongly shared similarity interests of the device identifiers on each subset.
- FIG. 5 is an example process for dividing a non-homogenous set of device identifiers into subsets based on strongly shared similarity interests of the device identifiers on each subset and providing a set of similar device identifiers.
- FIG. 6 is a simplified illustration of a Cartesian space populated with device identifier data and with a computed centroid according to an implementation
- FIG. 7 is an example process for identifying similar online device identifiers based on a statistical model according to another implementation.
- the online behaviors of device identifiers may be used to provide audience-based content.
- online behavior refers to how a device identifier interacts with web pages on the Internet (e.g., which web pages are visited, the order in which the web pages are visited, how long a particular webpage is viewed, and similar information).
- a set of device identifiers associated with an online event e.g., clicking on content, converting on content, making an online purchase, being added to a content provider's list of device identifiers, etc.
- a time representation between a first online event and a second online event can be determined so as to build a similarity model for different content.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating monetizable parameters (e.g., monetizable demographic parameters).
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by a content server.
- content is provided based on the content of a webpage.
- a webpage devoted to golf may mention the terms “golf” and other golf-related terms.
- a system that places content on the webpage may use the content of the webpage itself and/or terms provided as part of a request for additional content (e.g., via a tag embedded into the code of the webpage), to determine a theme for the webpage. Based on the determined theme, a manufacturer of golf clubs may opt to place additional content on the webpage.
- Audience-based systems in contrast to content-based systems, involve selecting content based on the device identifier visiting a webpage, instead of the content of the webpage itself.
- a device identifier may be associated with making an online reservation at a golf resort and navigating to a financial webpage to check the stock market. Based on golf being a potential interest category associated with the device identifier, for example, additional content from a manufacturer of golf clubs may be provided with the financial webpage, even though the financial webpage is unrelated to golf.
- device identifiers associated with an online purchase may have similar browsing histories before making the purchase and/or immediately thereafter.
- Device identifiers associated with a purchase of a good or service may also be associated with other similar online behaviors, such as researching a product before purchasing it, comparing prices for the product across multiple websites, purchasing related goods, etc.
- a large percentage of device identifiers associated with purchasing airline tickets to Seattle may also be associated with researching websites about tourist attractions in Seattle, such as the Space Needle. Therefore, a content provider selling airline tickets to Seattle may wish to provide content to a particular device identifier based on whether the device identifier is associated with a previous visit to a website devoted to the Space Needle.
- online behaviors surrounding a triggering event may be captured, such as the purchase of a good or service (an example conversion).
- the triggering event may correspond to a user visiting an order confirmation webpage or clicking a submit-payment button.
- the browsing history associated with a device identifier that precedes the event, as well as the browsing history for a time period thereafter (e.g., a short time period) may be used to identify similar device identifiers.
- the triggering event may correspond to the online purchase of a pair of shoes. Such a purchase may trigger the addition of the user identify to a list of device identifiers also associated with shoe purchases.
- the browsing history for device identifiers on the list around the time of purchase may be used to create a behavioral model.
- the model may indicate a high likelihood of a device identifier being associated with a shoe purchase, if the identifier is associated with a recent online purchase of a dress.
- the behavioral model may be used in a system to determine whether a device identifier's online behavior is similar to that of the device identifiers surrounding an event. For example, a device identifier associated with the dress purchase may be presented with content related to the sale of shoes, based on a comparison between the online behavior and the behavioral model.
- a content provider or other party may provide data indicative of a set of device identifiers to the system, to identify similar device identifiers (e.g., to expand a remarketing list or other set of device identifiers).
- One or more implementations described herein provides a method that allows a processing circuit to properly identify and represent shared interests of device identifiers in a set of device identifiers based on features derived from the web history of the respective device identifiers.
- the processing circuit can derive such identification and representation of shared interests from one or more online events that have occurred in the device identifiers' web history.
- the device identifiers' ad-click and ad-conversion histories can be identified and used to represent shared interests among the device identifiers in one or more sets of device identifiers.
- the representation of interest is derived by identifying a long-term online event history (“long-term history”) and a short-term online event history (“short-term history”).
- An example of a long-term history is content that a device identifier in a given set of device identifiers has clicked on, or converted on, in the 30 days prior to the user appearing on the given set.
- An example of a short-term history is content that a device identifier in a given set of device identifiers has clicked on, or converted on, in the 2 hours prior to the device identifier appearing on the given set.
- the processing circuit uses the long-term and short-term histories, is then able to determine the types of ads (long-term or short-term) that should be shown to a device identifier similar to one or more device identifiers in a given set, based on the contents, keywords, etc. associated with the similar device identifier.
- a user may search for “tablet computers” and then take a relatively long period of time to convert on the purchase of a tablet computer.
- content related to tablet computer would be considered long-term content.
- a user may search for “pizza delivery” and then take a relatively short period of time to convert on the purchase of a pizza.
- content related to pizza delivery would be considered short-term content.
- the processing circuit By separating these types of ads, when, for example, a device identifier searches for “pizza delivery,” the processing circuit would provide similar short-term content to the device identifier in the short-term future.
- the device identifier's interest in pizza delivery is deemed to expire within a relatively short amount of time.
- the processing circuit can better determine the device identifier's behavior for long-term and short-term content. Therefore, the processing circuit can also better determine the anticipated behavior of a device identifier similar to the device identifier upon receiving the long-term or short-term content.

- “moviel.html” may include a content tag that specifies that a content slot is to be located at the position of additional content 214 .
- Another content tag may request additional content from a remote location, for example, from a content server, as webpage 206 is loaded.
- client identification data e.g., an identifier tag, device ID, etc.
- the content server is able to determine browsing history associated with a device identifier as it is used to navigate between various webpages that participate in the content network (e.g., webpages that include content from the content server).
- FIG. 3 is an example process 300 for determining similar online device identifiers.
- Process 300 may be utilized by a content server or other server having access to browsing history data for a set of device identifiers.
- Process 300 may be used, for example, to provide relevant content to users.
- content providers may compete in an auction for the ability to place content on a given webpage.
- a content provider having access to a set of device identifiers that are similar to other device identifiers associated with making a purchase, for example, may adjust their bid accordingly if one of the similar device identifiers requests a webpage having embedded content.
- Process 300 includes receiving data indicative of a set of device identifiers associated with an online event (block 302 ).
- an online event may correspond to any action performed by an online user.
- an online event may correspond to visiting a webpage, clicking on a particular link (e.g., a hyperlink, a content link, etc.), navigating between a set of webpages, ending their browsing session, spending a certain amount of time on a given webpage, purchasing a good or service, signing up for a newsletter, requesting to be contacted, or any other action that may be performed by an online user.
- the set of device identifiers may include device identifiers (e.g., identifier tags, device IDs, etc.) for the electronic devices operated by the users.
- the set of device identifiers may also include information about when the event occurred with respect to a user in the set.
- the received set may include information about when a particular user visited a webpage, made a purchase, or performed any other online action.
- an online retailer may wish to place content via a content network.
- the retailer may generate a list of device identifiers associated with visits to the retailer's website and/or purchases made via the website.
- the list of device identifiers may be a list of identifier tags, device IDs, or other information that can be used by the content network to determine online behaviors associated with the device identifiers on the list. For example, a mobile telephone having a unique device ID may be used to access the retailer's website. If the user has opted in to allowing information about the user to be collected, the retailer may record the device ID as a device identifier and provide it to the content network. The content network may then use the device identifier to identify similar device identifiers.
- Process 300 includes representing the received set of device identifiers' perceived interests, based on one or more online events performed by the received set of device identifiers (block 304 ).
- the system that receives the set of device identifiers may retrieve information regarding the browsing histories associated with the device identifiers in the received set.
- a server of a content network may store browsing history information for device identifiers that visited websites participating in the content network (e.g., websites that display content provided by the content network). Such information may be collected, for example, by receiving identification information (e.g., an identifier tag, device ID, etc.) each time a device identifier is used to access a webpage displaying content from the content network.
- identification information e.g., an identifier tag, device ID, etc.
- Such information may be used to reconstruct, or partially reconstruct, a user's browsing history, provided that the user has opted in to allowing such information to be used.
- the browsing history may be predetermined by another device outside of the content network (e.g., the browsing history data may be publisher-provided).
- representing the received set of device identifiers' perceived interests may be based on determining short-term browsing histories surrounding an online event.
- process 300 includes determining short-term browsing histories surrounding the online event (block 304 ).
- the short-term browsing history for a device identifier refers to data about which webpages were visited within a particular period of the online event.
- the short-term browsing history for a device identifier surrounding an event may include data about the webpages visited by the device identifier less than one, two, five, twelve, or twenty four hours prior to the event.
- the short-term browsing history for a device identifier may include data about the webpages visited by the device identifier less than one, two, five, twelve, or twenty four hours after the occurrence of the event.
- the short-term browsing histories may be determined for the entire set of device identifiers or for a subset of the device identifiers (e.g., a random sampling of the device identifiers, a subset selected up to a predetermined amount of device identifiers, etc.).
- representing the received set of device identifiers' perceived interests may be based on determining long-term browsing histories (e.g., browsing history data from a period longer than the particular period associated with the short-term browsing history) surrounding an online event.
- process 300 includes determining long-term browsing histories surrounding the online event (block 304 ). Determining long-term browsing histories surrounding the event may be done in addition to or in lieu of determining short-term browsing histories surrounding the online event (block 304 ).
- the long-term browsing histories may be determined for the entire set of device identifiers or for a subset of the device identifiers (e.g., a random sampling of the device identifiers, a subset selected up to a predetermined amount of device identifiers, etc.).
- short-term browsing history may provide more insight into a user's interests surrounding the event. For example, a user may have a long-term interest in professional football. However, the user may have a short-term interest in purchasing flowers. Analyzing the user's short-term browsing history surrounding his online purchase of flowers may exclude the topic of football from being associated with the purchase of flowers. In other circumstances, in contrast to short-term browsing history, long-term browsing history may provide more insight into a user's interests surrounding the event. For example, a user may have a long-term interest in tablet computers. However, the user may have a short-term interest in reviewing golf statistics. Analyzing the user's long-term browsing history surrounding his eventual online purchase of a tablet computer may exclude topic of golf statistics from being associated with the purchase of a tablet computer.
- short-term browsing histories may be defined by a predetermined value of two hours between the online event and the device identifier becoming part of the set of device identifiers.
- the predetermined value could be adjusted to three hours or a different amount of time.
- various time periods could be tried to better filter the results. For example, if the predetermined value is set at two hours, the predetermined value could be incremented by some unit of time (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.). In this example, if the predetermined value were incremented by an hour, process 300 would determine the short-term browsing histories at three hours and/or one hour between the online event and the device identifier becoming part of the set of device identifiers.
- Process 300 includes training a behavioral model (block 306 ).
- the browsing history data associated with the device identifiers in the received set may be used to train a behavioral model.
- the behavioral model may determine commonalities among the online behaviors associated with the device identifiers. For example, a large number of users that purchase organic peanut butter from a retailer may have recently visited a webpage devoted to a recipe for an all-organic peanut butter and banana sandwich. Such a characteristic may be used to identify other device identifiers that are also likely to become associated with purchasing organic peanut butter from the retailer.
- the training of the behavioral model may also include identifying the contents of the content and/or webpage related to an online event. For example, the content and/or characteristics of the content of the webpages visited, content selected, selected content that led to a conversion, etc. can be identified and used to train the behavioral model.
- the content can be identified in the form of keywords from creatives, keywords from landing webpages, keywords that were searched on, etc.
- identified keywords may include “smart phone,” the names of various smart phones, the names of various tablet computers, “minor pentatonic scale,” “baking,” “cookies,” and the names of various restaurants. Further, in such implementations, keywords can be grouped together into related concepts.
- the concepts can be derived by utilizing abstractions on the feature data in order to represent different categories of interests, where each concept represents a category of interests.
- abstractions is further described below.
- identified keywords can be grouped into concepts, such as smart phones, tablet computers, guitar technique, cooking, and restaurant reviews.
- the keywords and concepts collectively, are feature data of the received set of device identifiers. Therefore, the feature data can be used to train the behavioral model (block 306 ).
- keywords and concepts from all of the keywords and concepts collected can also be identified. Identifying important keywords and concepts can also be thought of as filtering the results to find relevant content that is desired to be determined. For example, keywords and concepts that are associated with a conversion may be deemed important, in contrast to keywords and concepts that did not lead to a conversion, keywords and concepts that led to a lower quality site, keywords and concepts that led to unrelated content, etc. In this sense, for example, the keywords and concepts, which are types of feature data, are associated with the content clicked-on or converted-on by the device identifier. Thus, the feature data is also associated with the content clicked-on or converted-on by the device identifier.
- process 300 may take into consideration the quality and importance of the source of the feature data. For example, process 300 can assign a quality score to each landing webpage; thus, the feature data from content that lead to high-quality landing webpages are given more importance than feature data from content that lead to low-quality webpages. Similarly, feature data on converted content may weigh more than content that were only clicked-on by the device identifiers, when the ultimate goal for the content provider is to generate conversions rather than clicks.
- the training of the behavioral model may also include deriving at least one hierarchy of keywords and concepts based on the identified feature data.
- process 300 can expand the identified feature data beyond the contents of content and/or webpage related to the original online event. In so doing, process 300 can identify at least one related keyword or concept, which can then be used as expanded feature data with which to determine similar users.
- the training of the behavioral model may derive multiple hierarchies of keywords and concepts based on the identified feature data. Process 300 can expand the feature data across a concept hierarchy of related keywords, related concepts, related clusters, a commercial product hierarchy (such as a product hierarchy found at amazon.com or ebay.com), etc.
- process 300 may expand the feature data to include “mobile phones” as a more general concept, “mobile phone software” as another related concept, and/or “tablet computers” as yet another concept.
- process 300 may implement certain tools, such as interest category mapping and clustering, described below.
- the behavioral model may be trained by aggregating the filtered and expanded feature data into a vector representation of the received set of device identifiers. This is done by representing the received set of device identifiers as a set of feature vectors.
- a feature vector refers to an nth dimensional vector of characteristics of a device identifier, such as information about browsing history associated with the device identifier. The characteristics may be identified, for example, from short-term or long-term browsing history, the identified important keywords or concepts and/or the expanded feature data.
- characteristics of a device identifier may be normalized by utilizing a term-frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) count.
- Webpages visited by a device identifier may be represented by their uniform resource location (URL) or similar network address.
- Selected content may be content embedded into a webpage (e.g., additional content 214 in FIG. 2 ), pop-up content, banner content, or the like.
- a conversion refers to the performance of a certain online action.
- the action of a conversion is the purchase of a good or service.
- selected content that led to a conversion may be content that diverted a user to a website at which the user made a purchase.
- Other examples of conversions include creating a user profile on a website, subscribing to receive marketing offers (e.g., by providing a postal or email address, by providing a telephone number, etc.), or downloading software from a website.
- the feature vectors may be aggregated to find a set of characteristics based on a statistical measurement of the aggregated characteristics.
- the aggregated characteristics may be the number of times a webpage was visited by the set of device identifiers, the number of times the content was clicked, and/or the number of times clicked content led to a conversion.
- a statistical measurement of the aggregated characteristics may be the average, median, centroid, or other statistical measure of the aggregated characteristics.
- the aggregated characteristics having the highest amount of activity may be selected (e.g., the top five most visited webpages, the most-clicked content, etc.).
- the received set of device identifiers may be subdivided into clusters to generate the behavioral model.
- different groups of device identifiers may be associated with the same event and have widely different interests and motivations.
- a roll of copper tubing may be purchased from an online hardware store both by plumbers and by hobbyists.
- the browsing histories for these two groups may widely differ.
- the short-term browsing histories of the plumbers may include a number of webpages devoted to making a certain type of plumbing repair.
- the short-term browsing histories of the hobbyists may include a number of webpages devoted to do-it-yourself projects to make a heat sink using copper tubing.
- clustering allows for the different groups of device identifiers to be treated separately in the behavioral model.
- the received set of device identifiers may be subdivided into clusters by computing a weighted nearest-neighbor list for each user in the received set of device identifiers.
- the feature vectors may be analyzed to determine which vectors are closest to one another.
- the nearest-neighbor list for the received set of device identifiers may be determined by applying a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm, or similar algorithm, to the feature vectors.
- KNN k-nearest-neighbor
- Process 300 includes using the model to identify similar device identifiers to those in the received set (block 308 ).
- the device identifiers in the received set are represented as feature vectors
- device identifiers not in the received set may be represented in a similar manner.
- the received set may include feature vectors of characteristics for device identifiers A, B, and C, i.e., the set of vectors ⁇ A, B, C ⁇ .
- a feature vector of characteristics may be determined for a device identifier D (e.g., a device identifier not in the received set).
- the centroid of ⁇ A, B, C ⁇ may be determined and compared with the feature vector for user D to identify device identifier D as being a similar device identifier. For example, if the feature vector for device identifier D is close to that of the centroid vector of ⁇ A, B, C ⁇ , device identifier D may be considered to be a similar device identifier.
- the device identifiers having feature vectors closest to that of the clusters may be identified as being similar device identifiers. For example, a device identifier associated with visiting webpages devoted to plumbing repairs may be identified as being similar to device identifiers associated with the purchase of copper tubing.
- nearest-neighbor lists may be determined for all device identifiers being analyzed (e.g., those in the received set of device identifiers and those device identifiers being compared to the received set). The nearest-neighbors from all device identifiers may be aggregated and sorted by nearest-neighbor weights. The device identifiers having the highest weights in the aggregated neighbor list may then be identified as being a set of similar device identifiers.
- a limit may be placed on the number of identified similar device identifiers, in various implementations. For example, the top one hundred device identifiers having vectors closest to the centroid of the received set of device identifiers may be identified. Similarly, the top one hundred device identifiers having the highest weights in an aggregated nearest neighbor list may be identified. In some implementations, the limit may be adjusted based on a parameter. For example, a content provider may provide a set of device identifiers to a content network and request that the system identify one thousand device identifiers similar to those in the provided set.
- Process 300 includes providing the set of similar device identifiers (block 310 ).
- the set of similar device identifiers may include device identifiers (e.g., identifier tags, unique device IDs, etc.) or other information that may be used to determine that a device identifier in the set of similar device identifiers is being used to request a webpage.
- the set of similar device identifiers may be provided to a content provider and used by the content provider to select relevant content.
- the set of similar device identifiers may be provided to a content server that conducts an auction.
- a content provider may utilize the set of similar device identifiers to adjust auction bids to provide content to those device identifiers.
- a device identifier that visits a webpage devoted to plumbing repairs may have a browsing history similar to that of device identifiers associated with purchasing copper tubing.
- content providers may participate in an auction to place content on the webpage. In such a case, a content provider may place a higher bid in the auction to provide content for copper tubing to the device identifier on the webpage.
- process 300 is able to identify a set of similar device identifiers (identified at block 308 ) who are likely to share some common interests with the received set of device identifiers.
- Process 300 further provides the set of similar users (at block 310 ), thus, likely expanding the potential reach for a content provider's content, beyond the received set of device identifiers.
- Process 400 includes receiving a non-homogeneous set of network device identifiers and storing the set in a system memory (block 402 ).
- the set is non-homogenous in that the network device identifiers have one thing in common, but may otherwise have dissimilar interests. For example, device identifiers in the non-homogeneous set may have visited the homepage of a retailer who sells multiple categories of items, but viewed or purchased dissimilar products.
- Each network device identifier is represented by feature data associated with the network device identifier's network activity.
- Feature data may include, but are not limited to, web pages visited, topics in the web pages, salient keywords in the web pages, content displayed on the web pages, content clicked on, search terms entered for searches performed, products purchased, device identifiers' geography, etc.
- the user associated with the device identifier may have control over whether and how information is collected about them and used by a content server.
- Process 400 includes utilizing abstractions on the raw data in order to represent different categories of interests (block 404 ).
- Each abstraction may contain different amounts of detail for the each category of interest. For example, a web page's contents can be abstracted into multiple “concepts” where each concept represents a category of interests. This abstraction can be done at multiple levels of granularity such as a “cooking” concept, a “cooking pot” concept, or a “cooking utensils” concept.
- This abstraction allows the processing circuit to transform the information received from the non-homogenous set into layers of abstractions based on categories of interests that can be processed one layer at a time.
- Process 400 includes representing each network device identifier as a vector based on the abstractions of the feature data associated with each network device identifier (block 406 ).
- Each vector is an nth dimensional vector of the feature data associated with each network device identifier.
- Each feature data has a corresponding feature value.
- process 400 includes applying a clustering algorithm to the vectors (block 408 ).
- cluster analysis a set of objects, in this case, the network device identifiers, are assigned into groups or clusters. The objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than the objects in other clusters.
- the processing circuit can identify device identifiers with multiple common interests by forming multiple clusters in the same device identifier set.
- the program For each cluster, the program represents the common interest as an aggregation of vectors inside the cluster.
- the processing circuit arrives at an aggregation by adding up the values for each dimension to form a single vector to represent the cluster. This single vector does not necessarily have to be a member of the data set. More complex aggregation methods can also be applied.
- clustering algorithms include, but are not limited to, hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, distribution-based clustering, conceptual clustering, and density-based clustering.
- the processing circuit applies one of the clustering algorithms to the vectors to identify a plurality of clusters of network device identifiers that share a common interest, where the common interest is represented as an aggregation of vectors inside each cluster.
- the processing circuit may then display the clusters on a user interface.
- Process 400 includes dividing the non-homogenous set into subsets based on the strongly shared similar interests identified by the clusters (block 410 ). By taking the non-homogeneous set of device identifiers and dividing it into subsets based on strongly shared interests of the device identifiers in each subset, the system can select more relevant content for users when the system employs a audience-based system.
- the processing circuit may display the networking device identifiers as subsets categorized by interests on a user interface.
- the process 400 may include identifying device identifiers that share similar interests, but did not appear in the non-homogeneous set (block 412 ).
- the non-homogeneous set of network device identifiers may include vectors of device identifier features for device identifiers A, B, and C, i.e., the set of vectors ⁇ A, B, C ⁇ .
- a vector of device identifier features may be determined for a potential similar device identifier D (e.g., a device identifier not in the non-homogeneous set).
- the centroid of ⁇ A, B, C ⁇ may be determined and compared with the vector for potential similar device identifier D to identify potential similar device identifier D as being a similar device identifier. For example, if the feature vector for potential similar device identifier D is close to that of the centroid vector of ⁇ A, B, C ⁇ , potential similar device identifier D may be considered to be a similar device identifier.
- the processing circuit represents each potential similar device identifier as a vector based on the abstractions of the potential similar device identifier's feature data.
- the processing circuit then calculates the distance between the vector representing the potential similar device identifier and each cluster identified from the feature data of the non-homogeneous set.
- the processing circuit calculates on overall similarity score to the non-homogeneous set by aggregating the distances to each cluster. Different aggregation methods can be utilized. An inverse of distance between the vectors represents the similarity between the device identifiers.
- the potential similar device identifiers are scored and ranked based on similarity, with the top N device identifiers above a certain threshold value being assigned as similar device identifiers.
- a limit may be placed on the number of identified similar device identifiers, in various implementations. For example, the top one hundred device identifiers having vectors closest to the centroid of each subset of the non-homogeneous set of network device identifiers may be identified. In some implementations, the limit may be adjusted based on a parameter. For example, a content provider may provide a set of device identifiers to a content network and request that the system identify one thousand device identifiers similar to those in the provided set.
- the processing circuit then generates a second set of network device identifiers (the set of similar device identifiers).
- the processing circuit may then display the second set of network device identifiers on a user interface either as one set, or as subsets based on the strongly shared interests identified by the cluster analysis on the non-homogeneous set.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example process for dividing a non-homogenous set of device identifiers into subsets based on strongly shared similarity interests of the device identifiers on each subset and providing a set of similar device identifiers.
- each network device identifier in the non-homogenous set of device identifiers is represented by feature data associated with the network device identifier's network activity.
- the feature data may include web page URLs visited by the anonymous device identifier ( 502 A), web page content viewed by the anonymous device identifier ( 502 B), commercial products browsed by the anonymous device identifier ( 502 C), or other features ( 502 D) including, but not limited to, salient keywords in the web pages, content displayed on the web pages, content clicked on, search terms entered for searches performed, products purchased, device identifiers' geography, etc.
- step 504 abstractions are used on the raw data in order to derive concept categories and category hierarchies by the same method associated with block 404 of FIG. 4 .
- step 506 device identifiers are represented as feature vectors by the same method associated with block 406 of FIG. 4 .
- step 508 includes applying a clustering algorithm to the vectors.
- a clustering algorithm such as k-means clustering (step 508 A) can be used.
- a special clustering algorithm such as conceptual or hierarchical clustering (step 508 B) can be used.
- centroid In k-means clustering, the location of k centroids are randomly defined, one centroid for each cluster. Next, each observation, in this case, each device identifier, is assigned to the group that has the closest centroid. When all of the device identifiers have been assigned, the center of each group is calculated, and each centroid relocates to that position. This process is repeated until the centroids no longer change position.
- each cluster represents a concept description.
- the concept description may be a word cluster.
- a word cluster may be a set of words that convey the same or similar ideas.
- a word cluster may be a set of synonyms, according to some implementations.
- the concept description may include the word “hotel.”
- a word cluster that includes the word “hotel” may be as follows:
- step 510 includes identifying similar device identifiers to each subset or cluster by the same method associated with block 412 of FIG. 4 .
- a set of similar device identifiers can be produced for each cluster (step 512 A), or a set of similar device identifiers can be produced for the non-homogeneous set of device identifiers as a whole by performing weighted combination of similar device identifier sets for each cluster (step 512 B). Based on the similarities identified, the system can select relevant content to show each device identifier.
- the device identifiers in the received set may be represented in a similar manner.
- the feature vectors may be disposed into a hyper-dimensional space.
- the hyper-dimensional space may be a Cartesian space.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a simplified 3-dimensional Cartesian space 600 , although it is noted that the hyper-dimensional space may actually include four or more dimensions, such as hundreds, thousands, or even millions of dimensions.
- Each axis in the hyper-dimensional space may represent a possible device identifier signal, such as a website visited by a user.
- the received data for a first set of device identifiers may include feature vectors of user characteristics for a large number of device identifiers 602 , shown as a “cloud” in the hyper-dimensional space 600 .
- the first set of device identifiers may be an original set of device identifiers who participated in a study of their online activities, and may be provided for use in identifying similar device identifiers in a new device identifiers set when their data becomes available.
- Each data point in the “cloud” may represent a device identifier, and correspond to a feature vector having a component in each axis in the hyper-dimensional space 600 .
- the first set of device identifiers 602 may represent device identifiers who have known behaviors and who had made an online purchase, for example.
- a statistical model can be built to characterize the behaviors of the first set of device identifiers 602 .
- the statistical model may simply be a centroid 604 computed from the “cloud.”
- a feature vector of user characteristics may be determined for a device identifier not in the first set of device identifiers. For example, this device identifier has not made the online purchase, but may be considered as one of a second set of device identifiers to which content be provided based on that the second set of device identifiers have a certain likelihood of making such an online purchase, as predicted from their behaviors being similar to those of the first set of device identifiers.
- the centroid 604 may be compared with the feature vectors for the second set of device identifiers to identify these device identifiers as being similar to the first set of device identifiers. For example, if the feature vector for a device identifier 606 is close to that of the centroid 604 , as measured by a distance 608 that may be compared with a predetermined threshold, device identifier 606 may be considered to be a device identifier similar to the first set of device identifiers.
- the device identifiers having feature vectors closest to that of the clusters may be identified as being similar device identifiers. For example, a device identifier that visits webpages devoted to plumbing repairs may be identified as being similar to device identifiers that purchased copper tubing.
- nearest-neighbor lists may be determined for all device identifiers being analyzed (e.g., those in the received set of device identifiers and those device identifiers being compared to the received set). The nearest-neighbors from all device identifiers may be aggregated and sorted by nearest-neighbor weights. The device identifiers having the highest weights in the aggregated neighbor list may then be identified as being a set of similar device identifiers.
- a limit may be placed on the number of identified similar device identifiers. For example, the top one hundred device identifiers having vectors closest to the centroid of the first set of device identifiers may be identified. Similarly, the top one hundred device identifiers having the highest weights in an aggregated nearest neighbor list may be identified. In some implementations, the limit may be adjusted based on a parameter. For example, a content provider may provide a set of device identifiers to a content network and request that the system identify one thousand device identifiers similar to those in the provided set.
- the following operations may be formed according to the described implementations, as illustrated in a process 700 shown in FIG. 7 .
- Process 700 may include, for each device identifier in the first set, identifying user data or signals (block 702 ). These data or signals may indicate the device identifier's online behaviors, may include counts of various actions performed by the device identifiers, such as the websites they visit, the ads they clicked, the topics of the pages they visited, etc.
- Process 700 may include constructing a hyper-dimensional space (block 704 ) to represent the user data.
- Each possible signal may be represented by an axis in a hyper-dimensional Cartesian space, such as a simplified illustration shown in FIG. 4 .
- the actual number of dimensions may be hundreds, thousands, or more.
- the different dimensions may relate to different behaviors (e.g., websites visited) of the device identifier.
- a component of a user data (signal) strength along an axis may indicate the number of visits to the website.
- Process 700 may include disposing the first set of device identifiers in the hyper-dimensional space (block 706 ).
- Each device identifier may be represented by a single point in this space, and the single point also corresponds to a user vector.
- process 700 may include truncating the user data (block 708 ).
- the user data in the hyper-dimensional space may be truncated/filtered by various methods.
- the user data (vector) strengths may be normalized, for example from 0 to 1.
- Device identifiers with the weakest signals i.e., below a threshold (e.g., 0.01, or 0.4), may be removed from the set.
- the outliers in the first set of device identifiers may be removed, thereby improving the statistics of the first set of the device identifiers.
- the number of dimensions of the hyper-dimensional space may be capped, for example to a number of 50, by limiting the hyper-dimensional space to the 50 dimensions with the strongest user signals. This also removes the weaker user signals, and may save memory in the computation (as each extra dimension may drastically increase the memory consumption).
- Process 700 may include constructing a statistical model of the truncated data, such as computing one or more centroids (block 710 ) from the hyper-dimensional space populated with all such device identifier points.
- the centroid may indicate aggregated behaviors of the first set device identifiers.
- a centroid which may be a single point in the hyper-dimensional space (Cartesian or non-Cartesian)
- a statistical distribution such as a Gaussian distribution can be constructed based on the device identifier positions.
- the statistical distribution and its associated statistics parameters may better characterize the behaviors of the first set of device identifiers.
- statistical tools such as principle component analysis may be employed to model the data.
- the statistical model such as the centroid may be used to model (or uniquely identify) a device identifier with behaviors predicted based on the statistical model to be similar to the behaviors of the first set of device identifiers. This can be achieved, for example, by calculating a distance in the hyper-dimensional space from data indicative of behaviors of the device identifier to the centroid. In general, the distance may be computed from the data to a statistical distribution as well, in either a Cartesian space or non-Cartesian space. If the distance is smaller than a threshold, then the device identifier may be considered as a similar device identifier and included in a second set of device identifiers. As such, a large number of device identifiers can be identified as having behaviors similar to those of the first set of device identifiers.
- Process 700 may further include providing content items to the identified similar device identifier (block 714 ).
- the content items may be selected based on the aggregated behaviors of the first set of device identifiers, as represented by the centroid or other statistical models.
- the selected content items may include advertisements to be provided to the second device identifier set, for example through an auction process.
- bids can be placed for online content to be provided to the second set of device identifiers.
- the system may thus allow bids to be automatically adjusted based on the predicted online behaviors of the second set of device identifiers. For example, a device identifier may visit a webpage and an automatic auction may ensue among content providers to determine what content is presented to the device identifier. Content providers may automatically adjust their bids based on the similarity of the device identifier's online behavior to that of the first set of device identifiers, such as those that seem particularly interested in the content based on purchasing the product depicted in the content. Other potential uses of this information are also possible. In an example, content providers may bid for presenting content to device identifiers who have not visited certain websites but who are predicted to be likely future visitors based on their visits to other websites or search histories.
- the described implementations may thus provide improved audience-based systems.
- a second, potentially larger set of device identifiers may be identified.
- the second set of device identifiers may not have made a purchase as do the first set of device identifiers, but can be identified based on the predictive model described above.

Abstract
Description

- visited
web pages w —1, w—2 and w—3 with feature values w—1_v, w—2_v and w—3_v, respectively. In this context, a feature value is a function of howmany times u —1 visited the web pages in a given period of time. - viewed content a—1 and a—2 with feature values a—1_v and a—2_v, respectively. In this context, a feature value is a function of how
many times u —1 viewed the content.
The full feature vector foru —1 is <0, . . . . 0, w—1_v, w—2_v, w—3_v, 0, 0, . . . , a—1_v, a—2_v, 0, . . . . 0>, where the vector has feature values only for the network activities listed above (e.g. w —1, w—2, w—3, a—1 and a—2) and a feature value of 0 whenu 1 did not perform the network activity. The vector may be represented in a sparse format: <w—1: w—1_v, w—2:w—2_v, w—3: w—3_v, a—1: a—1_v, a—2: a—2_v>, where the network activity and corresponding feature value appear next to each other. Therefore, each dimension of the vector represents a single feature data of the device identifier.
In some implementations, the vectors may be aggregated to generate a feature representation or set of activities performed by the device identifiers in a non-homogeneous set. For example, if a device identifier set—1 includesdevice identifiers u —1 and u—2, thevectors representing u —1 and u—2 may be aggregated to generate a feature representation of the set of device identifiers. The aggregation may be performed by simple vector addition, vector dot product, or any other algorithm involving vector arithmetic.

cluster —1={inn, hotel, hostel, lodge, motel, public house, spa}
Such a cluster may be used to identify concept descriptions devoted to the same topic, but use different terminology to do so. These word clusters or concepts can be divided into hierarchies. For example, if every concept or word cluster is its own cluster, similar pairs of clusters can be merged into a parent cluster. The similarity between pairs can be defined in many ways, for example, by the minimum distance between the points, by the average distance between the points, etc. The process is repeated until all the concept descriptions are divided into hierarchies defined by a parent cluster.
