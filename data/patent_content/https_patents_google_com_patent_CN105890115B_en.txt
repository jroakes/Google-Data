Letter, such as personal computer and/or other thermostats or HVAC system component.
For some embodiments, enclosure space service condition and user's set point act of revision based on induction are provided
It is left for set point program and/or the algorithm of set point modification of program.The grade set points program leaves an example of algorithm
Algorithm herein referred to as " is left/automatically achieved " automatically, and hereafter the algorithm is further illustrated.
For some embodiments, Fig. 4 A-D illustrates the time diagram and real work set point of normal set-point temperature plan
The comparison of figure corresponds to the typical operation of " leave/reach automatically automatically " algorithm.For disclosed clarity, Fig. 4 A is to be directed to
Particular job day (such as Tuesday) and specific user's (may be the retired or the house parent for having young children) are relatively simple
Single typical thermostat set program 402.Setting program 402 only include morning 7:00 to evening 9:00 between wake-up/be in
Period, the required temperature for the grade periods is the 76 degree and evening 9:00 periods to morning 7:00, for this etc.
The required temperature of period is 66 degree.It can include method described in patent application by one or more joint distributions
Standard set point program 402 is established, can also be established by other methods.For example, can be programmed by end user specific
Normal set point program 402 (for example, using network interface) is established, by the way that set point or " crawl " are arrived the multiple of pre-set programs
The setting session (for example, the retired, the work man and wife for having child, unmarried urban residence person etc.) of one of selection, by certainly
Dynamic study, or pass through various other methods.
According to preferred " leaving automatically " algorithm, closing continuously and is automatically detected using the multiplex induction technology of thermostat
Space use state, such as passive infrared thread environment detector 330 shown in Fig. 3 A.For some embodiments, use state
Sensor measures-such as 1-2Hz in high frequency.Measured value is then collected into " bucket " of certain time length,
Such as 5 minutes.Detect whether each " bucket " detects use state using a simple algorithm.For example, an if bucket
In more than two sensor readings show the movement detected, then 5 minutes " bucket " is just taken as " detecting use ".
Therefore, each " bucket " is divided into two states: " detecting use " or " not detecting use ".For some embodiments,
Some threshold percentage of reading must indicate movement, so that bucket to be classified as to " detecting use ".For example, even if position not
Good, when there is enclosure space someone of air conditioning, about the 10% of reading also illustrates movement.In this example, it can be used
Bucket is classified as " detecting use " by 5% threshold value.
For some embodiments, at least partly state of bucket currently sensed, thermostat is by enclosure space or is adjusted
Space is classified as one of four states: " being in " (also referred to as " someone's use ")；" leave-normal " (also referred to as " unmanned to use "
Or " being left in one day ")；" leave-have a holiday " (also referred to as " is left ") in the daytime；" sleep ".Specific implementation for some first choices
State, if to a predetermined minimum time interval, the use state currently sensed be " not detecting use " (herein referred as
Leave state trusts window (ASCW)), then " leaving an automatically " characteristic triggers enclosure space state from " being in " to " leaving
The change in battlefield ".Since state changes into " leave-normal ", real work point temperature changes into a default energy conservation and leaves shape
State temperature (AST), and it is unrelated with the set-point temperature of normal thermostat set program description.
When " leaving automatically " characteristic purpose is intended to the unmanned comfortable setting used or enjoy program 402, avoid unnecessary
Heating or refrigeration, to reach energy-saving effect.A default preset can be set by AST, for the winter by way of example
In season, which is 62 degree (or need heat outdoor temperatures), for summer, the value (or the outdoor temp that needs freeze that is 84 degree
Degree).By user setting, AST heating and cryogenic temperature can be arbitrarily controlled.
Leave state trusts window (ASCW) and corresponds to the unmanned usage time interval sensed, and system can after this period
To make a rationally reliable working hypothesis (statistical accuracy with certain resonable degree), i.e., enclosure space nobody make
With.For most of typical enclosure space, it can be found that the preset time period within the scope of 90 to 180 minutes is to be suitble to ASCW
Period, can cope with ordinary circumstance, for example, quiet reading, the mailbox away from keyboard for going to corner, nap, etc., at this
In kind situation, the movement or occupied state sensor not sensed can incude opposite instruction.
For some embodiments, ASCW is automatically adjusted after study event.For example, for a kind of embodiment, manual
ASCW is extended predetermined amount (for example, 10-30 minutes)-and is for example changing into " leave-normal " mode after " push-in " event
Later, user's manual setting set-point temperature to keep comfort, therefore although indicates other feelings using detection sensor
Condition, this still illustrates that enclosure space someone uses.Similar, for some embodiments, if without any " stringent " thing manually
Part, after " leave-normal " state is switched in multiplicating, ASCW will be shortened.This change of ASCW may be used to calculate
What method preferably adapted to that user's particular tendency and/or other factors (such as thermostat/sensor physical location) influence makes
With induction validity.
In the example of Fig. 4 A-4D, understanding is provided under the heat protocol background that ASCW is 120 minutes and AST is 62 degree
The property released explanation, it should however be clear that from the angle currently illustrated, the correspondence example for freezing and other ASCW/AST values select is somebody's turn to do to familiar
The personnel of technology are transparent, and in scope of embodiments.In order to illustrate the induction along the display small oval marks of black is living
It moves timeline (As), plan set point Figure 40 2 and actual motion set point Figure 40 4, this oval marks pair is given in Fig. 4 B
Ying Yu senses movable (for example, sensing the time " bucket " that someone uses), currently exactly ASCW/AST.It is worth noting that,
By morning 11:00, until morning 10:00 just senses important User Activity, it is followed by the non-activity time of a hour
406 (or buckets for being classified as " not detecting use ") of section.Since the inactivity interval in Fig. 4 B is about 1 hour, slightly
Lower than ASCW, " automatic-to leave " characteristic be not triggered to leave-state of normal condition changes.
Provided in Fig. 4 C by afternoon 4:00 plan and practical set up point diagram.As shown in Figure 4 C, 120 minutes (from
Finally " not detecting use " starts 120 minutes) automatic trigger after non-activity " leave-normal " mode, real work sets up
Point 404 deviates the set point 402 of regular program, reaches 62 degree of AST temperature.By 4:00 in afternoon, " leave-normal " mode
Activity is not sensed after triggering, therefore " leave-normal " mode holding is effectively.
With reference to Fig. 4 D, after illustrating example related with Fig. 4 A-C, the plan and reality by noon 12:00 are illustrated
Set up point diagram.As shown in Figure 4 D, start to sense that this triggers " certainly using activity in about 5 points of short time periods started in afternoon
It is dynamic-return " or " it is automatic-reach ", so that enclosure space is switched to " being in " state, real work set point 404 is in the point
Return to normal set point plan 202.
For some embodiments, Fig. 5 is the various states that illustrates the enclosure space of air conditioning and can be included into.Constant temperature
Enclosure space or conditioned space are classified as one of four states by device: " being in " (510), also referred to as " someone's use "；" from
Open-normal " (512), also referred to as " unmanned to use " or " being left in one day "；" leave-have a holiday " (514) be also referred to as " in the daytime from
It opens "；" sleep " (520).According to day time and normal program setting, during normal operation, conditioned space is returned
Enter to be in state 510 or sleep state 520.Sleep state 520 can determine by default hour, such as from 12 points in evening to the morning
6 points, it can also be arranged by user according to the preference of user, or can be arranged according to current plan, such as the plan in Fig. 4 A
402, which has reacted the sleep state between 9 points to 7 points of the morning of evening.
Regular program purpose is intended to illustrate the common of user or is contemplated that behavior.As described above, outgoing when detecting
When leaving, the conditioned space in the state of being in 510, which can automatically become, leaves-normal condition 512, so as to economize on resources and at
This.As described above, when not detecting someone in the ASCW period in use, from the state of being in 510 to leaving-normal condition
512 change will occur.For some embodiments, based on the event that detects, elapsed time, and/or with basic object (base
This purpose be in reasonable statistical likelihood degree, it is energy saving when in enclosure space without user) consistent trigger event, can
- 512 mode of normal condition is left to change.For some embodiments, leave-normal condition 512 is when keeping energy saving AST temperature
Set-point temperature, until one of following event occurs: (i) receives manual correction from the user input, and the input is by state
Become the state of being in 510 again；(ii) " automatic to reach " mode, the mode become state again based on the occupancy activity-triggered detected
State of being in 510；(iii) user's normal sleep times have been arrived, and have not reached " having a holiday " mode, state is become sleeping by this
Dormancy state 520；Or (iv) due to regular program change set point (for example, it is outside the plan and plan user reach or wake up)
It has no and is determined as " having a holiday " mode.
For some embodiments, if herein referred as vacation state trusts window extending predetermined minimum time section
(VSCW)) unmanned use is detected, then is stopped in leaving-normal condition 512 have the enclosure space of air conditioning to become leaving-
False state 514.State 514 is being left-is having a holiday, set-point temperature readjustment is to leave-have a holiday set-point temperature (AVST), the temperature
It is a very energy-efficient temperature.For example, for a kind of embodiment, the default setting of AVST be 45 degree when needing to heat, need
It is 95 degree when freezing.The setting ratio ASCW's long of VSCW is more under normal circumstances.For example, VSCW's is suitble in many situations
Value is 24 hours.For some embodiments, VSCW is variable, such as from Friday afternoon to weeknight, can be 60 hours
In 48 hours.The slave set-point temperature for reducing mistake is become the shorter time section that nobody uses by longer VSCW during weekend
Period stringent AVST, such as short-term weekend are outgoing.
It is invalid that characteristic is left automatically, that is to say, that the state is never during sleep state 520 for some embodiments
It can directly be changed into from sleep state 520 and leave-normal condition 512.Disabling is automatic-and it leaves characteristic and avoids and be not detected with
People is in use, set-point temperature is changed into AST from the set-point temperature that night plans by mistake.For other embodiments,
It is changed during sleep state 520 using probe algorithm, so as in detection nothing due to caused by less expected activity grade
People in use, and user sleep during detect different activity patterns and position when, it is insensitive to non-activity state.At one
In example, ASCW is simply extended to 4 hours or 6 hours during sleep state 520.For other embodiments, sensor
The threshold percentage read in each " bucket " of reading is lowered, to reduce during user sleeps without user's mistake
A possibility that classification.
For some embodiments, Fig. 6 A-F illustrates the time diagram and real work set point of normal set-point temperature plan
The comparison of figure corresponds to the typical operation of " leave/reach automatically automatically " algorithm.It is for particular job day shown in Fig. 6 A
The thermostat set program 602 on (such as Wednesday), suitable for staying out between at 11 points in the morning at 5 points in afternoon under normal circumstances
User.Setting program 602 includes waking/being in the time from the morning 7:00 to 11:00 and from 5:00 to evening 10:00 in afternoon
Section, set-point temperature is 72 degree during this period of time.Sleep temperature and noon temperature are both configured to 62 degree.In this example, ASCW
It is 90 minutes, AST is 60 degree.It should be clear that the corresponding example from the angle currently illustrated, for freezing and other ASCW/AST values select
Son is transparent to the people for being familiar with the technology, and in the range of embodiment.
In fig. 6b, plan set point Figure 60 2 is given along actual motion set point Figure 60 4.Show the small ellipse of black
The sensed activity timeline (As) of label corresponds to sensed activity (for example, sensing the time " bucket " that someone uses), is at present
Afternoon 2:00.It is worth noting that, by 2:00 in afternoon, until morning 8:00 just senses important User Activity, it is followed by
The non-activity period 606 (or the bucket for being classified as " not detecting use ").If do not detected in 90 minutes ASCW
Someone uses, and triggers " leaving automatically " characteristic in morning 9:30, and have the state of the enclosure space of air conditioning to be arranged to
- normal condition is left, and set point becomes 60 degree of AST.
Fig. 6 C respectively shows plan and practical set point Figure 60 2 and 604, and the activity detected, at present at night
9:00.Even if without activity when should be noted that 5:00 in the afternoon, enclosure space state will become the state of being in, and
Set point changes, to match 72 degree of set points of plan.Due to according to schedule 602, it is contemplated that user under normal circumstances will be under
Noon, 5:00 got home, thus do not detect someone using when readjustment to being in or " occupancy " state.It is worth noting that, scheming
In example shown in 6C, about afternoon, 5:00 detects activity again.
For some embodiments, Fig. 6 D respectively shows plan and practical set point Figure 60 2 and 604, and detect
Activity is evening 9:00 at present.In the example shown in Fig. 6 D, from evening to current time evening 9:00, it is not detected with
People uses.Correspondingly, by after ASCW, 6:30 at night, have the state of the enclosure space of air conditioning become leaving-just
Often, and set point becomes 60 degree of AST
For example shown in Fig. 6 D, Fig. 6 E respectively shows plan and practical set point Figure 60 2 and 604, and visits
The activity measured is evening 12:00 at present.In this example, from evening to current time evening 12:00, someone is not detected
It uses.10:00 encounters the set point variation of plan at night, thus the sleep set point for making the set point of thermostat become 62 degree
Temperature.Since evening 10:00 is dormant beginning, for this example, automatic-to leave characteristic invalid.
For example shown in Fig. 6 D-E, Fig. 6 F respectively shows plan and practical set point Figure 60 2 and 604, and visits
The activity measured is the evening 11:00 on second day (Thursday) at present.In this example, from evening 10:00 to morning 7:00
Sleep state during, it is automatic-to leave characteristic invalid, and increase setting according to schedule in morning Thursday morning 7:00
Point.But due to do not detect someone use, leave automatically characteristic ASCW reach the morning 8:30 when trigger leave-
Normal state change, and set point becomes AST.Then, in morning 9:30, the state of the enclosure space of air conditioning becomes
To leave-having a holiday because since initially become leaving-it is normal have already been through 24 hours (vacation-state trust window
(VSCW)), and period does not detect someone's use.In morning 9:30, set point is that AVST (leaves-have a holiday state temperature
Degree), in this case, it is 45 degree.It note that for some embodiments, VSCW measured since the last time detects someone's use,
Rather than-normal time is begun to change into and leaves, which, which will lead to, becomes leaving-having a holiday state in Thursday morning 8:00.
For some embodiments, user (for example, in initial setting up ession for telecommunication, can pass through web-page interface, etc.) root
Change ASCW according to required power conservation requirement.For example, the ASCW for selecting the user of " stringent " energy-saving option to obtain is 45 minutes, the result is that
In 45 minutes non-activitys (or " leaving " or " unmanned to use " sense state), system could be made that " automatic-to leave " determines afterwards.
Various methods can be used to the filtering of ASCW period and detected event, " leaving " characteristic triggering automatically with improvement will
State, which is changed into, leaves-the reliability of normal condition.For understand the activity detected whether with someone and other reasons (such as
Pet) relevant various learning methods can be used for improving the reliability of " automatic-to leave " characteristic.For some embodiments,
" background " grade (for example, being attributable to is not that someone using result detects event) of sensed activity can be by interaction side
Formula study, and/or based on leave-normal phase during the manual set point of correcting property there is no confirmation.For example, if triggering
Period after " automatic-to leave " mode does not have the manual set point variation of correcting property, and lacks correcting property input and exist
Multiple and different occasion repeats, then can will sensed activity type relevant to equal periods and/or degree as with someone
Unrelated " background " grade of situation, the reason is that having certain type of correction under one or more situations if certain someone
Activity.
In the way of being similar to " automatic-leave " and using assessment, " automatic-to reach " characteristic to the triggering of the state of being in most
It is based on wicket time window well and/or detects movable filtering, to make uncertainty event or unrelated with practical someone
Other events will not surprisingly trigger " automatic-to return " mode.As described above, for some embodiments, detection process includes
To detecting movable presence or absence and individually assess 5 minutes wickets " bucket " of time (or when other suitable during wicket
Between section wicket).If it find that detect movable threshold quantity in the adjacent wicket of the grade times wicket, then basis
The time on the same day, " automatic-reach " characteristic triggering state, which becomes again, is in or sleep state.Such as the time 408 of Fig. 4 D.It is triggering
Afterwards, " automatic-to return " mode adjusts back set point to normal set point plan 402.
For a kind of embodiment, based on use pattern and/or with " automatic-leave " triggering and/or " automatic-reach " triggering
Repeat relevant correcting property manual input mode, provide a kind of algorithm to set point plan modification.When periodically with multistage
Between continuous monitoring and filtering with " leave/automatically achieve automatically " characteristic relevant people use and/or correcting property be manually entered behavior, with
Just it determines the mode in user's use, " can modify " in turn or " adjust " set-point temperature plan otherwise, with
Preferably matching actual use mode.By regular multistage temporal filtering, associative mode can be found simultaneously based on following situations
(i) based on the continuous calendar day, (ii) based on each common day, (iii) based on each weekend, (iv) with
Based on one day monthly, and/or based on any other daily grouping to there is logical relation with user behavior.Therefore, such as
Fruit observes that specific use relevant to " leave/reach automatically automatically " and/or correcting property are manually entered to continuous Friday
Behavior, then set-point temperature plan of the metering needle to Friday match the use pattern indicated with better.If to continuous
Saturday and Sunday, next Saturday and Sunday, and to subsequent Saturday and Sunday observe with " automatically from
Open/automatic reach " relevant specific use and/or correcting property be manually entered behavior, then adjust the setting on Saturday and Sunday
Point temperature plan detects use pattern with better matching.For another example, if continuous some months arrives on the 2nd day
It observes within 7th day that specific use relevant to " leave/reach automatically automatically " and/or correcting property are manually entered behavior, then adjusts
The 2nd day to the 7th day set-point temperature, etc. of continuous some months.For certain preferred embodiments, similar two days continuous
Two " leave/the reach automatically automatically " events (for example, continuous two common days or identical two days of continuous two weeks) occurred,
(a) in the preset time of every day (for example, in 60 minutes), and (b) without manual correction (for example, without relevant " tight
Lattice " behavior), then program of standards development can be modified automatically, or suggests changing to user.
For some embodiments, Fig. 7 A-7D is illustrated based on occupancy mode and/or correcting property manual input mode (with " oneself
It is dynamic to leave " and/or the repetition example of " automatic to reach " it is related) set point plan modification an example.Figure 71 0 is for scheming
Fig. 7 A, the real work set point in 7B and 7C is set forth in the normal set point of 7A-7C, Figure 71 2,714 and 716.Finally,
Figure 72 0 gives in Fig. 7 D the set point plan of " adjusted " or modification.For this example, as the time is observed, to normal
Set-point temperature indicates the user that its weekend whole day is in, if inputted without any correcting property manual user, " leaving automatically "
Characteristic will make state become leaving-normal (Fig. 7 A-7C) at the noon on Wednesday in several weeks, then in the about afternoon 5 of these days:
00 triggering " automatic-to reach " mode.This can correspond to voluntarily go to the retired of local library on Wednesday.This is reliable
Establish this mode after (for example, after continuous three Wednesday occur), as illustrated in fig. 7d, to subsequent Wednesday and after
All Wednesday, system automatic " adjustings " or " modification " set-point temperature plan automatically, to morning 10:00 and afternoon 5:00 it
Between interval contemplate " a leaving " period because system estimates that user is certain to go out in the grade periods now
For some embodiments, a mode is reliably established by two continuous events (for example, being based only upon in Fig. 7 A-C
Two in three Wednesday, rather than all three Wednesday).In addition, system can't fit automatically for some embodiments
The plan of " adjusting " or modification is answered, but can be suggested to user.If for having shown that the tendency for updating plan to " inquiry "
Property, then this kind setting will be executed, rather than uses them automatically.For some other embodiment, only in estimated cost and/or
When energy conservation is higher than preset threshold or percentage, system can be suggested using new plan 720 or to user automatically.
Importantly, if in Fig. 7 A-7C some day in the grade days have occurred correcting property user input (referred to as " stringent "
User's input), then it will not be according to automatic " adjusting " set point plan shown in Fig. 7 D.May occur in some cases correcting property or
" stringent " input, wherein (i) triggered it is automatic-leave mode, the spy that (ii) " automatic to reach " characteristic triggering state changes
It measures and is not felt well using Underactivity (after having filtered " background " event), and (iii) user, and move towards thermostat
Temperature is turned up.By way of example, situation may not be to go to library in morning Wednesday 10:00, and user reads upstairs, only
The thermostat of first layer does not detect someone, and at night 12:00 triggering it is automatic-leave, subsequent user is at about noon 12:
45 feel uncomfortable, and temperature is then downstairs turned up manually.Since " stringent " input of user proves algorithm to this kind of potential mould
Formula " misjudgment ", set point plan have no Figure 72 0 shown in automatic " adjusting " to Fig. 7 D, and in one embodiment,
Reverse weighting to this kind of potentially multiple mode part, so that the correction of higher degree is needed, to establish the isotype in future.Have
The thing of benefit, for more commonly situation, " stringent " input of user can also be used for adjusting the filtering class to probe algorithm application is occupied
Type and/or grade because for the time interval for causing " stringent " correcting property to input, " inactive " detected be one not just
True conclusion.
" leave/reach automatically automatically " algorithm of above-described embodiment is triggered by the use information being currently detected, another
In kind embodiment, provided based on empirical using possibility timetable (being established by thermostat units in an extended period)
Itself automatic triggering of " leave automatically/automatic reach " algorithm.For a kind of specific implementation, it is empirical using may performance when
Between table be expressed as the time diagram (empirical using possibility or EOP) of scalar value, scalar value represents one or several people every
One particular point in time uses the probability of enclosure space.Also the other expression reacted and occupied statistics and/or probability can be used
Any variation (for example, probability-distribution function) or stochastic variable explanation, rather than use be directed to EOP single scalar value.
For a kind of embodiment, thermostat units are set as one or more times in one day for meeting following standard
Itself triggering, which enters, leaves-normal condition: (i) normal set point plan is to plan the index of " being in " time interval, (ii)
Empirical acquistion probability (EOP) lower than preset threshold (for example, be lower than 20%), (iii) take sensor does not detect can not
Determine in enclosure space whether a large amount of activities of someone, and (iv) do not detect sufficiently long time interval using sensor
Sufficiently low activity (for example, leave state confidence level window or ASCW), so as in a manner of " tradition " above-mentioned enter " automatically from
Open " mode.Once meet these conditions, and " automatic-leave " mode itself triggers, will according to " tradition "
The identical mode of automatic mode (for example, by " reaching automatically " triggering, manual correction user input, etc.) continues to restore " certainly
It is dynamic to leave " mode.Based on " learned lesson " set-point temperature plan automatic adjustment (for example, based on use pattern and/or with
" leaving automatically " mode repeats the relevant correcting property manual input mode of example) it can be based on " traditional mode " triggering observed
Leave mode and itself triggering automatically leave pattern algorithm automatically.
It has been found that when be based only upon " tradition " automatically leave triggering method adjusting (wherein only consider currently, at once
Use information) compare, itself triggering of above-mentioned " leaving automatically " mode (is at least partially based on empirical using probability
(EOP)) set-point temperature plan " adjusting " more complete and with more statistics accuracy is provided.With institute in generation EOP measurement
The relevant reason of the big numerical value of activity detection data sample becomes a relatively useful basis, and system is based on
This basis executes the service condition " test " that " automatic-to leave " process provides.It, can be by " automatic-to leave " from the point of view of on the one hand
Process regards a kind of approach from the ecosystem automatic " promotion " or " promotion " of user as, to learn user's use pattern
Further details, and do not need the instantaneous accuracy for uniquely depending on take sensor hardware
For some embodiments, Fig. 8 is to illustrate that the enclosure space for having air conditioning various states can be classified as
Schematic diagram.The embodiment of Fig. 8 represents the one or more characteristics for leaving/reaching automatically algorithm automatically, which can be used as shown in Fig. 5
Embodiment alternative, or in some cases, can be combined with embodiment shown in fig. 5 before.Although note that
The range currently illustrated does not receive this limitation, but there is no individual " sleep " states for the embodiment of Fig. 8.Replace independent
" sleep " state has been to provide a condition into-normal condition 820 is left, if there is the enclosure space of air conditioning does not have
Have a business, the time on the same day not at night 8 points between 8 a.m..When for 8 points of non-businesses between 8 a.m. at night
Between, will from leave-normal condition 820 is excessively to the state of being in 810.
Shown in Fig. 8 is three states: state of being in 810, and in the state, thermostat is usually according to a scheme program
(unless under overriding set point manually)；Leave-normal condition 820 (be referred to as herein " being left in one day " and/or
" being left automatically in one day " state), in this state, set-point temperature is arranged to Power Saving Class, such as AVST.For some
Embodiment, in order to simple, AST and AVST are arranged to identical temperature.According to the status transition of enclosure space to " being in " shape
The ad hoc fashion of state 810, " being in " state 810 may also be referred to as " leaving " state, or " reaching manually " state (due to detecting
Occupancy activity, thermostat returns to " being in " state), or " reach manually " state (manipulates or remote user since user is practical
Current set-point temperature is changed by cloud remote control apparatus, thermostat returns to " being in " state).
For some embodiments, if there is one of following conditions, state of being in 810, which will be changed into, leaves-normal shape
State 820:(i) meet all first set conditions 812, or (ii) meets all second set of conditions 814.Condition 812 includes enabling certainly
It is dynamic to leave characteristic, and from the movable time is finally detected greater than ASCW, for some embodiments, which is arranged to
120 minutes.For some embodiments, activity sensor data will be looked by " collection " to " bucket " based on the time, the algorithm
Continuous empty barrel is looked for, to determine the occupancy activity not detected.For the embodiment of some first choices, the period of these barrels is
5 minutes, and ASCW most starts to be equal to 24 buckets (corresponding approximately to 2 hours).But for some embodiments, it can also make
Other schemes of (no to occupy) situation are occupied with the bucket of other sizes and the quantity of bucket, or implementation detection.
Condition 812 also includes at least effectively leaving set-point temperature in current set-point temperature, because into " leaving "
State will not energy conservation.As it was noted above, entering the condition of automatic leave state in one day from " being in " state for domestic installations
The time for further including the same day should be between 8 a.m. and at 8 points in evening (or other suitable " non-sleep " period).For quotient
Other limitations are not used with facility, because the sleep of user is not usually a problem, so if do not detect
It is very good to enter energy-efficient " leaving " state in these times for activity.Condition 812 further include since nearest operation when
Between should be lower than ASCW, wherein operation refer to wake up manually with the interaction of thermostat (such as swivel becket/disk or inwardly click),
Or by remote web page and/or PC interactive interfacing, thermostat is made to leave " leaving " state.For example, user in oneainstance
Dwelling is left in morning 9:00, and goes to office.In office, user's Telnet (directly logs in thermostat or passes through
Included the cloud server discussed in application what is specified jointly), and the setting of some thermostats is carried out in morning 10:00
Change (morning 9:00 add 2 hours ASCW), due to operation (passing through web-page interface) occur morning 10:00 actually at noon
It does not enter into before and leaves-normal condition (morning 10:00 adds 2 hours ASCW), rather than before morning 11:00.
Condition 812 also includes since the set point finally planned changes (or " encountering " plan set point changes recently)
Time greater than ASCW.For example, if user has left dwelling at 5 points in the afternoon, and 6 points of tune for having a plan at night
Fixed point changes, and ASCW is 2 hours, then will not enter leave state before 8 points at night, rather than at night before 7 points.
Condition 812 further includes, if thermostat for example, user walks close to thermostat, and passes through rotating circular disc tune according to manual overriding work
Current set point (opposite with using setting device that set point is arranged) is saved, or performs row of equal value by remote network interfaces
For automatic leave state would not be entered as long as overriding set point is effective manually.It note that for some embodiments, encountering
The set point planned next time before, any manual overriding will keep effective.It is in, and has been turned up manually general if user is sick
Logical set-point temperature, then this condition is just used for very much.Assuming that the set point planned on the day of does not come into force, overriding will manually for this
Continue to work end of day, usually at this moment have the set point of a plan that temperature is turned up, therefore makes to override manually in vain.Advantage
It is since this overrides condition manually, to be in when user is sick, and manually adjusted disk before returning on bed, then
Automatic-the mode of leaving will not come into force in the same day.Condition 812 further includes that thermostat cannot be in "Off" mode.Another
Part 812 is, if thermostat to take sensor whether produce sufficiently reliable occupancy situation data do not have it is enough " credible
Degree " (as it is one or more jointly it is specified included apply described in), would not be into leaving-normal condition 820.For example,
If thermostat 300 be mounted on cannot movable position in " seeing " family well, such as thermostat is located at after bookshelf or nothing
Method receives the entrance hall end of many information.By automatically processing sensing data, thermostat 300 whithin a period of time after installation
The advantages of be, if it is determined that cannot reliably distinguish non-activity and occupant activity, thermostat can be due to " low sensor information
Confidence level " and keep itself unqualified.
It condition 814 input the case where being mounted with multiple thermostats in the same building, hereafter will be to such case into one
Walk explanation.According to being discussed in detail hereafter, it is preferable that all mounted thermostats all should be before entering leave state
" agreement ".If having another and thermostat in the building, which leaves marker bit (AAF) and is set as " beating automatically
Open ", as long as then thermostat itself does not detect any activity in ASCW, which can also be set the AAF of oneself to
" opening ", the marker bit will not become " closing ", automatic-leave enabling, and the time at night 8 points between 8 a.m. (such as
Fruit is non-commercial building).It note that for some embodiments, current thermostat can't interfere another thermostat to enter
The decision of leave state, even if current thermostat has lower sensors'credence.
This refers to Fig. 8 again now, enters automatic leave state (leaving-normal condition 820) in one day in thermostat, will
It is maintained at the state, until (i) meets all first set conditions 816, thermostat will return to " being in " shape in this case
State 810, or (ii) meet all second set of conditions 822, and in this case, thermostat will turn away from-have a holiday state 830.
In order to which leave state automatic out of one day returns to " being in " state, condition 816 includes that " automatic to reach " determines.To various different former
Because a particularly useful condition realizes a kind of " bolt " mechanism to leave state automatic in one day, when thermostat is switched to one
In a few days when automatic leave state, it is " locked " to the state whithin a period of time, and will not return to " being in " state, even if
It might have automatic reach to determine, this period become into automatic reach herein and inhibits window (AAIW).If from entering certainly
The time of dynamic-normal condition 820 will inhibit in window (AAIW) (will further discuss with reference to Fig. 9) in automatic reach, which will
It is maintained at automatic-normal condition 820, even if detecting activity and/or encountering the set point of a plan.According to some implementations
Example, AAIW are set as 30 minutes.If have passed through the AAIW time, then the detected event in the continuous bucket of N causes to return to back
Family's state 810.For some embodiments, the value of adjustable N so that automatically reach function to detect activity it is more sensitive or
It is more insensitive.For some embodiments, most start to set two for the value of N, that is to say, that if there is no two continuous buckets
The activity detected will then occur to reach automatically.If have passed through the AAIW time, the plan set point encountered can also cause
It is automatic to reach.It is interactive manually with the interact manually of thermostat (such as by swivel becket or inwardly click) and/or remote access, example
Such as by remote access network facility, thermostat can also be made to leave " leave-normal " state 820, and return to state of being in
810.Finally, if left automatically, characteristic is disabled or thermostat is closed, and thermostat will return to the state of being in 810.It should be clear that
Left automatically described in Fig. 4 A-10B and automatically arrival function preferably with the independence of thermostat 300 " leaving manually " and " arrive manually
Up to " function provides together.For some embodiments (as it is one or more jointly it is specified included apply described in), Yong Huneng
It is enough to select " leaving button " by coming into thermostat disk and selecting " leaving " on menu, or by using remote access facility
Or menu selection, directly and instantaneously wake up " leaving " mode.(it can be described as " leaving manually " mode) in this case, some
In the specific implementation, thermostat always with energy saving AST (leave state temperature) operation, and with plan indicate the case where it is unrelated, also with
Any resource-user cost method detected is unrelated, until user makes thermostat leave " leaving manually " mode by " reaching manually ".
For some embodiments, (such as revolved by rotation by walking close to disk and providing any kind of input to reach " reaching manually "
Change is inwardly clicked), or any kind of interaction is carried out by logging in remote network access facility.
Referring now again to Fig. 8, if meeting all conditions 822, thermostat can from leave-normal condition 820 returns
It returns and leaves-have a holiday state 830.In order to enter " leave-have a holiday " state 830, since the time finally detecting activity (or most
Not empty bucket afterwards) VSCW, the specific implementation for some first choice should be greater than, which is 2 days (or 48 hours).In addition, from
The time (for example, user clicks interaction by rotating ring and/or inwardly) that last operation starts should also be as being greater than VSCW.
For some embodiments, if meeting all conditions 832, thermostat can be directly entered from the state of being in 810
Leave-have a holiday state 830.Note that in many situations, will be from leaving-normal condition 820, which enters, to be left-state of having a holiday
830, rather than enter from the state of being in 810.But in other situations, thermostat state can be directly entered from the state of being in
Leave-have a holiday state.Therefore, daily there are four plan set point (represent wake up, work, night and sleep) but user stops
In the typical simple scenario that vacation is left, for preceding a couple of days, thermostat will the transition between " leave-normal " and " being in ", it is right
It " is in " state in each plan point from " leave-normal " return, then after each ASCW (for example, 2 hours) expires
Turn away from-normal condition, it is known that until reaching VSCW.If mode that thermostat is exactly in when reaching VSCW " being in ",
" leave-have a holiday " is then transitted directly to from " being in ", but if thermostat is just in " leave-normal " mould when reaching VSCW
Formula, then be directly transitioned into from " leave-normal " " leave-have a holiday ".It note that if planning set point frequently changes (frequency height
In ASCW, such as a set point per hour), then it will not enter and leave-normal condition, and thermostat will reach VSCW
When directly " leave-have a holiday " from " being in " entrance.Condition 832, which is said, to be indicated, is left-is had a holiday to enter from " being in " state 810
State 830, it is necessary to which enabling leaves function automatically, and activity sensor should have enough confidence levels.In addition, in condition
In the case where 822, the time (or last not empty bucket) since finally detecting activity and the time since last operation
(for example, user clicks interaction by rotating ring and/or inwardly) should also be as being greater than VSCW.
For some embodiments, if meeting arbitrary condition 834, shape of being in will be returned to from leaving-having a holiday state 830
State 820.Any manual operation (come into or webpage) of condition 834 including thermostat, N number of continuous bucket (such as every 5 minutes 2 buckets)
In movable detection, or disabling it is automatic-leave state or close time of thermostat.
It, now will be further detailed about ASCW (leave state confidence level window) and AAIW (automatic reach inhibits window)
It states.Fig. 9, which is illustrated, determines related Figure 91 0 and 920:(i with following aspect Best Times threshold value) the automatic leave state of triggering, and
(ii) based on the empirical data from practical family population, temporarily inhibit to automatically achieve state when entering automatic leave state.
In the example of figure 9, single price is tested, but passes through the suitable statistical combination of independent structure, to multiple families
It summarizes and has obtained this method in front yard.Experiment can carry out in the following manner.For the NDAYS period (can be one 30 days when
Between section, but other time section be also suitable), to family track take sensor activity, and with the time of preset time period bucket retouch
It states, such as 5 minutes (but other time bucket is also suitable).More particularly, the characteristics of occupying mode is a binary function E
(k), for any specific k-th of time bucket, if the activity not detected, which is that " 0 " (does not have " to occupy thing
Part "), if there is the activity detected, then the function is " 1 " (not having " occupying event ").Fig. 9 gives the figure of function E (k)
910, which depicts daily 288 time bucket (24 hours divided by 5 minutes) to the NDAYS period, and wherein label 912 represents
Each occupies event.For a kind of embodiment, preferably describes specific occupancy event and have to the subsequent occupancy event then occurred
Then some predicted values handle the information, with determine it is best automatic-leave threshold value.After occupying event drafting to each
After the figure for occupying occurrence time, these figures of all occupancy events are merged together to form a histogram, can be looked for
To this feature.From the perspective of mathematics, these steps are equivalent to calculate the auto-correlation of function E (k), provide in Figure 92 0 this
Auto-correlation.It note that the actual experience data for obtaining from family population, auto-correlation function (or suitable smooth version) tool
There is a central lobe, the central lobe is recessed slightly around in first time value T1, and subsequent first side lobe starts subsequent
Time T2 is higher by this trough.For a kind of embodiment of first choice, value T1 be trigger automatic leave state time threshold (ASCW,
It is aforementioned), and the difference (T2-T1) of the two is temporarily to inhibit automatic when entering automatic leave state (AAIW, aforementioned) to reach state
Time interval.It is serial true it was found that, T1 tends to waving about 120 minutes at one, and T2 tends to shake
Pendulum about 150 minutes.In a preferred embodiment, have threshold value T1 used in a set of all thermostats provided to client and
T2 calculates these numbers based on a large amount of statistical sample during research and development of products.For another preferred embodiment, in Fig. 9
Program (for example, occupying track of issues, auto-correlation determines T1 and T2 from the valve of autocorrelogram) it is independent to each by thermostat
Device execute automatically, a set of T1 and T2 threshold value for being most suitable for each specific threshold is thus provided to client, and schemes E (k)
It is sent to cloud server, cloud server executes any variant of the auto-correlation and/or other statistic algorithms, with true
Determine the optimum value of T1 and T2, then downloads to individual thermostat from cloud server by these values.
For some embodiments, certain adjustment or adaptation can be carried out, with improve it is automatic-leave automatic arrival behavior.Such as
Fruit user is manually entered " leaving mode " (can be described as " leave-manually " state, do not provide in Fig. 8), it assumes that house nobody.
Correspondingly, for some embodiments, checked during " leave-manually " state, to check whether to pass through activity sensor
Detect automatic arrival state (for example, detecting sensor activity in last N number of continuous bucket).A kind of implementation for first choice
Example counts if detecting sensor activity in last N number of continuous bucket before " leave-manually " state in 30 minutes
Word N adds one.
For another example, if user has carried out manual temperature setting to the temperature lower than last energy consumption set point
(for example, manually overriding), then assume that user, this is done because wish that building becomes " vacant ".This can be simple
It is construed to enter " leaving manually " state, and if detects sensing in last N number of continuous bucket 30 minutes before
Device activity, then number N add one (so that automatic arrival it is more insensitive-for example, " more firm ", needs more noisy in this case
Could trigger it is automatic-reach determining).
For some embodiments, it is based on " stringent " behavior regulation ASCW.For example, if leaving-normal condition 820 entering
First 30 minutes in, user manually by the device from leave-normal condition rebound is in state 810, then ASCW will increase.?
It was found that based on these situations, increase at 30 minutes ASCS be suitable for improving it is automatic-leave function in many cases
Operation.It is an option that the principle for being similar to foregoing teachings (related to Fig. 7 A-7D) can be with automatic work, with " readjustment "
ASCW, if it becomes very big, automatic leave state is seldom activated substantially in one day.
For some embodiments, it is above-mentioned it is automatic-leave function and the other aspects of 300 hardware of thermostat operation are integrated, from
And other required results can be obtained.By example, the embodiment preferred for one, the presence of AAIW and environmental benefits in
It saves and occupies other power consumptions that detection hardware is used and/or triggered.Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, thermostat 300
In use detection hardware (such as passive infrared line sensor, the neighbouring sensor of active infrared line, ultrasonic sensor or its
Its sensor) it is disabled during AAIW, so if not using any response action, it is necessary to detect.For other head
The embodiment of choosing, " leaving manually " mode and/or leave-have a holiday can be disabled for similar reasons in mode it is hard using detection
Part.
According to jointly specified US patent number 13/269,501 (aforementioned), specified US patent number 13/ jointly
275,307 (aforementioned), and it is common specified, and the other applications (aforementioned) being included herein, for some embodiments, thermostat
300 can be advanced, more inductions, microprocessor control intelligence or " learning type " thermostat, it is capable of providing various processing
The combination of ability, has a graceful user interface, network connectivty and energy saving capability (including it is described at present it is automatic-leave/
It is automatic to reach algorithm), while not needing, or power supply line from home wall socket so-called " C line " from HVAC system, i.e.,
Just in this way, these advanced functions need bigger instantaneous power (for example, calling relay to obtain less from one or more HVAC
Electric energy).Thermostat 300 realizes these targets (or equivalent onboard energy-accumulating medium) by using replaceable battery, works as hardware
When power is used below the power that " stealing " can provide safely, they can charge, and be greater than stealing when hardware power uses
When the power that can be provided safely, they will discharge, to provide required additional electrical energy.
In order to be operated under " battery consciousness " mode, promoting to reduce power consumption and extend the service life of rechargeable battery, institute
Thermostat 300 is stated to be equipped with: (i) relatively powerful and power consumption also big first processor (such as Texas instrument company
AM3703 microprocessor), can the more complicated function of quick execution, such as drive the visible interface display for facilitating user, and
Execute various algebraic manipulations；Second processor (such as Texas that relatively low and power consumption is relatively low with (ii) power
The MSP430 microprocessor of state instrument company), for executing the lesser task of intensity, sensing is occupied including driving and control
Device.In order to save valuable electric power, the first processor is remaining " sleep " state when used for a long time, and is needing its energy
It " wakes up " when power, and the second processor relative durations (although preferably slowing down in short-term or inactivating some internal clockings, so as to
Power saving) execute the relatively low task of its power consumption.First and second processor is complementary, to make the second processor
It " wake-up " first processor, this function can be defined as " waking up " facility when some events occurs.The grade wake-ups are set
Apply a part opening and closing that can be used as different function and/or power saving target.For example, one " waking up PROX " can be provided
Facility makes the second processor in the peri position sensor (PROX, as what Silicon Labs SI was provided has by activation
1142 type peri positions/ambient light sensor of I2C interface) it detects when close to thermostat instrument board, at " wake-up " described first
Device is managed, so that the latter shows related data to the user come into and is ready to more quick when their hand touches instrument board
Reaction.Another example is installation " waking up PIR " facility, so that the second processor can be mobile by passive infrared
Sensor (PIR, such as the 1998 type dual-element photodetectors of PerkinElmer DigiPyro PYD) detects that thermostat is attached
When closely there are objects moving, the first processor is waken up.Obviously, the wake-up PIR is reached and asynchronous with automatic, since it is desired that
The continuous bucket induction PIR activity of n times could wake up automatic arrival, however primary enough moving events can trigger and " wake up PIR
It wakes up ".
In general, it can be activated when waking up PROX facility major part, because PROX sensor is preferably configured to examine
It is mobile (such as in 0.75 meter or shorter of thermostat of distance) to survey annual significantly user.Some preferred implementations wherein
In example, the wake-up PIR facility is never activated under " being in " state, avoids the unnecessary wake-up first processor,
To reduce the power consumption of thermostat, while the wake-up PIR facility is activated under automatic leave state, to make described first
Processor can assess the movable meaning of the movement detected (the automatic arrival for having the continuous bucket sensed activity of n times including entering).
But in a wherein preferred embodiment, the wake-up PIR facility keeps losing during AAIW (automatic reach inhibits window)
It is living, so as to further power saving, because the first processor will not enter within the time limit arrives expression patterns automatically.
In a preferred embodiment, it wakes up below and first processor wakes up rule and is applicable in.As described above, the wake-up
PIR facility inactivates under " being in " state.In the state of normal outgoing, if the time from entering the state is shorter than AAIW
(such as 30 minutes) then wake up PIR facility inactivation, but a timer is arranged and wakes up after 30 minute time interval
The first processor.It is described if the time from entering the state is longer than AAIW in the state of described normal outgoing
The activation of PIR facility is waken up, and a timer is set so as in when the coming into force of next set point of the thermostat time table
Between wake up the first processor.If issuing raw wake-up PIR time, the wake-up PIR facility quilt in normal outer do well
Inactivation, and the time in remaining time " bucket " time interval determines (for example, 5 minutes) for reaching automatically, and is arranged one
Timer is to wake up the first processor when next " bucket " time interval starts.This have the advantage that can be
It is somebody's turn to do power saving in the remaining time of " bucket " time interval, because the wake-up PIR event has been filled with the bucket, and during the bucket
Any surplus induction wake up PIR event will be it is extra, only waste electric power.Then, the wake-up PIR facility is next
A " bucket " time interval reactivates when starting.In short, advantage is that monitoring " N " secondary continuous bucket can be kept while power saving
Sensed activity.
In addition, similar electricity-saving mechanism is also applied for the state of being away on a vacation.Under the state of being away on a vacation, if should from entering
The time that state rises is shorter than time limit value (for the AAIW or other suitable " latch " periods), and at this moment the wake-up PIR is set
Inactivation is applied, but is provided with a timer to wake up the first processor after time interval.Described outer
During state of spending a holiday out, if the time from entering the state is longer than time limit value, the at this moment wake-up PIR facility activation,
And timer is arranged to wake up the first processor afterwards at 24 hours (or other suitable " sanitary inspection " time intervals).
PIR event is waken up if had occurred under the state that is away on a vacation, at this moment the wake-up PIR facility inactivation, the time " bucket "
The remaining duration of time interval determines for reaching automatically, and a timer is arranged and is used at next " bucket " between the time
The first processor is waken up when separating the beginning, thus the power saving within the remaining time of current " bucket " time interval.
Below more details in relation to installing the operation of more thermostats will be provided by some embodiments.Figure 10 A is shown
A kind of special shell, such as family, it is connected respectively to two different HVAC systems there are three thermostat in some embodiments
On.The shell 1000 has thermostat 1010 and 1020, and the thermostat is for controlling HVAC system 1042 and upstairs downstairs
HVAC system 1040.When the thermostat is connected with the same subscriber account in management server 1060 based on cloud in logic,
Three thermostats preferably mutually cooperate, and shell provides best HVAC control.The equal conjunction between three thermostats
Make to be colleague's cooperation, or supervise them for supervision cooperation namely the central management server based on cloud, as described
One or more masters of two thermostats, mediation, trouble-shooter, arbitrator and/or messenger.What one example provided leaves automatically
Ability is improved, and " leaving " operation mode is only when described two thermostats all sense non-activity in in the period of requiring
Activation.In one embodiment, each thermostat detect in in the period of requiring inactivate when, send a leave state
" ticket " gives the management server 1060, but will not enter before receiving the license done so from the management server " from
Open " state.Meanwhile each thermostat will send one and cancel its leave state when detecting in shell has occupancy activity
Ticket.Only when three thermostats all send leave state ticket, the central server 1060 will send leave state license
Give all three thermostats.Into after collective's leave state, if any thermostat senses occupancy activity, the thermostat
Revocation information can be sent to management server 1060 based on cloud, the latter will send leave state license revocation, and (or " arrivals " is ordered
Enable) to all three described thermostats.In the case of without departing from the scope of the present invention, can provide it is numerous other types of at
Cooperation to thermostat (namely identical thermostat of account in the management server).
According to some embodiments, Figure 10 B illustrates the execution of multifunction constant temperature device installation settings and leaves some of function automatically
Example.In this way, this group of thermostat (including thermostat 1010, thermostat 1020 and thermostat 1030) can cooperate offer
Enhancing leaves function automatically, as follows.Each thermostat maintains one group of state information object, including (i) part automatically from
Ready (AAR) label is opened, reflects whether the separate thermostat identifies oneself to carry out the preparation left automatically, (ii) is one or more same
Grade leaves ready (AAR) label automatically, reflects whether every group of other thermostats identify oneself to carry out the preparation left automatically.Each perseverance
The local AAR of warm device is marked, and a peer AAR of one group of state information object as thermostats other in group is marked and gone out
It is existing.Each thermostat can change the local AAR label of its own, but its peer AAR label only can be read.This is central cloud
The common function that management server is frequently exchanged with thermostat, in this way, this group of state information object of each thermostat
Up-to-date information is kept, especially holding peer AAR label is newest.Accomplish this point, for example, passing through each constant temperature of programming
Device at once itself part AAR mark any change be passed to management server, meanwhile, management server the change immediately
It is communicated to each others thermostat in group, updates corresponding peer AAR label.It is directly at the same level to peer's biography between thermostat
The other methods reached can also be used in the case where not departing from current method range.
According to a preferred embodiment, thermostat operates under consistent mode, in this way, if all AAR marks of the group
Will is set as "Yes" or " ready ", and each thermostat can only achieve actual " leaving " state.Therefore, in any specific time
Point, in group all thermostats will " leaving " state or they not in " leaving " state.In turn, if wherein one
Set or two sets of standards can be met, and each thermostat is configured or programmed to be arranged its AAR labeled as "Yes".When all following
Situation is really that can satisfy first set standard: (i) needs one section of deactivation time flu spacer according to the sensor of the thermostat
Should inactivate, so as to be equipped with its passive infrared (PIR) movable sensor, active infrared peri position sensor (PROX) and other account for
With sensor etc.；(ii) thermostat is " leaving confidence automatically ", and just verified its can have statistics meaning before
The enough time point induction of justice has the occupancy activity of statistical significance；And (iii) meets the basis that other leave mode automatically and " closes
Rational criteria " leaves function as non-deactivated before (a) user automatically；If (b) shell is not a business, the time is in the morning 8
Point arrived between at 8 points in evening；(c) thermostat is not in close pattern；(d) " leaving " state temperature is at this moment warmer than current
It spends more energy saving；And (e) user is not through the management server based on cloud and interacts with thermostat remote.Simultaneously occur with
When all situations, meet second set of standard: (i) needs one section of deactivation time interval according to the sensor of the thermostat
Induction inactivation；(ii) at least the AAR label of other thermostat is "Yes" in group；And (iii) meet it is above-mentioned " rationally
Property " standard.Second set of alternative criteria is more advantageous, it can set "Yes" for the AAR label of each thermostat, can
All thermostats can contribute to its take sensor data in group to occur, and leave determination automatically to carry out group, i.e.,
Just wherein one or more be not in " leaving confidence automatically " if mode be also in this way, at least one element be " automatically from
Set letter " just.The reliability and scalability that feature is left in the energy conservation automatically can be improved in this method: passing through shell
Reliability is improved in the multisensor position of surrounding, passes through a thermostat " displacement " for making to lead to thermostat " leaving untrusted "
(for example, the sensitivity for being mounted on improper position limitation PIR behind obstacle) will not influence validity or the applicability of group to mention
Enhanced scalability.
It will be appreciated that the above method has spread in more primary thermostats and/or more auxiliary thermostat cases.This
Outside, also more laudable to be, although " primary thermostat " word that the present invention uses, is not required for primary thermostat
The HVAC systems different from shell are one-to-one relationship.For example, the device in " areas " multiple in shell can be used one
A HVAC system service, because controllable damper can stop and/or re-direct the air-flow in HVAC system different
Area.In this case, each area may have the primary thermostat, and each primary thermostat is all connected to
HVAC system and suitable damper, to adjust its each area.
As shown, in the case where 1050, two 1010 in three temperature controllers and 1020 AAR indicate this be for
"Yes", this indicates not will receive induction in the case where meeting other conditions 1010 and 1020 in ASCW.However third temperature control
The AAR mark of device 1030 is "No", and for example, it has just received induction.It is both configured to if not all temperature controllers
Indicate "Yes", then order is inconsistent and is that dormant state does not allow any temperature controller to pass through.An example in 1050 situations, only
There is a device to be provided separately within 1000 buildings long periods, therefore the only display of temperature controller 1030 is used.
In the case where 1052, all temperature controllers 1010,1020 and 1030 can be run, and will not be felt in ASCW
It answers, and AAR traffic sign placement is "Yes".Therefore, what can order enter dormant state be inconsistency and three temperature controllers that
The realization of this isolation.
In the case where 1052,1020 in three thermostats cannot continuous service under sense state again.It draws an analogy,
Permitted newly to install, may is that mounted point bad (for example, " ken " is greatly limited by wall or door) other two thermostats
1010 and 1030 energy continuous services, and do not show and incuded in ASCW, AAR traffic sign placement is "Yes".In such case
Under, temperature controller 1020 has sensed other "Yes" states, and the mark for also changing correspondingly oneself is "Yes".Determine it is inconsistent, and
And enter dormant state.At this point, temperature controller 1020 maintains the operation of lower bound degree, refuse the life of temperature controller 1010 and 1030 " rejection "
It enables.
Figure 11 is the example that an auto-counter is shown.In addition to part mentioned above, is continuously contacting with bucket and felt
In the case where answering, isolation is transformed into standby mode in 300 energy of temperature controller.In some concrete conditions, if it is desired to temperature control
Device 300 is more easier by realize, " N ", which may be marked, is and each barrel can have five minutes time.In the case where other
" N " may drop to 1 (that is, single bucket).Typically, when automatism isolation function is triggered, according to one or more embodiment party
Case, it may occur however that such situation finds that temperature controller 300 is in dormant state and also needs some intervals after user goes home
Mistake before time reparation allows machine to be set according to auto sleep from auto sleep and returns to standby mode.For example, in N=
In the case where 2, the continuous five minutes display working conditions of bucket just need to trigger automatic realization device, but user only goes home five points
Clock, temperature controller 300 is still in dormant state.When temperature controller 300 triggers detector PROX, user walks close to check temperature controller
Dial plate (but without starting dial plate), is at this moment possible that implementation state similar in display and figure upper example,
" auto sleep " mark and effective lobate 1202 structure may be shown at this time.Be here be likely to result in misunderstanding, although
The quantity for having correlation very low, but in user, user has done occur within the scope of device.Such as bottom institute in figure
Show, under other concrete conditions, output display 316 means 1. temperature controllers 300 just in dormant state, 2. neighbouring inductors
The use of the surface PROX is to close to temperature controller 300, still, 3. still have a uncertain interval time that device is made to return to standby shape
State (is shown as 27 seconds) in Figure 11.It is convenient to use person will not obscure, because device clearly shows that dormant state will
Terminate beyond the question.It should be noted that standby mode will terminate according to rule immediately if user operates dial plate,
It enters and the consistent state of Fig. 8., it is more common that under other concrete conditions, it is possible to which auto sleep timer is both because making
User is close and shows that (citing, PROX trigger device user) also shows because user utilizes cloud central controller,
Remaining to dormant state within the uncertain time terminates, whether for the (citing, under an automatic device reaches of what reason
When one setting value), it all will not be normal hibernation state.Therefore, for example, if half past two work exists user in the afternoon
Outside, dormant state starts, and has a setting schedule 3: 45, the person of timely using remotely starts temperature controller in half past two, then such as
Shown in the lower half portion of figure, controlled based on cloud center, using order " terminating in 75 minutes " can be issued except interface, next
A setting reaches the preceding meeting of temperature controller 300 3 45 end dormant state in the afternoon.In other concrete conditions, Figure 11's
Lower half portion shows inverse timing device, the device energy detection trigger device PROX or operation sensing device PIR.The lower half Figure 11
Triggering display operation sensing device PIR provides satisfactory scheme, and user can see that timer is worn from him in scheme
Room is crossed to the display counting near temperature controller 300.
Although in order to which sake of clarity has the narration of above-mentioned detail, however, it will be apparent that without departing substantially from principle
Still change and adjustment are had.It is worth noting that, there are many more other modes to realize program and equipment described herein.Cause
This, this case study on implementation may be considered to be illustrative and not restrictive.Operative body of the invention is not given above
Details limitation, details will make modification in separate statement with co-extensive same level.
