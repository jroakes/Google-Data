Definitions
- This description relates to information queries, and more particularly, to methods and systems for determining characteristics of data queries based on responsive data sets.
- At least some online information may be identified using data queries such as search queries.
- Systems may transmit a data query, typically comprised of query terms, to a query engine (such as a search engine).
- the query engine may then provide the systems with a set of results ("query results").
- the query results indicate data (such as online publications) that is responsive to the data query.
- the query results also include methods of accessing such data (e.g., including online publications) via links such as web links.
- the systems may then access the data such as online publications via the web links.
- data queries may be designed to identify a particular creator of data such as a publisher of online publications.
- the querying system may transmit the data query with information that directly identifies a data creator.
- identifying information may include a domain name associated with the data creator or a descriptive name typically associated with the data creator.
- the querying system will typically select data from the particular data creator in the query results.
- This first example of data queries may be identified as "creator targeting data queries.”
- data queries may be designed to identify classes of information that may be included within data from a variety of different data creators.
- the querying system may transmit the data query with information that identifies the class of information. For example, such identifying information may describe products, services, or other attributes associated with multiple data creators.
- This second example of data queries may be identified as "content targeting data queries.”
- Query engines and related systems may benefit from being able to distinguish between the two described types of data queries. For example, it may be beneficial to determine when a data query seeks to directly identify a data creator as opposed to when a data query seeks to directly identify classes of information that may be included within data from a variety of data creators. Distinguishing data queries in this manner may allow for improved organization of query results and, in the case of creator targeting data queries, may also provide improved interaction between the query engine and the data creators.

- the subject matter described herein relates generally to information queries, and more particularly, to methods and systems for determining characteristics of data queries based on responsive data sets.
- determining analytic relationships in data queries based on responsive data sets may allow for improved organization of query results and, in the case of creator targeting data queries, may also provide improved interaction between the query engine and the data creators. Accordingly, systems and methods of determining analytic relationships in data queries, such as those described below, may be of interest.
- analytic relationship refers to the relationship between a data query and data identified by the data query.
- analytic relationships include, but are not limited to, distinguishing between whether a data query may be classified as a "content targeting query” or a "data-creator targeting query”.
- analytic relationships may identify other patterns of relationships between data queries and data.
- data queries refer to queries that may be used to identify data.
- data queries may represent terms (e.g., search terms) used to identify content such as online publication content.
- data queries may be represented by one or more strings of alphanumeric text including alpha-numeric terms or words.
- data queries may also include voice, image, or video queries. Accordingly, data queries may represent search queries that are used to identify content in electronic resources including online resources.
- query results refer to responsive results that may include data identifiers and data links produced by query processing engine (such as a search engine). In many examples, query results accordingly include one or more links to associated data that may be used to allow access to data associated with one or more data-creators.
- data-creator represents an entity responsible for the generation of a particular piece of data.
- data-creator targeting queries are data queries that are directed towards finding data associated with a particular data-creator.
- data-creator queries may accordingly include information related to the data-creator including a name or variation associated with the data- creator.
- data-creator queries may include information identifying a secondary identifier associated with a data-creator.
- the "data-creator” may also be referred to as a publisher.
- content targeting queries represent data queries that are directed to finding data that is not associated with a particular data- creator. Rather, content targeting queries are data queries that identify only publications having content that is related to a particular content targeting query and may therefore have a plurality of different data-creators (or publishers).
- the systems described herein utilize an analytics engine in communication with a plurality of user systems.
- the analytics engine is also in communication with a plurality of data-creator systems (including, but not limited to, publisher systems) and a plurality of query engine systems (including, but not limited to, a search engine system).
- the analytics engine may also be in communication with a secondary query analytics data repository.
- the described systems may be in communication with one another generally.
- the user systems may interact with the data-creator systems (including publisher systems) and the query engine systems (including search engine systems).
- systems and methods described herein are configured to determine analytic relationships in data queries based on responsive data sets and, more specifically, to classify data queries as one of a content targeting query and a data-creator targeting query based upon the link selection counts associated with the data query.
- interactions between user systems and query results are analyzed by the analytics engine.
- the analytics engine identifies data queries for analysis.
- the analytics engine also receives interaction data from one of several systems.
- the interaction data defines interactions made between the user systems and the query results.
- the interaction data defines the selections made by user systems web links (or other methods of access) provided in the query results. Accordingly, the analytics engine identifies selections made by user systems for particular data provided in query results for each data query.
- the analytics engine analyzes the interaction data to determine the distribution of interactions made by the user systems with respect to the query results. For example, the query engine may identify the number of distinct links ("link selection count”) that are accessed by user systems for each data-creator displayed in a query result for a particular data query. Further, the analytics engine may identify the frequency of selection of each of the distinct links (“link selection frequency") accessed by the user systems. As described, “data-creator targeting queries” primarily receive interaction with links for the particular data-creator (or the particular publisher). Alternately, "content targeting data queries” receive interactions with a variety of data-creators (because no particular data-creator is targeted). Based on the link selection count and the link selection frequency, the analytics engine determines whether the data query is a "data-creator targeting search query” or a "content targeting data query.”
- the determination of whether the data query is a "data-creator targeting query” or a "content targeting data query” may be facilitated by two thresholds.
- the first threshold (a “minimum interaction frequency threshold”) specifies a minimum number of link selections that may be required for a distinct link to be included in the link selection count. Because some interactions may be made in error, the analytics engine may only identify link selections as applying to the link selection count when this minimum interaction frequency threshold is met.
- the second threshold (a "minimum link selection count threshold”) species a minimum number of distinct link selections that may be required for a data query to be classified as a "content targeting data query.”
- the data queries may be created based upon variations of the name of a particular data-creator (or targeted data-creator).
- the domain name for a data-creator may be "EntityA.com” but targeted data queries for this data-creator may include alternate forms and misspellings such as "EntityAA.com” and "Entity A.”
- the analytics engine may be configured to identify that such query terms relate to the targeted data-creators using techniques such as natural language processing or other data classifications. Further, associated search queries for such variant and misspelling forms may be analyzed in conjunction with a standard data query.
- an analytics engine computing device is configured to: (i) identify a data query for analysis from a query repository, (ii) retrieve a plurality of interaction data associated with the data query, wherein the interaction data represents interactions between a plurality of user systems and a query result previously generated based on the data query, wherein the query result includes a plurality of links, (iii) identify a link selection count for each of the plurality of links based on the plurality of interaction data, (iv) classify the data query as one of a content targeting query and a data-creator targeting query based upon the plurality of link selection counts, and (v) generate a query characteristic analysis based upon the classified data query and the plurality of link selection counts.
- the analytics engine is configured to identify data queries (such as search queries) for analysis from a query repository.
- the query repository may be generated on demand, identified manually, or previously generated based upon analysis of data queries captured by the systems described above including the analytics engine, the data-creator systems, and the query engine systems.
- the analytics engine may process multiple data queries simultaneously and therefore classify multiple data queries simultaneously.
- the analytics engine is also configured to retrieve a plurality of interaction data associated with the identified data query.
- the interaction data represents interactions between a plurality of user systems and a query result previously generated based on the data query.
- the query result includes a plurality of links and may also include descriptive information describing the data available based upon a selection of a link.
- the interaction data may be provided in a variety of formats.
- the interaction data is provided by the data- creator or publisher.
- the data-creator may collect directly, or through an intermediary, interaction data generated by user systems accessing their data (e.g., visiting a website associated with the data-creator).
- the collected interaction data may include information that is passed as part of the request URL to fetch the data.
- a query engine e.g., a search engine
- the analytics engine may classify data queries using the methods described below.
- the interaction data is provided by the query engine (e.g., the search engine).
- the query engine is configured to provide query results in response to a data query generated by a user system.
- the query engine is also configured to track interactions between the user system and the query results that may be used to identify characteristics of data queries and classify data queries.
- the query engine may track the data queries it receives, the query results provided in response to each data query, and the selections made from the links presented in query results.
- a data query analytics system may track the interaction data as collected from the query engine and the data-creator and provide such interaction data to the analytics engine. In other examples, combinations of the described systems may interact to provide the interaction data to the analytics engine.
- the analytics engine is also configured to identify a link selection count for each of the plurality of links based upon the plurality of interaction data. This step represents the analytics engine identifying the number of link selections made for each of the links provided in the query results produced by the query engine.
- data-creator targeting queries result in link selections for only links associated with the data-creator.
- content targeting data queries result in a spread of link selections across data provided by a variety of data-creators.
- this step may also involve the analytics engine "resolving" multiple links into one link when such multiple links are all associated with the same data-creator.
- some data-creators may maintain multiple instances of link access to particular data and query engines may produce multiple links to access each of the multiple instances.
- the analytics engine may treat such multiple links as one link because all of the links are associated with the same data-creator.
- the analytics engine identifies "XYZ" for analysis and retrieves interaction data between user systems and the query results from at least one of the data-creator, the query engine, and a query analytics system.
- the interaction data may include link selections (provided by the data-creator) that include the data query as embedded information along with the link selection.
- the interaction data is processed to identify the number of link selections made for each link provided in the query results.
- Such processed interaction data when aggregated to include interactions between multiple user systems and the links provided in the query results, may be presented as follows in the table below (Table 1):
- the analytics engine determines that 99% of the total clicks identified in interaction data for the data query "XYZ" are associated with selections of the data-creator XYZ.com. As elaborated upon below, the analytics engine determines that the data query "XYZ" is a data-creator targeting query.
- Link4 vehicles.com
- the analytics engine identifies "car” for analysis and retrieves interaction data between user systems and the query results from at least one of the data-creator, the query engine, and a query analytics system.
- Processed interaction data when aggregated to include interactions between multiple user systems and the links provided in the query results, may be presented as follows in the table below (Table 2):
- the analytics engine determines that the link selections associated with the data query "car” are distributed across several data-creators. As elaborated upon below, the analytics engine determines that the data query "car” is not a data-creator targeting query, but rather a content- targeting query.
- the analytics engine performs a classification process to classify the data query as one of a content targeting query and a data-creator targeting query based upon the plurality of link selection counts.
- the analytics engine applies a classification algorithm that factors in at least (a) the number of different link selections per data query ("LINK_CNT"), (b) a threshold for the number of different link selections per data query (“LINK CNT TH"), (c) a link selection frequency (“LINK FQ”), and (d) a threshold for link selection frequency (“LINK FQ TH").
- the algorithm may be represented as follows (Algorithm 1):
- the number of link selections and the link selection frequency may be determined by the analytics engine (alone, or in conjunction with the query engine, the data-creator systems, and any other system) processing the interaction data describing the interaction between user systems and the query results.
- the analytics engine computes the threshold for the number of different link selections per data query (represented above as "LINK CNT TH").
- this threshold may be calculated by identifying a sample of data- creator domains with identifiers that are similar to data queries that are overtly content targeting. For example, the query “shoes” may be identified as similar to “shoes.com”, the query “rental cars” may be identified as similar to “rentalcars.com”, and the query “restaurants” may be identified as similar to "restaurants.com.” Such identification may be performed using natural-language processing algorithms or manual entry.
- the analytics engine then may determine the threshold based upon an average number of clicked links for the query results associated with each identified term.
- the analytics engine computes the threshold for link selection frequency ("LINK FQ TH").
- this threshold is determined by initially identifying a sample of data-creator domains with identifiers that are similar to data queries that are data-creator targeting. Such data-creator domains may be identified based on natural language processing and/or manual entry. The analytics engine then identifies link selection frequency that is exceeded by the majority of the identified data-creator domains.
- the analytics engine classifies the data queries.
- the analytics engine may classify the data queries as data-creator targeting or content targeting queries.
- natural language processing algorithms and other data classification algorithms may be applied to assist in the identification of data-creator targeting queries are variants on the data-creator name.
- the classification techniques described may determine that "ABC 1" is a data query that identifies "ABC.com” even though the presence of the "1 " suggests otherwise.
- the analytics engine also may provide an analysis of the link selections (or "traffic patterns") for each classified data query.
- the analysis may substantially represent a textual or graphical depiction of the frequency of selection of the data-creator's data for each reported data query.
- the analytics engine provides this analysis to the data-creator.
- the analytics engine may provide this analysis to any suitable recipient system.
- the analytics engine may also generate a report on data query performance for each classified data query.
- the analytics engine may determine that certain data queries, though popular or associated with sponsorships, may yield comparatively limited performance for a particular data-creator or data- creators.
- the analytics engine may also adapt the query result for each classified data query based on the data classification.
- the analytics engine may determine that comparatively few links are selected from the query results.
- the analytics engine may instruct the query engine to alter the query results to identify more relevant results for user systems.
- the analytics engine also generates a query characteristic analysis based on the classified data queries and the plurality of link selection counts.
- the query characteristic analysis represents a designation of a query classification for each data query along with statistical representations of the link selections and link frequencies associated with each data query. More specifically, the query characteristic analysis may be represented by providing LINK CNT, LINK FQ, and classification data for a particular query in the manner indicated below (Table 3):
- the query characteristic analysis may represent link frequencies as a vector.
- “Link Frequencies Per Selection” may include a vector of the same length as the value of "Link Selection Count”.
- the query characteristic analysis may also include the links associated with each link of the "Link Selection Count” in an order reflected in the vector of "Link Frequencies Per Selection”.
- the query characteristic analysis also may be represented by any graphical depictions representing the data described above. Further, the query characteristic analysis may be applied to improve the results of query engines or to facilitate improved advertising services associated with query engines.
- the methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing one of the following steps: (a) identifying a data query for analysis from a query repository; (b) retrieving a plurality of interaction data associated with the data query, wherein the interaction data represents interactions between a plurality of user systems and a query result previously generated based on the data query, wherein the query result includes a plurality of links; (c) identifying a link selection count for each of the plurality of links based on the plurality of interaction data; (d) classifying the data query as one of a content targeting query and a data-creator targeting query based upon the plurality of link selection counts; (e) generating a query characteristic analysis based upon the classified data query and the plurality of link selection counts; (f) retrieving the plurality of interaction data from at least one of a data-creator system, a query engine, and a query analytics data repository;
- Technical effects of the methods and systems described herein may include: (a) processing interaction data to identify characteristics of user system interactions with query results that are otherwise unavailable due to a lack of access to such aggregated data for other systems; (b) providing query analytics to improve query serving and query result generation; (c) providing query analytics to improve the interaction between user systems and query engines; and (d) improving the presentation of information on a display screen in a manner enabling users to perform the task of obtaining information of interest more efficiently by enhanced organization of the query results.

- Processed interaction data 380 when aggregated to include interactions between multiple user systems 310, 312, 314, and 316 and the links provided in the query results 360, may be presented as follows in the table below (Table 2):
- the analytics engine 340 determines that the link selections 370 associated with the data query 350 of "car” are distributed across several data-creators 330. As elaborated upon below, the analytics engine 340 determines that the data query 350 of "car” is not a data-creator targeting query, but rather a content-targeting query.
- the analytics engine 340 performs a classification process to classify the data query 350 as one of a content targeting query and a data-creator targeting query based upon the plurality of link selection counts.
- the analytics engine 340 applies a classification algorithm that factors in at least (a) the number of different link selections per data query ("LINK_CNT"), (b) a threshold for the number of different link selections per data query ("LINK CNT TH"), (c) a link selection frequency (“LINK FQ”), and (d) a threshold for link selection frequency (“LINK FQ TH").
- the algorithm may be represented as follows (Algorithm 1):
- the number of link selections 370 and the link selection frequency may be determined by the analytics engine (alone, or in conjunction with the query engine, the data-creator systems, and any other system) processing the interaction data 380 describing the interaction between user systems 310, 312, 314, and 316 and the query results 360.
- the analytics engine 340 computes the threshold for the number of different link selections per data query (represented above as "LINK CNT TH").
- this threshold may be calculated by identifying a sample of data-creator domains with identifiers that are similar to data queries that are overtly content targeting. For example, the query “shoes” may be identified as similar to “shoes.com”, the query “rental cars” may be identified as similar to “rentalcars.com”, and the query “restaurants” may be identified as similar to “restaurants.com.” Such identification may be performed using natural -language processing algorithms or manual entry.
- the analytics engine 340 then may determine the threshold based upon an average number of clicked links for the query results associated with each identified term.
- the analytics engine 340 may also factor the number of query results provided into the calculation of the LINK CNT TH.
- the analytics engine 340 computes the threshold for link selection frequency ("LINK FQ TH"). In one example, this threshold is determined by initially identifying a sample of data-creator domains with identifiers that are similar to data queries that are data-creator targeting. Such data-creator domains may be identified based on natural language processing and/or manual entry. The analytics engine 340 then identifies link selection frequency that is exceeded by the majority of the identified data-creator domains.
- the analytics engine classifies the data queries.
- the analytics engine may classify the data queries as data-creator targeting or content targeting queries.
- natural language processing algorithms and other data classification algorithms may be applied to assist in the identification of data-creator targeting queries are variants on the data-creator name.
- the classification techniques described may determine that "ABC 1" is a data query that identifies "ABC.com” even though the presence of the "1 " suggests otherwise.
- the analytics engine 340 also may provide an analysis of the link selections (or "traffic patterns") for each classified data query 350.
- the analysis may substantially represent a textual or graphical depiction of the frequency of selection of the data-creator's data for each reported data query.
- the analytics engine 340 provides this analysis to the data-creator 330.
- the analytics engine 340 may provide this analysis to any suitable recipient system.
- the analytics engine 340 may also generate a report on data query performance for each classified data query 350.
- the analytics engine 340 may determine that certain data queries 350, though popular or associated with sponsorships, may yield comparatively limited performance for a particular data- creator 330 or data-creators 330.
- the analytics engine 340 may also adapt the query result 360 for each classified data query 350 based on the data classification. In one example, the analytics engine 340 may determine that comparatively few links are selected from the query results 360. In such examples, the analytics engine 340 may instruct the query engine 320 to alter the query results 360 to identify more relevant results for user systems 310, 312, 314, and 316.
- the analytics engine 340 also generates a query characteristic analysis based on the classified data queries and the plurality of link selection counts.
- the query characteristic analysis represents a designation of a query classification for each data query along with statistical representations of the link selections and link frequencies associated with each data query.
- FIG. 5 is a diagram of components of one or more example computing devices, for determining analytic relationships in data queries based on responsive data sets using the online data environment that may be used in the environment shown in FIG. 1.
- one or more of computing devices 200 may form content management system (CMS) 106, customer computing device 108 (both shown in FIG. 1), user systems, search engines, and online publication systems, and analytics engine 340.
- FIG. 5 further shows a configuration of databases 126 and 146 (shown in FIG. 1). Databases 126 and 146 are coupled to several separate components within analytics engine 340, content provider data processing system 1 12, and customer computing device 108, which perform specific tasks.
- Analytics engine 340 includes a first identifying component 502 for identifying a data query for analysis from a query repository.
- Analytics engine 340 additionally includes a first retrieving component 504 for retrieving a plurality of interaction data associated with the data query, wherein the interaction data represents interactions between a plurality of user systems and a query result previously generated based on the data query, wherein the query result includes a plurality of links.
- Analytics engine 340 further includes a second identifying component 506 for identifying a link selection count for each of the plurality of links based on the plurality of interaction data.
- Analytics engine 340 also includes a classifying component 508 for classifying the data query as one of a content targeting query and a data-creator targeting query based upon the plurality of link selection counts.
- Analytics engine 340 additionally includes a generating component 509 for generating a query characteristic analysis based upon the classified data query and the plurality of link selection counts.
- databases 126 and 146 are divided into a plurality of sections, including but not limited to, a data query classification module 510, threshold determination algorithms 512, and an interaction data analysis module 514. These sections within database 126 and 146 are interconnected to update and retrieve the information as required.
- any such resulting program having computer-readable and/or computer-executable instructions, may be embodied or provided within one or more computer-readable media, thereby making a computer program product, i.e., an article of manufacture.
- the computer readable media may be, for instance, a fixed (hard) drive, diskette, optical disk, magnetic tape, semiconductor memory such as read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory, etc., or any transmitting/receiving medium such as the Internet or other communication network or link.
- the article of manufacture containing the computer code may be made and/or used by executing the instructions directly from one medium, by copying the code from one medium to another medium, or by transmitting the code over a network.
