(that is, route between the position indicator 106 shown on map denotation 104 and position icon 112).This can be by setting in calculating
The map application run on standby 100 executes, or is executed by remote computing system.Computing system including calculating equipment 100 can
To determine the various aspects of the one or more prediction travelling route from the position of user to solid shop/brick and mortar store position.For example, calculating system
System can determine the estimation traveling time of solid shop/brick and mortar store position, estimation travel distance, estimation traveling cost (for example, based on route
Distance, gas price, the estimation fuel economy of vehicle, the parking fee based on estimation, and/or be based on public transport admission fee), edge
The all or part of transportation condition of route, all or part of weather condition along route, the one or more of route
One or more positions partially identified with another of travel pattern, (one or more) direction of travel of route, route
The degree of approach of (for example, family of user) or other factors associated with travelling route.In some implementations, it can be based on
Round trip or based on from the current location of user to solid shop/brick and mortar store position and to the third place (for example, home address of user)
Stroke, to identify estimation traveling time, distance, cost, traffic or the weather of route.In some implementations, computing system pair
A plurality of difference route makes this determination.For example, two of the solid shop/brick and mortar store position that computing system can identify are driven
Bus or train route line, a bus routes, a train route and a bicycle route.Computing system can determine solid shop/brick and mortar store position
Every identify prediction route various aspects.
Computing system can will be carried out to the various aspects of one or more prediction travelling route of solid shop/brick and mortar store position and standard
Compare, to determine whether to have met standard.In some implementations, one or more has been met in response to computing system determination
Suggestion 114 is presented to the user by standard.In some implementations, standard can be preset value.In some implementations, standard can be with
It is the standard or value of determination according to the received information of computing system.
In the first example, computing system can predict user from the current location of equipment 100 is calculated to the hardware store of Qiao
Solid shop/brick and mortar store position possibility travelling route.In this illustration, computing system can when predicting travelling route use about
The historical information of the preferred travel pattern of user.For example, computing system can identify that tall hardware store is more than half mile, and
User prefers to drive to the position of half miles away.As another example, the accessible instruction user of computing system works as mesh
Ground in half mile of public transport stop when prefer historical information using public transport, determine tall hardware store distance
Public transport stop recognizes the public transit route of tall hardware store less than half mile.As another example, calculate
System can analyze the past behavior of user, more be liked with determining when destination is greater than a miles per hour user apart from public transport stop
It is joyous to be serviced using shared by bus (ride share).Computing system can determine tall hardware store apart from nearest vehicle for public transport
It stands and is greater than one mile, and determine that the prediction from the current location to the solid shop/brick and mortar store position of tall hardware store that calculate equipment 100 multiplies
Vehicle shares travelling route.In some implementations, user can be calculated in equipment 100 by the way that user to be input to, to indicate
Travel pattern.For example, map application can permit user from the approach of driving (direction), public transport approach, walking way
It is selected in diameter, cycling approach, or sharing option of riding is provided.
Continue above-mentioned first example, determine using one or more travel patterns determined from the current location of user to
After the prediction route of tall hardware store, the traveling time of computing system estimation prediction route.Then, computing system advances estimation
Time is compared with traveling time threshold value, to determine whether estimation traveling time is more than traveling time threshold value.Traveling time threshold
Value can be preset value (for example, 30 minutes).Traveling time threshold value is also possible to the value of user setting.For example, computing system can
The user interface for allowing user to select threshold value traveling time value to be presented to user.User can predict that user beats in computing system
It calculates and selects threshold value traveling time value before advancing to specific position or geographic area.In some implementations, it can be based on observing
User preference carry out threshold value.For example, compared to being more than 20 minutes people for generally avoiding stroke, it can be for often continuous
The people to drive 2 hours, is arranged get Geng Gao for threshold value.As another example, threshold value can be user and adopt in historical time section
The average value of the traveling time of stroke, or the average traveling time of the stroke based on user's use add weighted factor.
Determine that estimation traveling time is more than traveling time threshold value in response to computing system, computing system can be to suggest it is determined that generating
114, it sends it to and calculates equipment 100 and show.If estimating that traveling time is no more than estimation traveling time threshold value,
It does not generate and is presented to user and suggest 114.
As the second example, computing system can predict travelling route as discussed above and determine travelling route
Estimation travel distance.Then estimation travel distance can be compared with travel distance threshold value, with determine estimation traveling away from
From whether more than travel distance threshold value.Travel distance threshold value can be it is preset, set by the user, or be based on other letters
Breath, as above for described in traveling time threshold value.For example, prediction route can be Walking Route.Computing system can make
Determine that user generally avoids the walking stroke greater than 1.5 miles with the historical data about user behavior.Computing system can be with
Use 1.5 miles as travel distance threshold value.As another example, the flat of the walking stroke in historical time section can be used
Mean value or weighted average determine the travel distance threshold value of user.Travel distance threshold value can be based in part on prediction traveling road
One or more prediction travel patterns of line.Determine that estimation travel distance is more than travel distance threshold value, meter in response to computing system
Calculation system can be to suggest 114, send it to calculate and equipment 100 and show it is determined that generating.If estimating travel distance
No more than estimation travel distance threshold value, suggest 114 then can not generate and present to user.
As third example, computing system can predict travelling route as discussed above and determine travelling route
Estimation traveling cost.For example, computing system can execute on-line search, to determine the geographic area calculated near equipment 100
The estimated cost of middle per gallon gasoline, and estimate will to be used to advance to prediction route and (or advance to prediction route, then go
Enter the family of user or the current location back to user) gasoline the amount of money.In some implementations, estimated cost is included in reality
The estimated cost stopped at or near the position of body shop.As another example, prediction route can be related to public transport, and count
Calculation system can determine the estimated cost that solid shop/brick and mortar store position is advanced to by public transport, or determine to solid shop/brick and mortar store and return to user
Current location round trip cost.As another example, it is shared by bus that computing system can predict that user will use
Service advances to solid shop/brick and mortar store position.Computing system can be calculated using sharing to solid shop/brick and mortar store position by bus (or to solid shop/brick and mortar store position
Set then to the third place (family of such as user)) estimated cost, or to solid shop/brick and mortar store position and return it is round-trip by bus altogether
Enjoy the cost of stroke.
Then estimation traveling cost can be compared with traveling cost threshold value, to determine whether estimation traveling cost surpasses
Cross traveling cost threshold value.Traveling cost threshold value can be it is preset, set by the user, or be based on other information, such as above
Described in traveling time threshold value.For example, the historical data about user behavior can be used to determine use in computing system
Family generally avoids taking over 8 dollars of stroke.Computing system can be used 8 dollars and be used as traveling cost threshold value.As another
A example, the average value or weighted average of stroke of the user in historical time section are determined for the traveling cost of user
Threshold value.As another example, computing system can when determining traveling cost threshold value, identify to from related with solid shop/brick and mortar store position
The online shop of connection buys the associated cost of product.For example, system can predict that user may be from the solid shop/brick and mortar store position identified
Set one or more articles of purchase.Then, computing system can determine the estimation transportation cost of those articles (for example, passing through
Inquire online shop, or the past purchase information according to storage), and use estimation transportation cost as traveling cost threshold
Value.As another example, historical information or received information can be used in computing system, comes from and solid shop/brick and mortar store position to determine
The average transportation cost of the order of associated online shop.Average transportation cost may be used as traveling cost threshold value.As again
One example, computing system can predict one or more articles that user may buy from the solid shop/brick and mortar store position identified.Meter
Calculation system can identify one or more article at the cost of one or more article at solid shop/brick and mortar store position and online shop
Cost.Computing system can determine whether the cost of article at online shop is greater than one or more article at solid shop/brick and mortar store position
Cost, and if the price of the article at online shop is higher, the difference of cost can be used as traveling cost threshold
Value.In some cases, the difference of price can be added to estimation transportation cost and this summation is used as traveling cost threshold
Value.
In response to estimation traveling cost be more than traveling cost threshold value, computing system can with it is determined that generate suggest 114, will
It, which is sent to, calculates equipment 100 and shows.If estimation traveling cost be no more than estimation traveling cost threshold value, do not generate and
It is presented to user and suggests 114.
As the 4th example, computing system can be with all or part of weather forecast of identification prediction travelling route.Then,
Weather forecast can be compared by computing system with the standard determined.In some implementations, the relevant standard of weather can be
Specific to user's.For example, computing system, which can be used from the received information of user or historical user's behavioural information, identifies use
Family prefer to avoid the condition of snowing, condition of raining, have mist condition, have dirt condition when drive.Computing system can incite somebody to action
Avoid specific type boisterous about user with what is determined along all or part of weather condition of prediction travelling route
The standard of preference (or avoiding the boisterous preference of all types) is compared.If all or part of weather of route is pre-
The bad weather type matching that the bad weather type that user generally to be avoided has been identified as with computing system is surveyed, then
Computing system suggests 114 and is presented to the user for calculating equipment 100 it is determined that generating.
In some implementations, quantitative values can be given to all or part of predict the weather of prediction travelling route, this is fixed
Magnitude can be compared with threshold value weather value.For example, can all or part of prediction snowfall for prediction travelling route or
Rate of rainall, and be compared with it with threshold value rainfall or snowfall rate value.It can be based on user preference or the historical user observed
Behavior carrys out threshold value.For example, computing system can determine that user generally prefers to avoid to advance still not under the conditions of heavy rain
It avoids advancing under the conditions of moderate rain.Snowfall is determined in response to computing system or rate of rainall is more than threshold value rainfall or snowfall rate value, meter
Calculation system can be it is determined that generating suggestion 114 and being presented to user.As another example, the value that predicts the weather can be
It, is then compared by total rainfall or snowfall in given time period with threshold value, should generate and show to determine whether
It is recommended that 114.As another example, the rank for reducing visibility (due to rain, snow, mist, dirt etc.) can be identified, and by itself and threshold
Value is compared, to determine whether to generate and show suggestion 114.
In some implementations, computing system across (traverse) whenever being predicted to be in user it was determined that predict to go
When route line particular weather condition be predicted to be along prediction travelling route or in its vicinity in the presence of, suggestion 114 should be generated
And it is shown to user.For example, along prediction cyclone, hurricane or the Strong Thunderstorm condition of the prediction travelling route to solid shop/brick and mortar store position
It can make computing system and suggest 114 it is determined that generating and be presented to the user for calculating equipment 100.
As the 5th example, computing system can determine that user is predicted the Time of Day advanced to solid shop/brick and mortar store position.For example,
Computing system can determine the prediction travelling route of solid shop/brick and mortar store position and to another position (or different third position
Set or back to the current location of user) prediction travelling route all or part may (or shop be closed after darkness
After door) occur.The accessible user's specification of computing system (including the information about historical user activity) is to determine user one
As prefer to avoid to advance at night.This information can be used to determine in computing system: if to solid shop/brick and mortar store position advance or
The a part for leaving solid shop/brick and mortar store position, which is predicted to be, is occurring (or if shop will close the door when reaching) after darkness,
Suggestion 114 should be generated and be presented to user.
As the 6th example, computing system can predict along to solid shop/brick and mortar store position prediction travelling route traffic (and/
Or along the traffic for the travelling route for leaving solid shop/brick and mortar store position after user access entity shop position).For example, prediction traffic
Estimation can be based on both current and historical traffic conditions of prediction travelling route.It can be with along the prediction traffic of travelling route
Various ways are used.For example, prediction traffic can be used for estimating the total of solid shop/brick and mortar store position (and/or leaving solid shop/brick and mortar store position)
Traveling time.Total traveling time can be compared with threshold value traveling time value as discussed above, to determine whether to answer
When generation suggests 114 and displays it to user.It is also used as measuring along the prediction traffic of prediction travelling route, and always
Traveling time dividually determines whether that suggestion 114 should be generated and is presented to the user.It can be non-for example, advancing in heavy traffic
It is often depressing, even if total traveling time, which is equal to, does not undergo heavy traffic, another route to different location.For example,
40 minutes strokes of 2 miles of traveling can be very depressing in the case where heavy traffic, and on open highway
40 minutes strokes of 35 miles of traveling are for many users and less depressing.Computing system is accessible to be identified
User preference or historical user's behavior, with determine calculate equipment 100 user whether generally prefer to avoid traffic congestion.
In some implementations, computing system can be with determination to be compared with prediction traffic with the threshold value volume of traffic
It is no to generate suggestion 114 and be presented to user.For example, user preference information and/or historical user's behavioural information can be with
Indicate: the user for calculating equipment 100 prefers to avoid busy transportation condition, and user does not mind slight or medium traffic item
Part.In some implementations, computing system can quantify transportation condition.For example, computing system can be identified along prediction traveling road
The all or part of prediction travel rate of line, and the travel rate is compared with along the standard travel rate of the route
Compared with, or by prediction travel rate and if compare the travel rate of appearance in the case that all vehicles are all advanced with speed limit
Compared with.The difference of travel rate may be used as quantitative traffic measurement, and be compared with traffic congestion threshold value, to determine whether to answer
When generation suggests 114 and is presented to user.Traffic congestion threshold value can be based on user preference as described above or observe
User's history behavior.In some implementations, it in response to determining that prediction traffic value is more than traffic congestion threshold value, generates and suggests 114
And it is presented to user.As another example, if predicting the prediction traveling time of travelling route just more than the route
Normal or standard traveling time, then can will predict that traveling time is more than that normal or standard traveling time amount compare with threshold value
Compared with to determine whether to generate suggestion 114 and be presented to user.
As the 7th example, computing system can identify one or more travel patterns for predicting travelling route, and
This is compared with user preference information (or directly by user's extraction or based on the historical user activity observed),

In some implementations, computing system can will prediction travelling route, solid shop/brick and mortar store position, associated with solid shop/brick and mortar store position
Retailer, online shop or the product obtained by online shop and/or solid shop/brick and mortar store position many aspects from it is different
Determining standard is compared, to determine whether to generate suggestion 114 and be presented to user.For example, can group close
Any example in example is stated to determine whether to generate suggestion 114 and be presented to user.In a particular example,
It is recommended that 114 it was determined that prediction traveling time and predict that travel pattern meets determining standard, to trigger the generation for suggesting 114
And presentation.
Computing system including calculating equipment 100 can suggest that 114 should be only in response to determining standard quilt by determining
Meet and generate and be presented to the user, Lai Zengjia efficiency reduces the use of the communication resource (thus for other purposes release communication money
Source), reduce memory memory requirement and reduce processing requirement.For example, by only meeting one or more standards determined
In the case where just generate and present suggestion 114 (as described above), reduce the sum for generating and sending to the suggestion of user.Pass through
Only when computing system has determined that specific user may wish to check specific suggestion 114 just using processing, memory and communication money
Source rather than by it is this suggestion be supplied to all users of system and at random or indiscriminate (indiscriminate)
Time point, this avoids use these resources.Solution given here reduces the totality on communication network and bears, is right
The storage requirement (including to the storage requirement for calculating equipment 100) and process resource of computing system, to discharge these moneys
Source uses so that other application is used with other purposes, and also adds this system of extension to include greater amount of terminal

Set) estimation traveling time, to the estimation travel distance of solid shop/brick and mortar store position (or travelling to and fro between solid shop/brick and mortar store position), to solid shop/brick and mortar store position
The estimation traveling cost of (or travelling to and fro between solid shop/brick and mortar store position), the online shop of the suggestion of the retailer of solid shop/brick and mortar store position, sale class
One that is similar to the online shop of the suggestion of the product for the product that can be obtained at solid shop/brick and mortar store position, can be bought in online shop
Or the estimation transportation cost of multiple articles, the estimation haulage time of one or more article, user can be by from online shops
Rather than the estimated cost or the time saves or prediction traveling road that one or more articles are realized are bought from solid shop/brick and mortar store position
Line, solid shop/brick and mortar store position, online shop or the item of interest of prediction other specific aspects.
Such as, it is proposed that 114 may include the prediction row by one or more different traveling modes to solid shop/brick and mortar store position
The time quantum that can be saved into the instruction of time and if user's on-line purchase article rather than if advancing to solid shop/brick and mortar store position.
As another example, it is proposed that 114 may include advancing to one or more forecast costs of solid shop/brick and mortar store position and can leading to
It crosses and buys article from online shop rather than advance to the estimated amount saved solid shop/brick and mortar store position.Such as, it is proposed that 114 can refer to
Show the cost that the cost of solid shop/brick and mortar store position is advanced to by automobile and advances to solid shop/brick and mortar store position by public transport.It is recommended that
114 can also include that transport computing system have determined that the estimated cost of the interested one or more articles of user (or comes from
The average transportation cost of the order of online shop) and by subtracting transport from the cost of generally the least expensive prediction travelling route

Business device can identify solid shop/brick and mortar store position, and identification prediction travelling route identifies associated with the retailer of solid shop/brick and mortar store position online
Shop, and it is determining with solid shop/brick and mortar store position, predict travelling route, online shop or be predicted to be each of the interested article of user
The relevant information of aspect.For example, one or more remote servers can determine that user advances to the estimation row of solid shop/brick and mortar store position
The estimation transportation cost of prediction article is delivered into cost, after buying from online shop, passes through the estimation of on-line purchase article
The URL of saving and online shop.This information can be supplied to by one or more remote servers calculates equipment 100, meter
Calculating equipment 100 can be used this information to generate suggestion 114.In some implementations, it is proposed that 114 all or part is at one
Or it is generated at multiple remote servers, and be sent to and calculate equipment 100 for rendering to user.
In some implementations, including calculating the computing system of equipment 100 in response to determining that user intends in the near future
Some time to the solid shop/brick and mortar store position row that identifies and then generate and present suggestion 114, it is from the user bright without receiving
Really request the input of the suggestion.For example, computing system can execute in user's input inquiry 108 and after selecting " to determine "
Some or all of above-mentioned processing, to determine whether to generate suggestion 114 and be presented to user.If computing system
It is determined that generating and suggestion 114 (for example, due to meeting one or more standards determined) being presented, then computing system generates
And it presents suggest that 114 input without receiving additional user on the display 102.In some implementations, computing system can be with
Some or all of above-mentioned processing is executed, to determine whether the travelling route that should be requested in response to user to solid shop/brick and mortar store position
And it generates and suggests 114 and presented to user.If the computing system determine that should generate and suggestion 114 is presented (for example, due to full
Sufficient one or more standards determined), then computing system generates and suggestion 114 is presented on the display 102 without receiving
Additional user's input.
Suggest 114 by only just generating customization when having met one or more standards determined, computing system reduces
Memory memory requirement.Computing system only has determined that customization should be presented to the user for calculating equipment 100 builds in computing system
Just generation customization suggests 114 when discussing 114, rather than generates possible millions of customizations before it will suggest being presented to the user and build
View.By needing " immediately (on the fly) " when suggesting being presented to the user generating suggestion, it is a large amount of which reduce storages
The needs that pre-generated customization is suggested.Therefore, system described herein saves memory storage resource, these memories are deposited
Then storage resource is freed for other application and other purposes use.
