FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating anexample system 100 for identifying one or more advertisement (“ad”) specialist. An ad specialist may include an entity (e.g., individual, enterprise) that produces and/or assists in the production an ad in accordance with a request from a third party such as an advertiser. In some implementations, thesystem 100 may identify one or more parameters associated with a requested ad, and using these parameters, identify one or more ad specialist in accordance with the ad parameters. For example, the user may submit a request for ad specialist that has experience in producing television ads directed to certain demographic. In addition to identifying ad specialist, thesystem 100 may perform one or more of the following: enable the user and the identified ad specialist to work together, rate the specialist using feedback from the user and/or success of the ad, receiving payment for the ad based on previously agreed terms, distribute and/or track the ad, and/or generate feedback for the ad in accordance with tracking information. In performing one or more these functions, thesystem 100, in some implementations, may provide an end-to-end ad creation/distribution system in one or more media (e.g., audio, video). - In the implementation shown,
system 100 includes clients 102 and aspecialist server 104 coupled vianetwork 106. Clients 102 a-c are any devices (e.g., computing devices) operable to connect or communicate withspecialist server 104 ornetwork 106 using any communication link. Each client 102 includes, executes, or otherwise presents a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 110 and comprises an electronic device operable to receive, transmit, process and store any appropriate data associated withsystem 100. While the illustrated implementation includes clients 102 a-c,system 100 may include any number of clients 102 communicably coupled tospecialist server 104. Further, “client 102” and “user” may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, for ease of illustration, each client 102 is described in terms of being used by one user. But this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one device or that one user may use multiple devices. - As used in this disclosure, a user of client 102 is any person, department, organization, small business, enterprise, or any other entity that may use or request others to use
system 100. Client 102 is intended to encompass a personal computer, touch screen terminal, workstation, network computer, kiosk, wireless data port, smart phone, personal data assistant (PDA), one or more processors within these or other devices, or any other suitable processing or electronic device used by a user viewing content from thespecialist server 104. For example, client 102 may be a PDA operable to wirelessly connect with an external or unsecured network. In another example, client 102 may comprise a laptop that includes an input device, such as a keypad, touch screen, mouse, or other device that can accept information, and an output device that conveys information associated with an advertisement ofspecialist server 104, including digital data, visual information, or GUI 110. Both the input device and output device may include fixed or removable storage media such as a magnetic computer disk, CD-ROM, or other suitable media to both receive input from and provide output to users of clients 102 through the display, namely the client portion of GUI 110. - GUI 110 comprises a graphical user interface operable to allow the user of client 102 to interface with at least a portion of
system 100 for any suitable purpose, such as viewing advertisements. Generally, GUI 110 provides the particular user with an efficient and user-friendly presentation of data provided by or communicated withinsystem 100. GUI 110 may comprise a plurality of customizable frames or views having interactive fields, pull-down lists, and buttons operated by the user. For example, GUI 110 is operable to display Web pages in a user-friendly form based on the user context and the displayed data. It should be understood that the term graphical user interface may be used in the singular or in the plural to describe one or more graphical user interfaces and each of the displays of a particular graphical user interface. Indeed, reference to GUI 110 may indicate a reference to the front-end or a component ofevaluation engine 132, as well as the particular interface accessible via client 102, as appropriate, without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Therefore, GUI 110 contemplates any graphical user interface, such as a generic web browser or touch screen, that processes information insystem 100 and efficiently presents the results to the user.Specialist server 104 can accept data from client 102 via a the web browser (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) and return the appropriate HTML or XML responses to thebrowser using network 106. -
Specialist server 104 comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive, transmit, process and store data associated withsystem 100. System 100 can be implemented using computers other than servers, as well as a server pool. Indeed,specialist server 104 may be any computer, electronic or processing device such as, for example, a blade server, general-purpose personal computer (PC), Macintosh, workstation, Unix-based computer, or any other suitable device. In other words,system 100 may include computers other than general purpose computers as well as computers without conventional operating systems.Specialist server 104 may be adapted to execute any operating system including Linux, UNIX, Windows Server, or any other suitable operating system. In certain implementations,specialist server 104 may also include or be communicably coupled with a web server and/or a mail server. -
Specialist server 104 includesmemory 116 and aprocessor 118.Memory 116 may be a local memory and include any memory or database module and may take the form of volatile or non-volatile memory including, without limitation, magnetic media, optical media, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), removable media, or any other suitable local or remote memory component. In the illustrated implementation,memory 116 includesWeb pages 120, requestfiles 122,specialist profiles 124,rating profiles 126,bid files 128, and requestedads 130.Local memory 116 may also include any other appropriate data such as VPN applications or services, firewall policies, a security or access log, print or other reporting files, HTML files or templates, data classes or object interfaces, child software applications or sub-systems, and others. -
Web pages 120 comprise displays through which information associated with the production and/or the distribution of ads can be presented to users of clients 102 (e.g.,FIGS. 3A-G ). In general,Web pages 120 include any machine readable and machine storable work product that may generate or be used to generate a display through GUI 110. Web pages 112 may be a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, or any other suitable configuration.Web pages 120 may include text, audio, image, video, animation, and other attributes. In short,Web pages 120 comprise any source code or object code for generating a display that provides information for enabling users to perform one or more functions of the ad creation/distribution process.Web page 120 may be written in or based on any suitable programming language such as HTML. - Request profiles 122 include any parameters, variables, policies, instructions, settings, rules or directives for defining attributes of requested
ads 130. For example, the ad attributes may include: a budget, a deadline, services requested (e.g., script writing, voiceover, special effects, production, music), advertised product and/or service, target customers, target locations, messages to convey, and/or others associated with the requestedad 130 and/or associated service and/or product. Of course, the above attributes are for example purposes and may not reflect some implementations within the scope of this disclosure. Regardless of the specific settings included or defined inprofile 122, the client 102 may select these attributes through one or more Web pages 120 (e.g.,FIGS. 3A-G ). Eachprofile 122 may be associated with a request for a specific ad ormultiple profiles 122 may be associated with the ad request. In some implementations, a user may be associated with asingle request profile 122 ormultiple request profiles 122 or multiple users may be associated with asingle request profile 122. For example, twodifferent profiles 122 may present a request from a user for two different ads.Profiles 122 may be stored in one or more tables stored in a relational database described in terms of SQL statements or scripts. In other implementations, profiles 122 may be formatted, stored, or defined as various data structures in text files, Hyperlink Text Markup Language (HTML) files, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents, Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) files, flat files, Btrieve files, comma-separated-value (CSV) files, internal variables, or one or more libraries. In short,profiles 122 may comprise one table or file or a plurality of tables or files stored on one computer or across a plurality of computers in any appropriate format. Moreover, profiles 122 may be local or remote without departing from the scope of this disclosure and store any type of appropriate data. - Specialist profiles 124 include one or more data entries or structure operable to identify information associated with ad specialists. For example, the
specialist profile 124 may identify that an ad specialist specializes in video ads and has produced a certain number of ads. In some implementations, thespecialist profile 124 may include one or more of the following: types of services provided (e.g., script writing, voiceover, production, music, singing, sound effects), years of experience, types of experience, sample work (e.g., previously requested ad), types of fee structures (e.g., buyout, pay per play), language, and/or others. In some implementations, an ad specialist may be associated with asingle specialist profile 124 or multiplespecialist profiles 124 or multiple ad specialist may be associated with asingle specialist profile 124.Profiles 124 may be stored in one or more tables stored in a relational database described in terms of SQL statements or scripts. In other implementations, profiles 124 may be formatted, stored, or defined as various data structures in text files, HTML documents, XML documents, VSAM files, flat files, Btrieve files, CSV files, internal variables, or one or more libraries. In short,profiles 124 may comprise one table or file or a plurality of tables or files stored on one computer or across a plurality of computers in any appropriate format. Moreover, profiles 124 may be local or remote without departing from the scope of this disclosure and store any type of appropriate data. - Ratings profiles 126 includes one or more data entries or structure operable to define one or more ratings associated with ad specialists. For example, the
ratings profile 126 may define one or more ratings associated with the performance of ads produced by the ad specialist as well as ratings based on feedback provided by one or more users. The ratings profile 126 may include one or more of the following: a performance rating, feedback ratings associated with different questions provided to users, an overall ratings, ratings based on different types of ads (e.g., audio, video), conversion rates associated with ads produced by a specialist, and other information. In some implementations, an ad specialist may be associated with asingle ratings profile 126 ormultiple ratings profiles 126 or multiple ad specialist may be associated with asingle ratings profile 126.Profiles 126 may be stored in one or more tables stored in a relational database described in terms of SQL statements or scripts. In other implementations, profiles 126 may be formatted, stored, or defined as various data structures in text files, HTML documents, XML documents, VSAM files, flat files, Btrieve files, CSV files, internal variables, or one or more libraries.

Moreover, the log files 212 may be local or remote without departing from the scope of this disclosure and store any type of appropriate data. -
Evaluation criteria 216 include any parameters, variables, algorithms, instructions, rules, objects or other directives for evaluating ad specialists that produced requestedads 130. For example, theevaluation criteria 216 may be used to determine action rates associated with requestedads 130. In some examples,evaluation criteria 216 may be used to update one or more ratings of an ad specialist inratings profiles 126 based, at least in part, on actions associated with requestedads 130. As mentioned above, such actions may include one or more of the following: conversions, calls received, inquiries, clicks, click throughs, viewing time, and/or others. In some implementations,evaluation criteria 216 may include mathematical expressions for computing results (e.g., action rates) of the requestedad 130 based on associated actions, criteria for evaluating the results, and/or modifications to one or more rating profiles 126. In terms of computing results,evaluation criteria 216 may identify expressions to determine action rates associated with the requestedads 130. Using such results,evaluation criteria 216 may define criteria such as a logical expression for evaluating the requestedads 130. For example, the criteria may be used to determine a range that the conversion rates fall within. In this case, each range may be associated with a certain number of stars, such as five stars for the highest conversion rates. Alternatively or in combination, theevaluation criteria 216 may be used to rate a specialist received from the user. For example, theevaluation criteria 216 may identify questions and/or parameters (e.g., customer service, quality of ad) that the user answers and/or assigns a value. Theevaluation criteria 216 may also identify expressions for determining one or more ratings associated with the ad specialist using the user feedback. -
Pricing criteria 218 include any parameters, variables, algorithms, instructions, rules, objects or other directives for determining the cost of producing thead 130. For example, thepricing criteria 218 may be used to determine the cost based, at least in part, on actions associated with the requestedad 130. In some implementations, thepricing criteria 218 may comprise a cost per action. For instance, thepricing criteria 218 may indicated that the user be charged each time that a viewer performed a specific action (e.g., purchase) in response to a requestedad 130. In some implementations, thepricing criteria 218 may indicate that the cost is based, at least in part, on the number of impressions of the requestedad 130. In some implementations, theevaluation criteria 216 may identify expressions to determine action rates such as inquiry rates or other suitable results associated with the requestedad 130. -
Processor 210 executesevaluation engine 220 andpricing engine 222 at any appropriate time such as, for example, in response to a request or input from a user ofcomputer 202 or any appropriate computer system coupled withnetwork 204.Evaluation engine 220 can include any software operable to determine and/or evaluate metrics associated with requestedads 130 based on any suitable process. For example, theevaluation engine 220 may determine ratings for an ad specialist based on one or more parameters. In some implementations, such ratings may be based on feedback provided by users and/or metrics associated with one or more requested ads 130 (e.g., action rates). In the case of evaluating an ad specialist, theevaluation engine 220 may identifylog files 214 associated with the ad specialist, evaluated the identifiedlog files 214 using theevaluation criteria 216, and determine at least one rating associated with the ad specialist. In some implementations, prior to evaluating offers,evaluation engine 220 may determine one or more metrics usingevaluation criteria 216 and/or log files 214. For example, theevaluation engine 220 may determine a conversion rate for a requestedad 130 produced by the ad specialist using the log files 214. For instance, if the requestedad 130 was presented 100 times with 5000 purchases associated with the requestedad 130, the conversion rate is 50 purchases per impression. Regardless of calculations, theevaluation engine 220 may identify criteria for evaluating the ad specialist usingevaluation criteria 216. Criteria may include a number, a range, a threshold, and/or any other suitable criteria for evaluating the requestedad 130. In some implementations, theevaluation engine 132 may compare associated actions and/or action rates and the criteria using any suitable mathematical and/or logical expression. For example, theevaluation engine 132 may determine or otherwise identify ranges associated with certain types of ads using theevaluations criteria 216. For example, theevaluation engine 132 may identify 10 ranges associated with a certain type of ad. In response to satisfying criteria, theevaluation engine 132 may associate a level (e.g., a number of stars) for the ad specialist. - In one aspect of operation, the
evaluation engine 220 identifies one or more log files 214 associated with arequest ad 130 in response to an event (e.g., expiration of a period of time, a request). Additionally, theevaluation engine 220 identifies one ormore evaluation criteria 216 for evaluating information associated with therequest ad 130. In some implementations, theevaluation engine 220 identifies expressions for determining one or more metrics associated with therequest ad 130. For example, theevaluation engine 220 may identify a mathematical expression for determining action rates associated with the requestedad 130. Using the identifiedlog files 214 andevaluation criteria 216, theevaluation engine 220 determines one or more ratings associated with the ad specialist that produced the requestedad 130. In connect with determining the one or more ratings, theevaluation engine 220 may generate and/or update one ormore rating profiles 126 associated with the ad specialist. Thepricing engine 222 may determine one or more metrics associated with the requestedad 130 and, using the metrics, determine a cost to charge the user. For example, thepricing engine 222 may determine a number of times the requestedad 130 was presented using the log files 214 and determine a cost using the presentation times andpricing criteria 218. In some implementations, the cost is directly proportional to the presentation times. -
