Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to peer-to-peer transactions, and more particularly to using the social networking content of a user to determine transaction authentication levels.
- Users of this technology are desirous of a simpler and faster method of locating the account of a transaction counter-party and authenticating the transaction.
- An example of a circumstance in which users may conduct this type of peer-to-peer transaction might be when two people regularly dine together at a restaurant. If one person pays the restaurant for the bill and the other member of the party would like to pay the person his share of the bill, entering account information of the payee and multiple levels of authentication every time the two people share a meal would be burdensome. This requirement may reduce the likelihood that the user would employ this service.
- An aspect of the present invention provides a computer-implemented method for using the social networking content of a user to determine authentication levels required for a peer-to-peer transaction.
- a user installs a peer-to-peer payment application (“PPA”) on their mobile device.
- PPA peer-to-peer payment application
- the user inputs information to identify the transaction counter-party and the transaction details, such as an amount of money to transmit to the counter-party.
- the information can be transmitted to a server located in a peer-to-peer payment system (“PPS”).
- PPS may search the social network content of the user to determine the account information of the counter-party.
- the PPS also searches the social network content of the user to assess the security risk of the counter-party according to a preconfigured set of factors that define the strength of the connection to the user.
- the PPS may determine the level of transaction authentication required to process the transaction.
- the PPS may transmit the authentication requirements to the PPA on the user device.
- the user may enter the authentication data to complete the transaction.
- Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product that is installed on a user's device and on a server located in a PPS for using the social networking content of a user to determine authentication levels required for a peer-to-peer transaction.
- the computer program product includes a non-transitory computer-readable storage device having computer-readable program instructions stored therein.
- the computer-readable program instructions include computer program instructions for transmitting the user's transaction request to the PPS server; locating the transaction counter-party from the user's social network content; determining the authentication requirement for the transaction based on the strength of the counter-party's connection to the user; transmitting the authentication requirement list to a PPA; and conducting the transaction.
- the apparatus includes a web browser application with a PPA logically coupled to the web browser application.
- the PPA is configured for interfacing with the user and transmitting the user's transaction request to the PPS server.
- the apparatus includes a PPS server configured for locating the transaction counter-party from the user's social network content; determining the authentication requirement for the transaction based on the strength of the counter-party's connection to the user; and transmitting the authentication requirement list to a PPA.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an operating environment of a Peer-to-Peer Payment Application (“PPA”), in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- PPA Peer-to-Peer Payment Application
- FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for using the social networking content of a user to determine authentication levels required for a peer-to-peer transaction, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- the exemplary embodiments provide a peer-to-peer payment application (“PPA”) that can utilize a user's social graph for identifying counter-party accounts for a peer-to-peer transaction with a mobile device and setting the authorization level for the transaction.
- the social graph of a user refers to all of a user's contacts, friends, family, and other members of a user's online network. The social graph not only determines the members of a user's network, but also determines how the members are related and how closely the members are related.
- a user installs a PPA on his mobile device.
- the PPA can provide a user interface for entering configuration information and establishing an account.
- the user can utilize the PPA to conduct peer-to-peer financial transactions.
- Peer-to-peer transactions can be conducted between the user and a recipient.
- the recipient can be another consumer or a small business.
- the user enters information into the PPA including information to identify the counter-party and transaction details, such as an amount to pay to the counter-party.
- the user may enter the counter-party's name or other identifying information such as an email address or a phone number.
- the PPA transmits the information and the transaction details to the server on a peer-to-peer payment system (“PPS”).
- PPS peer-to-peer payment system
- the user may simply send the identity information and the transaction information directly to the PPS via email, text, instant message, or any other type of communication available to the user.
- the user may input instructions to manually alter the authorization levels required for a transaction counter-party.
- the authorization levels may be configurable by a user for some or all types of transactions.
- the payment system may restrict the authorization levels for some or all transactions from being altered by the user.
- the PPS compares the identity information with a compilation of social network data from the user. From the social network data, the PPS searches for the user's contacts, friends, business associates, family members, or other contacts to clearly identify the intended recipient of the transaction.
- the PPS may extract the identity from any social network data available from the user's activities. Examples of locations available from which the PPS may gather data may include, but not be limited to, social network websites accounts, such as on FACEBOOK or GOOGLE+, contact list entries, email contacts, phone contacts, or other programs and applications running on user devices or accessed via the internet or other network.
- the PPS evaluates the counter-party to determine the authentication level required to conduct a transaction.
- One of the criteria used by the PPS to evaluate the counter-party may be based on the status of the counter-party on the social network status, such as a “friend” on FACEBOOK or a friend of a friend.
- Other criteria may include, but would not be limited to, frequency of emails or texts with a contact, number of social network applications on which the counter-party appears, or the number of previous transactions with the user.
- the PPS After determining the strength of the connection of the counter-party to the user, the PPS establishes the authentication level required for the user to complete the transaction.
- the PPS transmits the level to the PPA on the user device, which prompts the user for the required authentication.
- the user may enter the required authorization and proceed with the transaction.
- authorization procedures that may be required by the PPS might include, but would not be limited to, signing in to the PPA, providing a PIN number, password re-entry, answering a challenge question, answering a challenge-response test such as a CAPTCHA, confirming additional details about the counter-party identification or corresponding account information, or other authorization steps that may help limit fraudulent transactions.
- the PPA can be embodied as a stand-alone application program or as a companion program to a web browser, for example, as a companion program to a Hypertext Markup Language revision 5 (“HTML5”) compliant web browser or other type of web browser having messaging and storage capabilities. While certain embodiments are described in which parts of the PPA are implemented in software, it will be appreciated that one or more acts or functions of the PPA may be performed by hardware, software, or a combination thereof, as may be embodied in one or more computing systems.

Abstract
The invention provides a computer-implemented method for using the social networking content of a user to determine authentication levels required for a peer-to-peer transaction. A user inputs transaction counter-party and transaction details into a payment application. The information can be transmitted to a server located in a peer-to-peer payment system. The system may search the social network content of the user to determine the account information of the counter-party and to assess the security risk of the counter-party according to a preconfigured set of factors that define the strength of the connection to the user. These factors may include the counter-party's status in the user's social networks, frequency of contact, prior transactions, or other factors that further establish a relationship. The system may determine the level of transaction authentication required to process the transaction. The user may enter the authentication data to complete the transaction.
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to peer-to-peer transactions, and more particularly to using the social networking content of a user to determine transaction authentication levels.
- Users of smartphones and other similar devices are conducting an increasing number of electronic transactions. While financial transactions with merchants have become much more user-friendly and commonplace, users are additionally employing their devices to conduct transactions with other mobile device users. These peer-to-peer transactions often require an cumbersome amount of data input to identify the other party and the other party's financial account information in the transaction and to conduct a transaction.
- Users of this technology are desirous of a simpler and faster method of locating the account of a transaction counter-party and authenticating the transaction. An example of a circumstance in which users may conduct this type of peer-to-peer transaction might be when two people regularly dine together at a restaurant. If one person pays the restaurant for the bill and the other member of the party would like to pay the person his share of the bill, entering account information of the payee and multiple levels of authentication every time the two people share a meal would be burdensome. This requirement may reduce the likelihood that the user would employ this service.
- If the user were able to bypass some or all of the authentication steps without sacrificing security, the speed and simplicity of the transaction would be greatly enhanced. If the user could further conduct the transaction without inputting all of the recipients account information, the process could be even more convenient for the user.
- An aspect of the present invention provides a computer-implemented method for using the social networking content of a user to determine authentication levels required for a peer-to-peer transaction. A user installs a peer-to-peer payment application (“PPA”) on their mobile device. The user inputs information to identify the transaction counter-party and the transaction details, such as an amount of money to transmit to the counter-party. The information can be transmitted to a server located in a peer-to-peer payment system (“PPS”). The PPS may search the social network content of the user to determine the account information of the counter-party. The PPS also searches the social network content of the user to assess the security risk of the counter-party according to a preconfigured set of factors that define the strength of the connection to the user. These factors may include the counter-party's status in the user's social networks, frequency of contact, prior transactions, or other factors that further establish a relationship. The PPS may determine the level of transaction authentication required to process the transaction. The PPS may transmit the authentication requirements to the PPA on the user device. The user may enter the authentication data to complete the transaction.
- Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product that is installed on a user's device and on a server located in a PPS for using the social networking content of a user to determine authentication levels required for a peer-to-peer transaction. The computer program product includes a non-transitory computer-readable storage device having computer-readable program instructions stored therein. The computer-readable program instructions include computer program instructions for transmitting the user's transaction request to the PPS server; locating the transaction counter-party from the user's social network content; determining the authentication requirement for the transaction based on the strength of the counter-party's connection to the user; transmitting the authentication requirement list to a PPA; and conducting the transaction.
- Another aspect of the present invention provides an apparatus for using the social networking content of a user to determine authentication levels required for a peer-to-peer transaction. The apparatus includes a web browser application with a PPA logically coupled to the web browser application. The PPA is configured for interfacing with the user and transmitting the user's transaction request to the PPS server. The apparatus includes a PPS server configured for locating the transaction counter-party from the user's social network content; determining the authentication requirement for the transaction based on the strength of the counter-party's connection to the user; and transmitting the authentication requirement list to a PPA.
- These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated exemplary embodiments, which include the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently presented.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an operating environment of a Peer-to-Peer Payment Application (“PPA”), in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. -
FIG. 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for using the social networking content of a user to determine authentication levels required for a peer-to-peer transaction, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. - The exemplary embodiments provide a peer-to-peer payment application (“PPA”) that can utilize a user's social graph for identifying counter-party accounts for a peer-to-peer transaction with a mobile device and setting the authorization level for the transaction. The social graph of a user refers to all of a user's contacts, friends, family, and other members of a user's online network. The social graph not only determines the members of a user's network, but also determines how the members are related and how closely the members are related.
- A user installs a PPA on his mobile device. The PPA can provide a user interface for entering configuration information and establishing an account. The user can utilize the PPA to conduct peer-to-peer financial transactions. Peer-to-peer transactions can be conducted between the user and a recipient. The recipient can be another consumer or a small business.
- The user enters information into the PPA including information to identify the counter-party and transaction details, such as an amount to pay to the counter-party. In certain exemplary embodiments, the user may enter the counter-party's name or other identifying information such as an email address or a phone number. The PPA transmits the information and the transaction details to the server on a peer-to-peer payment system (“PPS”). In an alternate embodiment, the user may simply send the identity information and the transaction information directly to the PPS via email, text, instant message, or any other type of communication available to the user.
- In an alternate embodiment, the user may input instructions to manually alter the authorization levels required for a transaction counter-party. The authorization levels may be configurable by a user for some or all types of transactions. Alternatively, the payment system may restrict the authorization levels for some or all transactions from being altered by the user.
- The PPS compares the identity information with a compilation of social network data from the user. From the social network data, the PPS searches for the user's contacts, friends, business associates, family members, or other contacts to clearly identify the intended recipient of the transaction. The PPS may extract the identity from any social network data available from the user's activities. Examples of locations available from which the PPS may gather data may include, but not be limited to, social network websites accounts, such as on FACEBOOK or GOOGLE+, contact list entries, email contacts, phone contacts, or other programs and applications running on user devices or accessed via the internet or other network.
- The PPS evaluates the counter-party to determine the authentication level required to conduct a transaction. One of the criteria used by the PPS to evaluate the counter-party may be based on the status of the counter-party on the social network status, such as a “friend” on FACEBOOK or a friend of a friend. Other criteria may include, but would not be limited to, frequency of emails or texts with a contact, number of social network applications on which the counter-party appears, or the number of previous transactions with the user.
- After determining the strength of the connection of the counter-party to the user, the PPS establishes the authentication level required for the user to complete the transaction. The PPS transmits the level to the PPA on the user device, which prompts the user for the required authentication. The user may enter the required authorization and proceed with the transaction.
- Examples of authorization procedures that may be required by the PPS might include, but would not be limited to, signing in to the PPA, providing a PIN number, password re-entry, answering a challenge question, answering a challenge-response test such as a CAPTCHA, confirming additional details about the counter-party identification or corresponding account information, or other authorization steps that may help limit fraudulent transactions.
- The PPA can be embodied as a stand-alone application program or as a companion program to a web browser, for example, as a companion program to a Hypertext Markup Language revision 5 (“HTML5”) compliant web browser or other type of web browser having messaging and storage capabilities. While certain embodiments are described in which parts of the PPA are implemented in software, it will be appreciated that one or more acts or functions of the PPA may be performed by hardware, software, or a combination thereof, as may be embodied in one or more computing systems.
- The functionality of the exemplary embodiments will be explained in more detail in the following description, read in conjunction with the figures illustrating the program flow.
- Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, exemplary embodiments of the invention are described in detail.

Additionally, thePPS 160 installs computer-readable program instructions on thePPS server 161 for interacting with thesocial network system 150. In an exemplary embodiment, these computer-readable program instructions may be implemented as an embedded script, such as JavaScript, in thePPS server 161. - In
block 210, theuser 101 installs aPPA 115 on theuser device 110. In certain exemplary embodiments, theuser 101 may navigate to a website of a provider of thePPA 115 and download and install thePPA 115. The website that provides thePPA 115 may be thePPS website 153. ThePPA 115 may be embedded in adigital wallet 112 on auser device 110. Theuser 101 may utilize a user interface of thePPA 115 to configure thePPA 115. Theuser 101 may configure privacy settings provided by thePPA 115. Additionally, theuser 101 may communicate with the computer-readable program instructions on thePPS 160 to establish user identification and transaction configuration. The communication with thePPS 160 may be made via any available technology including, but not limited to, an Internet connection via thenetwork 105, text, email, or a cellular connection. - In
block 215, theuser 101 initiates thePPA 115 by actuating a physical or virtual button, making a motion such as a “tap” or swipe with theuser device 110, speaking a voice command, or performing any other initiation process. - In
block 220, theuser 101 identifies the transaction counter-party and enters the identity into thePPA 115. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, thePPA 115 allows theuser 101 to select a transaction counter-party from one or more of the contact applications on theuser device 110. In an alternate embodiment, thePPA 115 may allow theuser 101 to enter only the counter-party's email address, name, phone number, or any other identification data. In this embodiment, theuser 101 may enter the identification into a user interface of thePPA 115 or transmit the identification to the peer-to-peer payment system (“PPS”) 160 directly. The transmission to thePPS 160 may be via email, text, instant message, or any other appropriate communication technology. In another alternate embodiment of the invention, theuser device 110 may recognize thetransaction counter-party device 120 via near field communication or another communication technology that allows thedevices devices counter-party device 120 may transmit the counter-party identity to theuser device 110 for use by thePPA 115. - In
block 225, theuser 101 submits the transaction data to thePPS 160. The transaction details may be entered into a user interface of thePPS 115 or transmitted directly to thePPS 160 from theuser device 110 in a similar manner to the transmitting of the counter-party identity as described inblock 220. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the transaction is a peer-to-peer financial transaction. - In alternate embodiments of the invention, the transaction may be merely an exchange of information or other type of non-financial transaction. One skilled in the art might recognize that examples of such a transaction that might include, but would not be limited to, exchanging contact information, transferring event information such as a concert, transferring data files, transmitting directions, or any other transaction that might benefit from the present invention. One skilled in the art might also envision the invention being used in a financial transaction that is not limited to peer-to-peer. This might include, but would not be limited to, financial transactions with merchants or financial institutions.
- In
block 230, if theuser 101 has entered the identification of the counter-party and the transaction data into thePPA 115, thePPA 115 transmits the data to thePPS 160. ThePPS 160 receives the identification and transaction data and stores it in the user profile created on thePPS server 161. - In
block 235, thePPS 160 compares the identity data of the transaction counter-party with a compilation of the social graph of theuser 101. The social graph of a user refers to all of a user's contacts, friends, family, and other members of a user's online network. The social graph not only determines the members of a user's network, but also determines how the members are related and how closely the members are related. The social graph can be compiled from the social networks of which the user is a member, email contacts, text contacts, frequent transaction parties, and other suitable sources. - From the social network data, the
PPS 160 searches the identities of the user's contacts, friends, business associates, family members, or any other identity that can be extracted from the social network content. Examples of thesocial network websites 153 to which theuser 101 may belong may include, but would not be limited to, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE+, or LINKEDIN. - The
social network system 150 may provide thePPS 160 with a list of contacts from the user's online community from which to extract the counter-party's identity. Thesocial network system 150 may further provide to thePPS 160 data concerning the relative strength of the connection between the counter-party and the user from the community and the user. The strength of the connection may be determined by factors that may apply to the structure of each particularsocial network system 150. For example, a social network system such as FACEBOOK may categorize members of the community as “friends” or “friends of friends” and LINKEDIN may categorize members as first, second, or third degree contacts. - The
PPS 160 may additionally or alternatively extract identities from thecontact applications 116 on auser device 110. Acontact application 116 may be any program or application on theuser device 110 or accessible by theuser device 110 that maintains a list of contacts of theuser 101 from which thePPS 160 may extract data. Examples ofcontact applications 116 might include, but not be limited to, email applications, text applications, instant messaging, calendar invite lists, or contact databases such as OUTLOOK or ACT. The strength of a transaction counter-party's connection to auser 101 may be prioritized by details gained from acontact application 116, such as frequency of communication withuser 101, the number ofdifferent contact applications 116 on which a particular contact appears, or any other prioritizing factors which may be extracted from the data. - Other priority factors may be used to determine the strength of the connection of a contact to the user, such as if the potential transaction counter-party has made recent transactions by the
device 120 using the same or a compatible peer-to-peer application. For instance, if the transaction counter-parties has an account on thePPS 160 and has made transactions with theuser 101 or contacts of theuser 101, that action would strengthen the connection of theuser 101 and the transaction counter-parties. - If the
user 101 and the counter-party have repeated transactions having similar characteristics, thePPS 160 can recognize the patterns and increase the strength of connection. For example, if theuser 101 and the counter-party have lunch every Friday, thePPS 160 may recognize the pattern and reduce the needed authorization level for the transactions. Another characteristic that thePPS 160 may recognize is the location of the transaction. For example, if auser 101 and the counter-party conduct a transaction at the same coffee shop twice a week, then thePPS 160 may recognize the pattern and reduce the needed authorization level for the transactions. - The final strength of the connection of the transaction counter-party to the
user 101 may be determined by a configured ranking system. For example, the ranking system may assign scores to a transaction counter-party based upon each instance that they appear in the social network of theuser 101. In certain exemplary embodiments, thePPS 160 applies the extracted data to a machine-learning algorithm or another statistical model to determine the most effective ranking system. For example, a machine-learning algorithm can be performed on the transaction counter-parties of one or more users to learn the ranking system that produces results having a fraud risk below an acceptable threshold. The machine-learning algorithm can be updated periodically. - In
block 240, thePPS 160 assigns the transaction an authorization level. The level is determined by the strength of the connection of the counter-party to theuser 101. For instance, a stronger connection may require a lower authorization procedure by theuser 101, and a weaker connection may require a more extensive authorization procedure. - Examples of authorization procedures that may be required by the
PPS 160 might include, but would not be limited to, signing in to thePPA 115, providing a PIN number, password re-entry, answering a challenge question, answering a challenge-response test such as a CAPTCHA, confirming additional details about the counter-party identification or corresponding account information, or other authorization steps that may help limit fraudulent transactions. - After determining the authorization procedures required for the transaction, the
PPS 160 transmits the information to thePPA 115. ThePPA 115 displays the requirements to theuser 101 for authorization via the user interface of thePPA 115. - The
PPS 160 can review the social graph of theuser 101 to determine the authorization level without disclosing any of the personal identifiable information of the transaction counter-party. - In
block 240, theuser 101 enters the authorization data into the user interface of thePPA 115. Upon receipt of the authorization, thePPS 160 may proceed with the transaction. If the counter-party has an account on thePPS 160, the funds may be automatically transferred to the counter-party's financial account. If theuser 101 has specified a financial account for the counter-party, thePPS 160 may transfer funds to that account. In a certain embodiment of the invention, a counter-party without an account on thePPS 160 may be required to register on thePPS 160 to receive the funds. - In an alternate embodiment, the
PPA 115 can employ the location technology of theuser device 110 to transmit the location of thedevice 110, and thus the location of theuser 101 to thePPS 160. By establishing the location of theuser 101, thePPS 160 may search for other devices within a certain proximity to theuser 101 that may be active. ThePPS 160 may search the social graph of the user to determine if any of the proximate device users are likely counter-parties. If one or more likely counter-party is identified, thePPS 115 may display the authorization level for each identified counter-party. Theuser 101 may select a contact from the list to be the counter-party for the current transaction with the knowledge of authorization level that will be required. Alternatively, theuser 101 can decide to abandon the transaction. - In
block 245, the user employs thePPA 115 to complete the transaction with the counter-party using the required transaction authorization level. - After completion of the transaction, the
method 200 ends. - In alternate embodiments, some or all of the functions or action of the
PPS 160 may be performed by theuser device 110 or executed on theuser device 110. - Users may be allowed to limit or otherwise affect the operation of the features disclosed herein. For example, users may be given opportunities to opt-in or opt-out of the collection or use of certain data or the activation of certain features. In addition, users may be given the opportunity to change the manner in which the features are employed.
