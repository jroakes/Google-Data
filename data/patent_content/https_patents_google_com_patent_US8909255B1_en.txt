- FIG. 5 illustrates an example of an electronic system with which certain aspects of the subject technology can be implemented.
- the subject disclosure provides a method and system for identifying geographic features with respect to a location lookup point (e.g., a latitude and longitude value).
- the geographic features can comprise any feature identifiable on a map. However, in some implementations the geographic features will include only features having a polygonal area. In some examples, geographic features may include, but are not limited to, geo-political entities (e.g., neighborhoods, boroughs, cities, states, etc.), natural boundary areas (e.g., lakes, mountains, shorelines, etc.) and/or man-made structures such as building and roads, etc.
- the location lookup point can correspond to any geographic location on a map. In some examples, the location lookup point will identify the physical location of a user.
- the location lookup point may be provided directly by, or inferred using, any suitable location information.
- Location information can comprise any information bearing on the likelihood of a physical position of a user. For example, location information may comprise location coordinates corresponding to a user location provided by a global positioning system (GPS) device, such as a GPS chip in a smart phone or mobile computing device.
- GPS global positioning system
- the location lookup point is used to generate a plurality of search cells, each encompassing the location lookup point, for use in determining what geographic features are associated with the location lookup point.
- Each of the plurality of search cells can include a different amount of geographic area and will correspond with a single map cell among a plurality of hierarchical map cells that cover the map.
- each subsequently generated search cell may contain a geographic area that is larger than the preceding search cell.
- the first cell that is generated among the plurality of search cells can be the smallest possible search cell (corresponding to the smallest map cell) having one or more associated geographic features.
- a determination of which geographic features are relevant to a particular location lookup point can be made through the use of one or more preprocessed indices.
- a preprocessed index e.g., a first index
- a preprocessed index e.g., a second index
- relevant geographic features can by identified (for each of the plurality of search cells), by determining, for each search cell, the set of all geographic features that are associated (e.g., overlap with) the search cell.
- the index will first map geographic features to one or more of the plurality of hierarchical map cells. Specifically, the mapping between geographic features and map cells will be performed by determining, for each geographic feature, the set of hierarchical map cells that approximate the geographic “coverage area” of the geographic feature.
- geographic coverage area can refer to a bounded geographic area (or map area) that approximates (or encompasses) a geographic feature in size and shape. Thus, the geographic coverage area for a geographic feature can approximate the shape and orientation of a map region covered by the geographic feature.
- geographic features can be approximated by favoring a fewer number of hierarchical map cells (e.g., using the minimum number of map cells that can accurately approximate the geometry of the geographic feature).
- the approximation may favor the use of larger map cells as compared to the use of the multiple map cells that comprise the larger map cells in the map cell hierarchy.
- the determination as to what map cells can be used to approximate a particular geographic feature can depend on a percentage of area overlap between a particular map cell and the geographic feature e.g., the percentage of the map cell contained within the boundary area of the geographic feature.
- An overlap threshold may be used to determine which map cells can be used to approximate a particular geographic feature. For example, a sixty percent overlap threshold may be required before a geographic feature can be associated with a particular map cell. Thus, map cells not having at least a sixty percent area overlap with a particular geographic feature may be disregarded (e.g., not added to the index). Depending on implementation, the percentage of area overlap between a geographic feature and an associated map cell may be indicated in the index. In certain aspects, minimizing the number of map cells used to approximate a particular geographic feature (e.g., disregarding map cells having a partial overlap) may help increase the speed of the reverse geocoding process, as further described below.
- the index will further contain a mapping between each hierarchical map cell and a set of geographic features corresponding to that particular cell.
- a map cell may be mapped to a particular geographic feature (or a feature identifier associated with the geographic feature) if the map cell is determined to be, at least partially, contained within the geographic boundary area of the geographic feature.
- Associations between map cells and geographic features can also be based on minimum thresholds, for example, of an overlap area shared by a particular map cell and a particular geographic feature.
- a threshold for associating map cells with geographic features may be larger than the threshold that is used to associate geographic features with map cells.
- a plurality of search cells (each having a corresponding hierarchical map cell) will be generated which each contain the location lookup point.
- the set of geographic features corresponding to each of the plurality of search cells are identified.
- one or more of the geographic features can be displayed to a user.
- the determination of which of geographic features should be provided to the user is based on a scoring of the geographic features to determine a ranking of relevance with respect to the user and/or the reference location coordinate, as described in further detail, below.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a flow diagram of an example method 100 for identifying one or more geographic features associated with a location lookup point.
- the method 100 begins with step 102 in which location information for a location lookup point is received, for example, by a processor-based device.
- the location information can comprise any type of information indicating a location on a map.
- location information can comprise information received from a user operated device, such as a mobile device including global positioning system (GPS) chip.
- GPS global positioning system
- the location information will comprise map location coordinates, such as longitude and latitude coordinate information and can be received from a user operated device, such as a mobile computing device, e.g., a smart phone, a tablet computing device or a mobile computer, etc.
- the location information will identify a location lookup point that approximates the physical location of the user on a map.
- a plurality of search cells are generated which contain the location lookup point.
- the plurality of search cells will correspond to a respective plurality of hierarchical map cells.
- each of the plurality of search cells are a different size (e.g., enclose different geographic coverage areas as compared to the other search cells) and correspond to map cells of similar size and placement.
- the process of generating the plurality of search cells can begin with generating a search cell having the smallest relative area compared to the other of the plurality of search cells.
- the first and smallest search cell generated will correspond in size, and placement, to the smallest available map cell for the geographic region surrounding the location lookup point.
- the first and smallest search cell generated will correspond in size, and placement, to the smallest available map cell for which one or more geographic features are associated.
- the plurality of search cells generated in step 104 are used to identify at least one geographic feature associated with at least one of the plurality of search cells.
- One or more geographic features e.g., a set of geographic features
- a search cell may be determined to be associated with a particular geographic feature if the particular geographic feature at least partially includes the search cell in its geographic coverage area.
- the association between a particular geographic feature and a particular search cell may depend on a percentage of area overlap between the geographic feature and the search cell, e.g., an amount of the area of the search cell that is contained within the geographic coverage area of the geographic feature.
- Overlap information indicating an amount of area overlap between each geographic feature and each associated search cell and/or map cell can be stored in the index.
- step 108 at least one geographic feature is provided to a user for display.
- the user is provided with only geographic feature information pertaining to geographic features that are relevant to the user and/or the location lookup point corresponding to the user's location on the map.
- a determination of which geographic features are relevant (and thus provided to the user) can be based on a “scoring” of the various geographic features which overlap with each search cell containing the location lookup point.
- the process of scoring may use any information about the location lookup point and/or the geographic features associated with the search cells.
- geographic features having complete coverage of a particular search cell are assigned a score of a higher rank i.e., preferred to geographic features sharing only a fractional area overlap with the search cell.
- FIG. 2 graphically illustrates an example of a relationship between a plurality of hierarchical map cells, a location lookup point, a first search cell and various geographic features.
- FIG. 2 illustrates the plurality of hierarchical map cells that cover the map region depicted in FIG. 2 , including the geographic features contained therein (e.g., Geographic Features 1-3).
- FIG. 2 further depicts the location lookup point contained within Geographic Features 2 and 3.
- the entire map area is covered by one or more hierarchical map cells that are related in a hierarchy of “levels,” wherein each map cell is contained within a bounded area of at least one map cell from each of the higher (larger) levels.
- the map cell is contained within the boundaries of at least one map cell from each higher level.
- the number of map cell levels used to cover a particular map region, as well as the size (e.g., the particular levels) of map cells, can vary depending on the region.
- the map cell containing the location lookup point in FIG. 2 (corresponding to the First Search Cell), is contained within a larger map cell (e.g., a map cell of a higher “level”), as shown in FIG. 3A , which corresponds to the Second Search Cell.
- a map cell of a higher “level” e.g., a map cell of a higher “level”
- FIG. 3A which corresponds to the Second Search Cell.
- the map cell of FIG. 3A corresponding to a Second Search Cell is contained within a yet larger map cell (corresponding to a Third Search Cell), as depicted in FIG. 3B .
- Each geographic feature can be approximated using one or more of the map cells.
- different sized map cells i.e., map cells of different levels
- the shape of Geographic Feature 2 may be approximated using the map cell corresponding to the First Search Cell in FIG. 2 , which is entirely contained within the coverage area of Geographic Feature 2.
- one or more of the surrounding map cells may also be used to approximate the shape of Geographic Feature 2.
- the determination as to whether a particular map cell is included in the set of map cells used to approximate a particular geographic feature can depend on the amount of overlap between the geographic feature and the particular map cell. Additionally, in making an approximation of a geographic feature with adjacent map cells, configurations which minimize the number of map cells used in the approximation may be preferred over approximations requiring a greater number of map cells.
- a preprocessed index can be used to map the relationship between each geographic feature and the plurality of map cells used to approximate the geographic feature.
- each geographic feature may be correlated with one or more map cells from among the plurality of hierarchical map cells covering the entire map.
- the index may also map a relationship between each of the hierarchical map cells and the associated geographic features. That is, for each map cell, the index may indicate a set of geographic features that at least partially contain that map cell in a respective coverage area of the geographic feature.
- a first search cell is generated containing the location lookup point.
- the first search cell corresponds to a smallest map cell for the map region containing the location lookup point.
- the second search cell and the third search cell are generated, as depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B .
- each generated search cell corresponds to one of the plurality of hierarchical map cells.
- a list of geographic features associated with the search cell is determined, for example, using the index, as described above.
- one or more of the geographic features associated with one or more of the search cells may be provided to the user.
- a determination as to which geographic features should be provided to the user is based on a relevance between each geographic feature and the location lookup point associated with the user's position.
- a scoring process may be used to determine for each geographic feature, an amount of area overlap between the geographic feature and one or more of the search cells containing the location lookup point.

- first server 410 may then generate a plurality of search cells containing the location lookup point and use the search cells to identify a set of geographic features associated with at least one of the search cells.
- the determination as to which geographic features are associated with a particular search cell can depend on an amount of area overlap between the geographic feature and the search cell.
