- the subject disclosure provides a method for efficiently clustering ads with map content.
- Ads can be clustered with organic map content, if it is determined that the organic map content and the ad both refer to the same entity (e.g., a name of a restaurant on a map and an advertisement for the restaurant). That is, when it is determined that an ad an map content (e.g., a label) refer to the same entity such as a restaurant, instead of displaying the name of the restaurant and a separate ad, the advertisement and name of the restaurant are clustered and provided within a single entry on the map.
- an ad an map content e.g., a label
- a set of ads relating to a set of organic map content are retrieved.
- the set of ads are compared to the set of organic map content (e.g., using fuzzy matching based on name, address, phone number, or other identifier associated with the map content and/or the ad).
- ads and map content corresponding to the same entity are identified and clustered.
- Each map content and/or ad is associated with a set of information including location (e.g., defined in terms of latitude/longitude in a 2D map), entity identifier (e.g., title or name of business or entity associated with the ad or organic map content), entity domain name, entity phone number, or other similar information identifying the entity associated with the map content or ad.
- location e.g., defined in terms of latitude/longitude in a 2D map
- entity identifier e.g., title or name of business or entity associated with the ad or organic map content
- entity domain name e.g., entity phone number, or other similar information identifying the entity associated with the map content or ad.
- the distance between an ad and organic map content having a probability of being clustered can be limited to a distance limit (e.g., 250 meters).
- the location of the ad is used to generate a query for map content within a threshold region defined in terms of the location of the ad (e.g., organic map content a "D" distance away from the location of the ad, where D is a threshold distance).
- the coordinate space could be defined in terms of different location identifiers, and the region may be represented in different ways. For example, S2 indexes and/or latitude/longitude may be used to define the location of the ad. Additionally, the region around each ad could be rectangular, circular or of another shape, and the region could be represented in different ways.
- the request can be for organic map content meeting the original search query or all map content available that are within the defined region.
- the request may return a defined number ("N") results.
- N a defined number
- a single request is sent for all ads where the number of results (e.g., organic map content within a D distance of the ad location) may be limited to N/(number of ads) for each ad.
- the number results per region could be distributed such that at most N/(number of ads) search results are returned around each point.
- the results for each ad which includes one or more organic map content (e.g., up to "N" search results) within a defined region around the location of the ad, are then compared to the ad and clustering is performed (e.g., using some fuzzy matching).
- the fuzzy matching is performed by using entity information associated with the ad and the one or more organic map results.
- the fuzzy matching may be performed according to comparing one or more of the entity name, entity phone number or entity domain name associated with the ad and each of the one or more organic map content (e.g., map content returned being a distance D from the location of the ad).
- the comparison and/or clustering may be performed by the server and the clustered entity may be returned for the ad.
- the organic map content meeting the query may be provided to the client, and the client may perform the clustering process to identify the organic map content to cluster with the ad.
- the query is restricted to a certain number of results in close proximity to the ads.
- the results are ranked by their proximity to their respective ad.
- the comparison may be performed according to the ranking (e.g., the results with the most likelihood of being clustered with the ad are compared first).
- the comparison according to ranking allows the system to take advantage of the assumption that ads and map content corresponding to the same entity are likely to be proximate to one another.
- the ranking further ensures that if the returned results need to be limited, (e.g., because of the threshold number of results), the most likely map content to be clustered with the ad are returned for comparison.
- the described method may also be used for search, if it is desirable to rank results based on proximity to a location(s) (known before the search is performed). For example, searching for "pizza near a station" could determine the locations for stations in the viewport, and the results may be filtered according to their distance to the station.

- FIG. 2 illustrates a process 200 for clustering map content with ads relating to the same entity as the map content.
- the clustering of ad content with organic map content is performed so that map content referring to an entity can be grouped with ads relating to the same entity and displayed to the user as a single entity on a map being displayed to the user.
- an ad is identified.
- map content e.g., searches for an address or entity on the map
- a set of map content and ads matching the search query are returned for display within a map in response to the user request.
- the process 200 described herein may be performed for the one or more of the ads returned in response to the user request.
- the location of the ad is determined.
- the ad is associated with entity data relating to the entity corresponding to the ad (e.g., the advertiser, or sponsor of the ad, the business advertised in the ad, a business offering the advertised product or service, etc.).
- the entity information may include one or more of entity location (e.g., address, map latitude/longitude), identifier, name, phone number, domain name, entity type, entity category, entity related products and/or services, entity related people and other similar information relating to the entity.
- an entity may refer to a person or business.
- the ad location is determined based on the entity data associated with the business.
- a map region for the ad is defined based on the location of the ad.
- the map region may be defined in relation to the location of the ad determined in block 202.
- the map region may, for example, be defined as an area around the location of the map (e.g., within a radius or distance D away from the location of the ad).
- the map region may be defined in terms of different location identifiers, and the region may be represented in different ways. For example, S2 indexes and/or latitude/longitude may be used to define the location of the ad.
- the region around each ad could be rectangular, circular or of another shape, and the region could be represented in different ways.
- a query is generated to retrieve organic map content relating to the ad.
- the query in some implementations, includes the map region defined in block 203.
- the query may further include search criteria (e.g., the search criteria included in the original search query by the user and/or entity data relating to the ad).
- one or more organic map content items are received.
- the one or more map content items are located within the map region defined in block 203.
- the organic map content items are selected based on one or more search criteria included in the search query generated in block 204.
- the request may return a defined number ("N") results. ).
- the returned search results, around each point are ranked by the distance from each respective point (instead of ranking based primarily on relevance). This ensures that if search results need to be dropped (more than N could be returned), the results less likely to cluster with the ad are dropped first.
- the organic map content item may be associated with entity data relating to the entity represented by or associated with the map content items, including one or more of entity location (e.g., address, map latitude/longitude), identifier, name, phone number, domain name, entity type, entity category, entity related products and/or services, entity related people and other similar information relating to the entity.
- entity location e.g., address, map latitude/longitude
- identifier e.g., name, phone number, domain name, entity type, entity category, entity related products and/or services, entity related people and other similar information relating to the entity.
- the organic map data retrieved in block 205 may include only organic map content items that were retrieved in the original search (e.g., the user query that returned the ad content), or may include any organic map content items.
- the one or more map content items is compared with the ad to determine if the ad can be clustered with any organic map content item.
- one or more of the entity data associated with the ad is compared to the data relating to the map content items.
- the name or identifier of the entity associated with the ad may be compared to the name or identifier of the entity associated with the organic map content item.
- other entity information associated with the ad may be compared against the entity information associated with the map content item.
- a first set of entity information corresponding to the ad e.g., entity name
- the comparison may be further confirmed by comparing other entity information such as the entity phone number and/or domain name of the ad and map content item.
- the entity data of the ad matches the entity data of any of the one or more map content items. If so, then it may be inferred that the ad and the map content item refer to the same entity and thus may be clustered. Thus, in block 208, the map content item and ad content are clustered. The clustered ad and map content item may then be provided for display to the user as a separate entity in the map being displayed to the user. If, one the other hand, it is determined that there are no map content item that match the ad the process ends in block 209.
- process 200 is described with respect to a single ad, as described above, the same process may be repeated for multiple ads.
- a separate query may be issued for each ad.
- a single query may be issued to retrieve map content associated with a plurality of ads. The map content is then received for each ad and the ads may be clustered with map content according to the above processes.
