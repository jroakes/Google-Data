Fig. 3 is some illustrative aspects according to the disclosure, for providing the workflow of the context fact 300.For carrying
Procedure below is described for the true workflow 300 of context：Receive the data of mark special entity, selected based on the special entity
Select generated data structure and provide the data of the data structure for output.For providing context true workflow 300
It may include：Ranked true 302a-302n list, the data structure 304 corresponding with special entity, the specific data knot of selection
The true synthesis 306 of the context of the list of structure and data structure to be synthesized and provide the data of the true synthesis 306 of context for
The true output 308 of the context of output.In some aspects, data structure 304 may correspond to the specified genus of special entity, the entity
Property or both.
Ranking fact 302a-302n list may each comprise based on the fact associated with each entity to carry out ranking
One or more entities.For example, ranked true 302a-302n list may include Asia top, highest peak in world, the world
Most long river, highest US President etc.., can be according to the attribute of such as height by the reality at such as peak in the list of highest peak in world
Body carries out ranking.In some aspects, predetermined number destination entity can be included in ranking fact 302a-302n each list.Therefore,
The list of highest peak in world may include total of five entity：Mountain Everest (Mount Everest), K2 peaks, Kanchenjunga
(Kangchenjunga), Lhotse (Lhotse Mountain) and Ma Kalu peaks (Makalu Mountain).World's highest
The list at peak can be based on the height on every mountain come by these mountain rankings.With reference to figure 3, Mountain Everest can rank the first, and K2 peaks can
It is number two, Kanchenjunga can be number three, and Lhotse can be number four, and Ma Kalu peaks can be number five.
Ranking fact 302a-302n list can be associated with score value.The score value of each list may correspond to each row
The relative popularity of table.In some aspects, the score value of each list is to include closing with particular column phase table based on recent search inquiry
The frequency of the entity of connection generates.In some respects, the score value of particular list can be based on recent search inquiry including specific
The frequency of list.For example, in recent search inquiry, highest US President list may frequently go out than highest peak in world list
It is existing.Under this example, it may be determined that highest US President's list is more popular than highest peak in world list.Therefore, highest peak in world arranges
Table may include the list score value of the 75 of full marks 100, and highest US President's list may include 90 list point that full marks 100 divide
Value is to reflect appearance of each list in nearest search inquiry.
It can be each true generation data structure 304 of the entity associated with ranked true 302a-302n list.
Data structure 304 may correspond to the particular community of corresponding entity.In some respects, data structure 304 can be quoted and special entity
The ranking and and the list phase associated with each respective attributes of the entity of the entity in associated list, the list
Corresponding list score value.For example, K2 peak heights (K2 Mountain Height) can be associated with data structure, because it is located at
In ranked true 302a-302n list.Reference picture 3, K2 peak heights can be associated with highest peak in world list.Each data
In structure, the ranking and list score value of entity may be present.Therefore, K2 peak heights can be number two simultaneously in highest peak in world list
And including 75 list score value.
The true synthesis 306 of context can be used for selecting specific data structure 304.In some aspects, the true synthesis 306 of context
Determine which data structure selected using the list score value of each data structure 304.For example, if there is two K2 peak heights
Each in degrees of data structure and data structure is associated with different lists, then the two lists can each include two not
Same list score value.Therefore, the K2 peak heights data structure with highest score may be selected for closing in the true synthesis 306 of context
Into.For example, the first K2 peak heights data structure can be associated with the highest peak in world list including 75 list score value, and the
Two K2 peak heights data structures may correspond to the Asia highest peak list that score value is 15.Therefore, the true synthesis 306 of context may be selected
The K2 peak heights data structure of highest peak in world list is quoted for synthesis, this is due to the list between the two lists
Score value is larger.
The true synthesis 306 of context can also be used to perform natural language synthesis to entity and the fact that corresponding with entity.Cause
This, it is possible to provide entity and corresponding true for being exported according to text, audio or the form of the two.Such as, if it is determined that the reality
Body is K2 peaks, and it is highest peak in world to determine list, and determines that ranking of the entity in the list is second, then context is true
Synthesis 306 can synthesize pure English text, and to provide, for output, such as " K2 peaks are the second in the world peak (K2 Mountain is
the 2nd tallest mountain in the world)”。
The true output 308 of context may include the output for having synthesized and providing via the true synthesis 306 of context.The context fact is defeated
Go out 308 can via text, audio or the two synthesize 306 data provided by context is true to export.The true output 308 of context
It may include：The fact that ranking and the entity in the list of entity, the particular list associated with the entity, the entity.
For example, entity may include K2 peaks, the list associated with K2 peaks can be highest peak in world, ranking of the entity in the list
Can be the second in the world peak, and the true height that may correspond to K2 peaks.
In some aspects, the true output 308 of context can provide relevant with the conspicuousness in list the fact that entity add
Information.Context is true to export related entities included in 308 lists that may include selected entity.If for example, output generation
The ranking at K2 peaks among boundary's highest peak list, the then true output 308 of context also other mountains in exportable highest peak in world list
Peak.Therefore, it is possible to provide the ranking at the K2 peaks in highest peak in world list among other ranked mountain peaks., can under this example
By K2 peaks compared with other ranked peaks.In some respects, in addition to the ranking of each related entities, also output is each
The fact that related entities.For example, in addition to the ranking associated with mountain peak, every in also exportable highest peak in world list
The height on mountain peak.
Fig. 4 illustrates the exemplary process diagram of the offer context fact 400 of some aspects according to the disclosure.Context thing is provided
Real 400 flow chart describes in response to the inquiry lexical item of search engine and provides context true process.In step 402,
Server can be configured to one or more lists of receiving entity.Each list in the list may include the score value of association,
It is associated with the corresponding fact and include the ranking of entity subset.
The score value associated with particular list may indicate that the relative popularity of list.In some aspects, point of particular list
Value is determined based on the frequency of occurrences of entity associated with the list in recent search inquiry.In some respects, it is specific
The score value of list can include the frequency of the particular list based on recent search inquiry.For example, in recent search inquiry, highest
US President's list may appearance more frequent than highest peak in world list.Under this example, it may be determined that highest US President's list
May be more popular than highest peak in world list.Therefore, highest peak in world list may include 75 list score value of full marks 100, and
And highest US President's list may include 90 list score value of full marks 100, to reflect each list in recent search inquiry
Occur.
The corresponding fact of each list may include all entity attributes or property suitable for list.For example, attribute can
Including mountain peak height, US President's height, river length etc..In some respects, corresponding true next pair of each list can be used
