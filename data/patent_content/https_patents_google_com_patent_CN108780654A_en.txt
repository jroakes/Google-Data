Fig. 4 is the example block diagram 400 for the operation for illustrating the shot boundary module according to some embodiments of the disclosure.Mirror
Head boundary module can be similar to about shot boundary module 250 described in Fig. 2.Shot boundary module can determine mobile contracting
Whether the latter end 422 of the start-up portion 420 of sketch map and/or mobile thumbnail is near shot boundary 410.Implement at one
In mode, shot boundary 410 can be determined using the motion detection between two adjacent video frames.Shot boundary module 400
Motion detection can be similar to the motion detection that is discussed above for sport scores device.Motion detection can use movement note
Moving-mass score between two adjacent video frames for being divided to device to generate mobile thumbnail.Motion detection can contribute to determine
Shot boundary 410.For example, when editing two camera lenses together, the of the last one video frame of previous camera lens and latter camera lens
One video frame may be different scene.Because camera lens is different scene, the last one video frame of previous camera lens and
First video frame of latter camera lens may show and largely move and generate big moving-mass score.
In one example, the beginning and/or end of mobile thumbnail can respectively before shot boundary and/or it
Afterwards.As a result, the user for watching such mobile thumbnail may can be appreciated that close to the beginning of mobile thumbnail and/or dashing forward for end
So variation.This suddenly change close to beginning and/or the end of mobile thumbnail is not that user is desired, and therefore it can
It can have a negative impact to their viewing experience.All aspects of this disclosure solve this by the size of the mobile thumbnail of reduction
Problem.Particularly, it may be determined that the shot boundary of beginning and/or completion beam part for moving thumbnail.Mobile contracting
The beginning of sketch map can be the time portion of mobile thumbnail comprising move the first video frame of thumbnail and from first
Video frame time/distance " x " subsequent video frame (e.g., including the institute in the first video frame and first second mobile thumbnail
1 second time portion of the mobile thumbnail of some subsequent video frames).The completion part 422 of mobile thumbnail can be moved
The time portion of dynamic thumbnail comprising the final video frame of mobile thumbnail and time/distance before final video frame
" x " previous video frame (e.g., including all previous videos in final video frame and the mobile thumbnail of last second
1 second time portion of the mobile thumbnail of frame).
For example, Fig. 4 illustrates 4 seconds long mobile thumbnails, and merge the video frame of video item, start from 2 seconds and
Terminated (for example, " beginning " and " end ") with 6 seconds.It can be in the beginning 420 (for example, about 2.3 seconds) of mobile thumbnail
Middle detector lens boundary 410A.For example, the moving-mass score of about 2.3 seconds two adjacent video frames can exceed that threshold value.
Can in the latter end 422 (for example, about 5.9 seconds) of mobile thumbnail detector lens boundary 410C.For example, about 5.9
The moving-mass score of two adjacent video frames of second can exceed that threshold value.Mobile contracting is detected in response to shot boundary module 400
Shot boundary 410A in the beginning 420 of sketch map, can reduce the length of mobile thumbnail so that the of mobile thumbnail
One video frame starts not before shot boundary 410A (for example, being removed the video frame in mobile thumbnail to 2.3 seconds from 2 seconds.
The shot boundary 410C in the latter end 422 of mobile thumbnail is detected in response to shot boundary module 400, can reduce shifting
The length of dynamic thumbnail so that the final video frame of mobile thumbnail do not terminate after shot boundary 410C (for example, by from
Removal video frame was by most 6 seconds within 5.9 seconds).
The middle section of mobile thumbnail can also include shot boundary (for example, shot boundary 410B).Mobile thumbnail
Middle section in the mobile thumbnail with shot boundary be more likely to it is expected by user, and therefore may not be to them
Viewing experience have a negative impact.In addition, the length for reducing mobile thumbnail makes the shot boundary in middle section
Before 410B the first video frame of mobile thumbnail do not start to and/or the shot boundary 410B in middle section after move
The final video frame of thumbnail is not over, the duration of mobile thumbnail may be made too short and can not effectively convey about
The information of associated video item.As a result, in some embodiments, ignoring the camera lens side in the middle section of mobile thumbnail
Boundary, and the shot boundary in the beginning and end part for only considering movement thumbnail when the size of the mobile thumbnail of modification.
