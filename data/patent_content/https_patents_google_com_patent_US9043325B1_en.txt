- Online map services have been available for many years, offering functionality including displaying graphical maps (whether image-, line-, or vector-based maps), locating locations by address, and providing travel directions (often illustrated on the above graphical maps).
- Some map services also maintain a database of geographical entities (such as restaurants, stores, and tourist destinations), their respective locations, and other information regarding these points of interest. Searches may be run against this database to identify particular points of interest for a user. For example, a user of a map service may submit a text-based search query for “thai restaurant, el cerrito, ca”, resulting in a list of restaurants serving Thai food in or about El Cerrito, Calif., which may also be listed and shown on a graphical map display.
- Some online map services have included a mechanism for user-submitted reviews of geographical entities.
- Information provided in such reviews is useful for search and ranking of geographical entities.
- few users take time to submit ratings or comments about geographical entities, which limits the benefits obtained from user-submitted information, such as enhanced search quality or simply providing more information for consumption by users.
- the disclosed subject matter relates to a machine-implemented method for displaying user-submitted comments for a plurality of geographic entities.
- a list of geographic entities is displayed, and a plurality of user-submitted comments associated with the geographic entity and a comment entry field which permits a user to submit a new comment associated with the geographic entity are displayed concurrently for each listed geographic entity.
- the disclosed subject matter further relates to a system for displaying user-submitted comments for a plurality of geographic entities, the system including one or more processors, and a computer readable storage medium comprising instructions stored therein, which when executed by the processors, cause the processors to perform operations including displaying a list of geographic entities, displaying, concurrently for each listed geographic entity, a plurality of user-submitted comments associated with the geographic entity and a comment entry field which permits a user to submit a new comment associated with the geographic entity, receiving a second new comment, and updating, while displaying the user-submitted comments, the displayed user-submitted comments to include the second new comment.
- the disclosed subject matter also relates to a computer readable storage medium comprising instructions stored therein, which when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform operations including displaying a list of geographic entities, displaying, concurrently for each listed geographic entity, a plurality of user-submitted comments associated with the geographic entity and a comment entry field which permits a user to submit a new comment associated with the geographic entity, receiving the new comment associated with one of the plurality of geographic entities, and utilizing the new comment for ranking geographical entities.

- the most recent user-submitted comments are displayed in geographical element listing 220 a , in order to facilitate communication among users of map service 110 about geographical entities. Due to limited display area on user device 105 , often only a portion of the user-submitted comments available for a geographical entity may be simultaneously displayed.
- a scrollbar similar to scrollbar 230 may be provided, a user interface element which presents a window for reviewing more user-submitted comments may be provided, or a user interface element which allows for searching through user-submitted comments may be provided, by way of example.

- user-submitted comments may include media other than simple text, with the capabilities of the element provided for entering and submitting new user-submitted comments corresponding to the available media options.
- step 335 may be performed, in which user device 105 may perform live updating of geographical element listing 220 a , such that a new user-submitted comment (including one submitted by user device 105 ) for the geographical element corresponding to geographical element listing 220 a submitted while geographical element listing 220 a is being displayed are added to geographical element listing 220 a .
- this may be accomplished via a “push” transaction, in which map service 110 pushes updated data to user device 105 , which causes geographical element listing 220 a to be updated with a new user-submitted comment.
- this live updating of the display with new comments may allow users to conduct a real-time discussion about a particular geographical entity.
- the new user-submitted comment may be utilized for search and ranking of results in future searches for geographical entities. In some aspects of the disclosed subject matter, this may be performed by examining the content of user-submitted comments for generating a search index for geographical entities. Additionally, the content of user-submitted contents may be used for ranking an initial set of results, to better identify more significant or relevant geographical entities.
