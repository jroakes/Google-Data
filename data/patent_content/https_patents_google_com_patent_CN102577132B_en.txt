Description
Technical field
The present invention relates generally to high efficiency digital coding and decoding.
Background technology
Nearest Two decades years comes, and microprocessor speed increases multiple order of magnitude and digital signal processor (DSP) becomes omnipresent.Conversion from analog communication to digital communication becomes more flexibly with attractive.Digital communication provides the major advantage that can effectively utilize bandwidth, and allows mistake in alignment technique to use.Thus, by using digital technology, can more information be sent by the spectrum space of given distribution and send information more reliably.Digital communication can use radio link (wireless) or physical network media (such as, optical fiber, copper network).
Digital communication may be used for dissimilar communication, such as, and such as audio frequency, video or telemetry.Digital communication system comprises transmitting apparatus and receiving equipment.Can carry out in the system of two-way communication, each equipment has transmission and reception circuit.Send in numeral or in receiving equipment, there is multistage process, by it, data are in the stage be transfused to by input (such as, microphone, camera, transducer) and be used to modulated carrier and transmitted between the stage be transmitted.After (1) is transfused to and is digitized, (2) can apply some initial noisc filtering, carry out (3) source code and (4) final chnnel coding afterwards.The present invention described in page subsequently can be thought and fall into the source code stage.
The main target of source code is to reduce bit rate, keeps perceived quality most possibly simultaneously.Various criterion is developed for dissimilar media.Such as, Joint Photographic Experts Group is applied to rest image, and IS-127 standard is applied to audio frequency simultaneously.For the concession of practicality, usually use and design source encoder corresponding to the vector length of DSP register capacity or the even-multiple of multiple DSP register capacity (such as, 128).Now for each application, all there are some restrictions to institute's allocated channel bandwidth.Based on this restriction, the designer of source encoder/decoder is by consider just to be decided by all degrees of freedom of each part of media of encoding may the specific quantity of code.Such as, when audio coding, may exist the particular frame size (such as, 160 sampling long) set up, the tonepulse allowed in each audio frame specific quantity and will the specific quantity of total amplitude quantum of pulse be assigned to.The selection made by designer is intended to maximize perceived quality, remains in distributed bandwidth simultaneously.Because all things are all discrete and are quantized, so the total quantity of peculiar (unique) frame can be enumerated.The potential total quantity of spy for every frame and the bandwidth of distributing are closely related, this is because it must send enough information by channel during the time interval of audio frame, to be identified in the peculiar frame that this image duration corresponds to this audio frequency most.The total quantity of peculiar frame is larger, just requires that more information is to identify a particular frame uniquely.Now, contingent, the total quantity (n) of peculiar frame is not power (that is, n ≠ 2 of 2
k, wherein, k is integer).Such as, n < 2 is supposed
k, in this case, if use k position integer representation every frame, then should exist always be never sent out close to 2
ksome scopes of high value integer.This expression system is inefficient, this is because be assigned with k position, but k position is not fully used.
U.S. Patent No. 7,230,550 disclose a kind of passing through reduces to need the mode of the overall position size of expression one group of multidigit code word, one group of multidigit code word is split into highest significant position (MSB) part and least significant bit (LSB) part, and combine MSB part and LSB part, thus solve the method for above-mentioned poor efficiency.Unfortunately, if as required in high bandwidth, high-fidelity system, large number of codewords will be processed in this way, and the method for 550 patents can require that high accuracy multiply operation is performed.This be calculate expensive, from but disadvantageous.
Although above example relates to audio frequency and discusses frame, more generally, dissimilar media (such as, image, video, remote measurement & audio frequency) feature be that (in whole or in part) n may one of code, wherein, n be (based on bandwidth restriction selected possibly) integer but be not 2 power, such as, n ≠ 2
k, wherein, k is integer.Similarly, generally also there is poor efficiency under these circumstances.

Fig. 1 is the block diagram of communication system 100 according to an embodiment of the invention.Communication system 100 comprises first communication equipment 102 and N number of communication equipment 104 that can be coupled communicatedly by communication network or peer channel 106.At least one in communication equipment 102,104 comprises transmitter, and at least one in communication equipment 102 and 104 comprises receiver.Specific embodiment provides two-way communication, and in this case, communication equipment 102,104 comprises transmitter and receiver.
Fig. 2 be in FIG shown in communication system in the block diagram of the transmitter 200 of equipment 102,104 that uses.Transmitter comprises input 202, and it can adopt multi-form according to the type of the information be just sent out.In case of audio, input 202 suitably adopts the form of microphone; In case of a video, input 202 suitably adopts the form of imageing sensor; And when remote measurement, input can adopt the form of transducer.
Input 202 is connected to signal conditioner 204.Signal Regulation can such as comprise analog domain filtering and/or amplification.
This signal conditioner 204 is connected to analog to digital converter (A/D) 206, the signal that its digitlization receives from signal conditioner 204.
A/D 206 is coupled to digital filter 208, and it is for performing additional filterings in the digital domain.
Digital filter is coupled to first order source encoder 210.First order source encoder 210 such as can comprise Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP) encoder (it is the audio coder of a type), MDCT (MDCT) encoder (it can be applied to the signal of number of different types), maybe can be used as the signal coder of any type of precoder or pretreatment stage.Now, the data entered normally are divided into discrete area (such as, specifying the audio frame (sampling corresponding to specific quantity) of duration or the fritter of image) and encode in these blocks at every turn by first order source encoder.(note, this does not get rid of the differential coding about previous frame or block.) here, in systems in which, each things is quantized and discretization, make to there is the difference possibility signal phasor for the limited quantity of each discrete area.Can based on so actual consideration, the resolution of discretization and quantification is designed for the length of the register of the digital signal processor (DSP) of the system of realization.The discretization of first order source encoder 210 and quantification and other aspects are also suitably considered based on perception, or in general based on sent demand on signal quality.At the far-end of transmitter 200, that is, to the output 228 of channel, there is another constraint, that is, also must by the maximum channel bandwidth adapted to.Realize signal quality and consider that the fine balance between available bandwidth can cause drawing the design of source encoder 210,212 usually, wherein, the quantity of possible signal phasor may not be integer power (that is, n ≠ 2 of 2 by chance
k, wherein, n is the quantity of possible signal phasor and k is any integer).At this under normal circumstances, if send k bit word with one of n possibility signal phasor identifying each discrete area being used for data, be then obviously inefficient in system.In information theory, significantly this poor efficiency will produce, this is because due to n < 2 to those skilled in the art
k, so the particular value of k position integer (code word) is never sent out, but even so, all k positions still all require to be sent out.In this case, the k bit word of of n signal phasor represents and is considered to have " non-integer " length.
Refer again to Fig. 2, will see, first order source encoder 210 is coupled to factorial pulse coder (FPC) 212.FPC can produce k bit word to represent the encoder of a type of n position signal phasor.In the U.S. Patent No. 6,236,960 of the people such as Weimin Peng, describe early stage factorial pulse coder, itself and the present invention are transferred jointly.Basis FPC by setting up the sequence of institute's likely signal phasor, and generates the integer code word of pointing to the signal specific vector in sorting and operates.The feature of signal specific vector is, the specific unique combinations of non-zero position, amplitude and symbol.Thus replace sending signal phasor, integer code word is sent out.The United States Patent (USP) 7 of " Apparatus and Method for Low Complexity Combinatorial Coding of Signals " by name, 461,106 FPC that improvement is provided, it is used in approximate (approximation) of the combination function described in 960 patents, to reduce assessing the cost of Code And Decode.The above-mentioned poor efficiency caused due to non-integer length codewords continues in the output of FPC 212.As current description, poor efficiency is solved by the providing of successive stages of transmitter.
Factorial pulse coder 212 is coupled to MSB/LSB resolver 214.The each multidigit code division received from FPC 212 is highest significant position part (MSB) and least significant bit part (LSB) by MSB/LSB resolver 214.Division code word is here the first stage for solving above-mentioned poor efficiency.LSB part can take all probable values, thus these positions can be utilized more fully.MSB may not be fully utilized, so by splitting off MSB and LSB, and isolation is inefficient in MSB.According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, replace FPC coding, use assembly coding and the decoding of another kind of type.When using assembly coding and the decoding of other types, similar benefit can be obtained.
According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, from the code word of FPC reception is not all, all there is equal length (such as, k position is so long).In this case, according to a selection, the quantity being grouped into the position of MSB part is fixing, and the quantity being grouped into the position of LSB is allowed to change.The application that the length of code word can change is audio communication system, and wherein, first order source encoder 210 is encoded to independent audio frequency band discretely, and distribute varying number for each position.This is rational, because the frequency range that covers based on them of different voiced band and/or their spectrum energies of comprising, has Different Effects to sensing audio quality.
Refer again to Fig. 2, can find out, MSB/LSB resolver 214 is coupled to many MSB buffer 216 and many LSB buffer 218.Because LSB part is fully utilized, these can be linked together simply.Such as, in voice applications, the LSB part from all middle derivation one group of frequency band during an audio frame period can be linked together.Many LSB buffer 218 is coupled to the connector (concatenator) 222 multiple LSB part linked together.
Many MSB buffer 216 is coupled to arithmetic encoder 220.Conceptually, arithmetic encoder can be used symbol sebolic addressing to be mapped to uniquely the specific sub-ranges (possibility region) of scope 0 to 1.Use the first symbol will (0,1] scope is divided into multiple subranges of the quantity equaling distinct symbols value (such as, be 2 for binary system).The size of subrange can proportional with the possibility of corresponding symbol value (such as, the chance of zero be 25%, and the chance of 1 is 75%).Identity (value) based on symbol selects a subrange.Each continuous symbol is for dividing the subrange using its prefix (subsequence of the symbol before it) to identify further again.Then, the binary representation falling into the mark of each subrange (such as, 11, to represent 3/4) is used as code, to represent the symbol sebolic addressing mapping to subrange.Co-pending Patent patent application serial numbers at " Arithmetic Encoding For CELP Encoders " (file number CML07096) by name: 12/247, instructs the arithmetic encoder of a type in 440.In this case, voice data is reduced to binary sequence, that is, each symbol is the sequence of 0 or 1.The arithmetic encoder 220 used in the present invention is more complicated, because symbol is integer value and can from 0 to G
i mAXin the scope of the maximum of-the i-th MSB part.In this case, except each symbol is used to be divided into except two subranges by previous scope (or subrange), each symbol is used that previous scope (or subrange) is divided into G
i mAXindividual subrange.The flow chart of arithmetic encoder is shown in Figure 4 and in following description.The output of arithmetic encoder 220 is the codes (" arithmetic code ") of the sequence representing the MSB part received from many MSB buffer 216.
Refer again to Fig. 2, can find out, arithmetic encoder 220 and connector 22 are coupled to packet assembler 224.Packet assembler 224 is coupled to channel encoder 226, itself so that be coupled to the output 228 of channel.Other information of such as spectral band energy also can be supplied to packet assembler.
Fig. 3 be in FIG shown in communication system in the block diagram of the receiver 300 of equipment 102,104 that uses.The input being grouped in channel 302 sent by transmitter 300 is received, and it is coupled to channel decoder 304, itself so that be coupled to resolver 306.Packet parsing device 306 is coupled to n-LSB register 312 and arithmetic code register 308.Packet parsing device 306 extracts the LSB connected, and they are delivered to n-LSB register 312.Packet parsing device 306 also extracts arithmetic code and is delivered to arithmetic decoder 310.Arithmetic decoder 310 is coupled to n-MSB register 314.Arithmetic decoder 310 reverses coding, and exports the sequence of MSB part to n-MSB register 314.The flow chart of arithmetic decoder 310 is as shown in Figure 5 and in following description.
N-LSB register 312 and n-MSB register 314 are coupled to multiplexer 316.Multiplexer 316 is coupled to FPC register.Multiplexer 316 associates corresponding MSB and LSB again, and to reformulate complete FPC code word, it is transferred into factorial pulse code register 318.FPC register 318 and then be coupled to factorial constant-delay discriminator 320.The coding that factorial constant-delay discriminator 320 reconstitutes first order source encoder 210 exports, and is delivered to first order source decoder 322, and it reconstitutes raw information (such as, audio frequency, view data).First order source decoder 322 is coupled to digital to analog converter (D/A) 324, itself so that be coupled to output 326 (such as, display, audio tweeter).
Fig. 4 is the flow chart for carrying out the arithmetic encoder 220 of encoding to the MSB part of the code exported by previous coder (such as, factorial pulse coder).In frame 402, index i, index j, variable x, variable y and variable rl, variable n and variable n-tilda are initialised.Identify that the variable i of the MSB part in the sequence of MSB part is initialized to 0, to point to the MSB part in sequence.Point to and the variable j of the continuous position in the code word produced by arithmetic encoder 310 is initialized to-2 (not using the first two code bit).Represent that the variable x of the position in arithmetic code spatial dimension is initialized to 0.Variable y as the ratio that resets (re-scalable) variable of the width of expression subrange is initialized to 2
w.Conceptive, code space can be considered to scope (0,1], but in fact code space is represented as 0-2
w.W is also the accuracy parameter of the accuracy corresponding to the arithmetic used by arithmetic encoder 310 effectively.Although be fixing in the flow chart that W is shown in figs. 4-6, alternatively, for each i-th symbol, W can be set independently.RI running length variable is initialized to 0.N is initialized to G
i mAX, i is set to its initial value 0.G
i mAXit is the maximum of i-th MSB part.MSB part has different maximum according to the design of first order source encoder 210.Such as, for may G be caused to the not coordination of different frequency bands coding assignment
i mAXdifferent value.N-tilda is initialized to G
i, the actual value of i-th MSB.
After frame 402, decision box 404 is the loop termination standards whether test will be processed by all MSB parts of encoding.If result is negative (meaning that more MSB part will be processed), then flow process proceeds to frame 406.First step in frame 406 calculates next subrange size.Next subrange size is by G
i(i-th MSB part) and G
i mAXthe mark (fraction) of the previous subrange size that the value (here being represented by n-tilda and n respectively) of (i-th MSB part maximum) is determined.For calculating the formula of the size of subrange be:
After previous formula is estimated, it is incremented, and n and n-tilda is set to G respectively
i mAXand G
i.
Next, in block 408, the position in the code space represented by variable x is increased the round value of the mark of the previous subrange size proportional with the ratio of the new value of n-tilda and n.In other words, G
imore close to G
i mAX, the reposition in code space is higher.And in block 408, the subrange size represented by variable y is set to the new value calculated at frame 406 now, and variable z is set to this new value.
Whether the value of decision box 410 test variable y is less than 2
w.If so, then flow chart branches to frame 412.Note, if the result of decision box 404 is affirmatives, then flow chart is also branched off into frame 412.
In block 412, represent that the variable y of subrange size resets ratio (rescaled) by factor 2 (it can be completed by left dislocation in binary arithmetic).And in block 412, the value variable e launched is set to equal code space position x divided by 2
wfloor function.Next, in block 412, reset ratio corresponding to y, the value of the position in code space is reset as x mod 2
wthe twice of value.
Next, decision box 414 is tested the value variable launched and whether is equaled 1.If so, then flow process proceeds to frame 416, and wherein, running length variable rl is incremented and after this flow chart branches returns decision box 410.When the result of decision box 410 is no, flow chart branches returns decision box 404.
When the result of decision box 414 is no, flow chart branches is to decision box 418.Decision box 418 is tested the variate-value launched and whether is greater than 1.If so, then flow process proceeds to frame 420.In frame 420, next bit variable nb increases progressively 1, runs bit variable rb and is set to equal 0 and the variate-value e launched reduction 2.If on the other hand, the result of decision box 418 is no, then flow chart branches is to frame 422, wherein, run bit variable rb zero to be set to equal 1.After frame 420 or 422, flow process reaches frame 424.In frame 424, the variable j pointing to continuous code bit increases progressively 1, and a jth code bit Vj is set to equal next bit variable nb, and nb variable is set to equal launched variable e.
Next, whether decision box 426 test run length variable rl is greater than 0.If so, then flow performing frame 428, wherein, variable j increases progressively, and a jth code bit Vj is set to equal to run bit variable rb, and running length variable successively decreases.After each execution of frame 428, flow cycles returns frame 426.When the result of frame 426 is no, then flow process exits circulation and reaches decision box 430.
Decision box 430 tests whether i=M, that is, just whether be there is any residue MSB part by the sequence of MSB part of encoding.If more MSB parts still will be processed, then flow cycles returns decision box 410, and continues as described above to perform.When determining in a block 430 not exist processed more MSB parts, flow chart branches is to decision box 432.Whether decision box 432 test variable j equals the L of the length indicating arithmetic code.If not, then flow performing 434, wherein, a jth code bit Vj is set to equal 1 and j increases progressively 1.From frame 434, flow cycles returns decision box 432.When the result of frame 432 is for time certainly, arithmetic code completes and Flow ends.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart of the arithmetic decoder 310 for the MSB partial decoding of h to the code produced by another encoder (such as, factorial pulse coder).In frame 502, mention that the index i of just decoded continuous symbol is initialized to 0 (pointing to first symbol); The integer j pointing to continuous code bit is initialized to 0 (pointing to first code bit); The variable x of the position in arithmetic code space is specified to be initialized to 0 (x will be established based on code place value); The variable y of the interval width in appointment codes space is initialized to 1 and variable n is set to equal G
i max.Frame 504 is decision boxes, and its result depends on whether y is less than 2
w.W is the fixing accuracy used by decoder 310.At first, the result of decision box 504 is no, and make flow chart branches to decision box 506, whether its test variable j is less than regular length parameter L.L represents the length of arithmetic code.At first, the result of decision box is affirmative (j < L), makes flow chart branches to frame 508.In frame 508, variable X is multiplied by 2 (moving to left one) and adds the value of code bit.(note, initial X is simply set as the value of code bit, this is because X is initialized to 0).When after all code bits of process, when the result of frame 506 becomes no, flow chart branches is to frame 510, and wherein, x is multiplied by 2 (not adding code bit) simply.After frame 508 or frame 510, flow chart branches is to frame 512, and wherein, y is multiplied by 2.After frame 512, flow cycles returns 504, whether is less than 2 again to test y
w.When process all code bits after, and may move to left in 510 x and move to left further in 512 y time, in frame 504, determine that y is more than 2
w, flow chart branches is to frame 514.In frame 514, variable n-tilda (temporary variable for coded identification) is set to the floor function equaling (2xn+n-1)/2y.In frame 516, the variable z of the width in interim storage code space is arranged according to the given equation for z above.
And, in frame 516, G
i, i-th code word is set to equal n-tilda; Index i is incremented 1 and variable n is set to equal i-th G
i maxvalue.In frame 518, variable x is set to the value reducing round (y*n-tilda/n)---the basic part removing " highly " (position) be attributable in the code space of previous code position.And in frame 518, represent that the variable y at the interval in code space is reset as z, it represents the interval in the code space selected by previous code position.Decision box 520 is tested i and whether is also equaled M, that is, whether all symbols are all decoded.If not, then flow process is back to frame 504.If on the other hand, all symbols are resumed all, then Flow ends.
Recall the explanation about above encoder, which specify arithmetic code word is that L position is long.In theory, in order to represent the MSB of M quantity, at G
i maxg in following scope
il should be met and be configured such that 2
lmore than G
i maxthe product of the sequence of value.In fact, when use finite precision algorithm (such as, using the processor register of the width of such as 32) perform arithmetic coding time, to additional code position need increase.Loose border (too high estimation) (LBAC) for the arithmetic coding of the quantity of additional code position is given by following equation.
Noting, in fact for being less than 1, in this case, an only extra bits can be required by evaluation by the quantity of the extra bits provided above.Also note, above equation can be incremented ground evaluation, that is, for being less than M G
i maxthe partial sequence of value.
Tight boundaries (more accurate) (TBAC) for arithmetic coding can by must determining the process that the minimum subrange of the code space can selected by each character position in conventional letter sequence is recursively selected.Size and the G for each i-th character position of minimum subrange

iall subrange width in minimum subrange width.For the expression of such as z in flow charts, be given as:
In fact, z and n (G can be shown
i max) be oppositely correlated with and equal:
And in frame 606, s increases log

i maxnew value.In block 608, y is set to equal z.Next, decision box 610 is tested y and whether is less than 2
w.If so, then flow cycles is by frame 612, and it makes y be multiplied by 2 (to move to left y) and make k increase by 1.When determining that y is not less than 2 in block 610
wtime, flow cycles returns decision box 604.When determining i=M in block 604, flow process proceeds to frame 614, and the quantity η of the code bit of extra demand is set to equal k+w-s-log

Fig. 7 is the flow chart of efficient audio coding device, and its combination arithmetic coding uses factorial pulse code to encode to the sequence of the frequency band of classifying according to the measurement relevant to spectrum energy.The method allows the FPC code word with non-integer length to use arithmetic coding to be efficiently encoded, and is provided for the code reassignment position saved from original allocation being reassigned to other frequency bands simultaneously.Although to the reference that the voiced band in Fig. 7 is made, it should be noted that this process can be applied to equivalently and other types information is encoded.In other application, replace spectrum energy, the signal energy of another form can be used.
Frame 702 indicates and repeats process shown below for continuous audio frame.Although do not illustrate clearly in the figure 7, process can be employed, to encode distinctively to the information extracted from continuous audio frame.
In block 704, call independent process (not shown), with the original allocation of execute bit to the sequence of frequency band.(suppose that signal is transformed to frequency domain here, and frequency coefficient is separated into multiple frequency band.) known treatment for position being distributed to frequency band can be used.At X.Wei, M.Shaw, M.Varley's, " Optimum Bit Allocation and Decomposition for High Quality Audio Coding, " icassp, vol.1, pp.315,1997IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP ' 97)-Volume 1, describes a kind of such known method in 1997.The figure place distributing to frequency band can be the function of the energy in frequency band.When information (such as, image, video, remote measurement) of other types, partly (be similar to audio frame) and subdivision (such as, the division of frequency band or other types) can be subdivided into.
In frame 706, frequency band is rearranged sequence (classification) according to the measurement relevant to spectrum energy.Measurement can be spectrum energy itself.Alternatively, be multiplied by the pre-programmed weight relevant to this frequency band by the spectrum energy being used in each frequency band, Weighted spectral energy can be drawn.In the frequency band that reorders, there are some advantages, make to have and be positioned near the beginning of sequence compared with the frequency band of low frequency spectrum energy.The result of such sequence is, position is tended to be reallocated the frequency band to having higher-energy content, thus causes the higher fidelity of the expression of such frequency band.
The top of frame 708 mark cycle, described circulation is that each jth frequency band (sequentially obtaining according to new sort) repeats.In block 710, the quantity of the unit amplitude pulse quantum of the frequency spectrum that can be represented by encoding in a jth frequency band is calculated.When this is by using the quantity of hypothesis pulse quantum to be set to integer value m, enumerate the equation of likely pulse configuration calculate.In factorial coding pulse multiple, the quantity N of possible pulse configuration equals the highest code value.Provide a kind of such equation being commonly assigned with the present invention and instructing in the equation (15) of the U.S. Patent No. 6,236,960 of factorial pulse code method.The equation (15) of its 960 patents clearly write out is:
Wherein, n is the quantity of the frequency window (bin) in a jth frequency band;
M is the quantity of pulse quantum;
I is summation index;
From the simulation equation of the factorial pulse code of the plus versions of more advanced, less amount of calculation by Udar Mittal, " the Low Complexity Factorial Pulse Coding Of MDCT Coefficients Using Approximation Of Combinatorial Functions " of James P.Ashley and Edgardo M.Cruz-Zeno, ICASSP, the equation (21) in 2007 papers provides.Use any one in these or similar equation, they do not need to be reversed to according to N obtain m, and they can use the look-up table of the value of calculating or use and such as solve the root finding method of point method on the contrary.These equatioies are discontinuous, so when solving them, in this context, find following m value, and it produces the value as the N of the maximum of the N produced by equation, and its position be less than for a jth in question frequency band is distributed.Log
2(N) value is the fair amount of the position for initial bit distribution.Thus, in the position for allocated frequency band is distributed, usually there is the position of some excessive amounts.The frame 712 of the latter aspect reference flow sheet of solution process.
If based on the measurement of the energy in frequency band, position is assigned to frequency band, then the quantity m corresponding to the pulse quantum of the figure place for bandwidth assignment is also relevant to the energy in frequency band.This be can according to the tolerance of the quantity m based on pulse quantum the frequency band that reorders, with the situation of the frequency band that replaces reordering based on frequency band energy.A kind of selection to be reordered frequency band based on m itself.Frequency band can be rearranged sequence with the incremental order of m.Do like this and mean that the frequency band with higher-energy (more information content) is tended to be re-assigned in position.Alternatively based on tolerance log
2(N (n, m+1))-log
2(N (n, m)) reorders, and wherein, N and m is defined in previous equation.When this tolerance quantizes to increase by 1 about pulse quantum m, how fractional bits (fractional bit) increases.If use this rear one tolerance, then frequency band can be rearranged sequence based on tolerance according to order of successively decreasing.The result of this rearrangement is, usually the position of large quantity (must not be whole quantity) is re-assigned to the frequency band of the large value (high-energy) with m from the frequency band of the little value (low-yield) with m, wherein, it, in the permissible value increasing m, is substantially used in the frequency band it therefrom obtained than it and has larger impact.
In frame 714, the highest significant position (MSB) of the highest code value N found in frame 712 is selected partly (to be expressed as G
j max).(note, band index changes into j from i, to avoid obscuring with the summation index in previous equation.) (length according to a particular embodiment of the invention, for the MSB part of all frequency bands is all fixed as the predetermined quantity of position).If like this, then, when complete bit length N is less than or equal to predetermined figure, integrity value N is counted as the MSB for special frequency band.)
In block 716, son process is called, to determine whether the arithmetic coding of the MSB reaching this frequency band requires to exceed the extra order of original allocation.Above-mentioned LBAC or TBAC is estimated in the sub-process spoken of at this, and in the latter cases, describes with reference to figure 6.Decision box 718 tests whether require extra order.If the quantity of the extra bits determined by arithmetic coding efficiency exceed use factorial pulse code enumerate one of formula with the quantity m setting up pulse quantum after the quantity of remaining extra bits, then require extra order.If determine requirement extra order in frame 718, then flow chart branches is to frame 720, and m is reset to smaller value by it.Such as, m can reduce fixed amount, or based on relate to m and required extra bits quantity expression formula and reduce.After m is reduced, in frame 722, the highest code value N is recalculated and MSB part G
j maxselected.After frame 722, flow cycles returns frame 716, and to recalculate arithmetic coding efficiency, and whether the sum reexamining the position needed for MSB reaching a jth frequency band for arithmetic coding falls in distribution.When the result of decision box 718 is no, means and do not require extra order, and do not require the quantity adjusting pulse quantum, flow chart branches, to frame 724, wherein, is assigned to other frequency bands from remaining too much (residue) position of allocation.The mode that mistake multidigit distributes to other frequency bands can be changed.A kind of mode divides position equably between residue frequency band.Another kind of mode makes distribution deflection, and the frequency band making to comprise the end closer to sequence of more multiple spectra energy receives more multidigit relatively.
In frame 726, calculate factorial pulse code code word to represent frequency band.This can according to aforementioned No.6,236,960 patents or aforementioned paper Udar Mittal, James P.Ashley, andEdgardo M.Cruz-Zeno's, " Low Complexity Factorial Pulse Coding Of MDCT Coefficients Using Approximation Of Combinatorial Functions ", ICASSP, the instruction of 2007 is made.In frame 728, select the MSB of code word, and in frame 730, call the process of arithmetic encoder, to start (or continuing when performing frame 730 after first performs) generation arithmetic coding for representing MSB.The arithmetic encoder described with reference to figure 4 can be used.Thus, as each new MSB (G
i) value by shown in Fig. 7 process generate time, the process shown in Fig. 4 performs with being incremented.In frame 732, the least significant bit of FPC code word is output to connector.
Whether decision box 734 is tested more multiband and still will be processed.If so, then in frame 736, process the sequential frequency band be incremented in sequence, and flow cycles returns frame 710, to start to process next frequency band.When determining that in frame 734 all frequency bands are all processed, flow chart branches is to frame 738, and wherein, the spectrum energy of frequency band and/or other information are output to packet assembler.
Following example to illustrate that when carrying out and do not carry out the reordering of frequency band position is among frequency bands redistributed.First suppose that frequency band is not rearranged sequence, and jth is assigned with 24.0 and 20.5 positions respectively with jth+1 frequency band.And we suppose and jth+1 frequency band individual for jth, and frequency bandwidth (positional number) is fixed as n=20.For a jth frequency band, can determine that resting on the maximum quantity m of operable pulse quantum while initial bit is distributed under 24.0 be 6, and be log for the figure place needed for encoding to 6 pulse quantum in a jth frequency band
2(N (20,6))=22.48.In this example, m=6 is budget in place is keep log under 24.0
2the maximum integer of (N (n, m)); The pulse quantum m=7 adding 1 will require log
2(N (20,7))=25.02.Now, by the position of 24.0-22.48=1.52 position residue is moved to jth+1 frequency band, we are used in the position increase of budget of jth+1 frequency band to 20.5+1.52=22.02 position.When calculating the quantity m of the pulse quantum being used for jth+1 frequency band, we find, we can use log
2(N (20,5))=19.72, come m=5 pulse code.
Here, we easily can carry out two kinds of observations.First, be re-assigned to jth+1 frequency band by 1.52 from a jth frequency band and do not there is good effect.That is, the position of increase does not allow the quantity of the pulse quantum in jth+1 frequency band to increase.The second, suppose that jth+1 frequency band is last frequency band in the sequence of frequency band, then position residue (22.02-19.72=2.30 position) may be wasted.
According to embodiments of the invention, consider now to there is the example that some functions based on frequency band energy reorder to frequency band.If we suppose that jth and jth+1 frequency band are the last frequency bands in the sequence of frequency band, and based on the monotone increasing function of frequency band energy, classify, and we suppose that more multiband is assigned to the frequency band with more macro-energy, then we can suppose that these frequency bands will comprise the position of maximum quantity.Such as, the position supposing to be assigned to these frequency bands is 60.5 and 64.0 positions respectively.As in exemplified earlier, we suppose that frequency bandwidth is fixed as n=20.For a jth frequency band, can determine that the maximum quantity m of pulse quantum can be confirmed as m=33, and be log for figure place needed for encoding to 33 pulse quantum
2(N (20,33))=59.80.By the position residual gravity of 60.5-59.80=0.70 position is newly assigned to jth+1 frequency band, we are used in the position increase of budget of frequency band to 64.0+0.70=64.70 position.When calculating the quantity m of the pulse quantum being used for jth+1 frequency band, we find that we can use log
2(N (20,39))=64.18 encode to m=39 pulse.In this case, contrary with previous occasion, the position of adding the second frequency band to allows m to increase, thus contributes to the increase of signal quality.
In general situation is, when increasing when figure place, reduces for the figure place needed for encoding to extra-pulse quantum.Thus, when merging the redistributing of some functions based on energy, redistributing of remaining bit becomes less problem, and because the lower cost of the every pulse quantum in higher-energy frequency band, for the possibility step-down to the position that is wasted after all frequencyband codings.
In the above-described embodiments, the actual allocated for the frequency band first processed in the sequence reordered is tended to be less than the original allocation performed in block 704, and position is reallocated to the meta frequency band later that reorders.And according to above-mentioned frame 710-712, the quantity m of pulse quantum is set to maximum, makes for the figure place log to m pulse quantum coding
2(N) original allocation is less than.According to embodiment, the order that reorders of frequency band can be reversed, and makes to have higher-energy or have comparatively high impulse quantum number, or has tolerance log
2(N (m+1))-log
2the frequency band of the smaller value of (N (m)) ranked first.In such embodiments, not find the value of m to make corresponding N be maximum reasonable quantity under initial bit is distributed, but the value of m can be found, make log
2(N) analog value is greater than initial bit distribution and (such as, is greater than the minimum value log that initial bit is distributed
2(N (m))).For such embodiment, log
2(N) this value can be the fair amount of position.In such embodiments, be not according to sequence, excess bits is distributed to frequency band further, but can from according to sequence further frequency band down obtain position, to form log
2difference (residue) between the value of (N (m)) and initial bit distribution.What perform in a particular embodiment reorders based on priority, but can according to the order of priority of the priority increased or reduction.
The spectrum energy of frequency band and/or other information are (such as, frequency band weight) be sent to receiver, make the decoder of receiver can rebuild sequence and the position that performed by encoder is distributed, make decoder can suitably its coded message received of decipher.Receiver also performs frame 702-704 in order, to obtain G
j maxvalue.By the G that channel receives
j maxvalue and G
jvalue then used by receiver, to perform the arithmetic decoding that above reference diagram 5 describes in order, thus regain the MSB of FPC code word, it is then again complete with the LSB received from transmitter is a catenation sequence.Then, FPC code word is decoded, to rebuild band spectrum energy distribution.
In the above description, specific embodiment of the present invention has been described.But those skilled in the art will expect, when not departing from the scope of the present invention set forth in claims, multiple amendment and change can be made.Such as, factorial pulse code is cited as the example of the coding method that can be benefited from the present invention, but other assembly coding schemes multiple also can be benefited.
