- a user may manually enter an association between a manipulation of a particular object and a command, such as opening the e-mail application when the user clicks a pen twice.
- the device's camera and microphone may observe the manipulation, use object recognition to recognize the type of object and type of manipulation, and associate the type of object and type of manipulation with the command.
- the device may interpret the user touching the outer circumference of a watch as a command to open up the alarm application.
- Particular manipulations and executable commands may also be received from other sources (e.g., downloaded from a third-party server) or learned by observation over time.
- the object may be a common object that is incapable of transmitting information to the device, the manipulation may be a common use of the object, and the command may be related to the type of the object. For instance, the device may dial the user's spouse's cell phone number every time he or she rotates his or her wedding ring.

- the client computing device may observe how the user manipulates various objects and determine whether there is a correlation with subsequent commands. For instance, after opening up the e-mail application upon two clicks of a pen, the device may observe that the user consistently clicks the pen again before creating a new e-mail. The device may store this observation in its memory and automatically create a new e-mail for the user the next time she clicks her pen after opening up the e-mail application.
- An external display device may be coupled to the device and project a display of related to the object and manipulation.
- the display may project a drawing surface when the user picks up a pen.

Abstract
A system and method is provided of detecting user manipulation of an inanimate object and interpreting that manipulation as input. In one aspect, the manipulation may be detected by an image capturing component of a computing device, and the manipulation is interpreted as an instruction to execute a command, such as opening up a drawing application in response to a user picking up a pen. The manipulation may also be detected with the aid of an audio capturing device, e.g., a microphone on the computing device.
Description
- Gesture recognition technology relates to the understanding of human gestures using computers and mathematical algorithms. Gestures may include any motion of the human body, particularly of the hand and face and may be used to communicate with machines. For example, a user may be able to move a computer cursor by pointing and moving the user's finger. The user's physical movement can be captured by various devices, such as wired gloves, depth-aware cameras, remote controllers, and standard 2-D cameras.
- In one aspect, a method for detecting as input physical manipulations of objects comprises receiving, using one or more computing devices, a first image and detecting, using the one or more computing devices, an object type in the first image. Similarly, the method also comprises receiving, using the one or more computing devices, a second image and detecting the object type in the second image. Moreover, the method comprises determining using the one or more computing devices a manipulation of the object type based at least in part on the analysis of the object type in the first image and the second image, determining using the one or more computing devices an input to associate with the determined manipulation of the object type, determining using the one or more computing devices one or more executable commands associated with the determined input, and executing using the one or more computing devices the one or more executable commands.
- In another aspect, a system comprises a camera, one or more processors, and a memory. The memory stores a plurality of object types, an object-manipulation pair for each object type where each object-manipulation pair associates the object type with a manipulation of the object type, and at least one command associated with each object-manipulation pair. The memory may also store instructions, executable by the processor. The instructions comprise determining an object type based on information received from the camera, determining a manipulation by a user of the determined object type based on information received form the camera, and when the determined object type and manipulation correspond with an object-manipulation pair of the determined object type, executing the command associated with the object-manipulation pair.

FIG. 7 is a flow diagram depicting an execution of an instruction set stored in memory of a system for detecting as input physical manipulations of objects in accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure. -
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram depicting a method for detecting as input physical manipulations of objects in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure. - The technology generally pertains to detecting user manipulation of an inanimate object and interpreting that manipulation as input. For example, the manipulation may be detected by an image capturing component of a computing device that is on or near a user, such as a camera on a wearable device or mobile phone. The computing device coupled to the camera may interpret the manipulation as an instruction to execute a command, such as opening up a drawing application in response to a user picking up a pen. The manipulation may also be detected with the aid of an audio capturing device, e.g., a microphone on a wearable device.
- The computing device may be configured to constantly observe, detect, and subsequently interpret a manipulation of an inanimate object as an instruction to execute a particular command, which can be as simple as starting a process. The association among the type of an object, a particular manipulation of that type of object, and the command may be stored in memory. For example, a user may manually enter an association between a manipulation of a particular object and a command, such as opening the e-mail application when the user clicks a pen twice. The device's camera and microphone may observe the manipulation, use object recognition to recognize the type of object and type of manipulation, and associate the type of object and type of manipulation with the command. By way of further example, the device may interpret the user touching the outer circumference of a watch as a command to open up the alarm application. Particular manipulations and executable commands may also be received from other sources (e.g., downloaded from a third-party server) or learned by observation over time.
- The object may be a common object that is incapable of transmitting information to the device, the manipulation may be a common use of the object, and the command may be related to the type of the object. For instance, the device may dial the user's spouse's cell phone number every time he or she rotates his or her wedding ring. In another instance, the client device may open up a wallet application when the user physically pulls out a wallet.
- Different manipulations of the same object may result in different commands. Referring back to the watch example above, the device may interpret two taps on the glass of the watch as a command to open up the calendar application. The user may then rotate their thumb and index fingers clockwise, or counter-clockwise, to toggle the calendar cursor forward or backward, respectively.
- Over a certain period of time, the client computing device may observe how the user manipulates various objects and determine whether there is a correlation with subsequent commands. For instance, after opening up the e-mail application upon two clicks of a pen, the device may observe that the user consistently clicks the pen again before creating a new e-mail. The device may store this observation in its memory and automatically create a new e-mail for the user the next time she clicks her pen after opening up the e-mail application.
- An external display device may be coupled to the device and project a display of related to the object and manipulation. For example, the display may project a drawing surface when the user picks up a pen.

FIG. 2 is a diagram depicting a variety of computing devices of onepossible system 200. For example, computing device(s) 110 inFIG. 1 may be apersonal computing device 220, such as a laptop, intended for use by a user. Thepersonal computing device 220 may have all of the components normally used in connection with a personal computing device such as a CPU or GPU, memory storing data and instructions, a display such as display 222 (e.g., a monitor having a screen, a touch-screen, a projector, a television, or other device that is operable to display information), and user input device 224 (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, touch-screen, microphone, etc.). Computing device(s) 110 may also comprise amobile computing device 230 capable of wirelessly exchanging data with a server over a network such as the Internet. By way of example only,mobile computing device 220 may be a mobile phone or a device such as a wireless-enabled PDA, a tablet PC, or a netbook that is capable of obtaining information via the internet. Computing device(s) 110 may also comprise awearable computing device 240 having a CPU or GPU, memory, adisplay 242, a camera, and a microphone. - The device may be configured to operate with an operating system such as Google's Android operating system, Microsoft Windows or Apple iOS. In that regard, some of the instructions executed during the operations described herein may be provided by the operating system whereas other instructions may be provided by an application installed on the device.
Computing devices FIG. 1 , and other computing devices in accordance with the systems and methods described herein may include other devices capable of processing instructions and transmitting data to and from humans and/or other computers including network computers lacking local storage capability and set top boxes for televisions. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram 300 illustrating different object types, object-manipulation pairs for each object type, and executable commands associated with the object-manipulation pairs stored inmemory 114 in accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure. The object types may comprise anything that can be seen or physically touched, including common or inanimate objects (e.g., pens, watches, coins, rings). The objects themselves may also be incapable of transmitting information to the computing device. As shown inFIG. 3 ,object type 320 may relate to a clickable writing utensil such as a clickable pen or pencil,object type 340 may relate to a watch, and objecttype 360 may relate to a ring that one can wear on their finger. - An object type may be associated with visual and/or audio characteristics. By way of example only, visual characteristics 322 may identify particular shapes (e.g., cylindrical), sizes (e.g., height and width), colors and distinguishing features (e.g., numbers printed on the object), and
audio characteristics 324 may identify particular audio signal characteristics such as the sound of a pen click. Visual characteristics 322 andaudio characteristics 324 may identify the breadth and scope of the various objects that match the object type. For example,pen object type 320 may be considered to encompass any object that is similar in shape and size to a pen, or only objects that are identical in appearance to a specific pen. - A manipulation may be any form of moving, arranging, controlling, or handling of an object type. The manipulation may be associated with a common, socially acceptable use of the object type, e.g., a manipulation that many people commonly perform with the object and, as such, would not be overly distracting to others that view or hear the manipulation. Further, an object-manipulation pair may associate an object type with a manipulation of that object type. The object type and the manipulation corresponding with the object-manipulation pair may not be mutually exclusive.
- For instance, object-
manipulation pair 326 may associateobject type 320, e.g., a push-button pen, with the manipulation of clicking the pen's button. Object-manipulation pair 326 may be further associated with a command from executable commands 380. For example and as discussed in more detail below with regard toFIG. 4 , when computing device(s) 110 determines that an object and a manipulation correspond with object-manipulation pair 326, for example, it may open up the e-mail application. Similarly, object-manipulation pairs 328 and 330 may associatepen object type 320 with the manipulation of clicking the pen's button twice and physically picking up the pen, respectively. Object-manipulation pairs 328 and 330 may also be associated with one or more corresponding commands fromexecutable commands 380. - As further illustrated in
FIG. 3 ,object type 340 may relate to a wearable timepiece, such as an analog or digital watch, and defined byvisual characteristics 342.Visual characteristics 342 may include an hour hand, a minute hand, a second hand, a dial, or digital numbers. Object-manipulation pairs 344, 346, and 348 may associateobject type 340 with manipulations of pinching the object type, tapping the glass of the object type twice, and rotating a finger along the outer surface of the object type, respectively. Similar to object-manipulation pairs 326, 328, and 330, object-manipulation pairs 344, 346, and 348 may be associated with corresponding commands fromexecutable commands 380. In this regard and as discussed in more detail with regard toFIG. 5 , when computing device(s) 110 determines that an object type and a manipulation correspond with object-manipulation pair 344, for instance, it may open up the calendar application. -
Object type 360 may relate to jewelry that can be worn on a user's finger, such as a ring, and defined byvisual characteristics 362. Visual characteristics may include the object's location on a finger, metal, an ornament, and colors such as gold, silver, or platinum. Object-manipulations pairs object type 360 with manipulations of rotating the object type, holding up user's fingers as the object type is worn, and tapping the object type three times, respectively. Like the aforementioned object-manipulation pairs above, object-manipulation pairs 364, 366, and 368 may also be associated with corresponding commands fromexecutable commands 380. In this regard and as discussed in more detail with regard toFIG. 6 , when computing device(s) 110 determines that an object type and a manipulation corresponds with object-manipulation pair 364, for example, it may dial the user's spouse's cellular phone number. - Executable commands may relate to and range from simple device-specific tasks (e.g., dial number) to complex combinations of application-specific tasks (e.g., search for nearby restaurants and sort the results by user rating). For example,
executable commands 380 may comprise: open e-mail application, open new e-mail, open drawing application, open calendar application, create new calendar entry, toggle calendar cursor, dial spouse's cellular phone number, display anniversary date, and open movie ticket application. Executable commands may be associated with a particular input, and the input may be associated with a particular manipulation of an object type. An input may be any type of information put in, taken in, or operated on by a CPU or GPU. Although common examples of executable commands pertain to controlling/displaying applications installed on a computing device, other aspects of the subject matter described above are not limited to any particular type of command. For instance, an executable command may be as simple as a signal to start a process and executing the command starts the relevant process. - While
FIG. 3 depictsdata 118 of computing device(s) 110 inFIG. 1 , the various object types, visual characteristics, audio characteristics, object-manipulation pairs, and/or executable commands may reside inmemory 144 of server computer(s) 140,storage system 150, or other memory components communicating withnetwork 160. Accordingly, a user may be able to download the object types, visual characteristics, audio characteristics, object-manipulation pairs, and/or executable commands to a computing device. The user may also be able to manually add the data to a computing device. Moreover, a computing device may receive instructions from the user to store a particular object-manipulation pair and associate the object-manipulation pair with a particular input or command. In that regard, the user may have the option of customizing the user's own object-manipulation pairs and their associated executable commands. - Example Methods
- Operations in accordance with a variety of aspects of embodiments will now be described. It should be understood that the following operations do not have to be performed in the precise order described below. Rather, various steps can be handled in reverse order or simultaneously.
-
FIGS. 4-6 are illustrative examples of a computing device capturing a user manipulating different inanimate objects based onobject types FIG. 3 . In one aspect, a pen may be manipulated by a user's hand.FIG. 4 provides an illustration of such a manipulation, namely a user'sthumb 430 clicking apen 432. The manipulation of thepen 432 is captured bycamera 412 enclosed inhousing 414 ofwearable computing device 410, which may also enclose a CPU or GPU, one or more processors, memory storing instructions and data, as well as a microphone (not shown). The dashed lines extending out horizontally fromcamera 412 represents the camera's field ofview 420, and is not limited horizontally. - In one example, as shown in
FIG. 4 , a user may grasp and holdpen 432 within the field ofview 420 ofcamera 412. Subsequently, the user may single-click the top ofpen 432 with his or herthumb 430.Wearable computing device 410, via itscamera 412 and CPU or GPU, may observe, detect, and/or interpret thatpen 432 is associated with certain visual and/or audio characteristics of an object type. For instance,computing device 410 may receive a first image and a second image ofobject 432 and use object recognition techniques to determine whether the object matches the visual characteristics of one of the object types, e.g., whether the object has an elongated cylindrical shape. Moreover,computing device 410, using its microphone, may determine thatpen 432 makes a clicking noise. Based on these characteristics,wearable computing device 410 may determine thatpen 432 corresponds with visual characteristics 322 andaudio characteristics 324 as shown inFIG. 3 and further determine thatpen 432 is associated withpen object type 320. -
Wearable computing device 410, via itscamera 412 and CPU or GPU, may additionally observe, detect, and/or interpret that a manipulation of the determined object type has occurred. For example,computing device 410 may determine that user'sthumb 430 single-clicked the top ofpen 432 based on the microphone's detection and reception of a clicking noise, and based on the images captured by the camera, e.g., by using object recognition to identify the user's thumb relative to thepen 432, and further determining that the thumb moved towards the pen at relatively the same time as the clicking noise was received. Upon determining the object type and manipulation of that object type,wearable computing device 410 may subsequently determine whether there is an association between the determined object type and manipulation thereof, e.g., an object-manipulation pair. In this example, a user'sthumb 430 single-clicking the top ofpen 432 may be associated with object-manipulation pair 326 as described above with regard toFIG. 3 .Computing device 410 may execute a command associated with object-manipulation pair 326. The command may be based on either the object type or the manipulation of that object type, or both. For instance, object-manipulation pair 326 may be associated with opening an e-mail application. - In another example,
wearable computing device 410 may determine that user'sthumb 430 double-clicked the top ofpen 432. Similar to the example above,computing device 410 may subsequently determine that double-clickingpen 432 corresponds with object-manipulation pair 328. Based on this determination,computing device 410 may execute the command associated with object-manipulation pair 328, e.g., open a new e-mail. In another instance,wearable computing device 410 may determine that user's hand is physically picking uppen 432 and holding it within the field ofview 420 ofcamera 412.Computing device 410 may determine that physically picking uppen 432 corresponds with object-manipulation pair 330. Based on this determination,computing device 410 may execute the command associated with object-manipulation pair 330, e.g., open a drawing application. - While
FIG. 4 illustrates one example of an object-manipulation pair, the object may not be limited to a pen and the manipulation may not be limited to click(s) of the pen. In another object-manipulation pair example, a user may twirl a pencil between the user's index and middle fingers. This particular object-manipulation pair may be associated with opening up a notepad application. - In another aspect, a wearable timepiece may be manipulated by a user's hand.
FIG. 5 provides an illustration of such a manipulation, namely a user'shand 532 touching the outer circumference ofwatch 530 is captured and processed bywearable computing device 410. - As shown in
FIG. 5 , a user may touch and pinch the outer circumference ofwatch 530 using his or her thumb and index fingers. Similar to the example depicted inFIG. 4 ,camera 412 ofwearable computing device 410 may observe, detect, and/or interpret within its field ofview 420 that watch 530 corresponds to certain visual characteristics of an object type.Computing device 410 may receive one or more images of the object type and employ object recognition techniques to determine whether the object matches the visual characteristics of one of the object types. Depending on the visual characteristics and the analysis,computing device 410 may determine that watch 530 corresponds withvisual characteristics 342 as depicted inFIG. 3 and further determine that watch 530 is associated withwatch object type 340. -
Camera 412 ofwearable computing device 410 may also observe and detect within its field ofview 420 that a manipulation of the determined object type has occurred. In one instance, it may determine that a user's thumb and index fingers pinched the outer circumference ofwatch 530. This determination may be based on object recognition of the thumb and index fingers' proximity to the outer circumference of the watch. Once the object type and manipulation of that object type have been determined by computingdevice 410, it may subsequently determine that the user's thumb and index fingers pinching the outer circumference ofwatch 530 is associated with object-manipulation pair 344 as described above with regard toFIG. 3 . And computingdevice 410 may then execute a command associated with object-manipulation pair 344, such as opening up a calendar application. - In another instance, wearable computing device 510 may determine that user's index finger successively tapped twice the glass of
watch 530. Similar to the example above, computing device 510 may subsequently determine that the double-tap of the glass ofwatch 530 corresponds with object-manipulation pair 346. Based on this determination, computing device 510 may execute the command associated with object-manipulation pair 346, e.g., open new calendar entry. In a further instance, computing device 510 may determine that user's thumb and index fingers are not only pinching the outer circumference ofwatch 530, but simultaneously rotating user's fingers clockwise. Computing device 510 may determine thatwatch 530 and the act of rotating its outer circumference corresponds with object-manipulation pair 348. Based on this determination, computing device 510 may execute the command associated with object-manipulation pair 348, e.g., toggling the calendar cursor. A clockwise rotation of the outer circumference may toggle the calendar cursor forward. Similarly, a counter-clockwise rotation of the outer circumference may toggle the calendar cursor backward. - In a further aspect, piece(s) of jewelry worn on a user's hand may be manipulated by the user. Jewelry is not limited to just rings or the type material they are made of, but may broadly comprise any type of ornament or piece of fashion that can be worn on or near the user's fingers or hands.
FIG. 6 provides an illustration of a user's thumb and index fingers rotating aring 630 captured and processed bywearable computing device 410. Like the examples depicted inFIGS. 4 and 5 , the manipulation of thering 630 is captured bycamera 412 ofcomputing device 410 within its field ofview 420. - Like the manipulation example described above with regard to
FIG. 5 , a user may touch and pinch the outer circumference ofring 630 with the user's thumb and index fingers. While worn, the user may then physically rotatering 630 in either direction. Based on one or more images captured bycamera 412 ofwearable computing device 410, it may observe and detect thatring 630 is connected to certain visual characteristics ofobject type 360, as seen inFIG. 3 , based on the location ofring 630 and type and color of the ring's metal. - Upon the detection and determination of
object type 630,camera 412 ofcomputing device 410 may detect the occurrence of a manipulation of that object type. By way of example only, a user's thumb and index fingers may pinch and rotatering 630 while it is still worn on the user's finger.Computing device 410 may subsequently determine that this manipulation ofobject type 360 is associated with object-manipulation pair 364 as described above with regard toFIG. 3 . Based on this association, a command associated with object-manipulation pair 364 may be executed, such as dialing user's spouse's cellular telephone number. - Another example of manipulating
object type 360 may involve a user holding up and fully extending his or her ring hand within the camera's field ofview 420 while simultaneously pointing to ring 630 with the user's other hand.Wearable computing device 410 may subsequently determine that this manipulation corresponds with object-manipulation pair 366 and execute the command associated withpair 366, such as displaying ondisplay 416 the user's anniversary date. In a further example,wearable computing device 410 may detect that the user tapped the surface ofring 630 three consecutive times. By using object recognition to identify the user's finger movement relative to the ring and the number of times it was tapped,computing device 410 may determine that this manipulation corresponds with object-manipulation pair 368 and execute the command associated withpair 368, for instance, opening the movie ticket application. - As already alluded to above with regard to
FIGS. 1 and 2 ,wearable computing device 410 may have access to more than just the object types, object-manipulation pairs, and executable commands depicted inFIGS. 3-6 . By way of another example only, the wearablecomputable device 410 may detect a user opening up his or her wallet. The association between the wallet and the act of opening it may correspond with an object-manipulation pair associated with a command to open a virtual wallet application. -
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram 700 depicting an example instruction set stored in memory of a system for detecting as input physical manipulations of objects in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure. Atblock 710, at least one computing device determines an object type based on information received from one or more cameras that may be coupled to the computing device. As alluded to above and by way of example only, the received information may be a series of images. Similarly, atblock 720, the computing device determines a manipulation of the determined object type by a user of the determined object type based on the information received by the one or more cameras. The computing device analyzes the visual and/or audio features of the object type and determines whether the detected object type and the determined manipulation correspond with an object-manipulation pair stored in memory atblock 730. Examples of these determinations were described above with regard toFIGS. 3-6 . When the determination is made atblock 730, the computing device executes a command associated with the object-manipulation pair atblock 740. When the determination cannot be made, the computing device reverts back to block 710. -
FIG. 8 is a flow diagram 800 depicting a method for detecting as input physical manipulations of objects in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure. Using one or more computing devices, the method comprises receiving a first image atblock 810. As described above with regard toFIG. 7 , the first image may be received from one or more cameras that may be coupled to the one or more computing devices. Atblock 820, the method further comprises detecting an object type in the first image. Similarly, atblock 830 the method comprises receiving a second image from the one or more cameras, and detecting the object type in the second image. Once the object type is detected in the first image and the second image, block 850 involves performing analysis on the object type in the first and second images. As described above with regard toFIGS. 4-6 , the analysis may be based on visual, audio, or other types of information from the images. - At
block 860, the method further comprises determining a manipulation of the object type based at least in part on the analysis of the object type atblock 850.Block 870 involves determining an input to associate with the determined manipulation of the object type. Atblock 880, the method further comprises determining one or more executable commands associated with the determined input, and executing the one or more executable commands atblock 890. - As these and other variations and combinations of the features discussed above can be utilized without departing from the invention as defined by the claims, the foregoing description of the embodiments should be taken by way of illustration rather than by way of limitation of the invention as defined by the claims. It will also be understood that the provision of examples of the invention (as well as clauses phrased as “such as,” “e.g.”, “including” and the like) should not be interpreted as limiting the invention to the specific examples; rather, the examples are intended to illustrate only some of many possible aspects.
