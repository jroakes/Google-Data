- Touchscreens are graphical display devices that act as both inputs and outputs.
- touchscreens include a graphical display and detect the presence and location of manual interaction with that graphical display.
- Text such as the text of this specification, is a collection of alphanumeric and other characters. People can interact with a touchscreen to form such characters and generate text by writing the characters on the touchscreen. However, human handwriting can be ambiguous, especially when characters are formed on a relatively small touchscreen of a mobile device.

Input elements 115 can include one or more key, pad, trackball, or other component that receives mechanical, audio, or other input from a user.
- Electronic component collection 120 includes a digital data processor 125 , a store for local data 130 , a store for application instructions 135 , and a clock 140 .
- Digital data processor 125 is a system of one or more data processing devices that perform operations in accordance with one or more sets of machine-readable instructions. For example, digital data processor 125 performs operations in accordance with the instructions for implementing various applications stored in application instruction store 135 .

- Clock 140 can be an integral part of process 125 or clock 155 can be a separate component, as shown.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of character interaction 205 with touchscreen 110 of device 100 ( FIG. 1 ).
- Character interaction 205 is represented as a collection of lines 210 , 215 , 220 that follow the path of strokes across touchscreen 110 . The strokes can be made using the tip of a fingertip or other element.
- lines 210 , 215 , 220 are displayed on touchscreen 110 . In other implementations, lines 210 , 215 , 220 are not displayed on touchscreen 110 . In either case, information characterizing the path of lines 210 , 215 , 220 is collected and translated by device 100 .
- touchscreen 110 For the sake of convenience, other user interaction with touchscreen 110 is represented herein using comparable lines which may or may not actually be displayed on touchscreen 110 .
- the character interaction 205 represented by lines 210 , 215 , 220 is ambiguous.
- the paths of lines 210 , 215 , 220 are not precise.
- the starting and end points of lines 210 , 215 , 220 are also not exact.
- lines 210 , 220 appear to lean toward one another but they do not meet at their tops.
- Character interaction 205 could thus reasonably be interpreted as a more than one character.
- character interaction 205 could reasonably be interpreted as either an “H” or an “A.”
- Such ambiguity is not only inherent to human handwriting, but it is also worsened by the operational context of device 100 .
- touchscreen 110 may be relatively small, e.g., as part of a mobile device. Further, a user may not be properly positioned to interact with touchscreen 110 . Indeed, the user may even be walking while forming lines 210 , 215 , 220 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of a process 300 for translating user interaction with a touchscreen into text.
- process 300 is performed by a device that includes a touchscreen, such as device 100 ( FIG. 1 ).
- process 300 is performed by a digital data processing system that receives information characterizing user interaction with a device that includes a touchscreen.
- process 300 can be performed by a server system that hosts a search engine or other service provider.
- Process 300 can be performed in isolation or in conjunction with other digital data processing operations.
- process 300 can be performed in conjunction with process 1500 ( FIG. 15 ).
- the device performing process 300 receives information characterizing a first character interaction at block 305 .
- a character interaction is user interaction with a touchscreen that represents a character. Often, a character interaction is ambiguous and reasonably can be interpreted as a more than one character. The character interaction can be received directly from a user who is interacting with a touchscreen of the device that is performing process 300 or indirectly from a device that includes such a touchscreen.
- User interaction that represents a character can be distinguished from user interaction that does not represent a character in a number of ways. For example, a user can interact with a touchscreen or other input device to specify that subsequent user interaction represents a character. As another example, a device can constrain user interaction to being interpreted as characters, e.g., by default or at certain stages in a sequence of data processing activities. In some implementations, the constraint can be identified by text of other indicium that indicates, to a user, that user interaction at this stage is to be interpreted as characters.
- User interaction representing separate characters can also be distinguished in a number of ways.
- a period of time without user interaction i.e., a “timeout”
- the duration of such a timeout can be between 250 and 450 ms, or about 300 ms.
- the device performing process 300 can distinguish between successive characters based on affirmative input received from a user. For example, input identifying the end of user interaction representing a character can be received using an “end-of-character” widget on the touchscreen itself or using another input device.
- the device performing process 300 assigns probabilities to different interpretations of the first character interaction at block 305 .
- Interpreting a character interaction construes the character interaction as a particular character.
- Each of the interpretations is assigned a probability that embodies how likely it is that the character interaction does indeed represent a particular character.
- the probabilities can be expressed, e.g., as percent likelihoods.
- the device performing process 300 searches one or more collections of data with multiple interpretations of the first character interaction at block 315 .
- the device can search one or more indices of local data using the multiple interpretations, as described further below.
- the device performing process 300 can determine whether the object of the search has been found at block 320 .
- the object of the search can be, e.g., a contact in a contact list, an application, a media or other electronic file, a bookmark, an electronic document, or the like.
- the device can determine whether the object of the search is found in a number of different ways. For example, as described further below, in some implementation the device can present a collection of identifiers of candidate objects that are yielded by the search at block 315 to the user. The device can also receive user interaction with an identifier within the collection of candidate object identifiers that identifies the object of the search. As another example, in some instances, the search at block 315 with the different interpretations may be reasonably conclusive.
- the device performing process 300 may compare the probability that a first object is identified by the different interpretations with a probability threshold. If the probability exceeds the threshold, then the device can reasonably determine that the object of the search has been found. Since multiple interpretations of the first character interaction are used in the search at block 315 , a result generally will be reasonably conclusive only when the searched collection of data is relatively small.
- the device performing process 300 can use the object to perform other activities as needed at block 325 .
- object data can be displayed to a user on a display screen
- object instructions can be executed
- an object resource can be accessed on the Internet
- object media can be played or otherwise presented to a user, or combinations of these and other activities can be performed.
- the device performing process 300 receives information characterizing a second character interaction at block 330 .
- the second character interaction can also be ambiguous and received directly from a user who is interacting with a touchscreen of the device that is performing process 300 or indirectly from a device that includes such a touchscreen.
- the device performing process 300 assigns probabilities to different interpretations of a combination of the first and the second character interactions at block 335 .
- Interpreting a combination of character interactions construes the character interactions as a particular combination of characters.
- Each of the interpretations is assigned a probability that embodies how likely it is that the first and the second character interactions do indeed represent a particular combination of characters.
- the probabilities can be expressed, e.g., as percent likelihoods.
- probabilities can be assigned to different interpretations of the combination of the first and the second character interactions by:
- the probabilities which are assigned to different interpretations of the second character interaction are not independent of the probabilities assigned to different interpretations of the first character interaction. For example, if the first character interaction is likely to be a particular letter (e.g., an “N”), the probabilities of interpretations of the second character that yield character combinations which are uncommon (e.g., “NN” and “NH”) can be reduced but the probabilities of interpretations of the second character that yield character combinations which are common (e.g., “NA”) can be increased. As a result of such an approach, the probabilities which are assigned to different interpretations of the combination of the first and the second character interactions also change.
- the device performing process 300 uses machine learning or other techniques to assign probabilities to interpretations of characters that are based on interpretations of previous characters which have been confirmed. For example, if previous character interactions that resemble a new character interactions have been confirmed to represent a particular character, then the device performing process 300 can increase the probability assigned to the interpretation of the new character as that particular character. In effect, the device performing process 300 can “learn to read a user's handwriting” and store user-specific rules for character interpretation.
- the device performing process 300 searches one or more databases with multiple interpretations of the combination of the first and the second character interactions at block 340 .
- the device can search one or more indices of local data using the multiple interpretations, as described further below.
- the device performing process 300 can determine whether the object of the search has found at block 345 , e.g., by receiving user interaction identifying the object of the search within a collection of candidate objects identified at block 340 or by determining that a first object is reasonably conclusively identified by the different interpretations of the first and the second character interactions.
- the device performing process 300 can use the object to perform other activities as needed at block 325 .
- the device performing process 300 can continue to receive information characterizing one or more additional character interactions, assign probabilities to different interpretations of a combination of the first, the second, and the additional character interactions, and search one or more databases with multiple interpretations of the combination of the character interactions until determining that the object of the search has been found.
- process 300 is implemented in a recursive algorithm rather than the sequential series illustratively presented here.
- FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of an illustrative performance 400 of activities that include activities in process 300 ( FIG. 3 ).
- Performance 400 corresponds with the user interaction with a device that includes a touchscreen that is schematically represented in FIGS. 2 and 5 - 7 .
- character interaction 205 ( FIG. 2 ) is the first character interaction 405 that is received by a device that is performing the activities.
- the device assigns probabilities 410 to different interpretations 415 of user interaction 205 .
- the different interpretations 415 of character interaction 205 include the character “A,” the character “H,” the character “N,” and possibly other interpretations.
- the probabilities 410 assigned to interpretations 415 are expressed as percents.
- the device searches one or more collections of data using the interpretations 415 to yield a collection 417 of candidate objects.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of a presentation 500 of identifiers of at least a portion of the candidate objects in collection 415 on touchscreen 110 of device 100 .
- the candidate object identifiers presented in presentation 500 includes a pair of phone contact object identifiers 505 , 510 , a pair of electronic mail contact object identifiers 515 , 520 , and an application object identifier 525 .
- Phone contact object identifiers 505 , 510 are identifiers of objects drawn, e.g., from a phone or other contact list.
- Phone contact object identifiers 505 , 510 each include a name or other identifier of the contact, the phone number of the contact, and an indicium that indicates that phone contact object identifiers 505 , 510 identify phone contacts.
- the indicium in phone contact object identifiers 505 , 510 is a stylistic representation of a phone handset.

- Electronic mail contact object identifiers 515 , 520 are marked to indicate why they are identifiable by first character interaction 405 .
- the first characters of the contact identifiers in electronic mail contact object identifiers 515 , 520 are displayed in boldface type to indicate that they are matched by one of the interpretations of first character interaction 405 .

- more objects will be candidates for satisfying a search with multiple interpretations of one or more character interactions then can reasonably be presented in a single presentation, such as presentation 500 .
- presentation 500 there may be more than five objects that are identifiable by first character interaction 405 . However, only five object identifiers are presented in presentation 500 and these five object identifiers occupy the majority of touchscreen 110 .
- Device 100 may select to identify certain objects in a presentation based on the probabilities assigned to different interpretations of the one or more character interactions. For example, in response to a first interpretation of the one or more character interactions being noticeably more likely than all other interpretations, only objects that are identifiable by the first interpretation are identified in a presentation. As another example, in response to two different interpretations of the one or more character interactions being comparably probable, objects that are identifiable by both interpretations can be identified in a presentation. For example, in the illustrated instance, the probabilities of interpreting character interaction 205 as either an “A” or an “H” may be sufficiently close and objects that are identifiable by both “A” and “H” are identified in presentation 500 . This is true even though there may be more than three objects which are identifiable by the most probable interpretation “A.”
- the number of object identifiers in such a presentation that are identifiable by each interpretation reflects the probability that the interpretation is correct. For example, if a first interpretation is twice as likely to be correct as both of the two next most probable interpretations, then a presentation identifies twice as many candidate objects that are identifiable by the first interpretation as candidate objects that are identifiable by either of the two next most probable interpretations. In some implementations, candidate objects that are identifiable by interpretations that fall below a certain threshold probability (e.g., 10%) are excluded from such a presentation.
- a certain threshold probability e.g. 10%
- candidate objects are identified in such a presentation in alphabetical order regardless of the probability that the interpretation by which the candidate objects are identified is correct.
- identifiers of candidate objects are ordered in such a presentation according to the probabilities that the interpretation by which that candidate objects are identified is correct.
- identifiers of contact candidate objects are positioned before identifiers of applications, which in turn are positioned before identifiers of bookmarks, which in turn are positioned before identifiers of media. If insufficient space is available to display all the identifiers, only the first few identifiers are presented.
- Another example of a factor that can be considered in response to the probability being the same is the number of terms in an identifier. For example, identifiers that have fewer terms can be positioned before identifiers that have more terms in a presentation. If insufficient space is available to display all the identifiers, only the first few identifiers are presented.
- Another example of factor that can be considered in response to the probability being the same is the frequency that a candidate object has been accessed and the time that has passed since the last access, as described further below.

Abstract
Description
-
- independently assigning probabilities to different interpretations of the first character interaction and different interpretations of the second character interaction; and
- multiplying each probability of each interpretation of the first character interaction by each probability of each interpretation of the second character interaction to yield probabilities of the respective combinations of the first and second characters. The probabilities assigned to different interpretations of the first character interaction are independent of the probabilities assigned to different interpretations of the second character interaction in that the probabilities assigned to different interpretations of the first character interaction do not change the assignment of probabilities to interpretations of the second character interaction. In such cases, the assignment of probabilities to interpretations of different character interactions can be made with a single set of rules that considers each character interaction as a distinct, separate entity. An example of this approach is illustrated in
FIG. 4 .
