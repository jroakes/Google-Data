Definitions
- the specification relates to notifying people related to a user of an activity.
- existing solutions tie an activity to a physical location, for example, a hotel, a restaurant, etc., and only notify people of activities related to physical locations.
- existing solutions merely notify other users of a completion of an activity. For example, existing solutions notify a user's friends that the user has run two miles in a park. However, at the point where the user has completed the activity, it is too later for the user's friends to join.
- a processing module receives activity data relating to an activity being performed by a first user, the first user being associated with a social network, a determining engine extracts a feature from the activity data to identify the activity as the first user starting to purchase a product and a notification module notifies other users associated with the social network that the first user is starting to purchase the product.
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include receiving, with one or more computing devices, activity data relating to an activity being performed by a first user, the first user being associated with a social network, extracting, with the one or more computing devices, a feature from the activity data to identify the activity as the first user starting to purchase a product and notifying, with the one or more computing devices, other users associated with the social network that the first user is starting to purchase the product.
- Other aspects include corresponding methods, systems, apparatus and computer program products.
- operations further include processing activity data describing the activity to determine a location, wherein the location includes one of a physical location, a location specified by the first user, a location specified by an internet protocol address and a location specified by a uniform resource locator, and notifying the other users associated with the social network of the location.
- Operations further include generating a recommendation for the first user based on the activity data and wherein the recommendation includes one of a recommendation for an activity, a recommendation for forming an association with a new user of the social network and a recommendation for a product.
- Operations further include processing the activity data to determine a location and generating a recommendation for the first user based on the location and the feature.
- Operations further include applying a point to the first user as a reward for purchasing the product.
- the features include the activity being an offline activity or an online activity.
- the features include the activity being an online activity that is received in response to the first user reaching a location.
- the specification advantageously describes a system and method for notifying people related to a user that the user is starting to perform an activity in a location and generating a recommendation based on the activity. This helps users participate in more activities because they know what their connections are doing. In addition, the recommendations help users make new discoveries.

- the notification module 208 retrieves relationships (e.g., friendship, family, etc.) from a social graph stored in the social data, determines people related to the user based on the relationships and notifies people related to the user of the activity.
- the notification module 208 receives activity data describing a start of an activity, determines people related to the user and notifies people related to the user of the start of the activity.
- the feature for notifying people related to the user of a start of an activity is advantageous since, for example, it allows people related to the user to participate in the activity together with the user.
- the notification module 208 determines a predicted length of an activity.
- the notification module 208 receives location information associated with the user from the location module 204 related to past activities and predicts that the current activity will take the same amount of time. For example, based on GPS data the user goes running for an hour at 9:00 am every Monday. As a result, when the activity is running and it starts at 9:00 am on a Monday, the notification module 208 predicts that the running will take an hour and transmits a notification to the social network indicating that the predicted time for the activity will be from 9:00 am to 10:00 am. In another instance, the user manually enters an expected duration of the activity.
- the notification module 208 is connected to the user's calendar (or the notifying application 103 includes a calendar module for managing events), where the user enters a duration for events. For example, the user creates a meeting in the calendar and the notification module 208 transmits a notification about the meeting with a duration based on the meeting from the calendar. In some instances, the notification module 208 predicts the length of the activity based on an average time that other users performed a similar activity. For example, where the activity is eating dinner, the notification module 208 determines that other users that ate dinner took 1.5 hours to eat and predicts that the user will also take 1.5 hours to eat.
- the notification module 208 notifies people related to the user of the activity and sends one or more of a location, information related to the location and one or more features for the activity to people related to the user. For example, the notification module 208 sends one or more of the activity data, the location and the one or more features to the user interface engine 212 and instructs the user interface engine 212 to generate a user interface for presenting the one or more of the activity data, the location and the one or more features to the people related to the user. Often the user location is not a physical location that the user's friends would visit but more of a helpful indication of context.
- a user when a user is beginning to edit a document, it does not matter whether the user is at work or at home because the other users can collaborate in editing the document from different locations. Alternately, the user checks-in to a photograph. In other instances, however, the physical location is helpful for the user's friends to join the user, for example, when the activity is Artist X's concert and the location is the Famous Brand Arena.
- the notification module 208 notifies a social network of an activity performed by a user.
- the notification module 208 sends the activity data to a social network provided by the social network application 109 .
- the notification module 208 notifies the social network of a start of the activity.
- the notification module 208 receives activity data describing a start of an activity from the processing module 202 and notifies the social network provided by the social network application 109 that the user is starting to perform the activity.
- the social network application 109 retrieves relationships for the user from a social graph stored in the social data 243 , determines people related to the user and notifies the people that the user is starting to perform the activity.
- the notification module 208 notifies a group of people as specified by the user of the activity. For example, the user generates a group of friends that excludes work colleagues so that the work colleagues do not know how often the user is shopping. Alternatively, the notification module 208 notifies a work group of work-related activities to avoid boring the user's friends. For example, the notification module 208 notifies a workflow group that the user is beginning to start a Question & Answer document for the group. In some instances, the notification module 208 by default notifies a subset of groups, for example, close friend of the user on the social network. In some instances, the user specifies the audience for the notification of activities. For example, the user specifies that all activities involving concerts should be posted to a music group and not a business group.
- the recommendation engine 210 can be software including routines for generating a recommendation for a user.
