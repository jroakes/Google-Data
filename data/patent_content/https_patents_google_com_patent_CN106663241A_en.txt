Specific embodiment
Processing system is reminded to be easy to automatically generate the item of the prompting for being limited by specific type of reminders and the list of action.In behaviour
In work, processing system receives input lexical item collection is reminded.These lexical items it is resolved and with remind category dataset (such as classifier
Allusion quotation) it is compared.When input include specify belong to remind classification item lexical item when, system storage by type of reminders with by this one
The data that the item that individual or multiple lexical items are specified is associated.Type of reminders specifies trigger event, and can depend on item and classification
And change.For example, belonging to the other groceries item of chandlery can have " when " type for specifying reminder time to remind or specify miscellaneous
" where " type of shop or grocery store's set is reminded.Conversely, the film item of such as movie title can have " distribution " type
Remind, each " distribution " type is reminded and specifies different issuing dates.
In order to illustrate, user can say [purchase green soya bean, bread and milk], and used as response, prompting can be set
Be set to when user enter any grocery store (or the specific shop specified at the option of user) when triggering for green soya bean, bread and
The prompting list of milk.Similarly, user can say [go to see Godzilla], and as response, can set prompting at it
The date triggering of arenas version distribution (or some other distribution, the program request or stream distribution after such as arenas version distribution) is gone to the cinema brother
This prompting drawn.
Prompting can also be triggered by complexity.For example, user can state and [just call mine only when I goes to fresh grocery store
Wife], wherein " fresh grocery store " is specific grocery store.Therefore, when user goes to grocery store and groceries item reminds list quilt
During triggering, remind list also by including the user reminding that his wife is just called only when grocery store is fresh grocery store.Equally
Ground, user can say [only just watch daily report at home], and when program starts and if only if when user is in, seeing
Seeing the prompting of daily report program just will be triggered.
Processing system is reminded to realize in a user device, or in computer system detached with user equipment in fact
It is existing, such as server system.In the latter case, server system is sent out from user equipment receives input and to user equipment
Data are sent for processing and setting prompting.These features and supplementary features are described in greater detail below.
Fig. 1 is the block diagram of the environment 100 for wherein processing the order input that triggering is accumulated and reminded for list.Such as interconnect
The computer network 102 of net or its combination provide the data communication between electronic equipment and system.Computer network 102 can lead to
Crossing one or more gateways also includes one or more wireless networks 103 or carries out data with one or more wireless networks 103
Communication.
User equipment 106 is electronic equipment under control of the user, and money can be asked and received by network 102
Source and other user equipmenies set up communication channel (for example, voice communication), and can also perform other actions.Example user sets
Standby 106 include personal computer, mobile communication equipment and can pass through the miscellaneous equipment that network 102 sends and receives data.
In Fig. 1 examples, user equipment 106 is smart phone.Example smart phone is described with reference to FIG. 8 below.User equipment 106 can lead to
Cross wired with network 102 and 103 and be wirelessly connected on network 102 and 103 and communicate.
As described by with reference to Fig. 8, user equipment can be able to carry out the device action collection for various programs and ability.
In some embodiments, user equipment 106 performs speech recognition processes using the speech recognition system for receiving phonetic entry, and
And the word and expression of the identification obtained by parsing.Then parsed word and expression is processed to determine whether phonetic entry adjusts
With specific action or order.However, what speech recognition and language processing system were not required, this is because equipment can also be received
Text Command is input into.
User equipment 106 is associated with user account, such as by the trustship of cloud service provider 112 for providing various services
Account.These services can include web mails, social networks, message, document storage and editor etc..Account data 114 can be deposited
Data specific to the account of storage user equipment 106.
Command treatment system 120 receives order input from user equipment, and processes order input to determine in response to order
Input will take which action (if any).Although command treatment system 120 is illustrated as in FIG single entity, life
Make processing system 120 to realize in cloud service provider 112, or or even realize in user equipment 106.
Input can call the various actions determined by command treatment system 120.For example, input can be interpreted search
Querying command, in this case, search inquiry is sent to search service.Similarly, input can be interpreted to dial electricity
The order of words calling, in this case, user equipment 106 is attempted setting up voice communication by network 103.Equally, input can
To be interpreted to remind, in such a case, it is possible to generate reminder item.Be described in more detail below reminder item generation and these
The process of item.
In some embodiments, each input is processed by input resolver 122, and input resolver 122 is programmed to solution
Analysis input item simultaneously determines what action (if any) should be taken.In some embodiments, being input into resolver 122 can visit
Which ask language model to determine order or action taken.Such language model can be that (for example, model can based on statistics
With including distributing to the weight for being determined to be in semantically related to particular command certain words and phrase) or it is rule-based
(for example, describe particular command sentence structure grammer).Can be using various other language and text input processing system.
As described above, user can be input into order on user equipment 106, and command treatment system 120 processes input
Order with determine it is described order input whether resolve to the user equipment be configured to perform user equipment action.For
The remainder of the application, the example of process is input into and will resolve to based on the input reminded.Therefore, omit to other order inputs
The description of other command process features of type.
In some embodiments, command treatment system 120 includes the prompting processor communicated with input resolver 122
124.Processor 124 is reminded also to access prompting categorical data 126 and remind table data 128.In some embodiments, remind
Categorical data 126 can be the collection of classification dictionary.Each dictionary correspond to particular category, and with belong to the item collection phase of the category
Association, and can remind for its generation.For example, " groceries " classification can be associated with the list of groceries and food items；" electricity
Shadow " classification can be associated with the list of film, performer etc.；Etc..Item that is various different classes of and belonging to the category can be deposited
Storage is in categorical data 126.For simplicity, only using two classification examples --- groceries and film are providing system features
Scene example.
Each prompting classification and item can be with associated with corresponding type of reminders set.Type of reminders is according to the type
The type of reminders of specific specific events trigger.For example, " where " type is reminded when user equipment is being specified by prompting
The prompting triggered when at position；It is the prompting triggered when occurring the time specified by prompting that " time " type is reminded.It is general next
Say, type of reminders depends on triggering its event type.For example, for film, type of reminders can be based on specific distribution class
Issuing date, another issuing date of program request distribution of the distribution of type, such as arenas version etc..
Type of reminders can be disposable or recurrence.Disposable event only occurs once, except non-user resets, otherwise
Will not occur again.For example, special time event (such as arenas version distribution) only can occur at issuing date.Equally, it is specific
Position event (such as when shop is reached) may occur only when user reaches shop first, and if user accesses again
Shop then will not occur.However, recurrent event can periodically occur or occur when every time action occurs.For example, whenever
When serial collection of drama is broadcasted, special time event (such as serial broadcast time weekly) can occur.Equally, ad-hoc location event
(such as when shop is reached) can be specified by the user as recurrence so that when every time user reaches shop, and triggering is corresponding to be reminded.
Because some remind peculiar in item and classification, some promptings be associated with particular item and classification not with other or
Other classifications are associated.For example, groceries class items are not reminded with " arenas version issuing date " time type and are associated.Equally, electricity
Shadow Xiang Buyu " when in grocery store " location type is reminded associated.
Prompting table data 128 storage type of reminders is associated with item.In the case of server side process, list is reminded
Data 128 can store the association of multiple users；Conversely, in the case of user equipment side process, prompting table data 128 can
To store the association of the only user of user equipment 106.For example, the phantom for being connected to user equipment 106 reminds table data 128 to refer to
Show that user equipment has multiple prompting list RLm, each reminds list to include multiple promptings { R1m...Rmx }.Remind processor
128 update and safeguard table data 128, and when the event corresponding with one of type of reminders occurs, generate user equipment
106 prompting.
The operation for reminding processor is described below with reference to Fig. 2A, Fig. 2 B, Fig. 4 and Fig. 6.Especially, Fig. 2A is for generating
The flow chart of the instantiation procedure 200 of the prompting list of triggering.Process 200 can wherein run the calculating for reminding processor 120
Realize in machine equipment.In some embodiments, processor 120 is reminded to realize in user equipment 106；In other enforcements
In mode, processor 120 is reminded to run on the server for entering row data communication with user equipment 106.For example, cloud service
Provider 112 can be run at prompting on the server in the cloud communicated with user equipment 106 by network 102 and/or 103
Device 120 is managed, and the server receives from user equipment and inquires about and provide data as response.Process described below 220,
400 and 600 can also realize in user equipment or server-side device.
Process 200 receives the first input (202).For example, it is input into resolver 122 and receives defeated with one or more lexical items
Enter.
Process 200 determines whether one or more lexical items of the first input specify and belongs to the item (204) for reminding classification.Example
Such as, the lexical item of the parsing of resolver 122 input is to generate the lexical item of parsing, and by the lexical item of parsing and reminds classification dictionary ratio
Compared with.Each reminds classification dictionary corresponding to other remind the different prompting classifications of classifications from each, and stores description and belong to this
The lexical item of the item of classification.If the lexical item of the item in one of classification dictionary is reminded in the lexical item matching description of input, dictionary is selected
Corresponding prompting classification.For example, for input [purchase green soya bean], lexical item [green soya bean] matching groceries item.
In some embodiments, for example input can further be processed by using language model, grammer etc., with true
Whether fixed input is relevant with prompting or some other actions.For example, grammer can be mapped to specific action.Parsing is [in green soya bean
Vitamin] grammer (for example, S → vitamin exists<Groceries item nonterminal (non-terminal)>) may map to search and look into
Input action is ask, the input is submitted to into search engine as input for the search inquiry input action.Conversely, parsing
[purchase green soya bean] grammer (for example, S →<Purchase nonterminal><Groceries item nonterminal>) may map to the other prompting of chandlery
Action.
Other Languages model can also be used.For example, the semantic analysis of input can be used for scoring various actions, and
The action with highest score can be selected.
If process 200 does not determine that one or more lexical items of the first input are specified belongs to the item for reminding classification, process
Input processing is not prompting (206) by 200.However, it is possible to process input according to operation or action, for example, look into as search
Input is ask, as order for calling calling etc..
If conversely, process 200 determines that one or more lexical items of the first input are specified belongs to the item for reminding classification, mistake
Journey 200 stores the data (208) for being associated type of reminders with the item specified by one or more lexical items.For example, input parsing
Device 122 can call prompting processor 124, and it accesses the prompting dictionary reminded in categorical data 126.According to remind classification and
, the type of reminders of item can be associated with this and be stored in prompting table data 128.
Storage can automatically occur according to default parameters, or can be constructed by user.In the former case, example
Such as, can select to give tacit consent to type of reminders based on item and classification.For example, for groceries item, acquiescence type of reminders can work as to use
Trigger when family is into any grocery store " where " type.Conversely, for film item, acquiescence type of reminders can be " time " class
Type, and can also be that at arenas version issuing date (or be then that the next one will if arenas version issuing date passes by
The media distribution date of arrival) triggering subtype.
Processor 124 is reminded to realize that the more complicated of type of reminders automatically selects logic.For example, can be based on and most may be used
Can occur or the time goes up immediate event to select type of reminders.For example, it is assumed that input is [viewing Godzilla], and film brother
This arenas version issuing date drawn passes by.If however, film is shown still in many movie theatres, for wherein just
The where type of any theater location showed a film is reminded and can be associated with film item.If conversely, film is under movie theatre
Reflect, but be scheduled that media distribution (for example, blue light) can then arrange the time type that blue light is issued to remind.Show as another
Example, if film is issued and still shown in many movie theatres, then can be by where type is reminded and time class
Type is reminded and is associated with this.It can be cin positive film in any theater location shown that where type is reminded, and time type
Prompting can be Friday night 6:00 reminding user when starting at weekend.
In the case where user confirms, class can be reminded for confirming and selecting to the dialogue of user presentation user interface
Type.Fig. 2 B are the flow charts for generating another instantiation procedure 220 of the prompting list of triggering.Process 220 confirmed by user, and
And also perform description in the scene of Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3 B.Especially, Fig. 3 A are the figures of the user interface 302 at user equipment 300
Show, wherein the prompting for belonging to other of the first chandlery is presented for confirming, and Fig. 3 B are the users at user equipment 330
The diagram at interface 332, wherein the prompting of the item for belonging to the second movies category is presented for confirming.
Process steps 222,224 and 226 are similar to above-mentioned process steps 202,204 and 206.Therefore, the description of Fig. 2 B
Start from process steps 228, wherein reminding processor 124 to select one based on the item specified by one or more lexical items being input into
Individual or multiple type of reminders, then provide the data (230) of the list for causing user equipment that one or more reminder options are presented.
For example, with reference to Fig. 3 A, for the input 306 [purchase green soya bean] illustrated in input field 304, " where " type is carried
Awake 310 are automatically selected by prompting processor 124 and are presented to user.Default location is as indicated " groceries in menu item 312
Shop-whole position ".It is this that where type triggering will remind " purchase green soya bean " when user equipment enters any grocery store.User
The determination of the position of equipment can be completed for example, by gps coordinate or any other appropriate process.Then can be by position
With various grocery store's location comparisons.
User is also an option that specific store locations, as by indicated by phantom list 314.For example, can in the minds of user
With with the certain shops for specific non-principal commodity；Conversely, for staple, it is normal that user may be indifferent to him or she
Which grocery store gone to.If selected for ad-hoc location, then reminding will trigger only when user is in the position.
User can as an alternative select different type of reminders, such as when type 308.Choose when type 308 it
After may need additional input, the time that such as user specifies.
On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3 B, for the input 306 [viewing Godzilla] shown in input field 334, at prompting
Reason device 124 automatically selects the prompting 338 of " when " type and presents to user.Acquiescence prompting is as indicated in menu item 342
" all issuing dates ".The time type reminds the triggering in the generation at each issuing date, or until user removes
Remind.By the way that by film item, for example, film Godzilla resolves to the bar in the database of the film information provided by third party
Mesh is performing the determination at issuing date.
User is also an option that issuing date, as indicated by phantom list 344.For example, user may want to only with
Film is watched after " program request " form distribution film, and user will be reminded when occurring at issuing date.
User can as an alternative select different type of reminders, such as where type 340.Select where type 340 it
After may need additional input, the position of such as particular theater.
In some embodiments, processor 124 is reminded to access type of reminders qualified described in dictionary and not conform to
The data of the type of reminders of lattice.Qualified type of reminders is the type of reminders of still possible generation event；Conversely, underproof carry
Awake type is the event that have occurred and that and will not occur again, or the type of reminders of the event that can not occur.For example, for
The film item that arenas version is issued is had occurred that, or for the film item issued without arenas version, will determine that " arenas version is sent out
Type of reminders OK " is underproof.Remind processor 124 and then only select suitable type of reminders for presenting.
Process 220 determines whether to select reminder option (232).User may not always select reminder option.For example, user
The input form that may not be, therefore mistakenly triggering is reminded, or user may determine not storing prompting.If unselected
Reminder option is selected, is then input into and be not treated to prompting (226).Conversely, if selected for reminder option, then the storage of process 220 will
The data that the type of reminders corresponding with selected reminder option is associated with the item specified by one or more lexical items
(234).Then the certain types of prompting to particular category item is set for user equipment 106.
When user generates the prompting to item, item and prompting can be collected according to classification, and be in the form of prompting list
It is existing.For example, user can be input into order, and the order resolves to action to show particular item list and corresponding when resolved
Remind.Fig. 4 is the flow chart for selecting the instantiation procedure 400 for reminding list.Reference picture 5A and Fig. 5 B describe process 400.It is special
Not, Fig. 5 A are the diagrams of the user interface 502 at user equipment 500, wherein present belonging to carrying for other of the first chandlery
Awake list, and Fig. 5 B are the diagrams of the user interface 532 at user equipment 530, wherein the item for belonging to the second movies category is presented
Prompting list.
Process 400 receives the second input (402).For example, it is input into resolver 122 and receives defeated with one or more lexical items
Enter.
Process 400 determines whether one or more lexical items are specified for processing the action for belonging to the item list for reminding classification
(404).For example, the lexical item of the parsing of resolver 122 input is to generate the lexical item of parsing, and processes lexical item to determine whether input refers to
The action of processing item list is determined.It is, for example possible to use grammer or language model are processing parsed lexical item to determine input
Whether display action is called.For example, the input [show my groceries remind] of the difference of Fig. 5 A and Fig. 5 B and [my electricity is listed
Shadow], can be resolved and remind processor 124 to can determine that respectively call action is reminded to show groceries respectively for the input
Item list and film remind item list.
If process 400 determines that input is not specified for processing the action for belonging to the item list for reminding classification, it is input into not
It is treated to a list request (406).However, input can be processed according to operation or action, for example it is, defeated as search inquiry
Enter, as order for calling calling etc..
If conversely, process 400 determines that input is specified processes the action for belonging to the item list for reminding classification, options
List (408) and offer cause user equipment that the data (410) of item list are presented.For example, as shown in Figure 5A, input 506 [shows
My groceries are reminded] cause to be provided to user equipment cause user equipment to show groceries item list 508 data (for example, if
Process 400 realizes in a user device, and by user equipment 106 data are generated, or if process 400 to provide 112 by service real
Now then data are sent by server).In some embodiments, when item list has the different type of reminders for item, such as
Shown in item list packet 510,512 and 514, item can be grouped according to type of reminders.Can also use present item list its
Its appropriate ways.
To be these offer promptings when user enters any grocery store in the first packet 510.In second packet
In 512, only this prompting is just provided when user enters grocery store's " prevalence ".In the 3rd packet 514, only when user enters
This prompting is just provided during grocery store " mother ".
Used as another example, as shown in Figure 5 B, input 5e6 [listing my film] causes to be supplied to the data of user equipment
So that user equipment shows film item list 538.Again, such as item list packet 540,542 and 544, can be according to type of reminders
Item is grouped.In the first packet 540, item has two different promptings --- and arenas version is issued and blue light distribution, and
And the prompting that provide to the item will be issued for each.Will only be the prompting of blue light distribution offer item in second packet 542.
Will only be the prompting of program request distribution offer item in the 3rd packet 544.
Again, it is also possible to using other appropriate ways that item list is presented.For example, user can provide input and [show me
Arenas version distribution film].Processor 124 is reminded by the way that using appropriate language model or grammer, the second input will be determined
The lexical item of parsing also specifies the first type of reminders --- " distribution of arenas version " in addition to classification and/or item.As response, remind
Processor 124 will provide the data for causing user equipment that item list is presented, wherein each in list and the first type of reminders
It is associated.In this example, only film item Godzilla and Mo Sila will be shown.
Various other type of reminders logics can also be processed.For example, user can be input into and [list the institute in addition to Pop's
There are my groceries].Using semantic language model, processor 124 is reminded to determine the where prompting for not being shown as that " prevalence " set
Groceries remind.Therefore, the packet 510 and 514 of Fig. 5 A is only shown.
As another example, the list with the item about trigger can also be shown.Can be from from different classes of
Item generates list, but its middle term has the common type of reminders specified by input.For example, user can be input into and [show that I am bright
It needs that what does].Lexical item " tomorrow " is resolved to exact date, then illustrates carrying for " when " type occurred on date
Wake up, for example, grocery list can be shown, film and laundry are reminded.Equally, user can be input into [when I am in San Francisco I need
What does].As response, show to list and remind carrying for the item being associated with " where " type with position " San Francisco "
Awake item list.
For each reminded in list, processor 124 is reminded to determine whether to have occurred and that the prompting class for meeting this
The event of type.When there is such event, this prompting is shown.Fig. 6 is to be in for the triggering in response to reminder events
The flow chart of the instantiation procedure 600 of existing item list.Process 600 is described in the scene of Fig. 7 A and Fig. 7 B.Especially, Fig. 7 A are
The diagram of the user interface 702 at user equipment 700, (be located at specific groceries in response to triggering the first type of reminders wherein showing
The position in shop) reminder events item list.Equally, Fig. 7 B are the diagrams of the user interface 732 at user equipment 730, wherein
Show the item list of the reminder events in response to triggering the second type of reminders (arenas version issuing date).

Completing depending on list items, and user is just reminded only when deadline list items are not completed.In the modification of these embodiments
In, deadline reminds periodically together with the number of days until deadline can remind user before deadline, all
Such as the daily prompting of the item in list.
Prompting can also be that behavior type is reminded.For example, prompting can be " in the way arrived ... " prompting of type, and
" where " will trigger in the way of position going in user.For example, user can ask the navigation of cinema, and when offer
During navigation, the list of film prompting can also be provided.
Prompting can also be combined, such as by boolean (Boolean) operator, for example, " when " AND " where ", " what
When " OR " where " etc..
Prompting can be with according to the categorical clusters of each of which.For example, it is relevant with the classification of groceries and brightwork to carry
Waking up can be grouped into " assignment " type classification, because user has been generally acknowledged that in grocery store and hardware store's shopping be necessity.
Conversely, the prompting relevant with the classification of film, TV, competitive sports etc. can be grouped into " amusement " type classification, because this
The event of sample is typically considered amusement.Therefore user can say " showing that I needs the assignment done today to me ", and carry
Awake processor 124 will make user equipment that the prompting for belonging to the classification that particular category is clustered is presented.
In some embodiments, prompting can be qualitative event rather than can quantify event.For example, user can say
[the laundry clothes when my] available free time.Remind processor 124 to reuse language model to come from lexical item " when I am available free
During the time " determine constraint.Then constraint can be expressed according to the predefined criterion of one or more of constrained type.For example, it is right
In constraint " free time ", 1) criterion can be outside normal working hours；2) when being in；With 3) not on user's calendar
One hour of any other appointment in.When these criterions are met, the prompting of " laundry clothes " will be generated.
In some implementations, reminder item can be linked to other reminded in list.For example, user can say [when
Groceries call my wife when doing shopping].Then, even if item " calling wife " is not groceries item, prompting processor will be with " in groceries
Corresponding " where " type in shop " is reminded to groceries item list addition --- calling wife.Therefore, when meeting " in grocery store "
The prompting of " calling wife " during type of reminders, will be also shown.
In some embodiments, can shared prompt list between users.For example, two people can share groceries item
List, and as everyone add-ins during one week, to list, for everyone list is updated.Therefore, when meeting in list
Prompting event occur when, list is shown on a user device.In the modification of these embodiments, can be to the shared list
Other users provide to the notice that is triggered of prompting.For example, husband can receive notice " your wife is now in mother's groceries
Shop is done shopping, and has reminded her to buy the following item on grocery list " and trigger the targeted item list of prompting.
Although it have been described that the Example reminders type of " groceries " and " film " classification, but can be using other classifications
Other type of reminders.For example, for television genre is reminded, type of reminders can be " when " type, by " pre-set time (Lead
Time restriction (for example, program starts previous hour)) ", and " repetition " type, are broadcasted by often collection and are limited.For with connection
The relevant prompting of program is closed, prompting can also be " channel " type, limited by the TV station for broadcasting syndicated program thereon.
Can also use for the prompting of other subject fields such as books, music, work, professional association.
Although generating above-mentioned example list in response to user input, can also based on observed user behavior come
Generate list and prompting.For example, the user's history for creating and completing is reminded to be determined for correct as the prompting of suggestion
Reminder item and corresponding triggering.Other information (whether such as customer location, user deleted prompting etc. before prompting is triggered)
Can be used for determining the prompting for being prompted to user or setting automatically for user.For example, user may infrequently be input into spy
But (for example, " going to gymnasium ") is reminded calmly and then the removing prompting before triggering is reminded.Since it is observed that behavior be user
May be not considered as that specific prompting is critically important, so systematics can should not be user and set the prompting automatically, or or even to user
Advise the prompting.
