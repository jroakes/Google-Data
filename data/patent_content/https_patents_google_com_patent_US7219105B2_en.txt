- a user would give IBM as the search query.
- This search query will return a large number of documents from the information sources. These documents may relate to different aspects of the entity ‘IBM’. For example, they may relate to the products, services, employees, competitors, and the like of IBM. Also, there may not be a website, or an information source dedicated to ‘IBM’ that lists the various connotations of ‘IBM’. Profiling the entity ‘IBM’ would imply summarizing the various aspects of ‘IBM’ such as products, services, competitors and the like of ‘IBM’. In order to do this, the user will have to browse through each search result. This can be a very tedious task.
- the entity ‘IBM’ returned a total of 22,700,000 results when searched over the Internet through the search engine GoogleTM. It is almost impossible for a user to read all these documents and profile the entity IBM. Moreover, it is very difficult for the user to structure the relevant documents in a manner that summarizes the various aspects of the entity ‘IBM’.
- An object of the current invention is to provide a method, system and computer program product for constructing a profile for an entity, based on information obtained from at least one information source.
- Another object of the current invention is to identify the relevant features of an entity and present them to the user in a structured manner.
- a further object of the current invention is to provide a system for automatically summarizing various aspects of an entity.
- the current invention provides a method and system for profiling an entity based on information obtained from at least one information source.
- Various contexts associated with the entity are identified. This can be achieved by using a clustering algorithm, an ontology, a thesaurus, association rules or manually by an expert.
- various concepts within each context are identified. The concepts can be identified using any feature selection technique. Once the concepts have been identified, distinct entity-context pairs are identified and the identified concepts are classified into various sets with respect to each entity-context pair. Thereafter, the concepts within each entity-context pair are ranked using a ranking algorithm. Few top ranked concepts from each set are then presented to the user.
- the entity is used as a search query to obtain information from at least one information source.
- the retrieved information is used to identify the various contexts related to the entity.
- further information is retrieved from at least one information source using the contexts to form the further search query. This further information is used to identify concepts relating to the contexts.

- FIG. 2 shows a block diagram illustrating the various components of entity-profiling system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating the method of profiling an entity in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the current invention.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart describing the method of structuring and presenting the concepts to the user in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the current invention.
- FIG. 5 shows the principal contexts for an entity ‘IBM’.
- FIG. 6 shows a few top ranked concepts within the hardware context of the entity ‘IBM’.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a computer system for implementing the present invention.
- Entity An entity may be a simple word or a phrase. It may refer to an organization, a person, a sport, religion etc. Various examples of the entity can be IBM, James Bond, Football etc.
- Profile The summarization of various features of an entity is called its profile. For example, if the entity is “IBM”, then the summarization of its products, services, employees, and competitors may be referred to as the profile of ‘IBM’.
- Contexts referred to in the present invention may have varied interpretations.
- the context may be a discourse that surrounds a language unit and helps to determine its interpretation.
- the context for ‘switch’ may be “electrical goods”.
- Contexts may also mean various aspects associated with an entity.
- some of the contexts associated with breast cancer could be causes, preventive medicine, exercises, genes causing the cancer, and drugs.
- Contexts could also mean various interpretations of a word or a phrase.
- the word “bond” may mean James Bond, a government bond, a chemical bond, etc.
- These contexts can be flat or hierarchical, unique or entity dependent. An example of hierarchical contexts can be given for an entity “Boeing”. In case of “Boeing”, the context “automation” may have “software” and “hardware” as sub-contexts.
- Profiling of an entity is more meaningful and useful if the identified contexts are orthogonal. Two or more contexts are said to be orthogonal if the associated key words or phrases are non-overlapping. In this definition, it is assumed that the keywords associated with the contexts do not have multiple senses. In general, a pair of contexts can be considered orthogonal even if they share a set of common keywords, provided the keywords are used in different senses in the two contexts.
- orthogonal contexts like “software” and “hardware” may have some common keywords, which makes them non-orthogonal according to the above definition of orthogonality.
- concept of orthogonality could depend on the entity to be analyzed as well.
- the contexts “software” and “hardware” may appear to be orthogonal with respect to the entity “IBM”. However, they may form part of the context “automation” with respect to the entity “Boeing”.
- Concepts are terms or phrases that give information about the contents of the documents. They signify the various aspects or features covered in the documents. In other words, the contexts capture the essence of the documents at a broad level while the concepts summarize the documents in more detail. For example, consider the case of a user who has a collection of documents with respect to a context “bag”, with the documents providing information about hand bags and shoulder bags. Therefore, the concepts with respect to the context “bag” are “handbag” and “shoulder bag”.
- the present invention describes a method, system and computer program product for profiling an entity based on information obtained from one or more information sources.
- information sources can be enterprise databases, or other information sources that can be accessed over a network.
- Contexts are identified for a given entity based on the information obtained from at least one information source. Thereafter, concepts within each context are identified. These concepts are presented to the user in a structured manner, thereby profiling the entity.
- FIG. 1 shows a block diagram illustrating the environment for the working of the present invention.
- Entity profiling system 101 is used to profile entities based on information obtained from several information sources. Entity profiling system 101 can access information sources directly, as in case of enterprise information sources, or it can access information sources through the Internet 109 . As shown in FIG. 1 , entity-profiling system 101 has direct access to information source 103 while information sources 105 and 107 are accessed through the Internet 109 .
- FIG. 2 shows a block diagram illustrating the various components of entity-profiling system 101 . It comprises a context identifier 201 , a concept identifier 203 and a concept arranger 205 .
- Context identifier 201 takes as input an entity and identifies all possible contexts relevant to the entity. Details on the exact manner in which contexts are identified have been explained in detail in conjunction with FIG. 3 .
- Concept identifier 203 takes as input the contexts identified by context identifier 201 and identifies concepts corresponding to each context. Details on how the concepts are identified will be explained in detail in conjunction with FIG. 3 .
- the identified concepts within each context are structured and presented by concept arranger 205 . Details on the manner in which the concepts are structured in order to present a profile of the entity will be explained in conjunction with FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 3 shows a flowchart depicting the method of profiling an entity in accordance with the system illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- various contexts with respect to the entity are identified at step 301 .
- identifying the contexts There are various methods for identifying the contexts.
- One such approach is through the use of a clustering algorithm.
- the user first retrieves information related to the entity from the information sources.
- the information may be in the form of documents.
- the user retrieves the documents by giving entity as a search query to a search engine.
- a clustering algorithm is applied to cluster the retrieved documents.
- the resulting clusters can be considered to correspond to various contexts associated with the entity.
- Various clustering algorithms known in the art may be used for clustering the retrieved documents.
- the ontology is a controlled, hierarchical vocabulary for describing a knowledge system.
- contexts can be defined using either Dmoz directory or Yahoo! directory.
- the contexts can be identified by finding prominent nodes that contain the entity, in the ontology.
- the prominent nodes are the ones that contain the entity quite frequently.
- a thesaurus may also be used to identify the contexts associated with the entity.
- association rules For example, if the entity to be profiled is “bond”, then the possible contexts identified by thesaurus are “affiliation” and “guaranty”, as these are synonyms for “bond”.
- association rules There are other approaches as well that use association rules to find distinct contexts associated with the entity. For example, one may find a set of the words or phrases that occur frequently with the entity and that mutually do not appear together in documents in the information source.
- Another approach that uses association rules has been cited in: Amit Nanavati, Krishna Prasad Chitrapura, Sachindra Joshi, and Raghu Krishnapuram, “Mining generalized disjunctive association rules,” in Proceedings of ACM 10th International Conf. on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), Atlanta, 2001, pp. 482–489.
- the contexts can be identified manually by an expert. In such as case, the user simply inputs all contexts that are relevant to entity in question.
- Contexts can be represented either by a set of terms (which can be keywords or phrases) or by a set of documents.
- the set of terms can also be considered as a single document. Therefore, since set of documents is a more general representation, they can be used to represent a context.
- set of documents is a more general representation, they can be used to represent a context.
- the concepts can be identified by following a two-step approach. These two steps are performed for each entity context pair.
- the documents relating to the entity and each context are retrieved from the information sources.
- documents relating to the entity have already been retrieved (as in the case of identifying contexts by using a clustering algorithm)
- only documents relating to each context are retrieved.
- the user can retrieve the documents by giving the entity and the context as queries to the search engine.
- the search engine returns two sets of documents. One set of documents is related to the entity and the other set of documents to the context. Alternatively, the user may perform search for the entity only once and use the set of retrieved documents for other entity context pairs.
- the concepts are identified from these sets of documents by using any of the text parsing algorithms that extract meaningful words or phrases in the document collections. For example, one can use Link grammar parser as described in: Daniel Sleator and Davy Temperley, Parsing English with a Link Grammar, Third International Workshop on Parsing Technologies, August 1993. The words or phrases extracted by these parsers can be used as the concepts.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a flowchart describing the method of structuring and presenting the concepts.
- the first step is to identify distinct entity context pairs as shown at step 401 .
- each entity context pair is taken and the identified concepts, which are a combination of concepts for the entity and the corresponding context, are classified into four sets as shown at step 403 .
- the first set of concepts contains concepts that are exclusive to E and is denoted by E(C′).
- E refers to the entity
- C refers to the context.
- the second set comprises of concepts that are exclusive to C and is denoted by C(E′).
- the third set denotes concepts that are common to E and C but more representative of E, denoted by E(C) and the fourth set comprises of concepts that are common to E and C but more representative of C, denoted by C(E).
- the concepts within each of these sets are ranked at step 405 .
- Several feature selection techniques used in text classification can be adapted to rank the concepts. Some of the derived ranking algorithms will be explained in detail later. The classification of concepts into the four sets has also been described in detail in conjunction with ranking algorithms later.
- the number of concepts to be presented can be chosen by the user. For example, the user may choose to present only the top ten concepts or a certain percentage of the total number of concepts retrieved.
- FIG. 5 shows the principal contexts for the entity ‘IBM’.
- the contexts for IBM 501 may be Hardware 503 , Software 505 and Services 507 .
- the concepts can be classified into four sets E(C′), E(C), C(E′) and C(E). It must be apparent to one skilled in the art that the contexts shown in FIG. 5 are for exemplary purposes only and the contexts relating to the entity ‘IBM’ may not be limited to hardware, software and services only.
- FIG. 6 shows a few top ranked concepts within the hardware context of the entity ‘IBM’.
- Set E(C′) 601 comprises concepts namely Websphere 603 and CEO of IBM 605 . These two concepts are associated with IBM 501 in contexts other than hardware 503 .
- One of the concepts in E(C) 607 is ThinkPad 609 . This concept is common to both IBM 501 and hardware 503 but it is more representative of IBM 501 than hardware 503 , since ‘IBM ThinkPad’ is a popular laptop by IBM.
- Set C(E′) 611 contains concepts such as door 613 and antique 615 . These concepts are associated with hardware 503 in contexts other than IBM 501 .
- set C(E) 617 contains concepts like desktops 619 . This concept is common to both IBM 501 and hardware 503 . However; desktops 619 are more representative of hardware 503 than IBM 501 .

Abstract
Description
- E(C′) contains the few top-ranked concepts from the set (G-H) (the concepts that are present in G but not in H) ranked according to RE|C(t),
- C(E′) contains the few top-ranked concepts from the set (H-G) (the concepts that are present in H but not in G) ranked according to RC|E(t),
- E(C) contains the few top-ranked concepts from the set G∩H (the concepts that are present in both G and H) ranked according to RE|C(t), and
- C(E) contains the few top-ranked concepts from the set G∩H (the concepts that are present in both G and H) ranked according to RC|E(t).
Also, let t be a term (word or phrase).- t′ be the complement of term t.
- n(t) be the number of documents in N and M containing t.
- n(S) be the number of documents in set S (S is either N or M).
- n(S, t)=number of documents in set S and containing t.
- n(S1, S2)=number of documents in any two sets S1 and S2.
In the Aposteriori Probability Ranking (PoP), the rank is given by
R PoP E|C(t)=Pr(N|t)−Pr(M|t)
R PrP E|C(t)=Pr(t|N)−Pr(t|M)
R MI E|C(t)=ln(Pr(t|N)/Pr(t))
and is estimated by using
R MI E|C(t)=ln((n(n,t)*n(N,M))/(n(N)*n(t))).
R CHI E|C(t)=(n(N,M)*(n(N,t)*n(M,t′)−n(N,t′)*n(M,t))2/(n(N)*n(M)*(n(t)*n(t′))
While using Fisher's Discriminant Ranking (FD), two variants of FD can be used. Let the two variations of FD be FD1 and FD2. One may refer to the following literature for details about the Fisher's Discriminant based feature selection algorithm: Soumen Chakrabarti, Byron Dom, Rakesh Agrawal, and Prabhakar Raghavan, “Using taxonomy, discriminants, and signatures for navigating in text databases,” in Proceedings of 23rd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, 1997. Let δ(d, t)=1, if t belongs to d, and δ(d, t)=0, otherwise. Here d denotes a document. Assuming that E and C represent two classes, we can compute intra class variance of document frequency as:
icv(t,S)=ΣS(1/n(S))(δ(d,t)−Pr(t|S))2
and inter class variance of document frequency between N and M is defined as:
ICV(t, N, M)=(Pr(t|N)−Pr(t|M))2
Then one of the ranking functions is defined as:
R FD1 E|C(t)=icv(t,N)−icv(t,M),
and the other as:
R FD2 E|C(t)=ICV(t,N,M)−icv(t,M).
