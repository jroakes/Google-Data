Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to search recommendations. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to implementing search recommendations using image content analysis and geo-semantic indexing.
Background
Users often wish to find locations that can accommodate the needs of certain human activities. However, when searching for nearby locations with certain facilities and/or physical attributes, a typical search query may not produce results that are valuable to the user. For example, a user may utilize a mapping application to view a map of an area and attempt to visually determine a location for a particular activity or search for manually marked elements that may indicate a likelihood of a sporting activity. Such search techniques can be cumbersome and may produce inconsistent or incorrect results. For example, facilities and/or attributes may be unmapped and/or too numerous or very easily changed. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved system for map searching to identify locations associated with an activity.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
In general, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods that enable map search recommendations based on geographic semantic indices developed using image content analysis. In particular, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may facilitate the generation of a geographic semantic index of a location that identifies types of features and/or attributes associated with a user activity and the use of such geographic semantic index to provide map search recommendations that include one or more geographic locations that may be tailored to a particular user activity. For example, a user may want to search for nearby locations that may accommodate a particular user activity (e.g., nearby places that are child-friendly, playgrounds with cool areas, places that people may sit down to read, etc.). A geographic semantic index of locations may be built based on image content analysis (e.g., analyzing a periodic set of street level pictures, etc. to identify features/attributes associated with an activity, etc.), including rich semantic context information for each location. The geographic semantic index may then be used to identify location units within a certain geographic area (e.g., a fixed radius of a user's location, etc.) that may be adapted to a desired activity (e.g., an activity score based on the location units, etc.). The identified location may be provided to the user as part of a query result recommendation (e.g., mapped location, list of locations, etc.). In some cases, the location recommendation may include a description of the location based on features/attributes and activities associated with the location. Accordingly, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may enable answering user queries for locations with requested features and/or attributes that may be tailored to a particular activity in a more comprehensive manner, and guiding users to such locations.
More specifically, according to one aspect of the present disclosure, a computing system may facilitate the construction and periodic updating of a geographic semantic index of locations (e.g., on a grid of location cells) with rich semantic context information for each location generated using an image content analysis engine. The image content analysis system may identify a wide range of semantic elements (e.g., on the order of thousands of elements), many of which reference features and/or attributes of physical and urban landscapes. Such image content analysis systems may be tasked with periodically processing very large image corpora. The geo-semantic index may use actual knowledge about physical locations derived from the collected pictures to provide a semantic context map of the world and facilitate search recommendations for places that may support a desired activity and/or recommendations for activities within a particular area.
According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a computing system may support cataloging of vocabularies of known feature and/or attribute types (e.g., from image content analysis dictionaries, etc.) and user activities that they may accommodate (e.g., search users and applications may be interested in). For example, such a feature/attribute vocabulary may include a "bench" for reading; "alleys" for walking; a "loading area" or "parking meter" for passengers to get on or off the vehicle; a "statue", "fountain" or "boutique" for a party; and the like. The feature/attribute vocabulary may have a many-to-many relationship between activities and vocabulary terms. In some embodiments, the feature/attribute vocabulary may include verb attribute terms in addition to physical features/attributes, e.g., to identify that a person is reading in a picture, etc.
The computing system may periodically obtain a collection of pictures (e.g., street level pictures, aerial pictures, etc.), for example, from a continuously updated corpus of pictures, publicly available pictures, user-generated pictures, and so forth. The computing system may perform image content analysis on the obtained picture to identify feature/attribute type terms from the generated vocabulary. Based on the identified features/attributes, the computing system may populate and/or update a geographic semantic index of location cells associated with the picture (e.g., on a grid of location cells mapped to a geographic area). The geo-semantic index may also include data related to the collection time of pictures having the identified features/attributes. In some implementations, the index may be continuously updated to match features/attributes to activities based on user feedback or the like, e.g., via manual updates from a human operator. In some implementations, the image content analysis can include filtering out certain image data, such as features/attributes identified in private and/or restricted areas.
For each activity supported by the vocabulary, the computing system may generate a weighted activity score for each location unit based at least in part on the number, diversity, and/or recency of semantic terms corresponding to the activity associated with the location unit. In some implementations, the activity score can be generated based on one or more metric definitions provided by a client application associated with the activity. For example, many user applications focus on specific human activities that may be supported by search recommendations using a geo-semantic index as described herein. In some implementations, some activities in the geographic semantic index and/or vocabulary may be defined based only on the requirements of the particular user application that defines the activities and metrics for the activity scores. In some implementations, the activity score can vary based on the type of activity, the type of application, and so forth, e.g., based on elements that may be important or necessary to the activity. The generation of such activity scores and the repeated refreshing of information provided from large picture corpora (e.g., street-level picture corpora, etc.) through image content analysis enables the functionality of the geo-semantic index in providing more comprehensive suggestions to users based on desired activities.
According to another aspect of the disclosure, a computing system may obtain queries from a user regarding nearby locations that may be tailored to a particular user activity. The computing system may analyze the geo-semantic index to identify one or more high scoring location units nearby (e.g., within a fixed radius of a search area indicated by the user, around the user's current location, etc.) and provide one or more of those locations that match the desired activity as search recommendations. In some implementations, for each location, the computing system may generate a textual description based on features/attributes and/or activities associated with the location. For example, in some implementations, such descriptions may be generated based on application of natural language processing, may be curated by a human operator, and so forth. These location descriptions may be provided to the user as part of a location recommendation to assist the user in selecting and/or finding a desired location.
For example, a user query may be submitted to a computing system, such as "find a place where I can take a walk and enjoy some shade". The computing system may filter query submissions for any known active words associated with the vocabulary, e.g., the system may recognize "walking" and "enjoying a cool and cool" as active terms in the vocabulary. The computing system may analyze the index to identify one or more location units with a high match for these activities based on the presence of certain vocabulary terms in the units. Thus, an identified unit location may have terms such as "alley," "tree," "sidewalk," "stone path," and/or other similar terms among its descriptive characteristic terms. The computing system may return one or more of the identified locations to the user as recommendations based, for example, in part, on the activity scores associated with the identified location units.
In some implementations, geographic semantic indexing can be used to provide recommendations for one or more activities within a certain geographic area, as opposed to recommendations for locations that are tailored to particular activities. For example, rather than answering a query of "where i may do < certain activities >", the computing system may use a geographic semantic index to answer a request to "please recommend activities that i may do within X meters of where i are located". In this case, the same geographic semantic index may use the user's current location and semantic elements stored in the index (e.g., developed based on image content analysis) to provide recommendations for certain activities supported by these elements within a specified geographic area.
In some cases, such an activity query may not be issued by the user directly through a desktop search or voice assistant. Rather, potential users may also interact with the recommendation system by their use of various client applications (e.g., via RPC calls). Many applications focus on specific human activities that the geographic semantic index can support. Some good examples may include applications for parties, car calls, sports and outdoor sports, virtual reality games, walking dogs, watching birds, and so forth. Each type of application may need to define its activity terms and specific weights and metric functions with any other algorithmic filtering criteria (e.g., avoid roads or residential buildings with a certain margin of distance, etc.). According to some aspects, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may provide an interface for any application that requires knowledge about a common space to support its activity-based features for user settings. As an example, in the case of a passenger lift, the computing system may return a location with a "loading zone" flag, parking meter, highly visible landmarks, and other items that make it easy for both the driver and the passenger to find a location and to park and take away personnel at that location with ease and legitimacy. In the example of a party, the activity score of a location unit may consider items that are "walkable" in height of the venue, for example, having elements such as "walking paths" and/or various pedestrian establishments, "fountains," "sculptures," and so forth.
According to some aspects, a computing system may obtain a vocabulary of image feature types associated with user activity. The vocabulary may include data identifying the type of image feature. The plurality of activity types may each be associated with a respective subset of the image feature types, the respective subset being from a vocabulary of image feature types. A computing system may obtain a set of pictures, such as a set of images. The computing system may perform image content analysis on the collection of pictures based on a vocabulary of image feature types. For example, the computing system may determine whether the corresponding picture of each of the plurality of location units of the geo-semantic index includes a feature type from a vocabulary of image feature types. The computing system may generate at least one activity score for each location unit in the geographic semantic index based on a vocabulary of image feature types. For each location unit, the computing system may determine an activity score for each activity type based at least in part on whether the location unit includes some respective subset of image feature types for such activity type. The computing system may populate a geographic semantic index of location units with data indicative of the at least one activity score for each location unit. The computing system may provide a geographic semantic index of location units for generating location recommendations in response to queries.
The systems and methods described herein provide a number of technical effects and benefits. For example, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may provide improvements to search recommendation systems. The systems and methods may, for example, enable queries for nearby locations based on the presence of certain facilities and/or attributes that may not have been mapped and/or too numerous or very easily changed. The latter may in particular make it infeasible to rely only on fixed permanent records (e.g. reported by the user) of such entities without automatically refreshing them. Accordingly, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may enable answering user queries for locations with requested features and/or attributes that may be tailored to a particular activity in a more comprehensive manner, and guiding users to such locations.
According to some aspects, an improved search recommendation system and/or related user interface may be provided by associating locations with activities based on image content analysis. Image content analysis of the picture associated with the location may be used to identify the presence of features of the vocabulary corresponding to the image features. Image features in the vocabulary may be associated with activities or activity types. As such, the geographic semantic index described herein may include information associated with activities at particular locations, where the activities are determined based on image content analysis. Such techniques may represent improvements over manual or other procedures.
Referring now to the drawings, example embodiments of the disclosure will be discussed in further detail.
Example apparatus and System
FIG. 1 depicts a block diagram of an example computing system 100 that may facilitate search recommendations based on a geographic semantic index developed using image content analysis, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. The system 100 is provided as just one example. Other computing systems including different components may be used in addition to or in place of system 100. System 100 may include one or more user computing devices (such as user computing device 102) and one or more remote computing devices (such as server computing system 120) communicatively coupled by one or more networks (such as communication network 140). Although only one user computing device is shown in fig. 1, any number of user computing devices may be connected to server computing system 120 through network 140.
The user computing device 102 may be any type of computing device, such as, for example, a personal computing device (e.g., a laptop or desktop computer), a mobile computing device (e.g., a smartphone or tablet computer), a gaming console or controller, a wearable computing device, an embedded computing device, or any other type of computing device.
The user computing device 102 includes one or more processors 104 and one or more memories 106. The one or more processors 104 may be any suitable processing device (e.g., processor cores, microprocessors, ASICs, FPGAs, controllers, microcontrollers, etc.) and may be one processor or a plurality of processors operatively connected. The one or more memories 106 may include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, a disk, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The one or more memories 106 may store data 108 and instructions 110, the data 108 and instructions 110 being executed by the processor 104 to cause the user computing device 102 to perform operations such as those described herein. More specifically, as described herein, the user computing device 102 may generate query requests and receive response data from the server computing system 120 over the communication network 140.
The user computing device 102 may also include one or more input/output interfaces 112. The one or more input/output interfaces 112 can include, for example, devices for receiving information from a user or providing information to a user, such as through a display device, touch screen, touch pad, mouse, data input keys, audio output device (such as one or more speakers), microphone, camera, haptic feedback device, or the like. The user computing device 102 may also include one or more communication/network interfaces 114 for communicating with one or more systems or devices, including systems or devices located remotely from the user computing device 102.
The server computing system 120 may include one or more processors 122 and one or more memories 124. The one or more processors 122 may be any suitable processing device (e.g., processor cores, microprocessors, ASICs, FPGAs, controllers, microcontrollers, etc.) and may be one processor or a plurality of processors operatively connected. The one or more memories 124 may include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, a disk, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The one or more memories 124 may store data 126 and instructions 128, the data 126 and instructions 128 being executed by the processor 122 to cause the server computing system 120 to perform operations such as those described herein, including supporting image content analysis, generating and/or maintaining a geo-semantic index, facilitating search recommendations, and so forth.
In some implementations, the server computing system 120 may include or otherwise be implemented by one or more server computing devices. Where the server computing system 120 includes multiple server computing devices, such server computing devices may operate according to a sequential computing architecture, a parallel computing architecture, or some combination thereof.
In some implementations, the server computing system 120 may host a geographic information system 130, such as a geographic information system associated with a mapping service. Geographic Information System (GIS)130 may implement a mapping application, a virtual earth application, or any other suitable GIS. The GIS 130 may support archiving, retrieving, and manipulating geospatial data that has been indexed and stored according to geographic coordinates (such as latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates) associated with the geospatial data. The GIS 130 may combine satellite pictures, photographs, maps, models, and other geographic data with internet search functionality to enable a user to view pictures of planets (e.g., map data associated with multiple geographic areas) and related geographic information (e.g., locations such as islands and cities, points of interest such as local restaurants, hospitals, parks, hotels, and schools, etc.). The GIS 130 may further allow the user to conduct a local search to obtain directions of travel to or between one location or otherwise retrieve map data for a selected area. The results may be displayed in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional representation of the region of interest. In some implementations, a user can pan, tilt, and rotate the view to view the three-dimensional terrain and buildings.
The GIS 130 may provide search results, recommendations, etc. (e.g., in response to a user query, etc.) based at least in part on the geographic semantic indices as described herein. For example, the GIS 130 may include or otherwise be provided access to a geographic semantic index (such as the geographic semantic index 134) that may include semantic context associated with a plurality of location units (e.g., features, attributes, activities, etc. associated with each location unit), where the geographic semantic index may be populated and/or updated based on image content analysis, manual input, etc.
According to an aspect of the disclosure, the server computing system 120 may include an image content analysis engine 132, which may facilitate implementation of embodiments of the disclosure. For example, the server computing system 120 may obtain data that includes a collection of pictures, such as, for example, street level pictures that are collected periodically. Image content analysis engine 132 may be tasked with periodically processing the obtained picture data to identify semantic elements that reference features and/or attributes of the physical landscape, for example, associated with one or more human activities and catalogued in a vocabulary of feature/attribute types as described herein. For example, the feature/attribute type may be associated with or indicative of a physical object and/or physical landscape, such as a structure, infrastructure, building, object, etc., within the picture. For example, features/attributes may include "casino", "park", "alley", "route", "boutique", "loading bay", "parking meter", "bench", "fountain", "regulation", "artwork", "tree", "bush", and the like. In some implementations, the data indicative of features within the picture may include one or more feature vectors indicative of one or more aspects of the identified features.
According to one aspect of the disclosure, the server computing system 120 may include a geographic semantic index 134. The geo-semantic index 134 may include a geographical index of locations that includes rich semantic context information for each location that is built and maintained based on image content analysis provided, for example, by the image content analysis engine 132. As examples, the geo-semantic index may include, for each location unit, data indicative of one or more features/attributes identified in a picture associated with the location unit (e.g., benches, paths, fountains, murals, parking meters, fairgrounds, etc.), data related to the collection time(s) (e.g., timestamps, etc.) of the analyzed image having the identified features/attributes, one or more activity scores for user activities associated with and/or accommodated by the identified features/attributes in the location unit, one or more textual descriptions based on the features/attributes and/or activities associated with the location unit, and/or the like.
For example, the obtained pictures associated with the location elements in the geo-semantic index may be processed by an image content analysis system (e.g., image content analysis engine 132) to identify one or more features (e.g., fairground, bench, fountain, parking meter, tree, path, etc.) in the image that are included within a feature vocabulary associated with the geo-semantic index. One or more features associated with a location unit identified within the map may be matched (e.g., using a feature vocabulary associated with a geographic semantic index) with one or more user activities associated with and/or accommodated by the feature. For example, one or more activity scores may be generated for each location unit based on the type of identified features, the number of identified features, the variety of identified features, the recency of the identified features (e.g., the time since the picture including the feature was collected), and/or the like, corresponding to the activity associated with the location unit.
The geographic semantic index 134 may be used to identify locations within a certain geographic area that may accommodate desired user activities (e.g., based on data obtained from the user computing device 102 associated with the search query, etc.). The server computing device 120 can provide, for example, the identified location data to the user computing device 102 as part of the query result recommendation (e.g., mapped location, list of locations, etc.).
The server computing system 120 may also include one or more communication/network interfaces for communicating with one or more systems or devices, including systems or devices located remotely from the server computing system 120 (e.g., such as the user computing device 102). The server computing system 120 may also include one or more input/output interfaces.
Example Picture
FIG. 2 depicts an example street level image 200 with features identified using an image content analysis system according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in fig. 2, street level images 200 may be obtained as part of a picture corpus, and the street level images 200 are processed by an image content analysis system (e.g., image content analysis engine 132 of fig. 1) to identify one or more features and/or attributes within the images 200. In particular, the image content analysis system may identify various features within the image 200 to facilitate creation and/or updating of a geographic semantic index as described herein. The image 200 may be associated with a location unit within the geographic semantic index and the identified features/attributes may be used to periodically update data associated with the location unit within the geographic semantic index. In some implementations, the image content analysis system can identify features within the image 200 and a confidence indicating the presence of the identified features, such as windows, doors, trees, vegetation, etc., as shown in fig. 2 (e.g., "window 1.00", "door 0.93", "tree 0.97", etc.). The identified features/attributes may be compared to a vocabulary of features/attributes associated with the geographic semantic index (e.g., feature/attribute types associated with user activity types maintained within the geographic semantic index), and the identified features/attributes may be used to facilitate updating of the geographic semantic index (e.g., generating/updating data associated with location cells, generating/updating activity scores for location cells associated with the image 200, etc.).
For example, the obtained picture (e.g., image 200) may be processed by an image content analysis system to identify one or more features/attributes located within the picture that are associated with a geo-semantically indexed vocabulary (e.g., a vocabulary that associates features/attributes with an activity to which the features/attributes are adapted). The one or more features/attributes identified within the picture may be matched to one or more user activities associated with and/or accommodated by the feature, for example using a vocabulary associated with the geographic semantic index. One or more activity scores may be generated for each location unit in the geo-semantic index, e.g., based on the type of identified features corresponding to the activity associated with the location unit, the number of identified features, the variety of identified features, the recency of the identified features (e.g., the time since the picture including the feature was collected), etc.
Fig. 3A and 3B depict example street level pictures according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in fig. 3A, street level images 300A may be obtained as part of a picture corpus, and the street level images 300A may be processed by an image content analysis system (e.g., image content analysis engine 132 of fig. 1) to identify features and/or attributes, as shown in image 300B of fig. 3B. In particular, the image content analysis system may identify various features/attributes within the images 300A/300B, such as identifying that the images are associated with attributes of a public space, such as a park, that the images contain features, such as water features, fountains, vegetation, and so forth. The identified features/attributes may be associated with a vocabulary of the geographic semantic index (e.g., a vocabulary that associates features/attributes with activities to which the features/attributes are adapted). The images 300A/300B may be associated with location units within the geo-semantic index, and the identified features/attributes may be used to generate and/or update data associated with the location units within the geo-semantic index (e.g., generate/update feature data associated with the location units, generate/update activity scores for the location units associated with the images, etc.).
Fig. 6A and 6B depict example street level pictures according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in fig. 6A, street level images 600A may be obtained as part of an image corpus, and the street level images 600A may be processed by an image content analysis system (e.g., image content analysis engine 132 of fig. 1) to identify features and/or attributes, as shown in image 600B of fig. 6B. In particular, the image content analysis system may identify various features within the images 600A/600B, such as identifying that the images are associated with attributes of a public space and/or a casino, the identifying images containing features identified as casino devices, fences, and the like. The images 600A/600B may be associated with location units within the geo-semantic index, and the identified features/attributes may be used to generate and/or update data associated with the location units within the geo-semantic index (e.g., generate/update activity scores for the location units associated with the images, etc.).
Example method
Fig. 4 depicts a flowchart of an example method 400 of providing search recommendations based on geographic semantic indices, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Although fig. 4 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the particular illustrated order or arrangement. The various steps of the method 400 may be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adjusted in various ways without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The method 400 may be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in fig. 1.
At 402, the method 400 may include obtaining, for example, by a computing device, such as the server computing system 120 of fig. 1, a vocabulary of feature types (e.g., a vocabulary associating features/attributes identified in a picture with activity types to which the features/attributes may be adapted). In particular, the computing device may facilitate cataloguing classification of, for example, a vocabulary of known feature and/or attribute types from an image content analysis dictionary or the like, and one or more types of user activity to which the feature and/or attribute types may be adapted. For example, a vocabulary of feature/attribute types may include "benches" for reading; "alleys" for walking; a "loading area" or "parking meter" for passengers to get on or off the vehicle; a "statue", "fountain" or "boutique" for a party; and the like. The feature/attribute vocabulary may have a many-to-many relationship between activity and feature/attribute terms.
At 404, the method 400 may include obtaining, by a computing device, a corpus of periodically collected pictures (such as street level pictures, aerial pictures, etc.). For example, the computing device may periodically obtain a set of pictures, e.g., from a continuously updated corpus of pictures, publicly available pictures, user-generated pictures, and so forth.
At 406, the method 400 may include performing, by the computing device, image content analysis on the collection of pictures based at least in part on the vocabulary of feature types. For example, the computing device may perform image content analysis on the obtained pictures to identify feature/attribute type terms from the generated vocabulary (e.g., identify semantic elements referencing features and/or attributes of the physical landscape associated with the user activity). In some implementations, for example, the image content analysis can include identifying one or more features/attributes within images included in the collection of pictures using one or more machine learning models.
As an example, the obtained picture may be processed by an image content analysis system to identify one or more features/attributes located within the picture that are associated with a geo-semantically indexed vocabulary (e.g., a vocabulary that associates features/attributes with activities to which the features/attributes are adapted). The one or more features/attributes identified within the picture may be matched to one or more user activities associated with and/or accommodated by the feature, for example using a vocabulary associated with the geographic semantic index.
At 408, the method 400 may include populating and/or updating, by the computing device, the geographic semantic index of the location unit based on the image content analysis of the collection of pictures. In particular, images within a collection of pictures may be identified with specific location units mapped to a geographic area. Based on features/attributes identified via image content analysis for pictures associated with the location cell, the computing device may populate and/or update a geographic semantic index of the location cell based in part on a vocabulary of feature types. For example, the geographic semantic index may be populated based on data associated with: a type of feature/attribute associated with each location unit, a type of activity associated with the feature/attribute in each location unit, and the like. In some implementations, the geo-semantic index can also include data related to the collection time of pictures with identified features/attributes. In some implementations, image content analysis and/or population of the geographic semantic index can include filtering out certain image data, such as features/attributes identified in private and/or restricted areas.
At 410, the method 400 may include generating, by the computing device, one or more activity scores (e.g., associated with each activity for which the features/attributes identified in the location unit are adaptable) for each location unit. In particular, the computing device may generate one or more weighted activity scores for each location unit (e.g., for each activity supported by the vocabulary) based at least in part on the number, diversity, and/or recency of the feature/attribute types corresponding to the activities associated with the location unit.
In some implementations, the activity score can be generated based on one or more metric definitions provided by a client application associated with the activity. For example, in some embodiments, some activities in the geographic semantic index and/or vocabulary may be defined based only on the requirements of the particular user application that defines the activities and metrics for the activity scores. In some implementations, the activity score can differ based on the type of activity, the type of application, and so on, e.g., based on elements that may be important or necessary to the activity.
As an example, in some embodiments, the geo-semantic index may include, for each location unit, data indicative of one or more features/attributes identified in a picture associated with the location unit (e.g., benches, paths, fountains, murals, parking meters, fairgrounds, etc.), data related to the collection time(s) (e.g., timestamps, etc.) of the analyzed image having the identified features/attributes, one or more activity scores for user activities associated with and/or accommodated by the identified features/attributes in the location unit, one or more textual descriptions based on the features/attributes and/or activities associated with the location unit, and/or the like.
At 412, the method 400 may include providing, by the computing device, a geographic semantic index for generating map recommendations, e.g., in response to a user query received from the user computing device regarding a desired activity, etc.
For example, a computing device may obtain queries from a user regarding nearby locations that may be tailored to particular user activities. The computing device may analyze the geo-semantic index to identify one or more high scoring location units nearby (e.g., within a fixed radius of a search area indicated by the user, around the user's current location, etc.) and provide data associated with one or more of those locations that match the desired activity as search suggestions.
According to aspects of the present disclosure, image content analysis and updating of the geo-semantic index may be performed iteratively based on a periodic set of new pictures.
Fig. 5 depicts a flowchart of an example method 500 of providing search recommendations based on geographic semantic indices, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Although fig. 5 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the particular illustrated order or arrangement. The various steps of the method 500 may be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adjusted in various ways without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The method 500 may be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in fig. 1.
At 502, the method 500 may include generating, by a server computing device, a vocabulary of feature types. For example, the server computing device may facilitate building a vocabulary of known feature and/or attribute types, e.g., from an image content analysis dictionary or the like, and one or more types of user activity to which the feature and/or attribute types may be adapted. For example, the vocabulary of feature types may include "benches" for reading; a "lane" for walking, a "loading area" or a "parking meter" for passengers boarding or parking; a "statue", "fountain" or "boutique" for a party; and the like. The feature/attribute vocabulary may have a many-to-many relationship between activity and feature/attribute terms.
At 504, the method 500 may include obtaining, by a server computing device, a corpus of pictures (such as street-level pictures, aerial pictures, etc.). For example, the computing device may periodically obtain the set of pictures, e.g., from a continuously updated corpus of pictures, publicly available pictures, user-generated pictures, and so forth.
At 506, the method 500 may include performing, by the server computing device, image content analysis on the picture corpus based at least in part on the vocabulary of feature types. For example, the server computing device may perform image content analysis on the obtained pictures to identify feature/attribute type terms from the generated vocabulary (e.g., identify semantic elements referencing features and/or attributes of the physical landscape associated with the user activity). For example, the server computing device may determine whether a corresponding picture for each of a plurality of location units of the geo-semantic index includes a feature/attribute type from a vocabulary.
At 508, the method 500 may include generating and/or updating, by the server computing device, a geo-semantic index of location units based on image content analysis of images within the collection of pictures. In particular, images within a collection of pictures may be identified with specific location units mapped to a geographic area. Based on the features/attributes identified via image content analysis for each image associated with a location cell, the server computing device may populate and/or update the geographic semantic index of the location cell based in part on the vocabulary of feature types. The server computing device may also generate/update one or more activity scores for each location unit of the geographic semantic index (e.g., associated with each activity for which the features/attributes identified in the location unit are adaptable).
At 510, method 500 may include a user computing device obtaining data associated with a query (e.g., from a user, an application, etc.) regarding a nearby location that may be tailored to a particular user activity. For example, a user may submit a search query on the user computing device, such as "find a place where i can take a walk and enjoy some shade". At 512, the method 500 may include the user computing device providing data associated with the query to the server computing device.
At 514, the method 500 may include the server computing device analyzing the geo-semantic index to determine one or more locations that may match the desired user activity. For example, the server computing device may analyze the geographic semantic index to identify one or more location units that are nearby (e.g., within a fixed radius of a search area indicated by the user, around the user's current location, etc.). At 516, method 500 may include the server computing device selecting one or more locations from the identified location units. For example, the server computing device may select one or more location units from the identified location units having activity scores associated with the desired activity above a certain threshold score (e.g., a certain number of location units from the identified units having a highest activity score for the desired activity).
For example, the server computing device may filter query submissions against any known active words associated with the vocabulary. For example, the server computing device may recognize "walking" and "enjoying a cool and shady" as active terms in the vocabulary. The server computing device may analyze the index to identify one or more location units based on image content analysis of the picture that have a high match for these activities based on the presence of certain vocabulary terms associated with these units. Thus, an identified unit location may have terms such as "alley," "tree," "sidewalk," "stone path," and/or other similar terms among its descriptive characteristic terms. The computing system may select one or more of the identified locations, for example, based in part on the activity scores associated with the identified location units.
At 518, the method 500 may include the server computing device providing data associated with the one or more recommended locations to the user computing device. For example, the server computing device may provide data indicating a map of the selected location, a list of the selected locations, and so on. In some implementations, for each location, the server computing system may generate a textual description based on features/attributes and/or activities associated with the location. For example, in some implementations, such descriptions may be generated based on the application of natural language processing, may be curated by a human operator, and so on. These location descriptions may be provided to the user as part of a location recommendation to assist the user in selecting and/or finding a desired location.
At 520, the method 500 may include the user computing device receiving recommendation data from the server computing device and providing the recommendation data to the user.
