- event process 10 may determine (via, e.g., a social networking application) that a user listens to digital recordings of live concerts (e.g., media content). Event process 10 may use this user characteristic to determine one or more result events such as event 208 (e.g., “Concert”).
- event 208 e.g., “Concert”.
- information associated with the one or more events may be based upon, at least in part, an event that a user previously attended (or, e.g., a similar previously attended event), or an event associated with a connection of a user.
- An event associated with a connection of a user may be, for example, an event that a connection of the user previously attended, an event for which a connection of the user indicated an intent to attend, an event hosted by a connection of the user, and/or an event associated with an organization that the user is connected to.
- event process 10 may determine that a user has previously attended camping trips. Event process 10 may use this event information to determine one or more result events such as event 216 (e.g., “Camping”). Event process 10 may further determine that multiple connections of the user are having a dinner event. Event process 10 may use this event information to determine one or more result events such as event 218 (e.g., “Dinner”). Event process 10 may determine the event that the user previously attended and/or the event associated with a connection of the user based upon, at least in part, the index (e.g., index 222 ) associated with the event (e.g., event 216 ).
- the index e.g., index 222
- event process 10 may determine that score 226 for event 216 is “89”, that score 228 for event 206 is “76”, and that score 230 for event 212 is “73”.
- scores 226 , 228 , and/or 230 may be calculated by event process 10 using one or more equations and/or weights. In this way, event process 10 may provide a user-centric set of result events based upon information specific to each user.
- event process 10 may determine one or more result events based upon, at least in part, a location of a client computing device associated with a user, a scheduled location of an event, events that relate to the user's interests, events that are similar to events that the user attended previously, events that friends/connections of the user are attending or have attended before, events hosted by friends/connections, events created by organizations associated with web pages or brands that the user follows, events that users with similar interests are attending, and events that relate to the user's online activities, (e.g., videos watched by the user or emails the user received).
- Event process 10 may also rank 110 (or, e.g., determine a rank for) the one or more result events (e.g., result events 306 ).
- the rank may be based upon, at least in part, the index (e.g., index 222 ) associated with the event (e.g., event 216 ).
- the ranked one or more result events (e.g., result events 216 , 206 , and 212 ) may be based upon, at least in part, the indication (e.g., IP address or location-based information) of the location of the client computing device.
- the ranked one or more result events may be based upon, at least in part, a nearness to the location of the client computing device.
- the ranked one or more result events may also be ranked based upon, at least in part, the score (e.g., scores 226 , 228 , and 230 ) for each event (e.g., result events 216 , 206 , and 212 ).
- event process 10 may use signals (e.g., user information or characteristics or event information) from an event index to inform the determination of result events.
- signals e.g., user information or characteristics or event information
- event process 10 may score each or some of the events (e.g., events 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , 214 , 216 , 218 , and/or 220 ).
- the score for each event which may be based upon a location of the a client computing device associated with a user, information associated with the user, and the information associated with the one or more events, may be used to determine the one or more result events initially, and may also be used to rank the one or more result events.
- event process 10 may rank the result events without determining a score for each event. For example, event process 10 may rank the result events based upon one or more assigned weights, user inputs, or other criteria.
- Event process 10 may additionally provide 112 the ranked one or more result events (e.g., result events 216 , 206 , and 212 ).
- event process 10 may provide the ranked one or more result events (e.g., result events 216 , 206 , and 212 ) such that they are available and or viewable to the user via GUI 300 .
- the ranked one or more result events (e.g., result events 216 , 206 , and 212 ) may be provided in order of the highest ranked (e.g., shown first) to the lowest ranked (e.g., shown last). For example, in an embodiment where ranking the result events is based on scoring the result events, the result event with the highest score may appear first, and the result event with the lowest score may appear last.
- event process 10 may also determine and/or provide the one or more result events as suggestions.
- the one or more result events determined and/or provided as suggestions may be determined and/or provided without receiving a search request.
- event process 10 may use one or more of the techniques and features described herein to periodically determine the one or more result events as suggestions for the user.
- event process 10 may determine, score, rank, and/or provide suggested result events 308 .
- Event process 10 may determine a user-centric score for each or many of the one or more events (e.g., events 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , 214 , 216 , 218 , and/or 220 ) and may provide the event or events with the highest scores to the user as suggested result events.
- event process 10 may provide event 216 as a suggested result event. While event 216 is the only suggested result event 308 shown in FIG. 4 , this is not intended to be a limitation of the present disclosure, as multiple suggested result events may be determined, scored, ranked, and/or provided to the user via GUI 300 using one or more of the techniques and features described herein.
- result events may be provided via GUI 300 , this is not intended to be a limitation of the present disclosure.
- the result events may be provided to a user by mail, text message, or push notification.
- event process 10 may update 114 the index (e.g., index 222 ) associated with the event (e.g., event 216 ) based upon, at least in part, receiving an indication that event content (e.g., event content 224 ) associated with the event (e.g., event 216 ) has changed. For example, as one or more users may indicate an intention to attend or not to attend an event, or as other event content is edited or changed via, e.g., GUI 300 , event content 224 may change. Changes to event content 224 may be updated in index 222 .
- changes to event content 224 updated in index 222 may be used by event process 10 to determine, score, rank, and/or provide result events and event process 10 may update result events for a user based on such changes. For example, if user 40 indicates that he/she will no longer attend the event, or if a sponsoring organization (e.g., “Tents, Inc.”) indicates that they will no longer sponsor the event, this may impact the user-centric result event set provided to the user and/or may change the score or rank of the event.
- a sponsoring organization e.g., “Tents, Inc.”
- event process 10 may receive a feed associated with the one or more events (e.g., events 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , 214 , 216 , 218 , and/or 220 ).
- the feed may indicate when event content (e.g., event content 224 ) has changed and/or when an index (e.g., index 222 ) has been updated.
- event process 10 may determine, score, rank, and/or provide updated result events based on such changes.
- event process 10 may update the location of the client computing device based upon, at least in part, another received indication of the location of the client computing device. For example, assume for illustrative purposes that event process 10 determines that client electronic device 32 associated with user 40 is located in Manchester, N.H. Event process 10 may determine, score, rank, and/or provide one or more result events to user 40 based upon, at least in part, the Manchester, N.H. location. Further, assume for illustrative purposes that user 40 drives to Boston, Mass.
- Event process 10 may update the location of client electronic device 32 associated with user 40 if it receives another indication (e.g., location-based information or GPS information) from client electronic device 32 of the location of client electronic device 32 and determines the new location (e.g., Boston, Mass.).
- another indication e.g., location-based information or GPS information
- event process 10 may again determine, score, rank, and/or provide one or more result events to user 40 based upon, at least in part, the Boston, Mass. location using one or more of the techniques or features described in the present disclosure. For example, event process 10 may update the scoring of the one or more result events (e.g., result events 216 , 206 , and 212 ) based upon, at least in part, the other received indication (e.g., location-based information or GPS information) of the location (e.g., Boston, Mass.) of the client computing device (e.g., client electronic device 32 associated with user 40 ).
- the other received indication e.g., location-based information or GPS information
- event process 10 may update the ranking of the one or more result events (e.g., result events 216 , 206 , and 212 ) based upon, at least in part, the other received indication (e.g., location-based information or GPS information) of the location (e.g., Boston, Mass.) of the client computing device (e.g., client electronic device 32 associated with user 40 ).
- the other received indication e.g., location-based information or GPS information
- the user may selectively decide whether to allow the feature to determine the information, or may selectively decide to prevent the feature from determining the information.
- the user may selectively decide to allow the feature to determine the information, or may selectively decide to prevent the feature from determining the information.

Description
- This disclosure relates to event management and, more particularly, to an event process.
- A user may use an event application to manage events. The event application may allow the user to invite others to an event. The event application may also allow the user to receive an invitation to another event. The user may have attended events in the past and may be interested in attending future events. Further, connections (e.g., friends) of the user on a social network may have attended events in the past and may attend events in the future.
- In an embodiment, a method may include, in an event management application associated with a social networking application, receiving, at a computing device, a search request for an event to attend. The method may also include, in response to receiving the search request, determining, at the computing device, one or more result events of one or more events to recommend to a user based upon, at least in part, one or more of information associated with the search, information associated with the user, information associated with the one or more events, and a location of a client computing device associated with a user. The location of the client computing device may be based upon, at least in part, a received indication of the location of the client computing device. The method may also include ranking, at the computing device, the one or more result events based upon, at least in part, one or more of the information associated with the search, the information associated with the user, the information associated with the one or more events, and the location. The information associated with the user may be based upon, at least in part, at least one of: a user interest, an online activity associated with the user, and media content associated with the user. The information associated with the one or more events may be based upon, at least in part, at least one of: an event that the user previously attended, and an event associated with a connection of the user. The method may further include providing, from, at least in part, the computing device, the ranked one or more result events.
- In another embodiment, a method may include determining one or more result events to recommend to attend based upon, at least in part, at least one of: an indication of a location of a client computing device associated with a user, and an index associated with the event. The index may be based upon, at least in part, event content associated with the event. The method may also include ranking the one or more result events based upon, at least in part, at least one of: the index associated with the event and the indication of the location. The method may further include providing, from a computing device, the ranked one or more result events.
- One or more of the following features may be included. Updating the index associated with the event may be based upon, at least in part, receiving an indication that event content associated with the event has changed. Determining the one or more result events may be further based upon, at least in part, a user characteristic. The one or more result events may be provided in response, at least in part, to receiving a search request. The one or more result events may be provided as one or more suggestions without receiving a search request. The event content may include, at least in part, at least one of: event information including an invitee, an attendee, an event category, an event host, and an event organization. Determining the one or more result events may be further based upon, at least in part, at least one of: an event that a user previously attended, and an event associated with a connection of a user.
- The method may also include determining the location of the client computing device based upon, at least in part, the received indication of the location of the client computing device. Determining the location of the client computing device may b e based upon, at least in part, one or more of an IP address associated with the client computing device, location-based information associated with the client computing device, and a location received via a search request.
- The one or more result events may be ranked based upon, at least in part a nearness to the location of the client computing device. Updating the location of the client computing device may be based upon, at least in part, another received indication of the location of the client computing device. Updating the ranking of the one or more result events may be based upon, at least in part, the other received indication of the location of the client computing device.
- In another embodiment, a computing system may include one or more processors. The one or more processors may be configured to determine one or more result events of one or more events to recommend to attend based upon, at least in part, one or more of information associated with a user and information associated with the one or more events. The one or more processors may also be configured to determine a score for the one or more result events based upon, at least in part, one or more of the information associated with the user and the information associated with the one or more events. The one or more processors may also be configured to determine a rank of the one or more result events based upon, at least in part, the score determined for the one or more result events. The one or more processors may further be configured to provide, from, at least in part, a computing device, the ranked one or more result events.
- One or more of the following features may be included. The one or more processors may be further configured to create an index associated with an event based upon, at least in part, information associated with the event. The one or more processors may also be configured to update the index associated with the event based upon, at least in part, receiving an indication that the information associated with event has changed. The one or more result events may be provided in response, at least in part, to receiving a search request. The one or more result events may be provided as one or more suggestions without receiving a search request.
- The information associated with the one or more events may include, at least in part, at least one of: event content, event information including an invitee, an attendee, an event category, an event host, and an event organization. The information associated with the user may be based upon, at least in part, at least one of: a user characteristic, a user interest, an online activity associated with the user, media content associated with the user, and a location of a client computing device associated with the user. The one or more processors may be further configured to determine the location of the client computing device associated with the user based upon, at least in part, a received indication of the location of the client computing device.
- Determining the location of the client computing device may be based upon, at least in part, one or more of an IP address associated with the client computing device, a location-based information associated with the client computing device, and a location received via a search request. The one or more result events may be scored based upon, at least in part, a nearness to the location of the client computing device. The one or more processors may be further configured to update the location of the client computing device based upon, at least in part, another received indication of the location of the client computing device. The one or more processors may also be configured to update the scoring of the one or more result events based upon, at least in part, the other received indication of the location of the client computing device.
- Determining the one or more result events may be further based upon, at least in part, at least one of: an event that the user previously attended, and an event associated with a connection of the user. The event associated with the connection of the user may be based upon, at least in part, at least one of: an event that a connection of the user previously attended, an event for which a connection of the user indicated an intent to attend, an event hosted by a connection of the user, and an event associated with an organization that the user is connected to. The one or more processors may be further configured to determine at least one of: the event that the user previously attended, and the event associated with the connection of the user based upon, at least in part, an index associated with an event.

Event content 224 may be associated with the event (e.g.,event 216 or “Camping”). Whileevent 216,index 222, and event content 224 will be discussed herein for example purposes only,event process 10 may create a plurality of indexes for a plurality of events (e.g.,events - As shown in
FIG. 3 , event content 224 ofindex 222 associated with event 216 (e.g., “Camping’) may be event information and may include, for example, an invitee of the event (e.g.,user 38 and/or user 40), and an attendee of the event (e.g., user 40). Event content 224 may further include a category of the event (e.g., “Outdoors”), a host of the event (e.g., user 36), an organization associated with the event (e.g., “Tents, Inc.”), and a location of the event (e.g., Forrest, N.H.). An attendee of the event may be a user that indicated he/she will attend the event or that has attended a past event. - In an embodiment,
index 222 or an index associated with, e.g.,events event process 10.Event process 10 may access, e.g.,index 222 via the database and may add event content toindex 222 or may retrieve event content fromindex 222 via the database. - Referring now also to
FIG. 4 , graphical user interface (GUI) 300 may be associated withevent process 10 and/or the event management application and/or the social networking application.GUI 300 may allow a user to create events, view events, search for events, and/or receive suggested events to attend (e.g., suggested by event process 10).GUI 300 may allow the user to view upcoming events that the user has been invited to (e.g., upcoming events 310) and past events that the user has attended (e.g., past events 312). - In an example, a user may enter a search query (e.g., search query 304) in a search field (e.g., search field 302).
Event process 10 may receivesearch query 304 and may processsearch query 304 to provide one or more search results. The search results (e.g., result events 306) may be viewed by the user viaGUI 300. - In an embodiment,
event process 10 may receive 102 an indication of a location of a client computing device (e.g. one or more of clientelectronic devices users - Further,
event process 10 may determine 104 a location of the client computing device (e.g. one or more of clientelectronic devices users event process 10 may use a received IP address, location-based information, or a text description associated with the location of the client computing device to determine the location of the client computing device. -
Event process 10 may determine 106 one or more result events (e.g., result events 306) of the one or more events (e.g.,events example event process 10 may receive query 304 (e.g., “Outdoors”) via, e.g.,GUI 300, and may search or parseindex 222 or an index associated with, e.g.,events Event process 10 may determine thatindex 222 ofevent 216 includes content related to “Outdoors” and may determine thatevent 216 is a result event. Further,event process 10 may determine that an index associated with event 206 (e.g., “Barbeque”) includes content related to “Outdoors” and may determine thatevent 206 is a result event. Additionally,event process 10 may determine that an index associated with event 212 (e.g., “Birthday Party”) includes content related to “Outdoors” and may determine thatevent 212 is a result event. - Furthermore, in an embodiment,
event process 10 may determine 108 a score (e.g., scores 226, 228, and/or 230) for the one or more result events (e.g., resultevents 306 or e.g., resultevents event process 10 may determine that the user is a friend or online connection ofuser 38 and/oruser 40, both of whom may be invitees or attendees ofevent 216. This information (e.g., a user characteristic) associated with the user may be used, at least in part, byevent process 10 to determine a score for the result event. - In an embodiment, the score (e.g., scores 226, 228, and/or 230) may be based upon, at least in part, the location of the client computing device (e.g. one or more of client
electronic devices users - For example, and referring also to
FIG. 4 , assume for illustrative purposes thatevent process 10 determines that the client computing device associated with the user is located in Manchester, N.H. Further, assume for illustrative purposes thatevent process 10 determines (via, e.g., one or more event indexes) that event 216 (e.g., “Camping”) is scheduled take place in Forrest, N.H., that event 206 (e.g., “Barbeque”) is scheduled to take place in Salem, Mass., and that event 212 (e.g., “Birthday Party”) is scheduled to take place in New York, N.Y.Event process 10 may determine score 226 forevent 216 as the highest score (e.g., “89”), since Forrest, N.H. may be the nearest location to the client computing device (e.g., located in Manchester, N.H.) associated with the user, of the result events (e.g.,events event process 10 may determine score 228 forevent 206 as the second highest score (e.g., “76”), since Salem, Mass. may be the second nearest location to the client computing device (e.g., located in Manchester, N.H.) associated with the user, of the result events (e.g.,events event process 10 may determine score 230 forevent 212 as the third highest score (e.g., “73”), since New York, N.Y. may be the third nearest location to the client computing device (e.g., located in Manchester, N.H.) associated with the user, of the result events (e.g.,events -
Event process 10 may also determine that the category “Outdoors” ofevent 216matches search query 304. This information associated withevent 216 may be used, at least in part, byevent process 10 to determine a score for the result event.Event process 10 may further determine that the host (e.g., user 36) ofevent 216 is a friend or online connection of the user. This information associated with the user may be used, at least in part, byevent process 10 to determine a score for the result event. Moreover,event process 10 may determine that the organization (e.g., “Tents, Inc.”) associated with or sponsoringevent 216 may be followed by the user online or may otherwise be a friend or online connection of the user. This information associated withevent 216 may be used, at least in part, byevent process 10 to determine a score for the result event. - In an embodiment, the information associated with the user or the user characteristic may be based upon, at least in part, a user interest, an online activity associated with the user, and media content associated with the user. For example,
event process 10 may determine (via, e.g., a social networking application) that a user is interested in barbequing.Event process 10 may use this user characteristic to determine one or more result events such as event 206 (e.g., “Barbeque”). Further,event process 10 may determine (via, e.g., a social networking application) that a user plays fantasy football in an online fantasy football league (e.g., an online activity).Event process 10 may use this user characteristic to determine one or more result events such as event 210 (e.g., “Football”). Additionally,event process 10 may determine (via, e.g., a social networking application) that a user listens to digital recordings of live concerts (e.g., media content).Event process 10 may use this user characteristic to determine one or more result events such as event 208 (e.g., “Concert”). - In an embodiment, information associated with the one or more events may be based upon, at least in part, an event that a user previously attended (or, e.g., a similar previously attended event), or an event associated with a connection of a user. An event associated with a connection of a user may be, for example, an event that a connection of the user previously attended, an event for which a connection of the user indicated an intent to attend, an event hosted by a connection of the user, and/or an event associated with an organization that the user is connected to.
- For example,
event process 10 may determine that a user has previously attended camping trips.Event process 10 may use this event information to determine one or more result events such as event 216 (e.g., “Camping”).Event process 10 may further determine that multiple connections of the user are having a dinner event.Event process 10 may use this event information to determine one or more result events such as event 218 (e.g., “Dinner”).Event process 10 may determine the event that the user previously attended and/or the event associated with a connection of the user based upon, at least in part, the index (e.g., index 222) associated with the event (e.g., event 216). - In an embodiment, based upon, at least in part, the information associated with the user and the information associated with the one or more events,
event process 10 may determine that score 226 forevent 216 is “89”, that score 228 forevent 206 is “76”, and thatscore 230 forevent 212 is “73”. In an embodiment, scores 226, 228, and/or 230 may be calculated byevent process 10 using one or more equations and/or weights. In this way,event process 10 may provide a user-centric set of result events based upon information specific to each user. Further, in this way,event process 10 may determine one or more result events based upon, at least in part, a location of a client computing device associated with a user, a scheduled location of an event, events that relate to the user's interests, events that are similar to events that the user attended previously, events that friends/connections of the user are attending or have attended before, events hosted by friends/connections, events created by organizations associated with web pages or brands that the user follows, events that users with similar interests are attending, and events that relate to the user's online activities, (e.g., videos watched by the user or emails the user received). -
Event process 10 may also rank 110 (or, e.g., determine a rank for) the one or more result events (e.g., result events 306). The rank may be based upon, at least in part, the index (e.g., index 222) associated with the event (e.g., event 216). The ranked one or more result events (e.g., resultevents events events events - For example, since
event 216 was scored highest (e.g., “89”),event 216 may be the highest ranked event. Sinceevent 206 was scored second highest (e.g., 76),event 206 may be ranked second highest. Sinceevent 212 was scored third highest (e.g., 73),event 212 may be ranked third highest. In this way,event process 10 may use signals (e.g., user information or characteristics or event information) from an event index to inform the determination of result events. - In an embodiment,
event process 10 may score each or some of the events (e.g.,events event process 10 may rank the result events without determining a score for each event. For example,event process 10 may rank the result events based upon one or more assigned weights, user inputs, or other criteria. -
Event process 10 may additionally provide 112 the ranked one or more result events (e.g., resultevents event process 10 may provide the ranked one or more result events (e.g., resultevents GUI 300. The ranked one or more result events (e.g., resultevents - While the one or more result events may be determined and/or provided in response to receiving a search request from, e.g., a client computing device associated with a user,
event process 10 may also determine and/or provide the one or more result events as suggestions. The one or more result events determined and/or provided as suggestions may be determined and/or provided without receiving a search request. In an embodiment,event process 10 may use one or more of the techniques and features described herein to periodically determine the one or more result events as suggestions for the user. - For example,
event process 10 may determine, score, rank, and/or provide suggestedresult events 308.Event process 10 may determine a user-centric score for each or many of the one or more events (e.g.,events event 216 received the highest score (e.g., user-centric score) of the result events for the user,event process 10 may provideevent 216 as a suggested result event. Whileevent 216 is the only suggestedresult event 308 shown inFIG. 4 , this is not intended to be a limitation of the present disclosure, as multiple suggested result events may be determined, scored, ranked, and/or provided to the user viaGUI 300 using one or more of the techniques and features described herein. - While the result events (e.g., searched for or suggested) may be provided via
GUI 300, this is not intended to be a limitation of the present disclosure. For example, the result events may be provided to a user by mail, text message, or push notification. - In an embodiment,
event process 10 may update 114 the index (e.g., index 222) associated with the event (e.g., event 216) based upon, at least in part, receiving an indication that event content (e.g., event content 224) associated with the event (e.g., event 216) has changed. For example, as one or more users may indicate an intention to attend or not to attend an event, or as other event content is edited or changed via, e.g.,GUI 300, event content 224 may change. Changes to event content 224 may be updated inindex 222. - Further, changes to event content 224 updated in
index 222 may be used byevent process 10 to determine, score, rank, and/or provide result events andevent process 10 may update result events for a user based on such changes. For example, ifuser 40 indicates that he/she will no longer attend the event, or if a sponsoring organization (e.g., “Tents, Inc.”) indicates that they will no longer sponsor the event, this may impact the user-centric result event set provided to the user and/or may change the score or rank of the event. - In an embodiment,
event process 10 may receive a feed associated with the one or more events (e.g.,events events events event process 10 may determine, score, rank, and/or provide updated result events based on such changes. - Further, in an embodiment,
event process 10 may update the location of the client computing device based upon, at least in part, another received indication of the location of the client computing device. For example, assume for illustrative purposes thatevent process 10 determines that clientelectronic device 32 associated withuser 40 is located in Manchester, N.H.Event process 10 may determine, score, rank, and/or provide one or more result events touser 40 based upon, at least in part, the Manchester, N.H. location. Further, assume for illustrative purposes thatuser 40 drives to Boston, Mass.Event process 10 may update the location of clientelectronic device 32 associated withuser 40 if it receives another indication (e.g., location-based information or GPS information) from clientelectronic device 32 of the location of clientelectronic device 32 and determines the new location (e.g., Boston, Mass.). - Upon updating the location,
event process 10 may again determine, score, rank, and/or provide one or more result events touser 40 based upon, at least in part, the Boston, Mass. location using one or more of the techniques or features described in the present disclosure. For example,event process 10 may update the scoring of the one or more result events (e.g., resultevents electronic device 32 associated with user 40). Further,event process 10 may update the ranking of the one or more result events (e.g., resultevents electronic device 32 associated with user 40). - It should be noted that where one or more of the techniques and features described herein are used to determine information about a user, the user may selectively decide whether to allow the feature to determine the information, or may selectively decide to prevent the feature from determining the information. For example, where one or more of the techniques and features described herein are used to determine information associated with the user's location, information associated with events that may interest the user, and information available from the user's social network, the user may selectively decide to allow the feature to determine the information, or may selectively decide to prevent the feature from determining the information.
