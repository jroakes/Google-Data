Background technology
In general, in distributed telecommunication networks, especially, (global system for mobile communications for example, GSM), the fault that is identified in the network more and more becomes more difficult to be used to provide the communication network of radio communication.In such network, when call setup, be ignorant, and under anything part about the end-to-end route of a calling, this calling may be by by several different networks that operator had or management.In addition, the quickening day by day of building along with the communications infrastructure, and along with the operability of Modern Communication System more flexible and mobilism more, just more be difficult to the managing failures tracking.Especially, be difficult to confirm the accuracy and the authority of fault message, and also be difficult to from fault message, judge the physical fault point of this problem.But,, and even so, be difficult to determine to take the identification and the enforcement of suitable remedial action at present in any case the remote identification fault seldom provides the true cause of such fault.
Like this, just need can improve the ability that fault is followed the tracks of and discerned under network environment, this is particular importance in distributed telecommunication networks.The special network element that operation and administrative center (OMC) can be provided to manage this network, perhaps alternatively, whole network can be managed in a single center.In general, such administrative center only receives the information relevant with alarm with senior statistics, rather than receives the information about particular problem.Usually, so, when this system is analyzed in more detail, just need other data, with tracing trouble or optimize the performance of network portion.In a distributed system of expanding fast, possible this network system has been crossed over a bigger geographic area, collect data and just may need to visit physically or in logic different network elements or network node, download needed excessive data, and this process is a process that needs the time, and might compare difficulty.
For example, in a distributed radio telecommunications network,, a lot of changes on topological structure and function all can influence systematic function/operation.Usually, the content of Gai Bianing can not be simulated (for example, before optional equipment produces) with a precise analytic model like this, and has and find the needed labor of possible solution at least.In fact, be that crucial network element need be analyzed historical widely editing data usually to the performance of a cellular system, such network element influence or relate to: performance optimization; Focus detects; Handover problem and interference region; Frequency planning; With any network element or the relevant firmware of network node, software or hardware problem; With the wireless frequency coverage test.
In fact, in the operating period (especially) of a cellular system, a lot of problems relevant with this cellular system are difficult to be identified and correct, and this is in default of concrete diagnostic message.The generation reason of these problems may be this particular system structure, use or the collision pattern, software be written into or other factors in concrete aspect.In addition, OMC is used to monitor that the data of particular network parameter may be not enough to or can not be used for relevant with particular problem that relates to the user or condition.
When the needs assessment network operation, other communication network typically needs and the relevant specifying information of contact facility.
Prior art system has adopted intelligent optimization or expert advice system that the necessary performance analysis is provided.Such system concentrates, and before analyzing, needs the additional data of centralized collection enormous amount.In execution mode that this substitutes, during operation, need accumulate enough data, and these data need be forwarded to OMC at network node, carry out such analysis if desired.But the bandwidth constraints of enormous amount and the data volume of expanding fast that network produced mean that in big distributed telecommunication networks the method for such integrated data store is inappropriate.In other words, with regard to limited frequency spectrum resources with by supporting user as much as possible to make the requirement of revenus maximization in the frequency spectrum that is assigned with at this, administration overhead has become needs the problem paid close attention to day by day.
In general, independently node can compress the management data relevant with node, and acts on behalf of with a centre management independently then, and for example, an OMC communicates, and decompresses, and handles and estimates.

In another embodiment, associated data are sent to a centre management point; Then, discern the network failure of communication network and at least one in the performance by explanation to these associated data.
Like this, each node of this communication network comprises an application space, concrete program, and program element for example, applet or basic element can be downloaded to this application space.The program of concrete function will be supported in these application spaces, this function with node is relevant, for example, base station will need to move the different application from a mobile switching centre or an attaching position register, and will allow to implement to download and operation code.Selecteed data, or event driven, or the time drive or relevant with channel, test between the DPAS (for example at BSC and BTS) of applet communicating in operation.
These concrete application programs can produce by this node or by this OMC, and can be distributed to concrete network node.Alternatively or additionally, between the tectonic epochs of node or between installation period, some specific application program can be included in the function of this node.
Like this, this concrete application program can be determined the needed information of OMC, so that only Xiang Guan informational needs is sent through network.Because most of analyses may be on this node of being discussed, carry out on perhaps a plurality of nodes, so the information that is sent to OMC may be limited to the result of this analysis.
Like this, the mistake and the source of trouble in a distributed network can be determined, and do not need to finish by the OMC function of concentrating, because any node in this network can cycle tests of initialization, or local or by whole network.
These nodes comprise a local clock, are called a concentrated time reference.Can be stamped time mark by this local clock by these application program parts parameter that write down or measured.So when this information exchanged between a node and another node, when perhaps exchanging between a node and concentrated OMC, this information can be carried out the time relevant and by institute's mark and identify.Like this, just might be relevant and the result of identifying and identify incident as this, determine the performance of network.Determined network performance can further be used to determine the needs that change in this network.
An advantage of the invention is that the reliability of this network is monitored by other network element of this network, and do not need to be fixed against local defined and the self-test routine of maintenance or concentrated test process.Another advantage is this network to be tested be not limited to the test physical link, and service or content provide, service quality (Qos), and also can test other a plurality of tests.Such method is useful especially to the network of network system that wherein several operators and service or content provider provide independent network element or cooperation to provide a quilt to manage.
Another advantage of the present invention is, the control of the concrete application program of various downloads is authorized to this node or the network element of initiating this application program.The control that is authorized to is passed to next node from node, especially, and when this test application spreads in whole network.Wherein this program element is downloaded to a concrete network node, and to carry out data collection and analysis, this node may communicate with other node and obtain and confirm this information especially, but the control of authorizing is maintained on the authorization node.
Another advantage of the present invention is, by to end user device (with especially, mobile device) application space is provided, just allow new software to be downloaded to this equipment with relevant with particular problem, thus, can follow the tracks of and monitor concrete condition.On behalf of OMC, this diagnosis of application program can come preliminary treatment or initiate the fault location process.
Another advantage of the present invention is that this diagnosis of application program can use a mode of priority to follow the tracks of, and in fact forces to cause a specific fault or a condition in this network, helps the reason of identification problem.
A method of the present invention is particularly useful to the fixed network with variable service quality (QoS), and in this fixed network, the partial loss of communication capacity can cause the minimizing of function.
Execution mode is described
Fig. 1 has shown a telecommunication system 10 synoptically.A travelling carriage (MS) 12 (in each sub-district of this system, a lot of such travelling carriages being arranged) communicates with at least one base station transceiver (BTS) 16-22 that supports an overlay area by an air interface 14.Each BTS 16-22 is connected to a telephone network 24 by base station controller (BSC) 26-30 and the 32-34 of a mobile switching centre (MSC).So BTS is undertaken interconnected by MSC.So each BSC 26-30 is used for providing service by controlling one or more BTS 16-22 at least one sub-district 36-42, and each sub-district comprises one or more BTS.As everyone knows, this system uses a plurality of Microcell 44-46 that controlled by a single BSC, supports sub-district and covering and extends cell environment.Each MSC also can be connected to an OMC operation and maintenance centre (OMC) 48.This OMC can comprise a concentrated time reference, uses this time reference of concentrating, and the clock in all other nodes of this network can be by synchronously.
In combination, BSC and BTS are generally known as a base station sub-system (BSS).
With OMC 48, travelling carriage 14 and BSS (with other network equipment) are all nodes of this telecommunication system 10.
Being connected in this telephone network 24 can be a plurality of interconnected many structures communication network 50-58, comprise support broadband and territory, arrowband network (for example, broadband asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, arrowband public exchanging telephone network (PSTN) and integrated services digital network (ISDN or the like)).What in addition, be connected to this telephone network is the voice and data network 60 (for example, company's internal network) and the Internet 62 of company.
Each node of this network comprises Downloadable, a programmable application space (DPAS) 70-98, it supports one or more basic element, these basic elements can be carried out programming constructs become receive one specifically be downloaded application program after (for example, use a small routine or similar form to be sent out), carry out some different tasks.Travelling carriage in this network also can comprise DPAS, receives, and preserves and initiates concrete program and use; DPAS is carried out demonstration by the form with a microprocessor 100 and relevant memory 102.
An embodiment of the invention have a file server 106 that is connected to this telephone network 24, and this file server can be conducted interviews by an ISP by a MS.A router one 08 provides route and is provided to the interface capability of telephone network 24, and is placed between this telephone network 24 and this file server 106.Certainly, not a permanent connection, this file server 106 can periodically be connected to this telephone network 24 by a modulator-demodulator (not showing).
By the view (as shown in Figure 2) of operability, the present invention seeks from some positions, and promptly node obtains the system data of relatively low layer.The system data of this low layer, for example from the quality of user's service measure, the task of being sent to is at least one node that obtains the lower-level system data then, on a node of being correlated with, these lower-level system data of other (having similar task) node are carried out relevant with this system data from each.If being correlated with, this reflects specific unusual (with regard to an operating parameter or a time), then, be sent to a central administration point, for example an OMC or similar point about this unusual compressed summary (that is, form is the selective information of a predetermined reporting format).With in the prior art systems half a large amount of packed datas is sent to a central administration point and compares, the present invention is the related data that Trouble Report (with the therefore utilization of bandwidth) is restricted to high compression, and this high compression related data directly this system (the perhaps part of this system) performance or the optimization with tested is relevant.
In general, perhaps an alarm triggered device is responded or independently according to the basis (step 200 of Fig. 2) of a management (keeping), hypervisor or applet are sent to the system node that is identified, BTS for example, BSC, perhaps MS, in these system nodes, such application program and applet are written among 202 to the corresponding D PAS 70-96.Local processor controls function executing 204 this program or applets, this program or applet are that order this locality (" test ") node obtains and specific operating parameter or the relevant information of access path/route of being identified.Such operating parameter can be service quality tolerance (for example, under the situation of a cdma system Eb/No and/or frame deletion rate (ER), perhaps under the system of a GSM type, be bit error rate (BER) or signal strength signal intensity (RSSI)) or the tolerance of cell ID is provided, or the like.Then, the operating parameter or the access path/route that are identified are monitored, typically by a predetermined cycle.This program or applet generally also are included in a reference of other node, and other node is also obtained and specific operating parameter or the relevant information of access path/route of being identified by order similarly.In case on this node, / accumulating information, then, this program or applet impel this information to be sent to a specified node to be correlated with/to contrast (Fig. 2 206), BSC for example, this appointed node can be in identical system configuration layer.The exchange of this information also can be used a suitable safe coding form, because this information may be responsive to system/user/.
As an alternative execution mode, or the mechanism that this node is inquired finished of higher-level system entity or specified node can be used for the collection of the information on an intermediate point equally.
Now, information from several test nodes can be used by at least one node of being correlated with, this node of being correlated with seeks identification icon (Fig. 2 206) in this information, this pattern can be represented unit failure or system operation.Then, preferably, any relevant formatted 208 be a high compression, only comprise the related data report of (reflecting the incident/parameter correlation between the different test nodes), this report is sent out 210 (typically, use a coding form) to this centre management point, to assimilate.If this report should be represented a specific system failure or condition, then, this central administration point or: i) produce 212 1 alarms (mode of a response of use); Perhaps in advance, ii) send instruction and correct this fault or condition (by sending software instruction); Perhaps iii) handling 214 these faults or condition in advance re-routes the path and/or redistributes the system condition that infrastructure equipment comprises that this is popular for needing.So this system of the present invention is distributed to administration overhead (in general) lower-level system entity, and central administration point only the needs assessment high compression with relevant report data.Use this method, the lower-level system data that the structure that the present invention allows this central administration point can examine prior art systems can not be visited.In other words, the present invention can describe meticulousr granularity when evaluation system fault and operating condition, and has limited the information overhead of central administration point.In addition, thinner granularity has increased the diagnosis capability of system, and high compression makes with relevant reporting format that (that is, MiPS) requirement of ability is littler to management processing.
In essence, derive from the concrete test program that is performed at a first node one, the defined parameter of management derived with a concrete test program (test program that may be identical or a different test program) performed from another node at least, one manage defined parameter and make up.The combination of this parameter is used to produce a combination parameter of mirror operation performance or fault condition, and the performance between the tested node of the general reflection of this combination parameter is relevant, if any.
So the present invention can seek the information that has common characteristic between node.By denominator (comparing) by communication with to the selecteed data of not compressing or partly compressing from the direct extracted data of a plurality of nodes, then do not handle on an OMC and compare with the data on node independently not being carried out the differentiation compression, this method is bigger to the compression ratio of data.
May measured parameter comprise: service quality (QoS) rank or request; Business-level; Link quality metric (to providing the sub-district of service, adjacent sub-district); The air interface that substitutes; The energy of every modulation bit (Eb/No) target; Link delay; Subscriber equipment (UE) sends rank; The network route; Soft handover activates set; With the observed neighbours of UE.The network event that may be monitored/estimate may comprise: mobile fault; Wireless coverage problem concerning a given service; The mapping graph of (air interface) technology position that substitutes; Be used to be handed over to the identification of alternative technology and the identification on border; Be correlated with about the data of substitute technology and/or to these data from user's collection; Be provided with the QoS of optimum.The change that may be carried out the network of supervision comprises: decision handover (perhaps needing or do not need the agreement of system); Change to the QoS target; Change to the Eb/No target; Cancellation to specific travelling carriage; Need to install new node, for example BTS equipment; Need to substitute or repair a BTS; Need to revise or the regulating networks route; Revise neighbouring relations with needs.
In a specific execution mode, this OMC 48 downloads, and for example decides the covering of one group of neighbor cell.This MS 12 moves on its sub-district that service is provided at present, that is, BTS 18, although other BTS in MS 12 these zones of supervision is to be used for the requirement of handover.In this embodiment, several BTS are all allowing application program to decide the covering of sub-district and are determining whether carrying out effective handover.This DPAS (for example label 72) relevant with BTS 18 analyzes the measurement report that is sent by MS 12 by a period of time.Other DPAS also analyzes the report from MS 12, and this information is forwarded to DPAS 72 (when this program code is downloaded, the node that the selected conduct of this DPAS 72 is correlated with).Forwarding to information can be to carry out automatically after receiving from the request of DPAS 72.From the information of this input, DPAS 72 can extrapolate about the information of the covering in being requested the sub-district at this.Operation can be initiated by this node of being correlated with itself with the application program that this carries out the adjacent DPAS of relevant node, perhaps also can directly be initiated by for example OMC 48.
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, MS 12 may cross over sub-district or sector borders, so that this MS needs a handover routine.A BSC (being included in this process) the decision handover between BTS not according to expection and in the event, this BSC gives an interconnected management position with this problem/Trouble Report, for example, OMC 48.OMC 48 downloads to node relevant at least one DPAS related with this handover procedure with a concrete application program, and then, these nodes communicate and determine whether idle Traffic Channel or whether have another fault.Preferably, then, a DPAS carries out preliminary treatment to these data, and filtering goes out relevant data to turn back to OMC.
In another embodiment, a plurality of MS that are in activation in a specific cell have been downloaded an application-specific, and this application program was impelled in a moment specific, offset peak, produce an a large amount of call load on this sub-district.A relevant DPAS (relevant with this BSS) has been downloaded specific application software, and this application software monitors the node that this BSS gets in touch during these a large amount of load operation.This MS equipment is all given OMC with relevant data report with DPAS.
MS also may download the software of when being lost that is connected that monitors with network, and after this connection was rebulid, this software was configured to will lose then report to OMC.
(see figure 3) in one embodiment, MS 12 use a suitable link road by, by telephone network 24 described above, be connected to this file server 106.Have fault if this MS12 judges this connection, it is initiated 300 1 processes and comes to estimate the ability to work of this network by discerning a system failure reason and fault point.More specifically, this MS 12 requires this network node that it is connected to, and is its BTS18 that service is provided in this example, sets up a test pattern and sends a test pattern and confirm.If BTS (request to MS responds) will set up this test pattern, BSC 28 impels BTS18 to download and preserves (302) need be by the test code that BTS18 moved, and preferably, an affirmation is sent to this MS 12.Certainly, this process can realize from higher system's starting point (rather than MS 12), and for example this mechanism is based on infrastructure.
The example of a test code is:
Beginning
ETY23561L is written to memory with the testing encryption code
Use discloses 3 secret cipher key code and is decrypted on memory
Use decrypted message to respond
Receive next 1000 bytes, and be kept in the memory
Use public-key cryptography to come encrypted code and return code
Be that unit represents loopback time of delay of measuring with the millisecond
Finish
If this tested node refuse/can not be downloaded and operation code 304-308, just can obtain a conclusion, the service behaviour of this tested node has problem or is carrying out illegal work.So this network manager can be estimated a fault indirectly, and may need further to analyze/work 309 (for example sending an engineer).In addition, at work, if this tested node can not return the code 310-314 that is expected, then, the conclusion of can reentrying, this node that fault has taken place can be taken away.If this tested node has returned incomplete or ruined data 310-314, this node just can be identified as the source of this problem.
If this testing algorithm proves the integrality 316 of this link and tested node, this node can be moved 320 with this test routine by order, promptly shift the next node in connecting to this when existence 322 next nodes (if or similarly) to communication link of this network manager.Then, continue this method of testing (next procedure 304 among Fig. 3), be identified or this system is found to be complete operate as normal up to link/node that problem taken place.
In the exemplary approach of Fig. 3, a mechanism is provided, follow the tracks of an intrasystem source of trouble, and do not need the management and the test of concentrating.The number of test instruction and the quantity of test data and spanning network just can reduce so widely to the result of on-line file administrative center.In a specific implementations of the present invention, this test process can be used to utilize a plurality of parallel data paths of isolated node simultaneously, for example, and under the environment of a Internet type.The periodicity of various parallel routes is correlated with and can be used to discern fault, and can be used to limit up management data to a central administration point, for example 106, one OMC 48 of a file server or one portable, based on the transmission of the management tool of PC.So such being correlated with also can be proceeded, and reflected process and the method that is proposed in the flow graph of Fig. 2.For example, the flow graph of Fig. 3 can be carried out improvement, comprises the step 206 to 214 of Fig. 2, as below illustrating.
This test code can be carried out some different functions, and can comprise one or more, this test environment basic function unit of being designed to estimate.It should be noted that generally not tested control of tested node (in this example, being BTS18) in addition, these are different with the self-test routine.Very clear, the system/working mechanism of this particular aspects of the present invention also can be used for pure wired system, is included in the Internet that has a plurality of paths between the node.
Preferably, in order to ensure safety, up and downlink communication all can be carried out encryption, but other method for example is connected to a known time synchronized data source, also can be used.
Certainly, under the environment of an air interface, lacking a Radio Link may be to have fault in some local area fully, and without any need for detailed case study or identification.In other words, if air interface can not work, even reside in the analysis software of a specific intranodal can not be directly and the base station communicate.But, if that this node can be visited is additional/auxiliary link (for example World Wide Web (WWW), a wide area network (WAN), perhaps bluetooth), and Downloadable testing software can be used to by using such alternate link to come searching system work or fault.
Alternate embodiments of the present invention may be implemented as a computer program code that is coded on the computer program, and this code is used by a computer system.Desired is, such computer program can use one movably medium distribute, and be attended by printing or electronic document (for example, the software of compression packing), a computer system is preassembled, perhaps distributes from a server or board, bulletin by a network (for example the Internet or World Wide Web (WWW)).So, the instruction of series of computation machine can be fixed on the tangible medium, perhaps be fixed in the computer data signal, this computer data signal is a carrier wave, and can be used wired or Radio Transmission Technology sends to a computer system.Movably (that is, tangible) medium can be a medium that computer can read, disk for example, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, perhaps RAM, hard disk, magneto optical disk, ROM, flash memory, perhaps magnetic or light-card.This series of computer instructions has embodied here about this system and described function whole or wherein partial function in front.
Software implementation mode of the present invention can be used any traditional computer programming language and realize.For example, preferred embodiment can use a structured programming language (for example, " C ") or an object oriented programming languages (for example, " C++ ") to realize.
Although preferred method of work is suitable with use, the executable instruction of machine is programmed, general or application specific processor or logical circuit are realized, also can use hardware to realize special characteristic of the present invention.Certainly, the present invention can use the hybrid mode of hardware and software to realize.
It should be understood, of course, that described above only is an example, and can make amendment in detail, and can not depart from scope of the present invention.Though the wide range of systems topological structure that contact is summarized has above been described the present invention, the present invention also can be used for the particular aspects of this topological structure.For example, the present invention can only be used for cellular system, perhaps in fact, only is used for the part (for example in the scope of a BSC and lower-level system entity, for example BTS and MS are relevant with it) of this cellular system.
The present invention can be used for general telecommunication system, comprises (but being not limited to) the Internet, double-side band (wireless frequency) system, the GSM/CDMA system of mixing and third generation multimedia application.
