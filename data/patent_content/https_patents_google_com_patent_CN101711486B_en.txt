Embodiment
Figure 1A is the figure of region telecommunication system 10.This system across multiple community in urban areas and between which or the rural areas of centre.Generally speaking, in system 10, telecommunications service can be provided by the different sub-network in larger communication network.Such as, in densely populated urban area, except the alternative data network of such as WiFi or WiMAX etc., service can be provided by honeycomb substrate.Beyond urban area, service will more generally be provided by cellular telephone provider.These systems can in network enabled and internetwork " transfers ", to allow (constant) that continue or close to lasting data or voice communication.And some or all of these communications can be processed as straight-through (straight) data communication, and wherein voice are encoded at end user device place and packed, thus just become and do not distinguish with the routine data on network in essence.
As shown, system 10 covers three communities being provided with subnet 12a, 12b, 12c.These subnets 12a, 12b, 12c can comprise the radio data network of community scope, the network of such as WiFi, WiMAX or other similar configuration.In each subnet, multiple WAP (wireless access point) may be there is, these access points utilize line (such as, coaxial cable, optical fiber etc.) to be connected to subnet, and access subnet for allowing user radio (although eventually through wired connection).In addition, the part of subnet also directly can be connected to user through a cable.
Each subnet 12a, 12b, 12c be public, special or half dedicated network.Such as, common network can be the wireless network for city foundation, and it can be connected to internet at a single point or multiple point as required.Common network can by public organizations' operation in such as city, or can by the privately owned mechanism operation with public entities cooperation.
And dedicated network can be similar to common network, and internet can be connected in this locality, but with the discrete operation of any community organization (such as, by special ISP (ISP)).This network also can be connected to based on wider network by such as so-called equity point (peering point), such as Local Area Network or national network.Such as, the private communication channel that this dedicated network can utilize privately owned side to buy or lease, and/or privately owned side can be utilized to pay the communication channel of wholesale usage charges.For the communication between the user of dedicated network, general internet or other networks will not need to be used.This execution mode for dedicated network carrier can have more epistasis can and the advantage of more low cost.
Various assembly can appear at subnet 12a, 12b, 12c each in.Such as, the wireless device of such as personal digital assistant 20a and cell phone 20c can as communication end point.And wireless transceiver 14a, 14b, 14c can be arranged on building or lamp stand, think that the user near these transceivers provides wireless connections.Such as, the transceiver on lamp stand can as simple duplicator, and it is from lamp stand or such as absorb electric power from solar collector and associated batteries.Other transceivers can be wireless and wired switch or router, thus the main connection of subnet data being routed to internet or other central networks, and from these main connection route data.Cellular network also can have similar topological structure, thus base station provides geographic footprint (geographicfootprint) and is connected into larger network infrastructure.
As shown, subnet 12a, 12b, 12c suppose that all standing radio data network will especially be complied with in some region of such as urban area, and other rural areas will not be like this.But various region may combine in many ways, thus subnet may be overlapping and extend across multiple region.These subnets also can be interrupted as required, thus some WAP (wireless access point) is routed by specific main line, and other are routed by another main line.In addition, the connection of access point can such as automatically be changed, to help the load in balancing network or in group of networks.Such as, if the data traffic in a subnet is large especially, some of its access point can alternatively via another Subnetwork connection, to guarantee each high-quality service for subnet 12a, 12b, 12c.
Subnet 12b additionally comprises node 22, and node 22 can with the devices communicating outside subnet.Such as, node 22 can be satellite communication structure.In this embodiment, satellite communication channel can be the part of dedicated network, so that the communication in subnet is by node 22 route, for accessing remainder or other networks of this dedicated network, comprises internet.
Not by the region covered of in subnet 12a, 12b, 12c between subnet 12a, 12b, 12c, such as rural areas.However, this region can be served by cellular provider.This service can based on voice and/or based on data.As shown in the figure, there is Liang Ge cellular communication provider, as shown in the cell tower 16,18 (such as, has cross support beam, and only has horizontal beam) that marks in different forms.Region between some subnet, two communication providers provide service, and in other regions, and only communication provider provides service (represented by the tower that only there is a kind of form in this region).Such as, in the centre of figure, only corresponding with tower 18 provider provides service.Like this, if user in this zone wishes to connect, this provider must be utilized.
Equally, along the top of figure, Liang Ge provider has multiple tower.Therefore, such as, automobile 24 has two possible approaches and can be used for telecommunications.Certainly, when provider has proprietary close network, user's possibly cannot by any network access information except the provider network relevant to subscriber equipment or recognition of devices.In this case, the network provider closed will lose the chance of this user conversation of carrying.In any case, the operation of cellular network can be followed for connecting any one of multiple known operation pattern with charging calling.
In operation, in one example, truck 26 marches to another subnet 12a from a subnet 12b.Regional population is between those subnetworks sparse, and only by the bearer service relevant to tower 18.If the user in truck 26 starts the calling in subnet 12b, this calling will be initiated by subnet 12b, and be carried by the main line for subnet 12b.Pass subnet 12b along with user and shift out the covering of an access point, the process of this calling will be transferred to another access point.The method of known method and hereafter more complete description can be utilized to carry out this transfer.When this calling only transmits processed as the data comprising digitized voice signal, each transmission can be processed independently, and this network only needs the material guaranteeing particular group or grouping unnecessarily not sent repeatedly by this network.
When user exits subnet 12b, multi-form transfer may occur.In this case, user can enter the network runed by the entity different from the entity of operation subnet 12b of such as cellular phone network, and/or utilizes the network of the communication standard different from subnet 12b.Such as, subnet 12b can utilize IEEE compliant radiocommunication agreement, one in the variant of such as 802.11 or 802.16, and tower 18 can be the part etc. of the heterogeneous networks of such as GSM, UTMS or cdma network.Transfer between this network may relate to the identifying information transmitting and use tracking object for charging or other.When truck 26 arrives subnet 12a, perform the transfer from the access point tower 18 to subnet 12a.Subnet 12a and subnet 12b can be runed by single tissue or the part of single dedicated network, or can be runed by various tissue as an alternative, and/or be the part of heterogeneous networks, by the common network connection of dedicated network or such as internet.
In another example, automobile 24 just advances to subnet 12a along the path served by multiple honeycomb substrate from subnet 12b.Driver may start to utilize its home network of such as WiFi or WiMAX network to carry out voip call in its family.The equipment of this driver can be the multi-mode communication device that can utilize many host-host protocols and be switched to another pattern from a pattern pellucidly.Such as, the calling started at home can utilize unauthorized mobile access (UMA) technology to carry out, and unauthorized mobile access (UMA) technology uses the standard of such as bluetooth or IEEE 802.11.
When driver leaves its family, this calling can be picked up by subnet 12b, and subnet 12b itself can use UMA technology, but can be the part of the identical or different subnet used in its family with this user.When call is digitized and other data be similar to for transmitting equally process (some priority treatment may be utilized to guarantee QoS), each network only can process grouping when grouping is sent out, do not need the purposes being concerned about that these divide into groups, and when what they will be when the other end communicated is re-assembled.
Once the driver in automobile 24 leaves subnet 12b, tower 16 or 18 can be forwarded to the work for the treatment of of the data from phone.Herein, multiple cell phone carrier can be used for processing this calling, and this service can be provided based on auction system.Specifically, as described in more detail below, when subscriber equipment to be within the scope of carrier or in certain region time (such as, as the GPS in this equipment and utilize determined about the data of the overlay area downloading to this equipment), this subscriber equipment can to these carrier recognition oneself.This equipment also can identify its current communication session carried out, such as by providing the identification of equipment at the communication other end.
Utilize this information, each carrier corresponding to tower 16 and 18 can provide it to be ready to carry the price of this communication session respectively.When this session is call, this quotation can with regard to the price of per minute or other times section.When transfer of data is absorbed in this session, this quotation can with regard to the position of information or byte or similar tolerance.Certainly, in appropriate circumstances, voice transfer can be processed as transfer of data.Equipment also can obtain other information, and whole or in part based on this information, makes the decision-making accepted about which carrier.This information can comprise the service quality of expection, the widest covering (such as, if communication session expection expends the long period and this user moves), or by the optimal tradeoff selected by predetermined way (such as the linear combination of two factors).Such as by arranging the graphic icons of slide block set by promising two features (or three or four) (or triangle or square), user can select a combination, or by illustrating that a feature is better than the mode of another relative preference, this slide block can be positioned between two features.
The price reported of carrier can be based in part on the possible any expense that must pay to another carrier of this carrier.Such as, when user is when calling out another people be on road on circuit, wireless carrier may must pass through another this calling of carrier route, and to this carrier defrayment.On the contrary, when another people is in (and this carrier and the said firm have agreement) on the network runed by the same companies carrier of operation subnet 12b, this carrier may be lower to the quotation of this communication call.Therefore, based on " called party ", there is any carrier, if calling party may obtain better affairs---this carrier is also served in the region residing for this calling party.Also be because calling can rest in single carrier network, in this case, the quality of session may be better.
Price also can based on the present network capacity relevant to this carrier or other factors.Such as, if for the specific part of network, carrier is close to saturated, and this carrier may propose very high quotation or basic without quotation, to guarantee good service on that network.This quotation also can comprise the various performances that this carrier has; Such as, carrier can only can carry voice calls or limited data volume, and another carrier may can support the abundanter communication session of such as videoconference.In this case, it is known that carrier property can be caught in quote process, so that the selection that user or subscriber equipment more can be understood carrier.
Carrier can be also the restriction of quotation setup times, so that user can send or receive data during the period set by this time restriction, but, need after this again to offer.Such as, when equipment initiates quotation during low use section, carrier may make it offer " effectively " in one hour, and after one hour, this equipment will be configured to again offer.In this way, carrier can manage their load preferably, and also can avoid the service providing low cost during the high demand period.Time range for offering dynamically can be arranged by carrier, and becomes the part of this quotation, or can be arranged by prior agreement, such as, in the quotation lost efficacy in the front portion of each hour.As an alternative, quotation only can be applied to existing request/session, and permission is fixed a price by more dynamically.
This session can be set up by various suitable method, comprise for based on the Session initiation Protocol (SIP) of IP session and usually relevant to the scheme based on honeycomb conventional method.This communication can use a series of message, and by these message, calling party device is sought to set up session, and passes through the intermediate equipment of such as server, and this content is sent to called party's equipment.Called party's equipment can utilize message to respond equally, so that session can be initiated and be kept.Although these message are send separately, as the part of the affairs in transaction protocol, they are relevant.
Such as, subscriber equipment can be regarded as agency, and can depend on various networking component to set up and executive communication session.In one example, agency can utilize the help of proxy server to make a call.In this way, this message from equipment receipt message, and can be forwarded to its re-set target by network for this initiation user profit by intermediate equipment---proxy server---.Such as, wish that invitation message can be sent to proxy server by the equipment of initiation session, this proxy server comprises the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) seeking the equipment communicated.After having won the quotation for this session, proxy server can determine the position of called party, and forwards this message.Called party's equipment can respond, and this response can be forwarded to calling party by proxy server.Such as, utilize RTP (RTP) or other suitable mechanism, can this communication be carried out.These servers can provide additional service, such as certification and book keeping operation.
In another example, agency can utilize the help of Redirect Server, makes a call.In such examples, invitation request can be sent to Redirect Server by calling party device, and this Redirect Server can contact location server to determine the path of called party.When getting this information, information can be turned back to calling party device by Redirect Server, and this calling party device can confirm that it has received this information, and this request can be sent to the place of Redirect Server instruction by it.This position of being redirected may indicate called party's equipment, or it may represent another server by forwarding this request.Then, called party can respond, and calling party can confirm this response.
Registrar can follow the trail of the position of various equipment, and this positional information is supplied to other assemblies in this network, the data for use in particular device can be routed to this network and this equipment current resident position can be determined.Along with equipment moving, the position of this equipment can dynamically be registered, and the position technique of such as AGPS, TDOA, cell-id and other mechanisms known can be utilized to work in coordination with the directory service of such as finger (finger), rwhois and LDAP and other mechanisms known.In addition, such as, shaking hands of the connection of SDP actuating equipment performance and generation matching performance can be utilized.
These descriptions of connection and communication mechanism are only exemplary; Other mechanism and agreement also can be suitably used.Such as, H.323 standard or another standard can be used to communication, as the part or by other means of SIP method.And the part of session or session can be organized by SS7 agreement and/or is performed, for call setup, route, control, management and releasing.Be consistent for the use of SIP, SIP with other features described below, responsibility (thus flexibility) towards end-to-end, and is placed on end user device by these features.
Figure 1B shows the figure of the mobile device 32 communicated by multiple network 42,44,46,48.Generally speaking, the figure shows equipment 32 and how can adjust its communication pattern according to its position, the most effectively communicate so that its user can obtain with minimum cost.Equipment 32 can be initiated and terminate communication sessions on single network.In some embodiments, equipment 32 can initiating communication session on a network, or an access point is used for network, then, can be transformed into other access points or other networks during session.

Equipment 32 also can communicate with dedicated network 46 via router three 6, and router three 6 can be the enable network equipment of WiMAX, and it is the part of metropolitan area network.Equipment 32 can be multimode, because it moves along with user, can be handed over to router three 6, be switched to 802.16 patterns from 802.11 patterns from switch 34.But the final wired connection for any access point will be to network 46.In addition, multi-access point can be arranged in WiFi or WiMax network, and equipment 32 can move to next access point from an access point, does not also change pattern.
In addition, equipment 32 can communicate with one or more cellular network 42,44, such as by the access point 38,40 on cell tower.Cellular network 42 can by the carrier operation different from cellular network 44.Cellular network 42,44 also can utilize various criterion or agreement to run.As shown in arrow 50a, 50b, equipment 32 can utilize access point 38,40 input to exchange messages, such as when equipment 32 enters the area of coverage of access point 38,40, or when equipment 32 such as utilize signal strength sensors respond to its just leaving the area of coverage of router three 6 time.
Equipment 32 can such as transmit control signal with the frequency of one or more control channel, for the carrier that known or suspection are in specific region.This frequency can be only the superset of all usable frequencies and agreement.In addition, this equipment can be programmed to only attempt and known net connection (the known map such as, by the GPS location obtained by equipment 32 data and carrier being covered compares) in certain region.Arrow 50a, 50b represent the request from equipment 32 and the respective response to this equipment in negotiation connects.
Network 42,44 and network 46 can all be connected to common network 48, such as internet and/or PSTN (PSTN).By this way, can maintain with the communication session of the opposing party being connected to network, even if geographically move to the next one from an overlay area along with equipment 32.As shown, the transfer along with equipment 32 movement can be only from an access point to another on single network, or can be from network to network.
Fig. 2 shows the system diagram of the assembly of telecommunication system 40.These assemblies can comprise or be similar to the many assemblies shown in Figure 1A and Figure 1B.Generally speaking, system 40 concentrates on around two networks---internet 42 and PSTN (PSTN) 44.Generally speaking, data communication can be carried out on internet 42, and voice communication can be undertaken by PSTN 44.But PSTN 44 is also configured to carry digital communication, therefore, it is possible to carry various forms of data, and internet 42 can carry digitized voice communications, such as utilize various VoIP protocol or other mechanism.
There is provided the various networks of many services to be shown as and be connected to internet 42 and PSTN 44.Such as, traditional cable provider 54, such as competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) can provide voice-and-data service by switching network.Equipment on network can comprise traditional phone 54a, 54b, 54d and computer 54c.Computer 54c can by traditional dial-up service or by DSL or other similar broadband service communication.
Information Provider 46 can provide the access to internet 42 successively.Information Provider 46 can be such as by CNN that cable modem provides internet to access.As shown, computer 62 is connected to Information Provider 46 by broadband cable connections, and the microphone comprised for performing call and loud speaker, such as by using VoIP.Equally, computer 64 comprises the video camera being provided with monitor, for carrying video conference in a similar manner.Information Provider 46 also can comprise the ISP of other types, is such as connected to those of user by cable provider 54 or other networks.
Traditional wireless network 50 can comprise there is multiple tower 18 typically leave over (legacy) cellular telephone transmissions system, multiple tower 18 can link together via the switching system of common management.As shown, wireless network 50 only can carry the voice communication between subscriber to network, or by the communication of PSTN 44 with other users.
Wireless network 52 is more modern cellular networks, and comprises voice channel and distinct data channel (except basic controlling channel).Transfer of data is routed to internet 42, or receives from it, and voice transfer is routed to PSTN 44 or receives from it simultaneously.
Wireless network 48 is nominal all data networks.Specifically, all data are packed by client, and by network as data processing.But, in order to ensure service quality (QoS), priority can be set for the continuous data of some form of such as voice communication.Equally, other data of such as HTTP related data also can be packaged by similar fashion, and like network class route, in reception or the combination of other suitable points.In this way, wireless network 48 can provide comprehensive data, services to its subscriber or other users.
In the accompanying drawings, be shown as with the part be geographically separated of this network of transceiver 60 form and be separated from wireless network 48.Such as, wireless network can have node each population center, and then these nodes can be connected to each other by middle ground, such as by various broadband connection scheme, comprises optical fiber, special optic fibre, microwave be connected with satellite.In this way, equipment 48a and equipment 48b can carry out the data communication session of such as voip phone calling in single wireless network or LAN.And one or more (such as, for the videoconferences) of these equipment can by transceiver 60 and another devices communicating on wireless network 48, such as equipment 48c or equipment 48d.
If except wireless network 48 requirement order, they, by outside (monthly) subscription fee of payment, can be non-chargeable session by each communication of wireless network 48, so that the user of equipment is not these session defrayments.If wireless network 48 does not require any expense, these communications also can be completely free.As an alternative, wireless network 48 can be hybrid network, because for each payment plan, can provide the service of each rank.Such as, for comparatively high cost, larger bandwidth can be provided or better serve.Such as, in minimum rank, simple text message can be provided, and in higher level, can video conference be provided.And when user is willing to be intended to browse targeted promotional material when using wireless network 48, service can freely or rate reduction.
When the part outside wireless network 48 that communicates is carried out, wireless network 48 can in a standardized manner, be connected with other networks.Such as, if communication be call out with the voip phone of computer 62, associated packets only can be sent to internet 42 by wireless network 48, internet 42 general suitably route they.
Equally, if called out with the user of cable provider 54, wireless network 48 can be directly connected to PSTN 44.In this case, transition of communications can be become can be applicable to the communication of PSTN 44 by wireless network 48, and can follow other the suitable agreements for PSTN 44, comprises charging and other agreements.Such as, when carrying out trunk call, other providers that wireless provider 48 can carry out connecting to assistance pay and connect and carrying expense.Before information is sent to PSTN 44, wireless network 48 can position such as by utilizing the identifying information of the outer user of network to determine residing for this user, then can utilize as far as possible close to dedicated network or internet 42 this information of route of this point, reduce such expense.Wireless network 48 also can utilize other logical routings, to minimize the expense that it may must pay to other providers.
Although be called as " wireless " network, wireless network 48 can have various wired component.Such as, in addition to wirelessly, user can have the wired connection to master network 48, and each subnet in network 48 can pass through wired connection.
As described more comprehensively above and hereafter, equipment 48a-d such as can utilize VoIP protocol, communicates in wireless network 48 as clear data equipment.Equipment 48a-d also can advance outside wireless network 48, and obtains the access to other networks and provider, such as by inch of candle network.Such as, equipment 48a can be carried to the network being connected to Information Provider 46, and himself can be connected as data transmission set, to communicate with the remainder of this network.Equipment 48a can utilize the public VoIP provider of such as Skype or Vonage to come to contact, for voice communication with non-VoIP equipment.Equally, equipment 48a can shift out the region of wireless network 48, and enters the region of wireless network 52.Then, then equipment 48a can continue through wireless network 52 and communicate or form communication session, as hereafter described more comprehensively.
Fig. 3 shows the flow chart in the action initiating communication equipment in voice telephone calls.This flow chart is generally used for the communication of going out from equipment.Generally speaking, multi-mode equipment can be programmed, to have sought the various patterns of communication session.As shown in flow charts, this equipment, from least cost option, and if lower cost option is unavailable or become unavailable, then shifts to the option of higher cost.
At action 70 place, the order of equipment receipt of call, such as user inputs the activation that telephone number or similar destination identifier (such as, Gmail account identification symbol) and " transmission " or " calling " are ordered.This call command also can be the part of communication simply, such as the group of grouping or information block.Equipment initially can check the availability (action 72) of first network, and if this network can be used, this equipment can be undertaken calling out or send in addition data (action 74) by this first network.This equipment also previously can demonstrate the availability of first network, such as by periodically checking all available networks in this region.This first network can be such as connect by cable broadband the LAN carried out in the user family connected.This connection may with insignificant cost for user provides higher QoS.
If first network is unavailable, such as when user stays out middle, then equipment can check the availability (action 76) of second network, such as wireless network 48.If this network can be used, so, equipment can complete this calling or send information (action 78) in addition.Also can check other known networks or determine that it is available or unavailable in addition.
The network that equipment checks can be been programmed in this equipment, such as when equipment is purchased or by the training program for this equipment.Such as, second network can be programmed into this equipment by the seller, and when user sets up their account, first network can " be smelt " by equipment, such as by user family or office operate this equipment with AD HOC, herein, user expects that it is available for using this equipment at most and understanding radio data network.These networks also can " be found out " by equipment by other means, such as dynamically upgrade the network that will use based on available network current around equipment.
If do not have such data network to be available for this equipment, so it can find out the network outer network (or may be shown targeted promotional material to obtain access) that this user may must pay usage charges.As composition graphs 4A and 4B more specifically describes, this equipment can any carrier of ping (exploration) in scope (action 80), to represent that it needs service.Before needs ping carrier, which carrier this equipment may determine in scope.Ping process may relate to transmission identifying information and other information about communication session, the bandwidth etc. that such as data type, data volume and expection need.Other information also can be provided.
Then, each carrier can respond with the quotation of this communication session of carrying.As noted, this quotation can follow the form of setting, such as predetermined and setting-up time section (such as, 20 minutes or to hour beginning) price.This restricted quotation can make relatively being easier to, because this may be only relatively that price is to price of quotation.This quotation also can be more open, and each carrier has can reformed multiple variable (such as time or data volume, price and the grade of service).Then, this equipment can assess any competitive bidding (action 82), and selects preferred quotation, for continuing this communication session.This equipment can consider non-quotation information, such as from the possible service quality of specific support or the available bandwidth from this carrier.
User can arrange the rule for assessment of quotation, such as by arranging ad hoc rules or passing through to identify the profile relevant to ad hoc rules.Such as, " users of power " profile can select available Best link, does not consider cost.As another example, " student " profile can be selected compared with low quality or slower connection, and also can arrange the upper limit to gone out price.If all quotations exceed this upper limit, so, if this equipment can warn user, this user continues to shift out network, and he or she can not continue communication session.Profile can allow people that multiple Different Rule with single selection or finite population selection are distributed to their account.
Once have selected quotation, this equipment can make a call or other communication sessions (action 84).This may relate to the hand-over from a pattern to another pattern, such as by communicating in two modes and eliminate redundant data at overlapping period, such as by the soft or softer Hand-over techniques of standard simultaneously.If necessary, this transfer also can be hard transfer.Another execution mode can have central platform, and it helps Transformation Service between two heterogeneous networks.As hereafter described more comprehensively, then, this calling can continue, until user returns the network inner region sufficiently long time, so that communication session can be transferred back with the rate of consulting.This negotiation and the user transferred for equipment can be transparent.They also can be translucent, so that equipment provides communication session just shifting out network and may start certain instruction (such as audio or video display) of the expense that produces.
Fig. 4 A shows the swimming lane figure of the action provided around data communication session, such as from the call of communication equipment.This figure more specifically shows each participant role in this process.Herein, participant is client device, two carriers (such as, relevant to the tower 16 and 18 of Fig. 1 carrier) and telegon.This flow chart generally illustrates with the initiation of the communication session of telephone call paradigm.
As composition graphs 3 explain, if can, the service of mainly being registered by this equipment is carried out calling out (action 86) by subscriber equipment at first.For whole calling, if this calling is in network, telegon can be followed the trail of and record usage data (action 88).Such as, telegon can follow the trail of start and end time and the object identifier (such as telephone number, gMail account etc.) of this calling.The information that the information of following the trail of can be followed the trail of traditional telephony call with current utilization such as SIP with SS7 is identical, and also can comprise difference or additional information.
Such as, when communicating mainly based on data, this information can comprise the total file size of communication session.This tracking of information directly can be carried out by telegon, and such as by observing the information be delivered on this telegon network, herein, telegon operation is used for the major networks of this user.This observation also can be indirectly, such as by making this device traces back about the information of this communication session, is then reported to telegon in the ending of this session.This method may be suitable for all data equipment, if because by simple observation, telegon may determine when communication session starts and terminate---especially equipment carries out two communication sessions (such as, file transfer and call) simultaneously.In addition, follow the trail of and also can carry out via third party, the agreement such as by reaching, information reporting is given the carrier relevant to calling party and/or called party by it.
If master network is unavailable, if that is, user is outside network, so, this equipment can ping can carrier, as quotation invite (action 90).Then, carrier 1 when receiving this invitation, can take suitable action, such as confirms its current excess capacity, then can calculation and quotation (action 92).Carrier 2 can take identical or analogous action (action 94).Then, this equipment can receive each quotation, and utilizes pre-defined rule or regular collection to assess them, and can select (action 96) in these carriers.Then, this equipment can make a call (action 98), such as send information by (such as suitable frequency and suitable agreement) in a certain pattern to the quotation side selected, and the quotation side of this selection can carry this communication session, such as also proceed to the connection (action 100) of destination equipment by these data of route.Connect this session can comprise exchanged by the black phone of PSTN network and/or provide to third party information with perform the whole of this exchange or some.
When the call is completed, client device can terminate this calling (action 102), such as when user presses the conclusion button on phone.Then, this action can cause the carrier selected to be this calling and other communication sessions generation charge information (action 104).It is mutual that the generation of charge information can comprise with this client device.Such as, this equipment can follow the trail of the parameter relevant to this charging, the total bit of the length of such as call or transmission and reception or byte number, and this parameter can be reported to the carrier of selection.This client device even can calculate the price for this communication session, and simply by this price report to carrier.This carrier oneself also can follow the trail of the information about this calling, such as billing purpose.
Then, charge information can be submitted to telegon (action 106) by the carrier of this selection, and this telegon can receive this information (action 108) and itself and the account being used for this client be matched.The submission of charge information can in session once terminating to occur, or periodically can occur (such as, once a day or monthly).This charge information can comprise the date and time of this communication session and the data volume of its length and transmission and the cost of this session.
In appropriate circumstances, in order to " termination " these affairs, telegon can reconcile (reconcile) these affairs (action 110) with client, such as by locating this equipment when equipment returns in network, to check that this client has match information.By which, system can be guaranteed to submit unsuitable charge information to.If there is coupling, this charge information can be kept accounts (action 114) by telegon.
In due course, after such as and then have received charge information or monthly, telegon can initiate payment transaction (action 116), by these affairs, obtain fund (action 120) from client, and fund is supplied to carrier (action 118).This transfer can occur simultaneously or one can occur before another.Telegon also can retain some fund to cover executive communication session coordination and its affairs cost paid.In addition, can terms of payments various with bearer negotiation, such as, if carrier by immediate payment (such as, part that telegon is born " floating "), can be reduced payment by payment under guarantee slightly before user pays.
In this example, telegon is the system ordered of the user of client device or service.This telegon is generally this client and collects all charge informations, is merged, and processes the payment set from this client, and is supplied to each carrier by paying accordingly.Payment can be undertaken by traditional approach, such as by e-bank, or signal card number or pass through check.Pay and also can be undertaken by other electronic methods, such as micropayments method, wherein, user keeps can the balance of funding of electronic access, and the fund that this user of system automatic access holds.
Telegon can be only for organizing with the affairs of carrier and bearing the burden of consumer positioning and carry out charging and the service of collecting the charges from user or system.Telegon also can be for user provides the same mechanism of major networks, such as utilizes the network of UMA technology.In addition, telegon can make for user and sell wireless device, or can define the specification of manufacturing equipment, is included under mandate.Therefore, telegon can provide wired and aerogram access in specific region to user, and such as main cities and rural areas, as immediate data service.Price for this service can provide with lower moon rate, and user can be allowed to utilize its equipment to perform any activity based on data, such as Email, message and voice communication.
Telegon also can allow user access to be extended to outside network.Transfer of data may appear at specific network exterior domain, and also (such as, when client device can be switched to another pattern from a pattern) can be there is as packingization transfer of data or via typical cellular telephone communication in voice communication.
Fig. 4 B shows the swimming lane figure of the action provided around data communication, such as from the call of communication equipment.This figure is similar to Fig. 4 A, except larger role born by telegon in quote process.According to previous example, if client device is in network, customer equipment utilizes its major networks to carry out calling out (action 130), and the usage data (action 132) for this communication session can be followed the trail of and record to telegon.If this equipment is in outside network, telegon can receive request by other means, such as by agreeing to another network (action 134) forwarding this request.When equipment moves to network in network, but time before this equipment leaves this network, also this request can be made.Such as, utilizing signal strength data and signal strength signal intensity trend, or by utilizing position and vector data to determine that this equipment leaves network, can make and thisly to determine.Position is determined to be made by telegon, equipment or third party, and when being made by equipment, the information about the network coverage can be periodically supplied to this equipment, so that it has up-to-date network map.
When telegon have received request (action 136), it can it understands each carrier having covered the region that this client device is moving into by ping, performs auction process (action 138).Carrier can and then carry out responding (action 142,142) with quotation, and telegon can assess these quotations (action 144).This assessment can consider rule specific to the user of this client device or this client device or regular collection.
