Definitions
- a digital media store may collect a variety of content items.
- the media store may catalog the content that it serves to users. Users of the media store may perform a search or browse content stored therein.
- the result for a query may show variations of the same core content as independent or unrelated content items. For example, a user may search for a particular movie and receive multiple results such as an explicit version, an uncut version, a clean version, and a director's cut.
- Each of the items may be represented to the user in a row or grid format. For example, each item may have its own stock keeping unit ("SKU").
- WO01/03002 describes multimedia information retrieval using meta-descriptors in addition to descriptors.
- US 7 568 148 B1 discloses clustering documents based on features derived for the documents' content.
- US 8 661 069 B1 discloses automatic clustering of documents and determining and indexing a canonical document for each cluster.
- US 8 352 465 B1 discloses clustering of image search results and presenting them grouped under a cluster representative image.
- a plurality of content items is received by a media store database. Each content item is clustered based on an analysis of it. A canonical document is generated for each of the plurality of clusters. A query is received for one of the content items in the media store. At least one of the canonical documents is identified in response to the query. A representation of the at least one of the plurality of canonical documents returned in response to the query is presented. Each of the canonical documents is represented as a single document corresponding to the content items contained in one of the clusters.
- a system in an implementation, includes a database for storing one or more content items.
- a processor is connected to the database.
- the processor is configured to receive a plurality of content items by the database.
- the processor performs a clustering operation based on an analysis of each of the content items a media store has received.
- the processor generates a plurality of canonical documents.
- Each canonical document corresponds to one of the clusters of content items and contains a respective reference to content items contained in the cluster represented by the canonical document.
- the processor receives a query for one or more content items.
- the processor identifies at least one of the canonical documents in response to the query.
- the processor presents a representation of the at least one of the plurality of canonical documents identified in response to the query.
- Each of the canonical documents is represented as a single document corresponding to the content items contained in one of the clusters.
- a movie may have several different versions such as an unrated version, a director's cut, international versions, high/standard definition format versions, etc. While each version of the movie is related, each version is often presented to a user as being unrelated or independent as the other. For example, each version of the movie may be displayed separately in a line in the media store or as a separate item in a list format. Moreover, the media store's database tends to be structured in such a way that each version is independent. As disclosed herein, all of the different versions may be represented by a canonical document.
- a book may be available in fifty different languages.
- a single canonical document may refer to all fifty of the different language versions.
- the canonical document may be populated with different versions of the book as they are received from the publisher. Other data may be included in the canonical document, as described below.
- Content searching may be improved as well because the system may search only canonical documents instead of having to search through every version of the same content. Consolidating versions of content (or representations thereof) into a single document can be time consuming if it is manually performed and would not be practical for newly adding content such as when a new album is available and a user would like to browse and/or purchase the album as soon as it is available. Manual curation and grouping, thus, would be time consuming to be scalable for a modern media store and all of its content.
- a publisher may provide some indication that content is related to or a version of another content item in the media store. However, this is only useful for new content that the publisher provides; it may not be applied retroactively to existing content in the media store.
- a media store may only display to a user or ingest content that it can sell or otherwise serve to a user.
- the content items may be stored in a database as documents that have a 1:1 mapping to a representation of the content that a user can purchase, view, and/or install.
- the media store or a server connected thereto performs reconciliation and/or clustering of content items algorithmically. For example, a French version of movie XYZ may be determined to be related to an Italian version of movie XYZ based on the metadata associated with the French and Italian versions.
- the clustering may utilize audio and/order video fingerprinting, OCR, or other techniques to determine whether content items stored in the database are related to other content items or newly added content items.
- a canonical document is generated. Rather than display or serve content items that are for sale, the canonical document permits the database to recognize canonical and variant SKUs or the like.
- a music album may have four versions (e.g., explicit, explicitly with bonus content, clean, and clean with bonus content). These versions may already exist in the media store database.
- a canonical document may represent the album and have links to the variants.
- a user searches for a clean version of the album, the user may be presented with the same representation of the canonical document as another user who searches for an explicit version of the same album.
- the system may apply one or more rules to the canonical document that may determine which of the variants may be presented or otherwise available to a user of the media store (e.g., license permissions, country), for example, when a user selects the canonical document representation. Collections represented by the canonical documents may be merchandized irrespective of a user's location or preference (e.g., a user may prefer a clean version of an album over an explicit version). Moreover, a response to the query may be presented in an easier to view format because a canonical document would represent any other variant or version of the content related thereto. For example, instead of having four different versions of the same album appear in response to a query, only a canonical document corresponding to the four variants may be displayed to a user.
- Collections represented by the canonical documents may be merchandized irrespective of a user's location or preference (e.g., a user may prefer a clean version of an album over an explicit version).
- the system may allow greater flexibility to content that is not yet released for to the public or available in a particular region. For example, it may ingest a new, but not publicly available, content from a publisher and allow a user to add the content to a wish list. The system may notify the user when the content is available for consumption (e.g., purchase or viewing). Because a canonical document may be formed for the new release and all of its variant versions (e.g., a Spanish version, a Russian version), an administrator of the system may enable public consumption of the canonical document, thereby enabling users in different regions to consume the respective versions available in their locales.
- a canonical document may be formed for the new release and all of its variant versions (e.g., a Spanish version, a Russian version)
- an administrator of the system may enable public consumption of the canonical document, thereby enabling users in different regions to consume the respective versions available in their locales.
- the administrator of the system may utilize the canonical document to establish permissions for several documents rather than setting an access level for each specific variant of the content.
- Data regarding the performance of the variants e.g., sales, views, rentals, recommendations, ratings, etc.
- the data for all of the variants may be aggregated and analyzed together such that all variants of a content item may be examined simultaneously for their performance globally.
- one or more content items are received by a media store database, as shown in the example provided in Fig. 3 at 310.
- a media store database may serve a variety of digital content such as movies, songs, books, applications, etc.
- the media store may make the content available to users thereof for download, purchase, browsing, and/or social interactions. For example, a user may recommend a particular content item on the media store to a friend in the user's social network.
- the database may store other social interactions of users such as ratings, reviews, and/or recommendations of specific content items and/or developers connected thereto.
- a clustering analysis is performed on each content item ingested by the database at 320.
- the clustering may be performed utilizing a variety of techniques such as K-means clustering and/or a machine learning technique.
- Content may be analyzed for its metadata (e.g., title, length, size, actors, author, publisher/distributor), audio, video, text, etc.
- metadata e.g., title, length, size, actors, author, publisher/distributor
- a newly submitted content item may be an extended version of movie JRR.
- the metadata may indicate that the title is similar to that of an existing title in the media store database that may be the theatrical cut of the movie JRR.
- the director, actors, publisher, etc. may be the same; however, the length may differ.
- An audio and/or video analysis may review a substantial overlap between the extended cut and theatrical cut of JRR.
- a clustering algorithm applied to one or more of these features may, with high confidence, indicate that the extended version of JRR is related to the theatrical cut of JRR.
- manual curation may be performed on ingested or existing content to accommodate errors that may occur by the automated system.
- features of a content item may be utilized to associate it with a cluster of content items existing in the media store database.
- Members of a cluster are related versions of content (e.g., alternative versions of a movie or album).
- a cluster consists of or more content items.
- a canonical document is generated for each cluster in the media store database at 330.
- the canonical document contains a reference to content items contained in the cluster represented by the canonical document.
- the canonical document may contain a feature code, indication of the source document's location in the database (e.g., where the content item being referred to is located), and a SKU, for example, for each content item referred to in the canonical document.
- the canonical document may include a canonical version of the data contained in the content items represented.
- cover art, audio signature, video signature, text, metadata, etc. may be stored with the canonical document.
- the media store may compare the new content item to the canonical document's version of the content items it represents. This may permit a faster association of new content items with a canonical document.
- a query is received for one or more of the content items at 340.
- a user may enter movie JRR as a query.
- the media store identifies one or more canonical documents as being relevant or a match for the query at 350.
- the system may provide canonical documents that have been determined to match or be relevant to the query. In some configurations, the system may not present any specific content items at this step.
- a representation of one or more canonical documents is provided in response to the query at 360.
- a canonical document may be represented as a stack of documents such as the representations of the three canonical documents 410, 420, 430 shown in Fig. 4 .
- each canonical document may reflect the number of content items to which it refers.
- canonical document 410 may refer to four documents, canonical document 2 420 to two documents, and canonical document 3 410 to one document.
- the representation may reflect the number of content items available to the particular user (e.g., based on the user's locale).
- a user may select the representation of the canonical document at 499 and the interface changes to display the content items referred to in the canonical document.
- each of the four variant versions referred to in canonical document 1 410 may be displayed 411, 412, 413, 414 to a user.
- the variant versions may be represented to a user in other ways as well such as in a list.
- the canonical document may be utilized to filter the content items provided to a user. For example, an Italian version of a movie may not be permitted to be sold to the U.S. market due to licensing arrangements with the distributor. A consumer of the Italian version of the movie may, nonetheless, recommend the movie to an American consumer. If the American consumer views the recommendation, the system may, by virtue of the Italian and U.S. versions belonging to the same canonical document, be presented with the U.S. version of the movie or promotional material therefor. Other business rules may exist and be applied. As another example of a business rule, the media store may desire to promote a type of variant for content items over other types.
- an analysis of sales for content items in the media store may indicate that explicit content is more frequently purchased than a corresponding censored variant of the content item.
- the media store upon displaying the content items available for a canonical document may show or present the explicit variant of the canonical document to the user ahead of other variants that may sell less.
- the canonical document may cause the presentation of content to a user of the media store to be seamlessly altered according to one or more rules specified by the system or a user preference (e.g., a language preference, a location, etc.).
- a system in an implementation, an example of which is provided in Fig. 5 , includes a database 520 for storing one or more content items and a processor 530 connected thereto.
- the database 520 and processor 530 may be components of a media store 599 that serves and/or hosts content items for users.
- the content items may be received by the media store 599 from a distributor/developer 510.
- the processor 530 receives one or more content items as described above.
- the processor 530 may cluster the content items received based on features extracted from each content items (e.g., metadata, audio analysis, video analysis, etc.).
- the media store 599 may include a feature extraction module 550 that determines and/or extracts features for each ingested content item.
- a feature extraction module 550 that determines and/or extracts features for each ingested content item.
- the database 520, feature extraction module 550, and clustering technique 560 are shown as components of the media store 599; however, they may be separate from the media store 599.
- the feature extraction module 550 and clustering technique 560 may not communicate with the media store's processor 530.
- the clustering technique 560 may refer to, for example a clustering algorithm that may be applied by a processor 530 to ingested content and/or features extracted therefrom.
- the processor 530 is configured to generate one or more canonical documents.
- Each canonical document that the system generates corresponds to a cluster of content items.
- the content items in a cluster are related versions of one another because, for example, they are variant versions of each other.
- Users of the system may browse content on the media store 599 with a device 540 such as a tablet, smartphone, laptop, etc. As described above, not all of the content may be consumable by a user such as items not yet for sale.
- a user may submit a query to the system for one or more content items.
- the system identifies one or more canonical documents stored in the database 520 in response to the query.
- a representation of the canonical documents that match or relate to the query are presented to a client device 540 for the user.
- Each of the canonical documents is represented as a single document that, when selected by a user, may expand to show the user a representation of the content items to which the canonical document refers. Not all of the content items represented by the canonical document may be shown to the user. For example, if a business rule prohibits a locale from showing a particular variant of content.
- a canonical document for one or more content items may be generated at 610.
- a first of the content items contained or represented in the canonical document may differ from a second of the content items based on one or more features such as a language, a format, a content rating (e.g., censorship), a license, etc.
- the canonical document may contain a reference to each content item such as a SKU.
- the content item source file or document may be stored in a database separate from the canonical document.
- One or more content items may be associated with the canonical document at 620. For example, during content ingestion, a SKU may be assigned to each content item.
- the SKU may be included or referred to in the canonical document.
- the system may display one or more of the content items based on the SKUs contained in the document as described earlier.
- the system may, therefore, receive a query from a user device for one or more content items at 630 and determine that a first of the content items is associated with the canonical document at 640.
- a search may return movie ABC as being most relevant to a user's query.
- Movie ABC may be associated with canonical document ABC.
- the media store may provide the canonical document, instead of the content item, for movie ABC.
- the media store may perform a search of its database for relevant matches to the query among the canonical documents rather than specific content items. Whether the media store searches content items only, canonical documents only, or both content items and canonical documents, it may provide a representation of one or more canonical documents that have been determined to be relevant to the query at 650. If a user selects the canonical representation, the representation may expand to show one or more canonical documents referred to in the selected canonical document.

As stated earlier, a movie, for example, may have several different versions such as an unrated version, a director's cut, international versions, high/standard definition format versions, etc. While each version of the movie is related, each version is often presented to a user as being unrelated or independent as the other. For example, each version of the movie may be displayed separately in a line in the media store or as a separate item in a list format. Moreover, the media store's database tends to be structured in such a way that each version is independent. As disclosed herein, all of the different versions may be represented by a canonical document. Thus, instead of showing a user each version of the movie, the user is presented with a representation of the canonical document. As an example, a book may be available in fifty different languages. A single canonical document may refer to all fifty of the different language versions. The canonical document may be populated with different versions of the book as they are received from the publisher. Other data may be included in the canonical document, as described below.
- Content searching may be improved as well because the system may search only canonical documents instead of having to search through every version of the same content. Consolidating versions of content (or representations thereof) into a single document can be time consuming if it is manually performed and would not be practical for newly adding content such as when a new album is available and a user would like to browse and/or purchase the album as soon as it is available. Manual curation and grouping, thus, would be time consuming to be scalable for a modern media store and all of its content. A publisher may provide some indication that content is related to or a version of another content item in the media store. However, this is only useful for new content that the publisher provides; it may not be applied retroactively to existing content in the media store.
- Typically, a media store may only display to a user or ingest content that it can sell or otherwise serve to a user. The content items may be stored in a database as documents that have a 1:1 mapping to a representation of the content that a user can purchase, view, and/or install. As disclosed herein, the media store or a server connected thereto performs reconciliation and/or clustering of content items algorithmically. For example, a French version of movie XYZ may be determined to be related to an Italian version of movie XYZ based on the metadata associated with the French and Italian versions. The clustering may utilize audio and/order video fingerprinting, OCR, or other techniques to determine whether content items stored in the database are related to other content items or newly added content items.
- As disclosed herein, a canonical document is generated. Rather than display or serve content items that are for sale, the canonical document permits the database to recognize canonical and variant SKUs or the like. For example, a music album may have four versions (e.g., explicit, explicitly with bonus content, clean, and clean with bonus content). These versions may already exist in the media store database. A canonical document may represent the album and have links to the variants. A user searches for a clean version of the album, the user may be presented with the same representation of the canonical document as another user who searches for an explicit version of the same album. The system may apply one or more rules to the canonical document that may determine which of the variants may be presented or otherwise available to a user of the media store (e.g., license permissions, country), for example, when a user selects the canonical document representation. Collections represented by the canonical documents may be merchandized irrespective of a user's location or preference (e.g., a user may prefer a clean version of an album over an explicit version). Moreover, a response to the query may be presented in an easier to view format because a canonical document would represent any other variant or version of the content related thereto. For example, instead of having four different versions of the same album appear in response to a query, only a canonical document corresponding to the four variants may be displayed to a user.
- The system may allow greater flexibility to content that is not yet released for to the public or available in a particular region. For example, it may ingest a new, but not publicly available, content from a publisher and allow a user to add the content to a wish list. The system may notify the user when the content is available for consumption (e.g., purchase or viewing). Because a canonical document may be formed for the new release and all of its variant versions (e.g., a Spanish version, a Russian version), an administrator of the system may enable public consumption of the canonical document, thereby enabling users in different regions to consume the respective versions available in their locales. The administrator of the system (e.g., the media store), may utilize the canonical document to establish permissions for several documents rather than setting an access level for each specific variant of the content. Data regarding the performance of the variants (e.g., sales, views, rentals, recommendations, ratings, etc.) may be associated with the canonical document. The data for all of the variants may be aggregated and analyzed together such that all variants of a content item may be examined simultaneously for their performance globally.
- In an implementation, one or more content items (e.g., a movie, a song, an album, a book, an application, etc.) are received by a media store database, as shown in the example provided in
Fig. 3 at 310. During an ingestion process, publishers and/or distributors of content may submit content to be served or hosted by the media store. The media store may serve a variety of digital content such as movies, songs, books, applications, etc. The media store may make the content available to users thereof for download, purchase, browsing, and/or social interactions. For example, a user may recommend a particular content item on the media store to a friend in the user's social network. The database may store other social interactions of users such as ratings, reviews, and/or recommendations of specific content items and/or developers connected thereto. - A clustering analysis is performed on each content item ingested by the database at 320. The clustering may be performed utilizing a variety of techniques such as K-means clustering and/or a machine learning technique. Content may be analyzed for its metadata (e.g., title, length, size, actors, author, publisher/distributor), audio, video, text, etc. For example, a newly submitted content item may be an extended version of movie JRR. The metadata may indicate that the title is similar to that of an existing title in the media store database that may be the theatrical cut of the movie JRR. Similarly, the director, actors, publisher, etc. may be the same; however, the length may differ. An audio and/or video analysis may review a substantial overlap between the extended cut and theatrical cut of JRR. A clustering algorithm applied to one or more of these features may, with high confidence, indicate that the extended version of JRR is related to the theatrical cut of JRR. In some instances, manual curation may be performed on ingested or existing content to accommodate errors that may occur by the automated system. Thus, features of a content item may be utilized to associate it with a cluster of content items existing in the media store database. Members of a cluster are related versions of content (e.g., alternative versions of a movie or album). A cluster consists of or more content items.
- A canonical document is generated for each cluster in the media store database at 330. The canonical document contains a reference to content items contained in the cluster represented by the canonical document. The canonical document, for example, may contain a feature code, indication of the source document's location in the database (e.g., where the content item being referred to is located), and a SKU, for example, for each content item referred to in the canonical document.
- In some configurations, the canonical document may include a canonical version of the data contained in the content items represented. For example, cover art, audio signature, video signature, text, metadata, etc. may be stored with the canonical document. Upon ingestion of a new content item, the media store may compare the new content item to the canonical document's version of the content items it represents. This may permit a faster association of new content items with a canonical document.
- A query is received for one or more of the content items at 340. For example, a user may enter movie JRR as a query. The media store identifies one or more canonical documents as being relevant or a match for the query at 350. Rather than provide individual hits to specific content items in the media store database as a response to the query, the system may provide canonical documents that have been determined to match or be relevant to the query. In some configurations, the system may not present any specific content items at this step. Thus, a representation of one or more canonical documents is provided in response to the query at 360. For example, a canonical document may be represented as a stack of documents such as the representations of the three
canonical documents Fig. 4 . The representation of each canonical document may reflect the number of content items to which it refers. For example,canonical document 410 may refer to four documents,canonical document 2 420 to two documents, andcanonical document 3 410 to one document. In some configurations, the representation may reflect the number of content items available to the particular user (e.g., based on the user's locale). A user may select the representation of the canonical document at 499 and the interface changes to display the content items referred to in the canonical document. For example, each of the four variant versions referred to incanonical document 1 410 may be displayed 411, 412, 413, 414 to a user. The variant versions may be represented to a user in other ways as well such as in a list. - The canonical document may be utilized to filter the content items provided to a user. For example, an Italian version of a movie may not be permitted to be sold to the U.S. market due to licensing arrangements with the distributor. A consumer of the Italian version of the movie may, nonetheless, recommend the movie to an American consumer. If the American consumer views the recommendation, the system may, by virtue of the Italian and U.S. versions belonging to the same canonical document, be presented with the U.S. version of the movie or promotional material therefor. Other business rules may exist and be applied. As another example of a business rule, the media store may desire to promote a type of variant for content items over other types. For example, an analysis of sales for content items in the media store may indicate that explicit content is more frequently purchased than a corresponding censored variant of the content item. The media store, upon displaying the content items available for a canonical document may show or present the explicit variant of the canonical document to the user ahead of other variants that may sell less. Thus, the canonical document may cause the presentation of content to a user of the media store to be seamlessly altered according to one or more rules specified by the system or a user preference (e.g., a language preference, a location, etc.).
- In an implementation, an example of which is provided in
Fig. 5 , a system is disclosed that includes adatabase 520 for storing one or more content items and aprocessor 530 connected thereto. Thedatabase 520 andprocessor 530 may be components of a media store 599 that serves and/or hosts content items for users. The content items may be received by the media store 599 from a distributor/developer 510. Theprocessor 530 receives one or more content items as described above. Theprocessor 530 may cluster the content items received based on features extracted from each content items (e.g., metadata, audio analysis, video analysis, etc.). The media store 599 may include afeature extraction module 550 that determines and/or extracts features for each ingested content item. InFig. 5 , thedatabase 520,feature extraction module 550, andclustering technique 560 are shown as components of the media store 599; however, they may be separate from the media store 599. Thefeature extraction module 550 andclustering technique 560, may not communicate with the media store'sprocessor 530. Theclustering technique 560 may refer to, for example a clustering algorithm that may be applied by aprocessor 530 to ingested content and/or features extracted therefrom. - The
processor 530 is configured to generate one or more canonical documents. Each canonical document that the system generates corresponds to a cluster of content items. The content items in a cluster are related versions of one another because, for example, they are variant versions of each other. Users of the system may browse content on the media store 599 with adevice 540 such as a tablet, smartphone, laptop, etc. As described above, not all of the content may be consumable by a user such as items not yet for sale. A user may submit a query to the system for one or more content items. The system identifies one or more canonical documents stored in thedatabase 520 in response to the query. A representation of the canonical documents that match or relate to the query are presented to aclient device 540 for the user. Each of the canonical documents is represented as a single document that, when selected by a user, may expand to show the user a representation of the content items to which the canonical document refers. Not all of the content items represented by the canonical document may be shown to the user. For example, if a business rule prohibits a locale from showing a particular variant of content. - In an implementation, an example of which is provided in
Fig. 6 , a canonical document for one or more content items may be generated at 610. A first of the content items contained or represented in the canonical document may differ from a second of the content items based on one or more features such as a language, a format, a content rating (e.g., censorship), a license, etc. The canonical document may contain a reference to each content item such as a SKU. The content item source file or document may be stored in a database separate from the canonical document. One or more content items may be associated with the canonical document at 620. For example, during content ingestion, a SKU may be assigned to each content item. The SKU may be included or referred to in the canonical document. When a user accesses the canonical document or a representation thereof, the system may display one or more of the content items based on the SKUs contained in the document as described earlier. The system may, therefore, receive a query from a user device for one or more content items at 630 and determine that a first of the content items is associated with the canonical document at 640. For example, a search may return movie ABC as being most relevant to a user's query. Movie ABC may be associated with canonical document ABC. Thus, the media store may provide the canonical document, instead of the content item, for movie ABC. As stated earlier, the media store may perform a search of its database for relevant matches to the query among the canonical documents rather than specific content items. Whether the media store searches content items only, canonical documents only, or both content items and canonical documents, it may provide a representation of one or more canonical documents that have been determined to be relevant to the query at 650. If a user selects the canonical representation, the representation may expand to show one or more canonical documents referred to in the selected canonical document. - Implementations of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in and used with a variety of component and network architectures.

- In situations in which the implementations of the disclosed subject matter collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., a user's provided input, a user's geographic location, and any other similar data associated with a user), or to control whether and/or how to receive data from a provider that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by systems disclosed herein.
