Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to web-based video display and specifically to user interface features for managing video and advertising content in an online content distribution system.
- Video content is now delivered to users via a wide range of technologies, each of which has established mechanisms for delivering advertising content.
- Movies commercially released in DVD format generally come with trailers for other movies from the same production company. These trailers are often presented automatically when the user seeks to watch the primary program; sometimes it is difficult if not impossible for a user to avoid watching the advertising content.
- Many users have expressed dismay at the requirement to sit through undesired advertisements, particularly after they have already paid a substantial amount to buy the DVD.
- the advertising content is often out of date when the DVD is watched some period of time after it is first released. The overall user satisfaction with this sort of advertising has been mixed.
- Various systems, methods and software tools enable users who are viewing videos on a website to control certain aspects of their playback experience, and also enable the content provider to provide advertising content in an effective manner.
- an advertising window is superimposed on a video playback window.
- the user is given an option to select or skip the advertisement.
- the advertisement can be text only, audio, video, or a combination.
- the advertising window is presented as a banner located toward one edge of the video playback window.
- the banner is presented in opaque or translucent form, as desired.
- the advertising window appears during the video playback, rather than before it.
- the selected opacity/transparency of the advertising window is selected based on the amount of attention that is desired to be given to the advertising.
- the advertising window appears after the video playback.
- the window appears as a banner within a larger window of video content related to the content that was just displayed, i.e., material that the user might want to see based on the user's prior selection.
- FIG. 1 Other aspects of an embodiment are indicators for the viewer as to the amount and placement of the advertising that accompanies requested video content.
- a timer/slider bar on the player is colored red to indicate portions that correspond to requested video content and yellow to indicate advertising. Timing icons that appear with the advertising make clear to the user how much longer the advertising will take.
- User interface controls allow the user to cancel advertising content and to move on to subsequent advertising content.
- User interfaces for advertising content are made distinctive vis-à-vis those for shared video so that the viewer is not confused as to whether any particular content is part of the shared video or advertising.
- FIG. 2 is a process flow for associating advertising with video.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a web page implementing an exemplary interface in a “pre-roll” mode of operation.
- FIG. 5A illustrates a web page implementing an exemplary interface in a “mid-roll” mode of operation.
- FIG. 5B illustrates a web page implementing an exemplary presentation of “mid-roll” content.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a web page implementing an exemplary interface in a “post-roll” mode of operation.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary interface for a video website with integrated advertising content.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system architecture in accordance with one embodiment.
- a video hosting website 100 includes a front end server 140 , an advertising management system 130 , a video server 110 and various databases, including a user database 150 and a video database 190 .
- Many conventional features, such as firewalls, load balancers, application servers, failover servers, site management tools, and so forth are not shown so as to more clearly illustrate the features of the system.
- a suitable website 100 for implementation of the system is the YOUTUBETM website, found at www.youtube.com; other video hosting sites are known as well, and can be adapted to operate according the teaching disclosed herein.
- web site represents any method of uploading and downloading content and is not intended to be limited to content uploaded or downloaded via the Internet or the HTTP protocol.
- the various servers are conventionally implemented, whether as a single piece of software or hardware or as multiple pieces of software or hardware. In general, functions described in one embodiment as being performed on the server side can also be performed on the client side in other embodiments if appropriate.
- a client 170 executes a browser 171 , and connects to the front end server 140 via a network 180 , which is typically the Internet, but may also be any network, including but not limited to a LAN, a MAN, a WAN, a mobile, wired or wireless network, a private network, or a virtual private network. While only a single client 170 and browser 171 are shown, it is understood that very large numbers (e.g., millions) of clients are supported and can be in communication with the website 100 at any time.
- the browser 171 include a third party video player (e.g., the FlashTM player from Adobe Systems, Inc.), or any other player adapted for the video file formats used in the site 100 .
- a user accesses a video from the site 100 by browsing a catalog of videos, conducting searches on keywords, reviewing playlists from other users or the system administrator (e.g., collections of videos forming channels), or viewing videos associated with particular user groups (e.g., communities).
- browser 171 also accesses a video file indirectly, via an embedded video that is accessed via an embedded hyperlink in a third party website.
- Users of the client 170 and browser 171 can upload content (which can include, for example, video, audio, or a combination of video and audio) to the site 100 via the network 180 .
- the uploaded content is processed and placed for storage in the video database 190 .
- This processing can include format conversion, compression, metadata tagging, and other data processing.
- an uploaded content file is associated with the uploading user, and so the user's account record is updated in the user database 150 as needed.
- other data relating to the user is also placed for storage in database 150 . For example, the user may be asked to self-select certain categories or product/service types of interest, for the purpose of allowing the user to self-select various types of content and advertising that the website 100 presents to the user.
- the uploaded content will be referred to a “videos” or “video files”, but no limitation on the types of content that can be uploaded are intended by this terminology.
- the advertising management system 130 stores advertising content to be presented along with the user-requested content.
- the advertising content is in the same format as the user-requested content (e.g., video advertising for a video content request).
- other types of advertising are presented to the user, such as pure text advertising, advertising providing a hyperlink to an advertiser's website, text-and-audio advertising, and still image advertising.
- An advertising control subsystem 131 both manages access to the advertising content stored in the advertising database 132 , and also serves to associate certain advertising content with certain user-requested content.
- the association is made solely on the content of the requested video, while in another the association is made based on other factors as well, such as user-specific information stored in the user database 150 .
- a user who has self-identified as wanting to learn more about new movies may be presented with a greater frequency of movie-oriented advertising content than a user who had not indicated such a preference.
- FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of a process for presenting advertising content along with shared video, such as provided via system 130 .
- FIG. 2 begins with an administrator logging in 210 to the advertising management system 130 .
- the administrator selects 220 advertising content to associate with a particular shared video.
- this association is made manually.
- advertising content is automatically associated with video content.
- owners or stewards of the content choose which ads are associated with their content. In some circumstances, such association is random while in other instances, the association may be made based on some aspect of the video content. For example, if a video shows a litter of puppies, metadata for that video may be processed so as to trigger association with advertising content for a pet food company.
- advertising content is chosen in accordance with previous actions or characteristics of the user, so that a first user will view a first ad and a second user will view a different ad when they watch the same video.
- association 220 the administrator selects the type of advertising display to be used with the video.
- pre-roll advertising also called pre-watch advertising
- the appearance of such a window is provided by superimposing pixels corresponding to the advertising content over the video playback area of the video player before the video begins.
- the advertising content is not actually implemented within a pop-up window, i.e., a separate window that can be positioned with respect to the underlying content, but instead is an unmovable static area integrated into the video content, where the video content is either frozen or animated.
- the video with a pre-roll ad playing inside it is sent to the browser as a single, streaming file. In certain situations, this makes it more evident to the viewer that the advertising content is not part of the requested video. In addition, this provides greater user interaction with the advertising content area precisely because while the area looks like a movable window, it is not. If the user attempts to reposition the area, in this embodiment the user will not be able to do so.
- pre-roll advertising content Advertising presented before the requested video plays is referred to as “pre-roll” advertising content.
- pre-roll advertising is automatically initiated.
- the pre-roll advertising only plays if the user actively presses on the advertising portion of the display.
- an interface button is provided within the advertising portion of the display so that the user must click on that button to see the full advertising content.
- the pre-roll advertising display portion is, in one embodiment, presented as a fully opaque display. In other embodiments, the advertising portion is partially or fully transparent, so as to allow the user to see both the advertising portion and whatever part of the underlying requested video it covers.
- the advertising content is static. In some embodiments, the advertising content is itself a video.
- a progress bar is displayed in some embodiments that shows, whether graphically, by a numeric timer, or both, how much time is left in the display of the advertising content. Further detail on “pre-roll” display of advertising is provided in connection with the discussion of FIG. 4 .
- Mid-roll display differs significantly from pre-roll display in that the user will be presented with advertising content while already enjoying the originally requested video content. Accordingly, in many instances the type of presentation used for the advertising content will need to be different in the pre-roll and mid-roll situations so as not to disrupt the user's overall experience. Thus, in the mid-roll scenario, a less obtrusive display of advertising content may be desirable, depending on the nature of the requested content.
- mid-roll advertising display is presented in connection with the discussion of FIG. 5 .
- the administrator may select 250 post-roll placement of the advertising (also called post-watch advertising).
- This sort of display differs yet again from the pre-roll and mid-roll situations, as the user of a video playback website is typically presented with suggestions for other, potentially related, video content after watching the requested content.
- overall user satisfaction concerns dictate that the user not be distracted too much from making those post-playback selections of related videos; however, it is found that just after playback the user is in a very receptive state for advertisements.
- an effective placement of advertising is found to be one that presents an advertising play button nearby, but distinct from, buttons allowing the selection of suggested videos.
- an advertising play button is placed in the same overall window as the buttons for suggested videos, yet separated from the suggested video buttons by user interface controls for sharing the video that has just been watched and for watching the video again. Further detail on post-roll advertising display is presented in connection with the discussion of FIG. 6 .
- Combinations of pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll placements may, in certain instances, be desirable. For example, it may be that in a certain type of video, a user is likely to notice and want to see a mid-roll advertising message, but be too interested in the ongoing video content to actually activate a user interface control while the requested video content is playing. In that sort of situation, presenting a post-roll advertising button referencing the same advertiser or the same advertisement as appeared mid-roll may be a solution that satisfies the user's interest in enjoying the video while at the same time providing the user with an opportunity to follow-up on the advertising that appeared mid-roll. Thus, in one embodiment, a same advertisement is presented on post-roll if the user stopped play of the advertisement when it was presented mid-roll.
- a same advertisement is presented post-roll whether or not the user stopped the mid-roll advertisement.
- the advertisements for any two of pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll are related and may be the same advertisement, in order to enforce the advertised content in the user's mind.
- Processing begins when the user activates a conventional user interface control to play 310 the selected video content.
- the video commences playing.
- a user interface banner or “blind” (based on resemblance in appearance to a window blind) appears 320 to the user with advertising content.
- the blind is a predominantly rectangular box that appears like a horizontally extended user interface button.
- the window is large enough to be readily noticed, yet in this embodiment not large enough to significantly impact a typical user's enjoyment of the requested video.
- the blind appears by rolling up vertically from the bottom of the video window until it partially obscures a relatively small portion of the bottom of that window.
- the blind includes a user interface button allowing the viewer to click 330 to watch the advertising immediately, which temporarily suspends playback of the requested video. Once the advertising content has been shown in response to the user click, playback of the originally requested video continues 340 until completion.
- the blind disappears after the advertising content has been shown, while in another it remains displayed for a period of time, up to and including the entire duration of the originally requested video. Likewise, if the user never clicks on the button in the advertising blind, the blind may be set to disappear after a period of time or to remain on the screen.
- the blind is translucent so as not to unduly obscure the requested video, but in some applications it may be preferable to use an opaque blind, for instance to provide an incentive for the viewer to click on the button to show the advertising content so that playback of the originally requested video can then continue without further obstruction by the button.
- a video content window 401 is displayed, with the first frame (or in some embodiments a representative frame that is not the first frame) of the requested video.
- Superimposed on the video content window 401 is what appears to be a second window, advertising window 402 , in the style of a bordered window-within-window or a conventional pop-up.
- a large “play” button 403 is prominently displayed within advertising window 402 , indicating to a user that the content in advertising window 402 is a video that can be played by pressing button 403 .
- window 402 is not actually implemented as a separate window in one embodiment, though to the user it may at first appear to be a pop-up window.
- a number of existing video content sources ranging from commercial DVDs to internet television sites, add in advertising content before, i.e., “prepend” advertising to, the primary content desired by users.
- prepend advertising the nature of shared video websites is such that users have a wide variety of interests, some of which may be consistent with pre-roll advertising and others which will not.
- pre-roll advertising placement it can be employed only where it will enhance the overall user experience and avoided where it will be neither effective nor well-received. Because this selection is possible, where pre-roll advertising is selected, it can be implemented in a more aggressive manner than might otherwise be possible.
- a default display mode for pre-roll display is through automatic initiation of the advertising content, i.e., without waiting for a user to ask for it.
- allowing a portion of the video selected by the user to remain visible on one or more sides of the ad allows the user to remember which video he will be watching after the ad and provides a reminder that the video will be available shortly.
- the nature of shared video is such that a user may not always be able to distinguish content from advertising. In many situations, it will be advantageous to clarify for the customer what is advertising and what is the originally requested content.
- the video player's conventional control buttons e.g., time sliders, pause buttons and the like
- an indication of the advertisement's duration is also provided, e.g., progress bar, dynamic clock icon.
- the word “Advertisement” is displayed as part of the player's border as advertising content is being shown, either inside the video ad or outside of the video ad.
- Advertising is also employed in various embodiments in the other advertising windows, blinds and banners detailed below. Further indication that the advertising content is not part of the requested video is made by giving it the appearance of a pop-up window and, as may be appropriate in particular instances, highlighting the borders of the window, highlighting the entire window should the viewer move the mouse over the window, and making the advertising window 402 otherwise differ in user interface appearance and behavior from the remainder of the video content window 401 .
- ad window 402 provides some visual indication, e.g., progress bar, clock icon, of the duration of the advertising content it displays, but such visual indication is visually distinct from whatever indication of video timeframe is provided in the video content window 401 .
- Use of such different timing indicators for video content and advertising content further distinguishes advertising content from the originally requested content.
- Separate user interface control is also provided to allow a viewer to hear audio related to the advertising content, even if the viewer had chosen to mute the audio of the originally requested content. In one embodiment, this is implemented via a loudspeaker icon control displayed within the ad window 402 .
- a “close window” icon is provided in ad window 402 to allow the user to remove the ad window 402 entirely and commence with playback of the originally requested video in video content window 401 .
- This “close window” capability is provided as a default in the other advertising windows, blinds and banners discussed below as well.
- Video content window 501 is already, in this circumstance, displaying the video that the user requested.
- a translucent advertisement blind 502 appears (or is rolled up) superimposed on a portion of video content window 501 ; in one embodiment the originally requested video continues to play without interruption.
- Blind 501 can provide access to a variety of advertising content which, when selected, will pause the current video. For instance, a link to a website may be presented on the blind, preferably with the linked site providing a “back” button to resume playback of the requested video once the website has been reviewed by the user. Instead of, or in addition to, a website link, an advertising video can be presented on the blind.
- a thumbnail frame of such video is displayed, along with a user interface “play” button 503 to allow the viewer to initiate the advertising video.
- selected advertising content e.g., a video or a website
- the paused video in the video content window 501 is grayed out while the advertisement is presented.
- the back button 512 can be selected to resume playback of the requested content. In one embodiment, playback of the requested video resumes once the advertising video has been fully played back or cancelled by the user.
- an exemplary post-roll advertising interface 600 is shown.
- the background of interface 600 is simply the final frame (or a representative frame) of the video that the viewer just finished watching.
- the viewer is presented not only with banners 620 , 621 recommending videos for the viewer to request, such as those that are highly rated or often requested by people who have seen the video that was just shown to the viewer, but also with an advertising banner 602 .
- the advertisement banner 602 is distinctly positioned above the suggested video banners 620 , 621 , and separated from them by other user interface buttons, e.g., the “share” and “watch again” buttons 610 , 611 . Further distinction is achieved by making the advertisement banner 602 opaque and the recommended video banners 620 , 621 translucent, and by placing an “Advertisement” legend on the advertisement banner 602 as previously discussed. As with the pre-roll and mid-roll scenarios, a “play” button 603 indicates that the advertising content is video.
- the administrator can make those choices when associating advertising content with a video.
- the advertising content may not be an advertisement per se, but is in some applications sponsored video content.
- an appropriate legend e.g., “sponsored content” is used if it is desired to distinguish such content from other shared video.
- interface 600 Usability of interface 600 is enhanced by its simple appearance, yet it is typically desirable to provide a viewer with a fairly large number of recommended videos. In practice, it is found that providing a relatively small number of proposed videos, e.g., via banners 620 , 621 , and then every few seconds changing the videos that are proposed on those buttons, provides a satisfying user experience.
- an administrator can select to have multiple advertisements associated with a selected video, and when one advertisement plays, a “next” button on that ad allows a user to immediately skip to the next ad.
- Another selection that can be made by an administrator is to have website links superimposed upon a video advertisement so that anytime during playback of the advertisement, the viewer can choose to go to a website associated with the advertisement.
- a horizontal translucent shading bar helps direct the viewer's eyes to the displayed URL for the website, as well as other user interface controls (e.g., the “next” button).
- a video advertisement Rather than immediately starting playback of a video advertisement, which may be unduly distracting to viewers, in one embodiment only the first frame of a video advertisement initially is shown, along with a large “play” button icon in the center of the advertisement screen. This is found to strongly suggest to the user to play the video advertisement without the distraction that automatic initiation might impose, or the risk that the ad might run when the user is not actually viewing the window. For ads that are images rather than videos, display is the same, other than not having the large “play” button icon.
- a timer/slider bar 670 appears in interface 600 that provides indication of playback and loading progress, as well as fast user control of forward and backward placement within the requested video.
- this interface is displayed in two colors: one to represent requested video content and another to represent advertising content.
- a red portion 671 represents requested content and a yellow portion 672 represents advertising content.
- interface 600 further distinguishes advertising content from recommended video content by including video banners e.g., 620 , 621 , but not including any advertisement banner 602 . Rather than a banner, advertising is displayed in this embodiment with only textual content (with or without a link to an advertiser's website), for example at the bottom of interface 600 .
- insertion of advertising content is facilitated by using a format that is compatible with existing/future web advertising standards, e.g., 25 character maximum header, two-line (approximately 70 character maximum) description, and 35 character maximum display URL.
- existing/future web advertising standards e.g., 25 character maximum header, two-line (approximately 70 character maximum) description, and 35 character maximum display URL.
- an interface 700 for a shared video playback website integrates advertising controls with other content.
- a window 720 representing video advertising content, playable by the user through activation of a prominent “play” button 722 .
- window 720 provides control features including a slider bar and loudspeaker icon, and further permits the advertising video to be rated using a one-to-five star rating system in the same way that the other videos, e.g., the featured videos 710 , are rated.
- interface 700 in addition to an advertising video 720 , interface 700 also includes an image advertising portion 730 .
- clicking on the image advertising portion 730 links to a website related to the advertising video 720 .
- the image advertising portion 730 is not related to the advertising video 720 .
- the area 730 may be offered first to the advertiser who provides the video 720 and offered to others if that advertiser chooses not to use the location 730 .
- advertisers themselves can reserve locations and schedule play times on the web page for their ads. For example, an advertiser may decide to run his video ad at certain times of the day, when certain videos or categories of video are shown or when certain categories of users are viewing the page.
- the video ad user interface includes a title (“How do you banana Malibu”), a source (“From: BananaMalibu”), an opportunity for users to provide comments (both written comments and video comments) and a total number of people who have rated the video, and a share button that allows a user to forward a link to the advertisement to other users.
- the share button therefore affords additional viewing opportunities.
- Some embodiments provide a user interface to control volume (as shown here by the loudspeaker icon).
- Some embodiments allow a user to mark an advertisement video as a favorite or to subscribe to a channel of advertisements from the same source, about similar topics, or from a user-selected list of advertisers.
- advertisement videos are available only for a limited time, even when favorited. In various embodiments, this limited time may be determined by the system or set by the advertiser.
- Certain aspects of the present invention include process steps and instructions described herein in the form of a method. It should be noted that the process steps and instructions of the present invention can be embodied in software, firmware or hardware, and when embodied in software, can be downloaded to reside on and be operated from different platforms used by a variety of operating systems.
- the present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.
- This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.
- the computers referred to in the specification may include a single processor or may be architectures employing multiple processor designs for increased computing capability.
