For example, let the set of parameters include a parameter ⁇ . It can be varied in the range [0, 1] by the user by turning a dial. Let the turning of the dial be associated with a metadata attribute where the metadata attribute is the time at which media content has been last accessed. For one embodiment of the present invention, the probabilistic value of the media content of the plurality of media content can be computed with the following equation:

- t i is the time at which media content O i was last accessed.
- the probabilistic value of the media content is inversely proportional to the time since it was last accessed.
- the probabilistic distribution is uniform when the value of ⁇ is 0.
- the value of ⁇ can be controlled by the user according to his choice by varying the position of the pointer 312 .
- the corresponding probabilistic distribution is determined, based on computing the probabilistic values of each of the plurality of media content with the help of equation (4). Thereafter, the list of media content desired by the user is created.
