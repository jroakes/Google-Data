Embodiment
This document has been described and has been used to generate system and the technology that comprises through the map of the user profile of geocoding.Select user data from one or more databases, and " truly " position of definite data selected.Subsequently, can indicate the position of data selected by being seated in mark on the map shown on the portable computing equipment.For example, commercial women can be in one or more web use the preservation data relevant with contact person, appointment and task.When she when its office drives to go to customer site, can on the screen of its PDA, show the icon of its instant preservation data in the neighbourhood of expression.If she has for example selected a contact person or incident by touching the residing screen area of described mark, then can show and described contact person or the relevant details of incident, such as the telephone number that is associated with contact person or appointment or the description of appointment.Then, described user for example can click to call out described telephone number, perhaps by pushing thereon or using voice command to select it.
Fig. 1 illustrates the conceptual illustration 100 that can show through the exemplarily drawing system of the user profile of geocoding.Generally, described system can extract user data from the database that comprises a plurality of data base sets, the information of being extracted is carried out geocoding, and shows the information through geocoding on the map that described system generated.In illustrated example, described exemplarily drawing system can be from web application fetches information, and can determine the physical location of institute's information extraction, promptly described information is carried out geocoding or geo-location.When the user advanced, described map system can generate map, and described map comprises the mark of each corresponding position of physical location of the information that is placed in and is extracted thereon.
For example, the user can use computing equipment that personal information is input to use such as the web of online calendar or stroke book, " to-do (job placement) " or task list, address book or address book etc.Except that other data, described personal information can comprise household and good friend's address, need finishing of task, work perhaps on the horizon and social affairs.When the user from a place when another place moves, the map that the information that is comprised in the described online application can be used to increase on the computing equipment of advancing with described user shows described computing equipment such as PDA, kneetop computer, in-vehicle navigation system or other suitable computing equipment.In some cases, can use described personal information to improve the output of other type.For example, the personal information that is comprised in the online application can be used to trigger voice reminder near with the corresponding position of described personal information the time or make computing equipment vibrate as the user.
Especially referring to Fig. 1, image 102 is by the screenshotss that can show through the demonstration that exemplarily drawing system produced of the user profile of geocoding.In illustrated example, can represent by incident 122 and contact person's 118 mark or icon through the information of geocoding.In some embodiments, mark 118,122 can use with web and the online data warehouse in the user data that comprised be associated.For example, described user data can reside in one or more web application such as GOOGLE CALENDAR, GOOGLE MAPS, GOOGLE DOCS, perhaps resides in other the proper procedure based on web.In other embodiments, each mark 118,122 can be corresponding to the information that is comprised in the computing equipment such as PDA, personal computer, kneetop computer, cell phone etc., perhaps corresponding to be stored in mobile device and with the information of the database synchronization of central server system.
In illustrated example, user's information can be stored in one or more application, and except that other suitable data-management application, described application can comprise calendar 108, address book 104 and task list 106.Event flag 122 can be represented the on the horizon and doctor's that arranged in the calendar 108 for example appointment, and contact person's mark 118 can symbolism address book 104 in listed colleague.The position that incident 122 and contact person 118 are marked on the map can be determined by represented incident of mark 118,122 or contact person's geospatial location.In example described above, the storing of incident 122 and contact person's 118 marks can correspond respectively to doctor's office and other physical location of contact.
Can be by the text message that comes self-application be carried out the position that geocoding is determined incident or contact person.For example, contacts entries can comprise the address such as " 01 Broadway; St.Louis Park; MN " in address field, and use and to check this address field and then such information be carried out geocoding, such as by described text message is committed to server, described server be programmed to utilize such as longitude and latitude to or the geocoding information of other appropriate format the information through geocoding respond.In a similar fashion, filtrator can check that appointment describes the explicit address information seek such as street name, perhaps such as the more implicit address information of dining room title (for example, " lunch at Spago ") and so on.
For example, can carry out the conversion of such text address information by first service and second service, described first service is excavated customer data base at such information, and described second serves described text message is converted to information through geocoding.Conversion it is also conceivable that various context factors.For example, the appointment for carrying out at approximately lunch or date for dinner can add search inquiry with word " dining room ".In a similar fashion, can at first search for, and this search can be used as local search and carry out in current zone around user's mobile device the database that comprises business listing.
In other embodiments, event flag 122 can corresponding to the listed different place of ad-hoc location of customer data base.For example, event flag 122 can be relevant with uncompleted task in the task list 106.In illustrated embodiment, described system can resolve and select one or more keywords or phrase such as " groceries ", " mail " and " dry-cleaning " to the unsettled task in the task list 106.Subsequently, described system can generate synonym-in current example to described keyword, and described map system can be respectively selected keyword and produce " supermarket ", " post office " and " laundry "-and be complementary and be in the searching for reference map datum of the clauses and subclauses within the predetermined radii of user's current location at the synonym with selected keyword or keyword.These data then can be retrieved by described system.Use and relevant street address or the out of Memory of coupling clauses and subclauses, described map system can utilize the event flag 122 amplification maps corresponding to the physical location of described coupling clauses and subclauses.In current example, when the user when avenue is advanced, described map system can be put the event flag 122 corresponding to a plurality of local grocery store, United States Postal Service and drycleaner's in user's specific range on map.
Described system can carry out similar processing to the calendar event that is ranked that lacks the certain location relevant information.In some cases, the user may import too common and can't carry out the position of geocoding or not comprise the calendar event of position; For example " 2007.11.01, Thursday, 8:00pm saw a film ".By following process described above (resolve clauses and subclauses, generate synonym and search), described system can and can comprise events corresponding mark 122 in user's near zone location cinema on map.
Understand spatial relationship between the represented position of user's position and map label 118,122 for the ease of the user, described system can be that some mark adopts color or transparent mechanism.In some cases, the user may be difficult to determine incident that user and map label 118,122 are represented or the relative distance between the contact person.For example, when the user also when driving motor vehicles, it may be difficult to the map scale of recognizing that map system is shown.In other words, the user possibly can't judge that shown mark 118,122 is 2 miles still 20 miles apart from it.In some embodiments, can show the mark 118,122 that is within the user preset distance with the color that is different from other mark.For example, the mark that is within the predeterminable range can be redness, and all other marks then are blue; Yet, can use other color mechanism.In a similar manner, the size of mark can more change near the current location of user's mobile device along with them.
In other embodiments, mark 118,122 can along with the user near or begin to fade in or fade out away from mark 118,122.For example, when the user comes home from work, thin out when the mark 118 of expression office can be outside the user moves to presumptive area (, become more transparent).Similarly, the mark 118 of expression user family can become more opaque during near its family the user.In some embodiments, color and transparent mechanism can combine.For example, the map label 118,122 that is in outside the user peripheral region can become blue and thin out along with the user away from its physical location; Near mark 118,122 can redden near the physical location of mark and opaquer along with the user.
In some embodiments, mark 118,122 can be the image that is associated with contact person or incident.For example, it is represented that the contact person can be included in web people's in using image by its contact details, and the picture of the position that incident can be undertaken by described incident is represented.In other embodiments, contact person and incident can be divided into the broad categories such as colleague, household, good friend, work, family, gymnasium etc.Each classification can be associated with different images; The contact person and the incident that are within the given classification can be represented by the image that is associated on map shows.And, go out as shown, mark can be simply based on the storehouse collection that obtains relevant information and difference, described storehouse collection is contact person, appointment or task list for example.
Can represent in map, to close on contact person 118 and incident 122 marks shown in the zone of current shown map segment from screen (off-screen) mark 112,114.In some embodiments, the shown map segment of described map system can not comprise all user's geocoding information.For example, described system can generate the map of user's 5 mile radius inner regions; Any incident 122 outside this zone or contact person's 118 marks can not appear on the screen.In some embodiments, can be placed at expression from the direction arrow of the direction of screen contact person or incident 110 below or on the map of the side demonstration edge from screen mark 118,122.Each can comprise the numeral of not presented event that indication can show or contact person's quantity respectively in follow-up map segment from screen mark 112,114.If do not show that then direction arrow 110 can be represented the current direction of advancing of user from the screen mark.
The details that is associated with contact person or incident may be displayed in the messagewindow 116 that is linked to contact person 118 or incident 122 marks.Messagewindow 116 can close on mark 120, perhaps in some embodiments, can be positioned near its mark that is associated in non-mode of closing on.Can from the information being stored in one or more web application or other suitable sources, extract details.For example, if mark 118,122 expression contact persons, then shown details can comprise contact person's name, address, telephone number etc. in the messagewindow 116.
Show that shown mark also can filter in common mode on 102.Particularly, can in demonstration 102, button be shown, can be when it is selected so that the mark of some type (for example, task list, contact person or appointment) occurs or disappears.Such interactivity can with the user is current can be similar to the mode of adding layer (for example, at street name, geocoding photo etc.) such as the application of GOOGLE MAPS.By this way, the user can be provided to its demonstration is carried out personalization and prevented the ability that it becomes chaotic owing to the current information that has nothing to do with the user.
And certain user's information can be by automatic fitration.For example, the appointment data flag activation that can only be correlated with to the appointment of carrying out on recent (that is the same day).In a similar manner, contact person's mark can only be limited to intimate good friend or kinsfolk.Associated person information also can extract from social networks is used, and mark can only be limited to other social contact person of the first order, perhaps limits by similar limiting factor.
In some cases, equipment can monitor its position and the user be given a warning near interested place is in the time.For example, as user during near relevant position (for example, family or enterprise), equipment can be initiated the sense of hearing (for example, voice reminder) or sense of touch (for example, vibration) indication to notify the user near interested place.In some cases, these warnings can be triggered near desired locations or incident by physics, time or navigation.For example, can work as the user and be in alerts triggered when specifying within 5 miles of the enterprises.In some embodiments, can be when incident be about to begin alerts triggered.For example, equipment can be before film beginning vibrates in 15 minutes.In other cases, alerts triggered in the time of can being positioned at the next door in the outlet of desired locations (for example, grocery store).In some embodiments, these sense of hearings or tactile alert can be used as replenish (perhaps it substitutes) outside warning, prompting or the icon that can occur on map shows.
In some embodiments, trigger event can be that the user is specified.For example, the user can be provided with warning based on weather forecast or current weather condition, price comparison, birthday, wave report etc.In some cases, the user can or warn indication to combine with one or more trigger events and form warning.For example, the user can should provide vibrating alert and suitable map icon by designated equipment when selected film also has the movie theatre of 15 minutes these films of starting and show to be within 10 miles.
In the alternative embodiment, can generate trigger event automatically for the user.For example, the user can select from receiving suggestion such as the general commending system that adopts of online retailer.Except that other method, these commending systems can be advised interested article like the interested project of client or by the purchase of checking the user is historical to the user by for example recognition category.Described commending system can offer the suggestion of being discerned map system, and described map system generates suitable prompting (for example, map icon, voice reminder or tactile alert) then.In illustrated example, the user can order the movie rental service, and it can provide film to recommend to its subscriber.The similar film generation recommendation of film of certain other standard can have been watched or satisfied in described service to the user.If the user selects to receive suggestion from this service, this service just can offer these recommendations user's map system.Described system then can be to recommending to carry out geocoding.For example, system can generate the map icon of the position in the movie rental shop with the film of recommending of expressing possibility.Perhaps, just show in movie theatre if the film of being recommended is current, the map icon of the theater location of the described film of expression projection can be created by then described system.In some embodiments, described recommendation service can be created and remind and transfer them to map system.Though illustrated in commending system in the example related to movie rental, can use other commending system.For example, can use the commending system of advising interested product of possibility or service to the user.
Fig. 2 A is the block diagram 200 that can show through the exemplarily drawing system of the user profile of geocoding.Described system can comprise the remote computing device 204 (for example, laptop computer, PDA, smart phone, portable navigation device etc.) that is associated with vehicle 206, and it can communicate with the application 202 of drawing by the network 208 such as the internet.The application 202 of drawing can comprise user data 220, one or more application 218, position resolution module 216, position delver 214, user data ground module 212 and interface 210.
In illustrated embodiment, the application 202 of drawing may be implemented as the set in module, application and online data warehouse based on web.As discussed in reference to Figure 1, except other data, user data 220 can be included in the information that is found in user's calendar 108, task list 106 and the address book 104.Position delver 214 can be to user data 220 searching position information.For example, position delver 214 can be to the particular text of predetermined user file search such as the positional information of ground party name (for example, the White House), address, coordinate data or other type.
In some embodiments, position delver 214 may be implemented as " web crawl device (crawler) " to the text of some site search indicating positions.For example, position delver 214 can be to selected site search enterprise name, regional title, address etc.In some embodiments, the data that described position delver can be searched for specified format, for example, word " Apartment " or " Apt ", Hezhou, city title etc. of 5 continuous numerical digits (potential zip coding), the one or more numerals of heel.In other embodiments, described position delver can be searched for the text of predefined indicating positions, such as " Walker Museum ", " Dinkytown " or " the University of Minnesota ".In some cases, position delver 214 can perhaps can utilize the mode described above pair location-based information of data search that is associated with application from the location-based information of predetermined web application request.
As an alternative, substitute except user data 220 is searched for the location-based data or as it, user or other entity can use 202 for drawing provide positional information.In some embodiments, the user can use remote computing device 204 to the 202 direct input position information of application of drawing.In other embodiments, contact person or incident also can be to using 202 communicate location information.In the exemplary embodiment, as user during near some contact person or incident, described contact person or incident can be used 202 to drawing and send the information relevant with its position.For example, when the user comes within the distance to a declared goal in shop, the computer system in described shop can (for example obtain warning with regard to this user's existence, equipment can transmit signal to the shop), and in response, send the address in shop and out of Memory (for example, relevant information) to system 202 with the current sales promotion in shop.In a similar manner, the contact person can send to the user with its positional information when the user is in its near zone.
Described user can be provided to the control to the bulk information of relevant its position of once sharing with system or other user.Particularly, can only take sure step to agree just to allow information sharing under this shared situation, thereby system default be the privacy of protection user data the user.
When needing the current location of identification equipment, computing equipment 204 can utilize network 208 that its position is sent to draw and use 202.Under these circumstances, the GPS on the equipment 204 or other technology can generate location identifier in a known way.When using tower triangulation, the application 202 of drawing can oneself be determined the position of equipment 204.
Task in the application 202 of drawing is to utilize under the situation of the information amplification map relevant with user data, and drawing uses 202 can determine whether that the Reference Map data are corresponding to the position of equipment 204 arbitrarily.For example, equipment 204 can send the longitude and the latitude of its current location to the application 202 of drawing by suitable means of communication.After the application 202 of drawing receives described data, draw 202 positions that can search in the Reference Map data corresponding to providing data are provided.
User data ground module 212 can generate the map of user's current location, and it comprises the user profile through geocoding.Described map can generate in every way, such as the mode that is provided with GOOGLE MAPS.For example, can determine the zoom level of map, and can obtain a plurality of map tile (tile) around the customer location that is in this zoom level and be sent to equipment 204 so that show to the user.
In some embodiments, user data ground module 212 is then determined the physical location of the data that position delver 214 is collected.For example, position delver 214 can provide (for example, position resolution module 216 is generated) street address or latitude and longitude information of each dependent event of having excavated for user data ground module 212.Subsequently, user data ground module 212 can be located described address and be selected suitable mark to be associated with the map datum of being located in the Reference Map data.At last, ground module 212 can utilize the mark of expression customer location to create and the map that increases shows.

In some embodiments, location engine 254 can also be handled the location-based data of being stored in the location-based data storage 258.In some embodiments, location engine 254 can be to the corresponding map entity of location-based data that is comprised in Reference Map data search and the location-based data storage 258.For example, location engine 254 can be to map datum search and keyword (for example, " Mount Rushmore "), coordinate data, street address, location name or the relevant entity of other such information that finds in location-based data storage 252.In case location engine 254 has found corresponding entity, it just sends to user data ground module 252 with the coordinate of described entity.
In some embodiments, (for example, user's current location and the incident that is associated with the user) map through user's current location of the user profile of geocoding can be created and comprised to user data ground module 252.Ground module 252 can be called when the user selects icon in the demonstration of equipment 242, so that the navigation application on the starting outfit 242.Location-based data also can be provided for location engine 254 in advance so that from instrument or theme (for example, " Tony ' s Pizza " or " milk ") or the address is (for example, " 123 Main St.; Anytown, CA ") text representation be converted to such as the right location identifier of latitude and longitude coordinates.Under these circumstances, described coordinate is to may being stored in the location-based data 258, and ground module 252 can directly be visited such data.
In some cases, can between computing equipment, divide about Fig. 2 A and the described function of 2B more than.For example, except that other, the remote computing device such as PDA, kneetop computer or portable navigation device can comprise to be used and user data.Except that other assembly, be stored in drawing on the remote server for example and use and to comprise position delver, position resolution module and user data ground module.In this embodiment, remote computing device can be sent to the application of drawing with user and application data, and described drawing is used can generate the map that can comprise through the user profile of geocoding then.In other embodiments, remote computing device can comprise to draw to be used, described drawing is used can comprise for example position delver, position resolution module and user data ground module, and except that other, remote server can comprise to be used and user data.In this embodiment, remote computing device can use application that remote server provides and user data to generate map through geocoding.
Fig. 3 A and 3B are used to generate the process flow diagram that comprises through the example process 300,320 of the map of the user profile of geocoding.Process 300 can be for example carried out by the system such as system 200 and 240, and is concise and to the point in order to present, following description using system 200 and 240 and notion Figure 100 as the example that is used to describe described process.Yet, can use the combination of other system or system to come implementation 300,320.Usually, the process 300 of Fig. 3 A comprises the location-based data of discerning the user and utilizes the position of using track user that described application then shows described data on the map around the customer location.Fig. 3 B comprises similar process 320, but the tracking of customer location carry out by the location tracking module of special purpose, its then to application report may be relevant with described application incident, thereby described application can be upgraded its demonstration to the user.
Referring to Fig. 3 A, flowchart illustrations be used to create the process 300 that comprises through the map of the user profile of geocoding.In step 302, the identification subscriber data file.In some embodiments, position delver 214 can may comprise the user file of location-based data to user data 220 search.In some embodiments, position delver 214 can be searched for the file with specified file extension name, the file that is positioned at assigned address (for example, being in specific web address), and perhaps the user can search for for position delver 214 by the intended target file.In some embodiments, web uses and can specify by the web address of for example using.
Under the situation on the server, position delver 214 can be asked web to use and be sent the data file that may comprise user profile in data storage.In some cases, position delver 214 can be asked predetermined data file; In other cases, data file can be used dynamically by web and generate.In other cases, position delver 214 can carry out " creeping " and extract location-based data website of using and the data storage that is associated.For example, as previously discussed, position delver 214 can be at comprising such as the text of the positional information of coordinate data, address etc. or other data and access application website and the data storage that is associated.
Described method proceeds to step 304, wherein excavates the relevant data in position from file.In some embodiments, position delver 214 can be searched for location-based data to subscriber data file.For example, position delver 214 can and be resolved street address, road and crossing title, coordinate data (for example, longitude and dimension) and location name (for example, enterprise, city, cities and towns, state etc.) to the subscriber data file search.In addition, position delver 214 can be at data search keyword (for example, hotel, market, mend shoes etc.), key phrase (near for example, the hotel the LaGuardia), geographic entity (for example, Dinkydome) and drive direction (for example, from Chicago to Minneapolis).Such extraction can be carried out according to any mechanism in the multiple mechanisms known.Extraction in this example is striden a plurality of data base sets and is carried out, such as contact person, task list and appointment.
After excavating the position related data from one or more files, the data of excavating in step 306 are classified into a plurality of groups.In some cases, position delver 214 can based on data type with location dependent data be referred to different classes of among.For example, data can be classified in the following classification: street address, road and crossing title, coordinate data, location name, keyword, key phrase, geographic entity and driving direction.In the alternative embodiment, can come described data are classified by the treatment capacity that before data are carried out mapping, may need.Before it is used by user data ground module 212, may not need the data (for example, coordinate data) of operating can with need the coming of for example keyword and key phrase and so on by the data separation that ground module 212 is handled.
Described data then can be submitted so that be converted to versions of data through geocoding.For example, mobile device can be committed to the location dependent information that is excavated the geocoding server, and described geocoding server can return the coordinate data with the corresponding one or more positions of described location dependent information.Carried out under the situation of classification in advance in described information according to data being carried out the required treatment capacity of mapping, can carry out local geocoding to some data, wherein such geocoding is simple relatively, and out of Memory can be submitted to remote server so that carry out geocoding.
When after step 306 data are classified in the group, monitor the position of computing equipment 204 in step 308.For example, map application can be basically continuously the GPS module on the slave unit 204 receive information, perhaps along with equipment receiving equipment 204 positional information when geographical is advanced through upgrading.
Subsequently, in step 310 identification with show the data that are in current location.For example, the zoom level of map around position that process 30 can identification equipment 204 and the equipment 204.Such information can be used to discern onesize or greater than the bounding box (for example, in the time will indicating the incident of leaving the map edge) of described map with map to display.Process 300 can search for the incident (for example, contact person, appointment etc.) of identification and all incidents in the identification institute computation bound frame to some extent, described incident can be stored in the table, a hurdle of described table is the position through geocoding of described incident.In addition, can submit to inquiry finding out the extraneous term in the appropriate area, such as under one in user's incident the situation being near the equipment 204 any grocery store for the task of taking milk and bread to remote server.The Search Results of such inquiry can be added to discern and be presented at data on the map as covering.
In some embodiments, the position of computing equipment 204 can be sent to user data ground module 212 so that generate suitable map datum.The use location related data, user data ground module 212 can be created the map of user's current location.For example, the longitude and the dimension of the current location of equipment 204 can be sent to user data ground module 212.After receiving described location-based data, ground module 212 can be provided in its Reference Map data by the corresponding position of coordinate that is provided with resolution module 216, perhaps described position can be committed to remote server so that with the map datum of this position resolution for this position.During device location in finding the Reference Map data, ground module 212 can specify radius (for example from memory load, 5 miles) or the interior all map datum points of bounding box are (for example, be in the map tile of suitable zoom level), perhaps can carry out mark so that with aftertreatment to described data.
Next, the location-based data that can use location delver 214 be provided of ground module 212 determine to show what user profile (if there is) on the map of user's current location that ground module 212 is created.In some embodiments, position delver 214 can send to ground module 212 together with the data through geocoding of described location dependent data with the location dependent data that extracted from user data 220.
In case received location dependent data, ground module 212 just can find the corresponding one or more positions of the location-based data that provided with position delver 214 in its Reference Map data.For example, ground module 212 can define the border of its map that will create at first; For example, ground module 212 is the interior map datum of explicit user current location 5 mile radius only, perhaps the data in certain bounding box.Next, ground module 212 can determine whether certain location-based data that position delver 214 is provided fall within the map boundary line.In some embodiments, ground module 212 can at first determine whether be in outside the map boundary line from the location-based data (for example, coordinate data) that can not need further to handle of position delver 214; If just from map, get rid of these location-based data.Then, ground module 212 can will may need the location-based data (for example, keyword or phrase) of operation bidirectional to compare with map boundary line; As the above mentioned, the location-based data that are in outside the map boundary line will can not be included in the map.For example, position delver 214 can provide keyword " hotel (hotel) " for map module 212.Ground module 212 can generate the synonym (for example, " inn " or " lodge ") of " hotel ", and its Reference Map data search is comprised one or more position in these words.The coordinate (if existence) that comprises one map datum in keyword or its synonym can compare with the map boundary line that is generated before, and can get rid of the coordinate data that is in outside the described border from map.Yet generally, indefinite like this location dependent data at first will be by geocoding or is handled in addition, so that it can be tracked moves and illustrate in the current active window of map so that be included in the user.
When the position in the Reference Map data was determined when subscriber equipment and relevant user data, ground module 212 can provide data so that generate map on the mobile computing device such as equipment 204.Providing like this can be carried out this locality, and wherein said data centralization perhaps can be used as on the network such as the internet to transmit to the user's data of computing equipment 204 from the server that Map Services is provided and carries out on equipment 204 self.
In case discerned and shown the data of current location, described method just proceeds to step 312.In step 312, receive the selection and the display items display details of project (for example, incident 122 or contact person's 188 mark) from the user.In some embodiments, when the relevant information of user expectation and mark 118,122, this user can select described mark, and in response, ground module 212 can show desired information in messagewindow 116.For example, the user can select to illustrate this icon of the icon of one photo among the user good friend-wherein and be displayed on the address in the described good friend contact person file-and can be in the detailed contact details of this good friend shown in the pop-up box.
In some embodiments, messagewindow 116 can show when the user enters in incident or contact person's the preset distance automatically.For example, suppose that the user will be interested in such information at once, the appointment that closes on very much may be very rare and important so that they show with messagewindow 116 completely.As an alternative, messagewindow 116 can be used as the mutual of user and map system and shows, described for example keyboard knocks alternately, pen or finger tapping, perhaps other suitably input (for example, voice).When being shown, messagewindow 116 also can be partially transparent and can not block following map.
In some embodiments, the information that may be linked to contact person or other incident that comprised in can explicit user data 220 of messagewindow 116.For example, except from user data 220 selected other data, the messagewindow 116 that is used for the contact person can comprise contact person's name, address and family and office telephone number.In some embodiments, the collected information of map system can be used as to comprise the additional of information in the user data 220 or substitute and uses.For example, map system can be with the title inputted search engine of contact person or incident, and can be in messagewindow 116 display of search results or summary as a result.Equally, in incident is under the situation of " milk " or similar keyword, can obtain location dependent information in response to the local search queries to " milk " or " grocery store " in equipment 204 peripheral regions, and the specific detail (for example, enterprise address and telephone number) from Search Results may be displayed in the messagewindow 116.
In the alternative embodiment, messagewindow 116 can also demonstration and the relevant data of relation of user and described contact person or incident.For example, system 200 can use the current location of equipment and speed (it can be provided by the device such as gps receiver and accelerometer in the equipment) to calculate the estimated time that the user arrives the position that is associated with selected mark 118,122.In case calculate, map system just can show the time of arrival of estimating in messagewindow 116.
Ground module 212 (perhaps in other embodiments, computing equipment 204) can be seated in messagewindow 116 on the map in the mode that increases the quantity of appreciable mark 118,122 on the map.In some embodiments, illustrated as the messagewindow 116 of contact person's mark 120, incident 122 or contact person's 118 marks that messagewindow 116 can adjacent window 116 be associated; Yet in some cases, if window 116 closes on its mark that is associated 118,120, window 116 will block a plurality of other marks 118,122 can't see it.In order to make the quantity maximization of appreciable mark 118,122 on the screen, map system can be seated in messagewindow 116 and not comprise any mark 118,122 or comprise in the viewing area of mark 118,122 of minimum number.As an alternative, system 200 can be decreased to the size of window 116 predetermined minimum window size to reduce the quantity of the mark 118,122 that is covered by window 116.System 200 can also be seated in window 116 on the zone away from the equipment direct of travel, thereby the zone in user the place ahead just can not be blocked on map.
In some instances, messagewindow 116 can the demonstration real-time information relevant with incident or contact person.For example, event flag 122 can represent may be postponed or cancel under the regular situation incident of influence, such as flight or train departure.In some embodiments, the data warehouse relevant with incident can be inquired about by system 200, and in messagewindow 116 state of presented event.Illustrated in the example, when the user drove to go to the airport, map system can be made regular check on the website, course line and this information (for example, current scheduling board or departure time) is included in the messagewindow 116 at update mode information.
Referring to Fig. 3 B, flowchart illustrations be used to create the alternative illustrative methods that comprises through the map of the user profile of geocoding.Generally, the method 300 among this method and Fig. 3 A is similar, but the positional information that has been to use special-purpose location tracking module to come surveillance equipment.Such module can be the module discrete with map application, and described map application can be the form of the service that operating system provided on the equipment.Various application can utilize the location-based data of this module registers, such as position or the bounding box of using the object of wishing tracking.Described tracing module can be stored the such object and the tabulation of position thereof, and the designator of having registered the application of described object.Described module then can be such as continuing receiving position information from the GPS module, and the positional information of this information and institute's storage object is compared.When the location was overlapping, described module can be warned suitable application and the current location of equipment can be sent to described application.
By this way, individual module can be managed the location tracking of a plurality of application.Described a plurality of application not all needs from GPS module solicited message, and can reduce the processing expenditure and the required power of trace location of system thus.Meanwhile, each application can be registered its demand and when can in officely why want thus, but also only where necessary, obtains notice and reacts.By this way, can carry out effective management of relevant warning in position and task.
Referring now to method 320,, step 302 step 322 and 324 (discern subscriber data file respectively and excavate location-based data) and Fig. 3 A and 304 identical from described file, therefore above description to step 302 and 304 can be applied to step 322 and 324 equally, and will not carry out repetition here.In step 326, utilize the location-based data of location tracking module registers.For example, certain data in the Reference Map data can be labeled, and promptly are registered, with the position of indicating positions related data.In some embodiments, the described location tracking module part that can be position resolution module 216; In other embodiments, described location tracking module can be the part of location engine 254 or other suitable hardware device or software application.In addition, the location-based data of being registered can comprise " focus ", promptly point out the map segment of demonstration through the user profile of geocoding in response to the user imports the respective physical position.For example, when user's position corresponding to the Reference Map data of ground module 212 in during regional in " focus ", ground module 212 can be utilized the map through the user profile amplification user current location of geocoding.
After the location-based data of having utilized the location tracking module registers, in the position of step 328 surveillance equipment.In some embodiments, the location tracking module can be regularly from computing equipment 204 request position information.In the alternative embodiment, the location tracking module can be used the position of GPS technique computes equipment, perhaps uses the position of base station control tower 244 to come the position of computing equipment by triangulation.
In step 330, trigger the user data location.For example, the user can import " focus ", and in response, the next map that map system can be provided with sign or the generation of other designator notice shows the user profile that can comprise through geocoding.Such triggering can be undertaken by the location tracking module, and it checks the tabulation of registration location at every turn when receiving the information relevant with device location.The tabulation of institute's registration location can be by the location tracking module stores, thereby the most approaching position of current and current location equipment is placed in the top of tabulation.By this way, make the most relevant position to be obtained easily by described module.
In response to triggering the user data position, system 200 can start user data applications or otherwise make application activating in step 332.In some embodiments, user data applications can be collected the Reference Map data that comprise user's current location.For example, map system can start user data ground module 212, in some embodiments, described user data ground module 212 can be from the current location of suitable entity requests equipment 204, and in case receive this position, just be in current location and preset reference data within the radius from memory load.Therefore, for example, map application can keep stopping action during not near anything relevant with map application the user, is triggered automatically when regional and shows from the trend user but described application can enter it in dependent event.
At last, in step 334 and 336, the data of identification and demonstration current location, and, show the details relevant with this project in response to project choice.For the illustrative methods of execution in step 334 and 336, the reader sees also the step 310 of Fig. 3 A and 312 discussion.
And, though the position of map is indicated as the data that depend on the equipment current location here, also can use other location-based data.For example, the user can input position as inquiry, and shown map can be the map around this zone.Therefore, for example, the user can plan the business travel in a zone, and zip coding that should the zone can be input in its computing equipment.The icon that she then can be shown this regional map and cover its each contact person in this zone on the described map automatically.She can be with various familiar mode convergent-divergent maps and moving thereon, and and do not rely on its current position.
Fig. 4 A illustrates and is used for creating the illustrative methods comprise through the map of the user profile of geocoding at client-server environment.Described client-server environment can be made of a plurality of server and client side.In some embodiments, a client can be personal computer, kneetop computer, and perhaps the user can import the similar computing equipment of the user profile that is stored in subsequently on the server.Described server can comprise one or more web programs and can handle the also online data warehouse of storing subscriber information.Second client can be carried out extra processing and demonstration and comprise map through the user profile of geocoding.For example, described second client can be PDA, navigational system, other portable computing device that perhaps comprises location tracking hardware and/or software and can communicate with other client and server.
Described method receives user profile there in step 402 beginning.In some embodiments, the user can import contact person, appointment and task in web uses.For example, the user can be input to appointment in the online calendar program such as GOOGLE CALENDAR or other proper procedure.In the alternative embodiment, user profile can be imported in the computing equipment such as PDA, kneetop computer, navigational system etc.
After step 402 receives user profile, in the described user profile of step 404 registration.In step 404, described information can be associated with particular user account (that is, being registered).For example, after step 404 input user profile, identifying information (for example, the title of user account) can be linked to described user profile.Subsequently, described user profile can be stored on the server in step 406.
In case user profile has been received and has been stored on the server, described method just proceeds to step 408, at location dependent information described user profile is excavated there.In some embodiments, position delver 214 can carry out combing to the user profile of being preserved at location dependent data.Position delver 214 can be to word, phrase or the numerical data of the text resolution indicating positions that found in the user profile.For example, position delver 214 can the searching enterprise title, drive direction, coordinate data etc.
In step 410, the user can utilize second client device to register to user account.In some cases, user account can be used relevant with one or more web.In the exemplary embodiment, the user can come registered user account by for example utilizing any necessary log-on message to sign in to described user account from portable computing device, and described necessary log-on message is such as username and password.In case the user logins, server just can authenticate at step 412 couple user's equipment.For example, can correctly authenticate by the checking username and password that the user provided.
After equipment is certified, in step 414 communicate location information.The positional information of excavating from user profile in step 408 can be sent to client (being portable computing device here) from server, and described client is preserved described positional information in step 416.The information of Chuan Songing can comprise the coordinate of each incident that is associated with the user like this, and the descriptor of described incident, thereby described incident can show to the user on map.
Next, moving at step 418 surveillance equipment.For example, described equipment can use the location tracking instrument such as gps receiver to determine its position continuously.When its position of equipment monitor, any location-based data that it can be in step 420 surveyed area.In some embodiments, when described equipment when step 418 is determined its current location, it can be to server in the positional information that step 414 provided be searched for its current location preset distance or the optional position information in the defined bounding box, described bounding box for example can be that size is for the frame of current map view or greater than the frame (for example, each side at current shown map is several times as much as the map size) of described map view.For example, the positional information that server provided can comprise coordinate data (for example, longitude and latitude).For example, described client can determine that the set of which longitude and latitude falls within 5 mile radius of equipment current location.
If location-based data are identified in the described zone, then described method proceeds to optional step 422, obtains there and the relevant user data of described location-based data.In some embodiments, described client can be from server requests and the relevant user data of the location-based data of being discerned.In response, described server can transmit and the relevant user data of being discerned of location-based data in step 424.For example, in some embodiments, the location-based data that server provided can be associated with contact person, incident or the task in one or more online application.Described server can transmit the corresponding contact person of location-based data, incident or the mission bit stream of discerning with client.In the alternative embodiment, the user data that is associated with the location-based data of being discerned can reside on the client.
And, can regularly inquire about another server along with equipment moves such as local search server.Particularly, inquiry can be relevant with the keyword that is found in user's personal data.And other form can be taked in keyword, such as the form that is used for searching the advertisement or promotion material in the user area.As an example, if the user has the appointment at " flight ", suppose that then the user will can not have a dinner aboard and can accept the advertisement of food, system can show the advertisement in the dining room in the zone that arrives at the airport.
In step 426, the display items display details.Show in the messagewindow 116 of mark 118,122 that item specific can be on closing on map.For example, can be in the messagewindow 116 that is attached to event flag 122 position, duration and start time of presented event.
Fig. 4 B illustrates and is used for creating the alternative illustrative methods comprise through the map of the user profile of geocoding at client-server environment.Identical with the method 320 among Fig. 3 B, this method depends on the warning that the location tracking module is helped to manage the supervision of position of mobile equipment and can be depended on the application of location dependent data.
Described method is in step 432 beginning, there by user data module accesses user data.For example, described user data module can be from server requests user data (for example, contact person, incident and task), and described server is distributed the data of being asked in step 434 to the user data module.The user can import such information in advance, perhaps can (such as the use electric commerce card or via the request of meeting) receive this information there from other people.Subsequently, at the described user data of location-based data filter.For example, can locate and extract may the information relevant with the position in the user data for described user data module.For example, the user data module can be extracted historic site title, crossing, address etc.
After step 436 is excavated or has otherwise been extracted location-based data, can be at step 438 registration location designator.In some embodiments, the user data module can be transformed to coordinate data with some location-based data (for example, place name and keyword).For example, the user data module can compare to determine that whether arbitrary name and keyword are corresponding to known location with place name and keyword and Reference Map data; If then mating location name or keyword can be associated with corresponding known location, just is registered.In step 440, location pointer can be accumulated.For example, described location pointer can be grouped and store.
