As introduction, subject, which is related to social media, to be shared, and is more particularly to be based on personal user's preference and privacy
Set to promote identification and content recommendation for carrying out shared system, method and computer-readable medium in social context.
Individualized content, which is recommended to be usually directed to, checks user and personal content consumption/interactive history of various types of contents, described
Content such as user access or check content, user viewing video, user search content, user listen song, user
Approve content, content of users to share of (for example, like, collect, subscribe to), etc..Personal content consumption based on user
History is that recommendation is presented so that shared content is generally acknowledged to be non-invasive for the privacy of user in user, and reason is
It does not disclose the information relevant with the personal content consumption/interactive history and preference of the user to other people.
However, user study is it has been shown that be supplied to the social networks good friend of user or the commending contents of follower to see
When getting up to disclose their private contents accreditation and consumption history, the user thinks that this is extremely uneasy.Specifically, user
Often by accesses control list and various types of possible user content consumption/interactive actions (for example, access, check, watch,
Accreditation, shared etc.) it is associated, the accesses control list limits and whom is controlled be able to access that the You Guan content consumption/friendship
The data mutually acted.Using private contents consumption/interaction data of user come to disclose the private contents of user consumption/friendship
The access control that the mode of mutual data violates user to another user's content recommendation is set.
For example, in the social context of the small user group of shared video mutually is related to, provided that giving the group
In the video recommendations of the first user be the viewing history based on the second user in the group, then the first user will likely be false
If the audio content for being recommended to first user is likely to be watched or approved by another user in group.If group
Second user in group it is chosen by his or her viewing history remain privacy (for example, via user with he or she
The associated access control of viewing history set), then the individual privacy of second user is just invaded.For example, second uses
Family --- assuming that its name is Michael --- is recommended the video about strange or embarrassing topic simultaneously in the first user
And first user by itself and inquiry " Who in the world would ever watch this video！I bet
it was you Michael！(who can see this video in the world for this！It is your Michael that I, which bets,！) " comment be shared with group
It can feel especially awkward in the case of group.

Receive and dispatch keyword, topic, the tone and the other characteristics of session.
Inaccessible data mining component 106 is configurable to generate second associated with the messaging sessions and protected
Protect data acquisition system.The protected data includes one or more of other users in specific user's inaccessible but group
Addressable data.For example, second data acquisition system can include the private data of other users in group.At another
In example, second data acquisition system can be included by two or more user-accessibles in group but the specific user
The data of inaccessible.For example, when content provider is Streaming Media supplier, second data acquisition system can include described
Specific user's inaccessible, relevant with use of one or more of the other user to media provider data (for example, they
Private viewing history, private search's inquiry), and specific user's inaccessible, about one in group or more
The accreditation data of the accreditation for the media content that individual other users are provided media provider.
Recommendation component 110 be configured as based on the second protected data set come select the subset of candidate content item with
Recommend or be presented to user.For example, recommendation component 110 check that candidate content item and based on the second data acquisition system come to it
Sorted out, ranking and/or filtering so as to identify with the preference of other users in the preference of specific user, group and
The subset of the mostly concerned candidate content item of the theme or context of messaging sessions is to be recommended.In another example,
Recommendation component 110 check that candidate content item and based on the second data acquisition system to be sorted out to them, ranking and/or mistake
Filter is to identify the subset of candidate content item to be recommended, in the subset of the candidate content item and the preference of specific user, group
The one or more that the preference of other users, the theme of messaging sessions or context and the specific user are provided is looked into
It is mostly concerned to ask search terms.According to the example, recommendation component 110 can return to the search query results with candidate content item
(for example, relative with recommendation list).Candidate content item is sorted out via it, filtered and each mechanism of ranking is closed below
Discussed in more detail in Fig. 4-6.
Due to the second protected data set of specific user's inaccessible, so it can not be used to find out candidate content item
To recommend the specific user.However, it can be used to the set of the candidate content item to being identified based on seed data
Carry out ranking, classification and/or filtering.As a result, candidate is not based on the data of specific user's inaccessible to be selected,
The private data of other users in the data such as group.Therefore, the content item of the private viewing of the user in group or accreditation
Another user that (for example, video) is changed into being recommended in group has low probability for the chance for carrying out shared content item.

Fig. 4 is presented according to aspects described herein and embodiment, is set based on personal user's preference and privacy
Put to promote identification and content recommendation for carrying out another shared example system 400 in social context.System 400 includes
With 100 same or analogous feature of system and function, with addition of affinity component 402 and sequencing assembly 404.For simplicity
The reason for, eliminate the repeated description to the similar element employed in corresponding embodiment disclosed herein.
Identification content receives and dispatches the specific user of session in group message transmitting-receiving to recommend participation group message
The main function that ession for telecommunication carries out shared theme mechanism is content as suggestion：Whole group will all like the content
Or think that the content is directed to the content with personal affinity with recreational or interesting, specific user, and the content
It is related to current topic/tone (for example, currently discussed topic) of messaging sessions.In order to promote to realize these mesh
Mark, the candidate content item that affinity component 402 is configured to determine that affinity score to be identified with recognizer component 108 are carried out
Association, the affinity score reflect corresponding message transmitting-receiving sessions participant and are directed to affinity possessed by candidate content item.
Recommendation component 110 can select the subset of candidate content item (for example, recommending based on affinity score associated therewith respectively
Component 110 can select the candidate content item associated with high user affinity).
In one aspect, affinity component 402 is configured as based on the second data acquisition system come the collection for candidate content item
Included each candidate content item determines affinity score in conjunction, and the affinity score represents other users in group
(in addition to making the specific user of recommendation for it) is directed to overall affinity possessed by each content item.It is specifically, close
Individual's viewing history about other users, private accreditation, private subscription, private inquiry etc. can be used with degree component 402
Information determines the score of each candidate content item (for example, video), the score represent other users totally have how " happiness
Vigorously " content item or the content item have for other users in group how " prevalence ".In addition, affinity group
Part 402 can use the specific user have no right it is conducting interviews, with each associated public data in other users
(for example, wherein such data are additionally included in the second protected data set, but the first seed number it is not included in
According in set).For example, affinity component 402, which can use, identifies that one or more of the other user is total to the good friend outside group
The data for the content item enjoyed, identify that one of other users approve or it is made and comment on and allow other users (such as institute
State the included and/or group and user not to be covered in group) understand but do not allow for what the specific user understood
The data of content item.
In another aspect, affinity component 402 can determine each candidate content item based on the first data acquisition system
Affinity score, the affinity score reflect the degree that specific user is directed to affinity possessed by each content item.
Another aspect, affinity component 402 can be directed to each candidate content item and determine combination affinity score, and the combination is affine
Degree score reflects specific user and is directed to the content for other users in the measurement of the affinity of content item and group
Common affinity possessed by.In yet another aspect, be associated with response to one of the comment of group member recommended content items with
Shared for specific user, affinity component 402 can be based on the second data acquisition system come the special user for determining reflection and being commented on
For the first affinity score of the affinity of each candidate content item, and determine to reflect the specific user for each interior
Hold the second affinity score of the affinity of item.The affinity component 402 can also be based on first and second affinity
The two determines the combination affinity score of each content item.
No matter affinity component 402 is to determine to wait based on the first subdata set or the second protected data set
The affinity score of content item is selected, affinity component 402 can calculate user for interior using same or analogous mechanism
Hold the affinity of item.
In one embodiment, in order to determine user for such as video media item affinity, affinity component 402
It can determine the type and extent interacted that the user had been carried out with the media item.For example, user may have recognized that
Media item, comment is carried out to media item, media item is saved as to collection, viewing media item, has shared media item etc., or held
The combination of actions gone on these actions.According to the example, the measurement as user for the affinity of media item, some are dynamic
Making can be to be more weighted compared with other actions.For example, when user likes or collects media item, relative to letter
Singly watch the media item or be stored for watching later, the activity can be considered as the user of the media item
The stronger instruction of affinity.In addition, the active level that user has been carried out with content item is bigger, then it is assumed that the user is directed to institute
It is higher to state affinity possessed by media item.If for example, user watch media item, it is shared and like it or very
To it is more, repeatedly watch it, then comment is simply made to media item or compared with watching it once with user, the activity can be led
Cause the media item associated with higher affinity score.
According to the embodiment, if user not yet have with content item it is any interact or association, it is considered that he or she
There is low affinity for the content item.For example, the set of candidate content item is being have selected based on the first subdata set
Afterwards, affinity component 402 using the second protected data set come determine other users in group with each candidate
The type of interaction and level of interaction that content item is carried out.On particular candidate content item, if affinity component 402 is based on second
Data acquisition system determines that the minority (for example, without or one) in other users in group has been interacted with content item
(for example, accreditation content item, viewing content item, shared content item etc.), then the content item can receive low affinity and obtain
Point, that reflects other users in group to be directed to affinity degree possessed by the content item.Specific user is directed to content item
Affinity can also based on him or she interacting with the content item.
In another embodiment, even if user is (including in the specific user of its positive recommended content items and group
Other users) do not show also to interact with the existing of content item, affinity component 402 also can be by identifying that content carries first
The user with the content consumption preference similar to the user of donor 102 gathers to be directed to the parent that the content item determines user
And degree.For example, on Streaming Media supplier, affinity component 402 can investigate the viewing history of user and find out Streaming Media
The set (for example, whole user's sample from the Streaming Media) of other users with similar viewing history of supplier.So
Afterwards, affinity component 402 can determine the user's that has equally watched or be recognized the candidate content item in the set
Number.The number is bigger, then the affinity score of the candidate content item is higher.Such as, if it is determined that Streaming Media supplier
Have it is similar viewing history many users all watched and liked alternative media item, then the user be present and seeing it
When the high probability that will also like.
In yet another embodiment, when for particular candidate video to determine the affinity of user, affinity component 402
It can determine candidate video channel associated therewith.Then, affinity component 402 can determine whether user has ordered
The channel has been read, contact has been carried out with the channel, have viewed other videos in the channel, etc., so as to described
User be inferred to when not running into the video also the user for the video by with affinity degree.In other words,
It is more to the use input by channel, user is just will be considered to for affinity possessed by the candidate video also from the channel
It is higher.
Sequencing assembly 404 is configured as carrying out come the set to candidate content item based on affinity score associated therewith
Ranking.For example, sequencing assembly 404 can make the ranking for being demonstrated by those candidate content items of high user affinity score preferential
In those candidate content items with relatively low user's affinity score.In various embodiments, recommendation component 110 is configured as base
The subset of the candidate content item is identified to recommend user in the ranking to be sorted of the subset of candidate content item.For example, push away
Can be selected by recommending component 110 by first 5, first 10, etc..In another example, recommendation component 110 can be by all candidates
Hold item to be included in recommendation list, but them are provided with order determined by sequencing assembly 404.By this way, touching
And before the relatively low candidate content item of ranking, user will inswept be considered as the proposed content item of optimal candidate.
Fig. 5 is given according to aspects described herein and embodiment, is set based on personal user's preference and privacy
Put to promote identification and content recommendation for carrying out another shared example system 500 in social context.System 500 includes
With 400 same or analogous feature of system and function, with addition of Rank component 502 and social annotation component 504.For letter
The reason for bright, eliminate the repeated description to the similar element employed in corresponding embodiment disclosed herein.
In various embodiments, Rank component 502 be configured as based on select the subset of candidate content item to recommend or
The specific user for being presented to participation group message transmitting-receiving session comes to waiting for share associated one or more factors
Media item is selected to carry out ranking.In one aspect, Rank component 502 is configured as based on the phase determined by affinity component 402
The association affinity score of candidate content item is answered to carry out ranking to them, so as to reflect that content provider thinks corresponding contents
Can be by specific user likes and shares degree.According to this aspect, the affinity score can be based on specific user with
Content consumption/interacting activity of content provider.The information is generally included in the first subdata set.Rank component
502 can also carry out ranking based on for other affinity scores determined by respective content item to corresponding candidate content item,
Other participants in other affinity scores reflection messaging sessions like corresponding candidate content item (or with other sides
It is recreational, interesting etc. that formula thinks that it has) degree.These other affinity scores will be based primarily upon the second protected data collection
Close.
Be associated with these embodiments, Rank component 502 can be based on how many people in other group participants watch,
The affinity instruction approve, share, commented on corresponding candidate video, and/or otherwise provide the corresponding candidate video comes
Ranking is carried out using the second protected data set versus candidate video.It is considered as those more popular to most of group members
Video therefore will be ranked higher.Rank component 502 can also determine group using the first data acquisition system and the second data acquisition system
The common viewing signal between specific user and other users in group.For example, Rank component 502 can identify it is specific
The candidate video that user watches and also watched by the other users of one or more of group.By specific user and compared with
Those videos that other users of big figure watched are by than those rankings with less or weaker common viewing signal
It is higher.
In some respects, recommendation component 110 be configured in response to the specific comment made by another user in group,
Put question to or share and identify the subset for the candidate content item for being considered as most preferably being included by specific user, wherein the group includes
The overall participant of three or more.According to these aspects, when carrying out ranking to corresponding candidate content item, Rank component 502
It can make other users that there is higher weight compared with remaining participant in group to the affinity of the candidate content item.
The ranking can also reflect content provider think corresponding candidate content item on the whole with messaging sessions
The set of related and/or comment to the messaging sessions/shared or the related degree of actualite.According to this aspect,
Rank component 502 can use included, relevant in the first subdata set to be shared in messaging sessions
Other content items information, the keyword that messaging sessions include, the topic of messaging sessions, and information receiving and transmitting
The tone of session or the information of atmosphere.Then, Rank component 502 can be determined based on these factors or be inferred respective content item
Relevance scores.For example, on video, Rank component 502 can to other videos with being shared, from message
The similar content of the tone of keyword, the topic of messaging sessions and messaging sessions that transmitting-receiving session is extracted
Characteristic (for example, based on the title associated therewith about video, the school of video, video length, associated with video
Channel, video semantic content, there is the metadata of performer in video, the artist associated with video etc.) video
Carry out ranking.When specific user initiates to inquire about, Rank component 502 can also be based on the correlation with used inquiry lexical item
To carry out ranking to corresponding candidate content item.
In addition, Rank component 502 for the general popularity of the user of content provider and can be had based on content item
The recency for closing issue/publicity of respective content item to carry out ranking to corresponding candidate content item.For example, Rank component 502
Can regard the candidate of currently popular or popular between the user of content provider (for example, number based on viewing, shared etc.)
The ranking of frequency is higher than the other video rankings for not being considered as prevalence.In another example, Rank component 502 can will most
