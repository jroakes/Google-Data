Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to telephone books in mobile communication devices, and more particularly to methods and devices to provide access to telephone book entries in a mobile communication device.
- a mobile communication device can be configured to include a contact datum in the form of a telephone book of nearly any size.
- a telephone book may therefore contain hundreds or more entries.
- a telephone book may also contain many entries of the same name, particularly where a certain name is a common name.
- their telephone book stored in the memory of a mobile communication device may contain so many entries that accessing an entry of the telephone book may prove to be cumbersome. For example, to access an entry a user can scroll through the list of entries on the display screen of the mobile communication device. To scroll through the list, the user can start at the first entry to find the sought entry. However, when there are hundreds of entries, scrolling through so many entries may be time consuming.
- Methods for reducing the amount of time to find an entry may include text searching methods.
- a text searching method a user must enter the text for searching via the keypad to initiate the text search. As with scrolling, entering the text of an entry into the keypad of the device may be time consuming.
- FIG. 1 depicts a mobile communication device including a user interface
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method
- FIG. 3 illustrates the situation where the retrieved list of conforming names includes entries of the same name that would otherwise span more than one page length of the display
- FIGS. 4A-B illustrate the situation where the retrieved list of conforming names includes entries of the same name so that the entries of the same name fills at least one page length of the display;
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an embodiment of the presentation algorithm.
- the telephone book entries can include a subset of the telephone book entries that are conforming names.
- the entries are stored in the memory of the device for access by a presentation algorithm of the user interface.
- Instructions can be received by the mobile communication device via the user interface to select a starting letter of a name from the telephone book entries.
- the starting letters can be arranged on the display screen so that at least one letter can be selected by coarse scrolling control.
- a retrieved list of conforming names corresponding to the selected starting letter can be arranged so that they may be accessed by fine scrolling control.
- a truncated list of conforming names can be displayed on the display screen so that a plurality of telephone book entries of the same name are undivided on a display screen, if the retrieved list of conforming names would otherwise span more than one page length of the display.
- names are consolidated on the display screen if the consolidated list of conforming names fills at least one page length of the display.
- a telephone book interface for a mobile communication device includes a display screen for displaying names associated with telephone book entries.
- the interface also includes a truncating instructions module configured for displaying on the display screen a truncated list of conforming names so that a plurality of telephone book entries of a same name are undivided on a display screen.
- the interface further includes a consolidating instructions module configured for displaying on the display screen a list of conforming names so that a plurality of telephone book entries of the same name are consolidated on at least one display screen.
- Other modules can be included in the interface without exceeding the scope of this disclosure.
- the interface can include at least one directional key to select a starting letter of a name from starting letters of names of the telephone book entries and at least one directional key of the user input device to select a name from names of the telephone book entries.
- FIG. 1 depicts a mobile communication device including a user interface.
- the mobile communication device 102 may be implemented as a cellular telephone (also called a mobile phone).
- the mobile communication device 102 represents a wide variety of devices that have been developed for use within various networks.
- Such handheld communication devices include, for example, cellular telephones, messaging devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebook or laptop computers incorporating communication modems, mobile data terminals, application specific gaming devices, video gaming devices incorporating wireless modems, and the like. Any of these portable devices may be referred to as a mobile station or user equipment.
- wireless communication technologies may include, for example, voice communication, the capability of transferring digital data, SMS messaging, Internet access, multi-media content access and/or voice over internet protocol (VoIP).
- VoIP voice over internet protocol
- the mobile communication device 102 can include a transceiver 104 , a processor or controller 106 , memory 108 , and modules 110 .
- the modules can carry out certain processes of the methods as described herein.
- the modules can be implemented in software, such as in the form of one or more sets of prestored instructions, and/or hardware, which can facilitate the operation of the mobile station or electronic device as discussed below.
- the modules may be installed at the factory or can be installed after distribution by, for example, a downloading operation. The operations in accordance with the modules will be discussed in more detail below.
- the modules can include a truncating instructions module 112 and a consolidating instructions module 114 .
- the user interface 116 of the mobile communication device can include a display screen 118 , a directional navigation key 120 with selection button 121 , a keypad 122 , and function keys 124 , 126 , 128 , and 130 . It is understood that other user input devices such as audio input 131 may be included in the user interface.
- the navigational key 120 may be comprised of a single toggle or joystick type button or the navigational key 120 may be made up of a plurality of buttons.
- starting letter selection of the name may be made by coarse control utilizing the directional navigation key 120 in the vertical direction and name selection may be made by fine control utilizing the directional navigation key 120 in the horizontal direction. Selection of a starting letter or entry can be made with selection button 121 or another method such as audio input.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an embodiment of the method for a navigable telephone book.
- Telephone book entries are stored 202 in a telephone book stored in the memory 108 of the mobile communication device 102 for access by a presentation algorithm of the user interface.
- the navigational and arrangement processes provided by the presentation algorithm are dynamic since the content of the telephone book and user preferences can change. In particular, telephone book entries can be added, deleted and edited.
- the navigational processes can allow first coarse control selection of a letter group and/or a starting letter of a name from a list of presented letters. After a starting letter has been selected, the navigational processes can also allow fine control selection of a list of names.
- the presentation algorithm can further dynamically arrange the names for scrolling in different manners depending upon the number of same names that are retrieved in the list of conforming names.
- Conforming names can include at least one of name starting with the same letter, the same letter sequence, names spelled identically and names spelled similarly. Accordingly, the methods and interfaces described may minimize user actions required to achieve a desired record selection and may reduce the amount of time for a user to access a particular entry.
- the mobile communication device 102 via the interface 116 can receive instructions to choose a letter group.
- certain keys on the keypad include letters in groups.
- the number “2” includes letter group “ABC,” and the number “3” includes letter group “DEF,” and so on.
- the keypad 122 of the user interface may be used to select a letter group.
- a user may choose a letter group 204 .
- the user may view the starting letters of names on the display screen 206 , for example, vertically and sequentially so that they may be scrolled through.
- the starting letters may be arranged on the display screen as file tabs or floaters.
- the starting letters displayed may include only those letters that are starting letters of names stored in the telephone book.
- a telephone book entry may contain no names starting with “E.”
- the display screen 118 showing letters “A, B, C, D, E and F” 132 would instead show “A, B, C, D, F and G.”
- a starting letter is not represented in the telephone book entries it may be grayed or otherwise indicated as not relevant.
- middle character selection may be the default display.
- the three letters “ABC” may be represented by the letter “B.” Navigating right or pressing the select key 121 may provide a letter selection. Navigating up from the display selection may automatically return the navigation to character selection mode. It is understood that any arrangement of letters for coarse scrolling control is within the scope of this discussion.
- the method can further include arranging on the display screen 118 conforming names once the stating letter has been selected 210 .
- a starting letter of a name from the telephone book entries can be selected 208 with coarse scrolling.
- a list of conforming names may be provided for selection with fine scrolling.
- navigation button 120 may provide navigation first vertically in coarse control for letter selection, and then horizontally in fine control.
- conforming names can include at least one of name starting with the same letter, the same letter sequence, names spelled identically and names spelled similarly.
- the presentation algorithm may determine the manner in which the names are arranged. In the situation where the starting letters are displayed horizontally, for example as tabs or any other arrangement, the navigation buttons 120 's horizontal control may be used to select a letter. The names may then be displayed vertically. The arrangement of the names can depend upon whether particular conforming names would occupy less than a page length or whether more than a page length when listed 212 on a page of the display screen 118 .
- the list can be truncated so that the entries having the same name can be listed on one page 214 .
- An undivided list of certain conforming names is displayed on one display screen 216 .
- the retrieved list of conforming names can include enough same names so that the same name fills at least one page length of the display 218 . Accordingly, a consolidated list of certain conforming names is displayed 220 . In either case, the names are displayed and can be available for fine scrolling control through the retrieve list of names 222 .
- FIG. 3 illustrates the situation where the retrieved list of conforming names includes the entries of the same name that would otherwise span more than one page length of the display, the list is truncated so that the entries having the same name can be listed on one page.
- FIGS. 4A-B illustrate the situation where the retrieved list of conforming names includes entries of the same name so that the entries of the same name fill at least one page length of the display. FIGS. 3 and 4 A-B will be described in more detail.
- stored in memory may be a telephone book including entries, a subset of which can be conforming names.
- conforming names can include at least one of names starting with the same letter, the same letter sequence, names spelled identically and names spelled similarly.
- Conforming names may be defined in other ways considering languages other than the English language and alphabets other than the English alphabet. It is understood that conforming names can be defined in any manner.
- FIG. 3 includes three parts: rough data 302 , unadjusted data 304 , and data adjusted by the presentation algorithm 306 .
- the rough data 302 shows names from telephone book entries that may have been entered into the memory of the mobile communication device by the user, or in any other manner, such as by download from another source.
- the rough data includes nineteen names starting with the letter “S.”
- the rough data can be of any amount. Instead of listing names starting with the same letter, the names may be listed to include names from a letter group, “PQRS,” for example. There may be fewer names in the rough data or more names in the rough data. In the rough data, five “Smith” names are enclosed 308 .
- the nineteen entries that are not adjusted by the described presentation algorithm may be shown on two separate screens, Screen 1 and Screen 2 shown together 304 .
- the five “Smith” names 310 are shown in the screens without presentation adjustment as spanning more than one page length of the display.
- the name “Smith, Aaron” is shown on Screen 1 , while the other four “Smith” names are shown on Screen 2 .
- the presentation algorithm including truncation instruction module ( 112 , FIG. 1 ) provides displaying on the screen a truncated list of conforming names so that a plurality of telephone book entries of the same name are undivided on a display screen when the retrieved list of conforming names includes the plurality of telephone book entries of the same name so that the plurality of telephone book entries with the same name would otherwise span more than one page length of the display.
- FIGS. 4A-B also includes three parts. Two parts are shown in FIG. 4A , and one part is shown in FIG. 4B .
- Rough data 402 includes twenty-one names starting with the letter “H.” As mentioned above, the rough data can be of any amount. In this case, there are twenty-one names starting with the letter “H” and thirteen “Hubbard” names 408 .
- the twenty-one entries that are not adjusted by the described presentation algorithm may be shown on three separate screens, Screen 1 , Screen 2 and Screen 3 shown together 404 .
- the thirteen “Hubbard” names 410 are shown in the screens without presentation adjustment as spanning more than one page length of the display. Since there are thirteen names, and the page length in this example is ten lines, the retrieved list of conforming names fills at least one page length of the display.
- the presentation algorithm including consolidation instruction module ( 114 , FIG. 1 ) provides displaying on the screen a list of conforming names so that a plurality of telephone book entries of the same name are so that they are consolidated on at least one display screen, when the retrieved list of conforming names includes the plurality of telephone book entries of the same name so that the plurality of telephone book entries of the same name fills at least one page length of the display.
- Screen 4 can be combined with Screen 3 .
- the initials of first names In other circumstances, the full name, instead of initial, would be shown. In the FIG. 4B , initials are used for clarity. In the event that there are two or more “Hubbard” names with the same first initial, a full name can be shown. In the event that there are two or more “Hubbard” names with the same full name, additional information distinguishing the entries can be provided. In this manner, the presentation algorithm may provide easy access to entries in the telephone book.
- the presentation algorithm for navigable arrangement of letters and names is dynamic since user preferences may change and the data of the telephone book can change with new entries and deletions. It is understood that different manners in which to carry out the presentation algorithm are within the scope of this discussion.
- the starting letters may be arranged on the display screen as file tabs or floaters. That is, the tabbed selections may instead be shown as floaters.
- floaters may include “Lia-Lea,” “Lee,” “Loe-Lurs,” and “Lof-Lurs.”
- the selection may open a page that may not be greater than ten entries, were ten entries the amount to fill a page length of the display screen.
- another set of floaters may be displayed on the display screen to indicate first initials, the first letters of first names or the entire first names.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an embodiment of the presentation algorithm.
- the methods can include different processes so that duplicate last names may not span multiple pages unless there will be a full screen or screens set up that display entries associated with that last name.
- the method includes dividing conforming names into telephone book entry segments 502 .
- the method includes counting where the ten items per screen separation would be for a page length of ten items. That is, the total number of names with the same starting letter can be evaluated for items per page 504 .
- a determination as to whether there are ten or fewer non-same names is made 506 . If there are ten or fewer non-same names, then they are displayed 508 .
- the method counts the number of same last names that exceed the size of single page 510 .
- the third pass determines if the same names would span screens. The process may ignore items that span screens based on the second pass results.
- the method further provides a determination as to whether there are over ten entries of the same name 512 . If there are fewer than ten entries of the same name, they can be displayed on the same page without dividing the entries 514 . If there are more than ten entries of the same name, then one or more additional pages can be made to include the remaining same name entries 516 .
- the navigational and arrangement processes provided by the presentation algorithm are dynamic since the content of the telephone book and user preferences can change.
- the navigational processes can allow first coarse control selection of a letter group and/or a starting letter of a name from a list of presented letters. After a starting letter has been selected, the navigational processes can also allow fine control selection of a list of names.
- the presentation algorithm can further arrange the names for scrolling in different manners depending upon the number of same names that are retrieved in the list of conforming names and the capacity of the display screen. Accordingly, the methods and interfaces described may minimize user actions required to achieve a desired record selection and may reduce the amount of time for a user to access a particular entry. In particular for telephone books having many entries, the described methods and interfaces may make the telephone book entries available with easy access.
