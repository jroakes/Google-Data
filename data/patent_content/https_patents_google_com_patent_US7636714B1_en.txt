Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to the field of information retrieval; and more specifically to retrieving answers to search queries and to assisting users in revising search queries.
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web, as well as the number of new users (who are typically inexperienced at web searching), are growing rapidly. Search engines can help users to locate and retrieve documents of interest.
- a user may enter the query [web hosting+fort wayne] when the city of Fort Wayne is usually referred to as Ft. Wayne. Or, a user may enter [free loops for flash movie] when most relevant pages use the phrase “music,” rather than “loops,” or the phrase “animation” rather than “movie.”
- documents that satisfy a user's information need may use different words than the query terms chosen by the user to express the concept of interest.
- search engines typically rate documents based on how prominently the user's query terms are in the documents, this means that a search engine may not return the most relevant documents in such situations (since the most relevant documents may not contain the user's query terms prominently, or at all). This problem becomes progressively more serious as the number of terms in a query increases. For queries longer than three or four words, there is a strong likelihood that one of the words is not the best phrase to describe the user's information need.
- a simple approach to query expansion is to use pre-constructed synonym information, such as from a thesaurus or a structured lexical database like WordNet.
- thesaurus based approaches have various problems, such as that they are expensive to construct. Even when available, they are generally restricted to one language; meanwhile, there is a need to accommodate many languages, and to obtain synonym sets for each language.
- a more significant issue is that the applicability of a synonym for a given phrase often strongly depends on the context in which the phrase is used. For example, “music” is not usually a good synonym for “loops,” but it is a good synonym in the context of the example query above. Further, this case is sufficiently special that “music” is not listed as a synonym for “loop” in standard thesauruses; many other examples of contextually dependent non-traditional synonyms can be easily identified. And even when conventional synonyms can be identified for a term, it can be difficult to identify which particular synonyms to use in the particular context of the query.
- the present invention includes a method for determining synonyms for search query terms, for evaluating their quality or strength, and for utilizing them to improve user queries.
- the method operates both the in context of particular search queries and in a context-insensitive manner, resulting in improved synonym selection for the contexts considered.
- the method finds query pairs that are alike, except for certain (single- or multi-word) phrases that occur in defined positions.
- the differing phrases become candidate synonyms.
- the method qualifies the candidate synonyms by performing a series of tests involving additional query-related information.
- One such test involves frequency of usage of search terms, e.g., the number or percentage of times both terms appeared in search queries within a prescribed time interval, or within a particular user session.
- Another such test involves relatedness of search results, e.g., the degree of commonality of search results returned for the original search query and for a version of the latter in which the candidate synonym is substituted. Additional tests further qualify the candidate synonyms according to particular applications.
- candidate synonyms Once candidate synonyms become qualified synonyms, they can be suggested to the user. Alternately, qualified synonyms may be applied to revise or expand a query transparently to the user. In addition, qualified synonyms can be used to modify the search score associated with retrieved documents.

- FIG. 1B is a flowchart illustrating a process for determining one or more synonymous terms in a context of the user search query according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 depicts an example method of determining candidate synonyms for search query terms according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a table illustrating several tests that may be used to qualify the quality or strength of a candidate synonym according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 1A is a flowchart illustrating a method of providing altered queries according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- a user search query is received 110 .
- a front-end server is responsible for receiving the search query submitted by the client.
- the front-end server provides the query to the search engine, which evaluates the query.
- the front-end server and/or search engine maintains various log files or lookup tables that store in memory each received user query, in association with other information. More particularly, each query is stored with a user identifier that identifies the particular browser and/or computer from which the query was received, a timestamp, and a list of some number of the search results (e.g., a list of the top ten document IDs from the search). Other information, contextual of the user, the search, or the like may also be stored.
- a list of search results for the user search query is identified 120 .
- the search engine evaluates the query to retrieve a set of search results in accordance with the search query and returns the results to the front-end server.
- the search engine communicates with one or more of the content servers to select a plurality of documents that are relevant to the user's search query.
- a content server stores a large number of indexed documents, indexed (and/or retrieved) from different websites. Alternately, or in addition, the content server stores an index of documents stored on various websites. “Documents” are understood here to be any form of indexable content, including textual documents in any text or graphics format, images, video, audio, multimedia, presentations, and so forth.
- each indexed document is assigned a page rank according to the document's link structure.
- the page rank serves as a query-independent measure of the document's importance.
- An exemplary form of page rank is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, which is incorporated by reference.
- the search engine assigns a score to each document based on the document's page rank (and/or other query-independent measure of the document's importance), as well as one or more query-dependent signals of the document's importance (e.g., the location and frequency of search terms in the document).
- FIG. 1B is a flowchart illustrating a process for determining one or more synonymous terms in a context of the user search query according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- query pairs are identified 140 .
- An example of this process is further described in conjunction with FIG. 2 . In one embodiment, this is accomplished by analyzing user query logs and lookup tables. The set of all queries received over some period are reviewed and all original and altered query pairs are identified. An altered query is defined as a query obtained by replacing a phrase in the original user query with a candidate synonym.
- a “phrase,” in the context of the present invention is one or more individual words or terms.
- an original user query might be [free loops for flash movie], and the altered query might be [free music for flash movie].
- certain queries may be eliminated as having insufficient context.
- queries used in the analysis may be required to have at least three terms.
- possible query fragments, or “pseudo-queries” are formed by removing phrases from the query and replacing each phrase with a token (e.g., “:”) that acts as a variable. Then, queries that vary only by the phrase marked with the token are identified as query pairs.
- information about the query pairs is analyzed 150 .
- additional information to suggest that the phrase in the original query and altered query are synonymous is identified.
- the evidence may include the frequency with which both queries in the pair are asked by the same user within a short time interval, or the number of top results that the original query and altered query share.
- one or more additional tests can be used.
- One such test is that, for every query containing the phrase A, the corresponding query with the phrase B substituted for A has a moderately high probability of occurrence in the stored data. In one embodiment, the required probability is 1%.
- a second test is that, for every query containing A, the corresponding query with B substituted for A has a minimum probability of being asked by the same user in a short time interval. In one embodiment, the interval is an hour and the probability is 0.1% or greater.
- a third test is that, for every query containing A, if the corresponding query with B substituted for A occurs, the two queries have a minimum probability of having a number of the top results in common. In one embodiment, the probability is 60-70% and the number of results in common is 1-3.
- the statistics used for the above tests can be gathered for each of the most common contexts in which the phrase occurs.
- the query would be reflected in statistics for all occurrences of “free,” the general context (:); for only occurrences of “free” following “whale,” the context (whale :); for only occurrences of “free” preceding “photos,” the context (: photos); and for only occurrences of “free” between “whale” and “photos,” the context (whale: photos). Since many queries containing the phrase “free” are processed, statistics will be obtained for many contexts in which “free” has occurred, quite possibly many thousands of different contexts.
- the above tests are performed for the overall context, to determine whether the substitution is generally a good one. For example, it may be determined that “download” is not generally (i.e., in the general context) a good synonym for “free,” is a good synonym in the context (: photos), and is not a good synonym in the context (: press). The conclusion in this example is that the context (: photos) is an exception to the general rule that “download” is not a good synonym for “free.”
- a subset is selected 160 including phrases with candidate synonyms that meet certain criteria.
- the criteria are some or all of the tests discussed above in the general context.
- a number of top candidate synonyms are selected for the subset of query pairs.
- a synonym is considered more significant than other synonyms, for example, if it is used in an altered query more often within user sessions, or if its altered query yields more search results in common with the original query.
- candidate synonyms are ranked 170 , or qualified, using the criteria discussed above.
- a set of threshold conditions should be satisfied using the data gathered above and discussed in greater detail in conjunction with FIG. 3 .
- the conditions may be that for at least 65% of the original-altered query pairs, there is at least one search result in common and that the frequency with which the altered query follows (e.g., occurs within five sequential queries) the original query within a user session is at least 1 in 2000.
- the statistics from step 150 are evaluated using a float scale function to determine a score for each qualified synonym, as discussed in greater detail in conjunction with FIG. 2 .
- the score is a measure of the confidence in a qualified synonym. Depending on the application, greater or lesser confidence or strength will be required. Consequently, whether a qualified synonym will be declared a useful synonym will depend on the threshold value of evidence that is sufficient for the application.
- one or more altered queries are derived 180 .
- Various methods exist for deriving alternative queries from the synonymous terms are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/629,479, filed on Jul. 28, 2003, entitled “System and Method for Providing a User Interface with Search Query Broadening,” which is incorporated herein by reference.
- alternate queries are suggested that include the synonym, either as a substitution in or an addition to the query.
- a number of alternative queries can be provided back to the user, along with the search results for the original query according to various methods.
- One such method is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11/094,814 filed on Mar. 29, 2005, entitled “Integration of Multiple Query Revision Models,” which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the synonym is treated as equivalent to the original phrase automatically for purposes of document retrieval.
- the original query is modified by replacing the phrase with a synonym or a disjunction of the original phrase and a synonym when producing search results for the query.
- a list of altered search results for the altered query is identified 190 .
- this list may include a maximum number of results.
- FIG. 2 depicts an example method of determining candidate synonyms for search query terms according to one embodiment of the invention.
- the method operates in the context of an information retrieval system, which generally includes a front-end server, a search engine, and an associated content server.
- users access the system via a conventional client over a network operating on any type of client computing device, for example, by executing a browser application or other application adapted to communicate over Internet-related protocols (e.g., TCP/IP and HTTP).
- the information retrieval system can operate on high performance server class computers, and the client device can be any type of computing device.
- the details of the hardware aspects of server and client computers are well known to those of skill in the art and thus are not further described here.
- the front-end server is responsible for receiving a search query submitted by the client.
- the front-end server provides the query to the search engine, which evaluates the query to retrieve a set of search results in accordance with the search query, and returns the results to the front-end server.
- the search engine communicates with one or more of the content servers to select a plurality of documents that are relevant to the user's search query.
- a content server stores a large number of documents, which are indexed (and/or retrieved) from different websites. Alternately, or in addition, the content server stores an index of documents stored on various websites.
- Documents are understood here to be any form of indexable content, including textual documents in any text or graphics format, images, video, audio, multimedia, presentations, web pages (which can include embedded hyperlinks and other metadata, and/or programs, e.g., in Javascript), and so forth.
- each indexed document is assigned a page rank according to the document's link structure.
- the page rank serves as a query-independent measure of the document's importance.
- An exemplary form of page rank is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the search engine assigns a score to each document based on the document's page rank (and/or other query-independent measure of the document's importance), as well as one or more query-dependent signals of the document's importance (e.g., the location and frequency of search terms in the document).
- the front-end server and/or search engine maintains various log files that store each received user query, in association with other information. More particularly, each query is stored with a user identifier that identifies the particular browser and/or computer from which the query was received, a timestamp, and, for some queries, a list of some number of the search results (e.g., a list of the top ten document IDs from the search). Other information, contextual of the user, the search, or the like may also be stored. The information in the log files is then analyzed according to the methods described herein.
- queries are eliminated as having insufficient context; preferably queries used in the analysis have at least three terms.
- the query [gm cars] is eliminated.
- all possible query fragments or pseudo-queries are formed 220 by replacing a sequence of one or more terms with a marker or token (e.g., “:”), while leaving at least two words in the pseudo-queries.
- a marker or token e.g., “:”
- the generation of pseudo-queries may be described as iteratively replacing each term (or sequence of consecutive terms) of a query with a universal token.
- the term (or sequence of terms) that is replaced is called a “phrase.”
- Each pseudo-query record is keyed by its pseudo-query, the original query from which it was derived, and the phrase that was replaced by the token to produce the pseudo-query.
- the keying of the pseudo-query records in this manner allows for multiple different sorts and aggregations of the pseudo-query records as further described below.
- Step 230 also optionally annotates a pseudo-query record with the first ten resultant document IDs (indicated below as “url#”) returned by the search engine in response to the query, either extracted from the log files (if available), or indirectly with a pointer or other reference to an external store of the results. According to one embodiment, fewer or no document Ids may be annotated, to reduce the required storage space.
- top_results ⁇ url370293847, url123985709, . . . >
- top_results ⁇ url370293847, url123985709, . . . >
- top_results ⁇ url123985709, url1093475987, . . . >
- top_results ⁇ url370293847, url123985709, . . . >
- the process of generating the pseudo-queries operates to make explicit the range of potential contexts of each phrase that is implicit within each query.
- the records corresponding to an individual pseudo-query reflect what is known (i.e., across all user queries in the logs) about one set of queries that differ in only one phrase.
- the records for each pseudo-query are then analyzed 240 to generate a new set of records that reflect how well each phrase appears to function as a synonym for some other phrase, if it occurs in the given pseudo-query.
- Pseudo-query records are sorted by pseudo-query such that all records with the same pseudo-query are grouped together. For example, assume that the records for the pseudo-query [: used car prices] include the two from above, plus two more, all of which are shown below:
- top_results ⁇ url370293847, url123985709, . . . >
- top_results ⁇ url370293847, url123985709, . . . >
- top_results ⁇ url283923887, url739572390, . . . >
- top_results ⁇ url370293847, url123985709, . . . >
- Step 240 generates a single record for each phrase that is identified in a pseudo-query. In other words, all records with the same pseudo-query are grouped together and a new record is created for each phrase covered by the group, reflecting how that phrase relates to the other phrases of the group for that pseudo-query. Continuing the present example, step 240 creates a record for each of the phrases “gm,” “general motors” and “ford.” Each record includes candidate synonyms for the respective phrase.
- Each record output by step 240 indicates the ten most significant potential synonyms for each phrase.
- the significance of synonyms is determined at this stage independent of context according to a hierarchy of tests. First, a synonym that occurs in more related queries within sessions is considered more significant than one that appears in fewer related queries. Second, if two synonyms occur in the same number of related queries within sessions (as is likely to be the case, since relatively few sessions have related queries), a synonym is considered more significant than another if the results returned for a search query that includes the first synonym have more results in common with the results returned for a query with the phrase. Finally, if two synonyms still evaluate as equally significant, one is considered more significant if it occurs more often within the queries corresponding to the respective pseudo-query.
- step 240 would output:
- step 240 passes on the session information from step 230 .
- the data record above reflects the session queries “gm used car prices,” “general motors used car prices,” and “ford used car prices.” In many cases, like “ford” in this example, there the original and altered queries may occur in different sessions, yet not occur together in a single session.
- Step 240 also compares the search results (using, e.g., the document IDs) for each original and altered query if they were recorded, and tracks how many were in common. Thus, in the present example, [gm used car prices] and [general motors used car prices] had 5 documents in common among their respective top ten, while the results for [gm used car prices] had no documents in common with those for [ford used car prices]. Then, the records produced by this step are sorted by phrase, gathering together all records produced by step 240 for each phrase.
- step 250 computes statistics that reflect how well each candidate synonym functions as a synonym in general (i.e., in the general context, “:”), as well as in specific contexts.
- candidate synonyms are selected from the observed “related phrases.” Continuing the present example, assume that for the phrase “gm,” step 250 receives the above record, plus two more:
- Step 250 determines how many queries contained a particular phrase “and computes statistics for each candidate synonym of” the phrase. In one embodiment, this includes determining the number of queries for which the corresponding query with the synonym:
- step 250 also gathers statistics for each context in which the phrase occurs frequently. For example, statistics are gathered for the 10,000 contexts for which the most queries exist. In this example, the contexts would be (:), (: used), (: used car), (: new), (: new car), (of :), (nutrition of :), (: food), and (of: food). Only one of the queries discussed in the above example (original queries [gm used car prices], gm new car prices], and nutrition of gm food]) belongs to each of these specialized contexts, except the general context, (:), which subsumes all three queries. Realistically, however, some contexts will include data from many queries. Step 250 evaluates the above statistics for each context, retaining, for each context, only the 20 most common candidate synonyms.
- Step 260 further qualifies candidate synonyms using various tests.
- FIG. 3 is a table illustrating several tests that may be used to qualify the quality or strength of a candidate synonym according to one embodiment of the present invention.
- the tests 310 apply to statistics gathered in step 150 .
- the qualification begins by confirming that two preliminary conditions are satisfied.
- the first preliminary condition is that for at least 65% of the original-altered query pairs, there is at least one search result (e.g., a URL) in common.
- the 65% parameter is empirically derived, and other thresholds can be used as well, depending on the corpus of documents.
- the second preliminary condition is that for at least 1 in 2000 of the query pairs, a user in a session enters the original query followed by the altered query within, e.g., five queries.
- step 260 evaluates a number of the statistics from step 250 as a group, according weight to each statistic. The evaluation is based on the following function:
- score 320 ratio the test determines
- base 330 target value
- high scaling factor
- the value of base 330 reflects a desired value for the given test.
- the individual tests are defined as follows.
- frequently_alterable 350 provides a measure of whether, for each query with the phrase of interest, the corresponding altered query occurs often enough (preferable more than 1%) to suggest that the candidate synonym makes sense in context. This computation is i) from step 250 (queries in log) over the total number of distinct queries including the phrase (TDQ).
- frequently_much_in_common 360 evaluates whether the original queries and altered queries typically exhibit enough results in common to suggest that the meanings of the phrase and candidate synonym are similar. Preferably, at least 60% of altered queries have at least 3 search results in common with the original user query. This computation is iv) from step 250 (had at least one result in common) over ii) of step 250 (result data existed for both original and altered queries).
- frequently_altered 370 evaluates whether users occasionally try the substitution. Preferably, for every 2000 user queries, there is a corresponding altered query within the same session. This computation is v) from 250 (appeared earlier within a session) over TDQ.
- high_altering_ratio 380 measures whether users do not preferentially substitute in the opposite direction, i.e., substitute the phrase for the candidate synonym, which would suggest that the original phrase is much better than the candidate synonym.
- this variable evidence is a measure of the strength of or confidence in a synonym, qualified as discussed above. A value approaching 1.0 indicates very high confidence, while a value of 0.6 reflects good confidence. Depending on the application, greater or lesser confidence or strength can be required. Consequently, whether a candidate synonym is declared a validated synonym depends on the threshold value of evidence that is sufficient for the application. It has been empirically determined that for many applications, for example, a candidate synonym can be validated, e.g., considered equivalent to a phrase, if the value of evidence is greater than 0.6. Again, other thresholds and variations of the Scale function, and its subordinate functions may also be used.
- a set of validated synonyms and the corresponding contexts in which they are effective can be utilized in several ways.
- a conservative approach is to suggest to the user alternative queries into which the synonym has been substituted. For example, when a user enters a given query, a number of alternative queries can be provided back to the user, along with the search results for the original query. Each of the alternative queries can be linked to its associated search results, so that the user does not have to manually re-enter the alternative query.
- Advantages of the present invention include a computer implemented method to determine synonyms to serve as substitutions for phrases within an information search query.
- Candidate substitutions may be suggested to the user or automatically included in addition to or in place of the original query. Alternately, the candidate substitution may be used solely to modify the score associated with the retrieved documents.
- a formula may be used to assess the strength or quality of candidate synonyms, and the strength or quality may be compared to a threshold that is determined according to the application of interest.
