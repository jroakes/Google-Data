- an exemplary network architecture 100 for performing searches on a network while maintaining user privacy comprises a pseudonym server 105 , a proxy searcher 110 , and a central searcher 115 that are connected to a network 120 as shown.
- the databases 130 may include any sort of searchable entity, including Internet search engines, search services, databases embedded in or as part of another entity or service, and/or traditional databases
- the user 125 may wish to perform searches on the one or more databases 130 , and/or searches that can be associated in some fashion with one or more databases 130 as described below.
- a salt server 135 along with a server database 140 are connected to the pseudonym server 105 .
- a searcher database 145 is connected to the central searcher 115 to facilitate searches of the one or more databases 130 .
- the network 120 may represent a global network, such as the Internet, or other publicly accessible network.
- the network 120 may also, however, represent a wide area network, a local area network, an Intranet, or other private network, which may not be accessible by the general public.
- the network 120 may represent a combination of public and private networks or a virtual private network (VPN).
- VPN virtual private network
- the proxy searcher 110 and the central searcher 115 may be configured to perform searches of the one or more databases 130 while maintaining the privacy of the user 125 .
- the proxy searcher 110 may cooperate with the pseudonym server 105 to obtain a pseudonym for the user 125 when the user 125 signs up for adaptive, privacy-guaranteed searching provided by the proxy searcher 110 and central searcher 115 .
- the proxy searcher 110 may provide the user 125 with a private key that can be used by the user 125 to reduce the risk of impersonation via well-known public-private cryptographic mechanisms for authentication/authorization/encryption/digital signature.
- the pseudonym server 105 may be configured to generate a pseudonym for the user 125 using conventional hash algorithms, such as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA- 1 ), and/or the various Message Digest (MD 2 , MD 4 , MD 5 ) algorithms. To ensure uniqueness of the generated pseudonym, the pseudonym server 105 may use the salt server 135 to provide a “salt,” which may be random data that can be used in the hash algorithm.
- the user's 125 pseudonym may be stored in the server database 140 and provided to the proxy searcher when the proxy searcher receives a search request from the user 125 .
- the pseudonym server 105 may store the user's 125 pseudonym in the database server 140 , but may store the user's 125 actual identity separately (e.g., in different portions of the same database 140 or in a different database) to protect the user's 125 privacy.
- the privacy of the user 125 may be protected by using a three-steps-removed approach to performing a search of the one or more databases 130 .
- the central searcher 115 does not see the identity of the user 125 , but instead sees a pseudonym for the user 125 .
- the one or more databases 130 do not see the identity of the user 125 , but instead see only the central searcher 115 .
- the central searcher 115 breaks up a complex search request received from the proxy searcher 110 into apparently unrelated simple search requests, which may be difficult for an intruder to associate together.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary communication network
- the present invention is not limited to such configurations, but is intended to encompass any configuration capable of carrying out the operations described herein.
- a data processing system 200 that may be used to implement the pseudonym server 105 , salt server 135 , proxy searcher 110 , central searcher 115 , and/or user 125 of FIG. 1 , in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, comprises input device(s) 202 , such as a keyboard or keypad, a display 204 , and a memory 206 that communicate with a processor 208 .
- the data processing system 200 may further include a storage system 210 , a speaker 212 , and an input/output (I/O) data port(s) 214 that also communicate with the processor 208 .
- I/O input/output
- the storage system 210 may include removable and/or fixed media, such as floppy disks, ZIP drives, hard disks, or the like, as well as virtual storage, such as a RAMDISK.
- the I/O data port(s) 214 may be used to transfer information between the data processing system 200 and another computer system or a network (e.g., the Internet). These components may be conventional components such as those used in many conventional computing devices, which may be configured to operate as described herein.
- Computer program code for carrying out operations of data processing systems discussed above with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2 may be written in a high-level programming language, such as C or C++, for development convenience.
- computer program code for carrying out operations of embodiments of the present invention may also be written in other programming languages, such as, but not limited to, interpreted languages.
- Some modules or routines may be written in assembly language or even micro-code to enhance performance and/or memory usage. It will be further appreciated that the functionality of any or all of the program modules may also be implemented using discrete hardware components, one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or a programmed digital signal processor or microcontroller.
- ASICs application specific integrated circuits
- Operations begin at block 300 where the pseudonym server 105 associates a pseudonym with the user 125 and stores the pseudonym in the database 140 .
- the proxy searcher 110 receives a complex search request for the one or more databases 130 .
- the complex search request may be in the form of a matrix where one matrix dimension corresponds to general search categories and the other matrix dimension corresponds to sub-categories of the general search categories.
- the matrix may use typical general search categories.
- the general search categories may include actor or musician name, producer, director, production company, studio, date or period of production, release date, content rating, and/or genre of film.
- the matrix may include sub-categories for more detailed searches. For example, mood, e.g., happy, sad, silly, funny, scary, etc. may be a sub-category.
- a general self-help category may include several sub-categories, such as woodworking, concrete, plumbing, electrical, automotive, etc.
- the matrix may also use mathematical rules for evaluating searches. For example, one entry in the matrix may represent a search for a movie with at least 10 jazz scenes and less than 15 comedy or sad scenes. Alternately, this search could be represented via combining entry values, for example a “majestic scenes” entry having a value of “at least 10” with a “comedy or sad scenes” entry having a value of “less than 15.” Other search queries may be used, such as, for example, a search for movies with around 50% scary scenes, 28% silly scenes, and 22% dramatic scenes. Searches may be made using a desirable/undesirable scale where, for example, +10 indicates some aspect is the most desirable and ⁇ 10 indicates that some aspect is the least desirable. For example, a search could be made for a movie with a +8 comedy rating and a ⁇ 5 silly rating. Conditional operations may also be applied. For example, a search may be made for “if the movie is a comedy, then is the comedy dramatic.”
- the proxy server 110 forwards the complex search request to the central searcher 115 with the pseudonym associated with the user 125 so as to hide the actual identity of the user 125 from the central searcher.
- the central searcher 115 divides the complex search request into multiple simple search requests at block 315 .
- the simple search requests correspond to individual or combinations of cells of the search request matrix. Individual cells may be used in that this approach may provide the best privacy. Combinations may be selected for better efficiency and/or to match the capabilities/operations of particular databases 130 , such as particular Internet search engines.
- the central searcher may generate simple searches of the one or more databases 130 by proceeding with each category and generating a search for each sub-category entry that is non-null.
- Each simple search may be given a unique random-appearing identifier that may be placed into the search request and thus echoed in the reply to that request so that the response/result of the simple search can be assoicated with its “parent” complex search and with the particular user.
- the central searcher 115 performs the simple search requests on the one or more databases 130 .
- the central searcher may evaluate the search results based on rules defining whether a search was satisfied and/or successful.
- the rules may be applied mathematically to the results to determine whether one or more of the simple searches was successful.
- the results may be in the form of a binary indicator, e.g., “yes” or “no” or may be numerical indicators having a specified range of values in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.
- the central searcher 115 may populate a results matrix for each “hit,” e.g., each movie matching request paramters, corresponding to the complex search request matrix that contains the various results of the simple search requests associated with each hit.
- the central searcher provides these matrices to the proxy searcher 110 , which may also present the search results in other formats, such as histograms and/or a hierarchical distribution of the search results.
- the proxy searcher 110 has access to the user's 125 pseudonym for reporting the results back to the user 125 , or allowing the user 125 to access the results, or enabling some combination.
- the searching operations may be adaptive. That is, the central searcher may “learn” which of the databases 130 provide the best results for various types of searches. For example, the central searcher may track the results from each of the databases 130 by category and/or sub-category. The central searcher 115 may then determine which of the databases provides satisfactory results for the various categories and/or sub-categories.
- the results may be tracked in the following ways: a number of satisfactory results in a given time period may be tracked; a number of satisfactory results in a set of time periods may be tracked; a weighted number of satisfactory results in a set of time periods may be tracked; a rate of change of satisfactory results in a given time period may be tracked; a rate of change of satisfactory results in a set of time periods may be tracked; and/or a weighted rate of change of satisfactory results in a set of time periods may be tracked.
- each block represents a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).
- the function(s) noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in FIG. 3 .
- two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending on the functionality involved.
- a customer or user 125 may sign up with an adaptive privacy-guaranteed search service through the proxy searcher 110 , for example.
- the customer 125 decides to search for movies that are happy, romantic, include at least three scenes of sandy beaches, and have actors from a defined actor list that specifies multiple actors in various desirability categories.
- the request is submitted to the proxy searcher 110 , which receives the complex search request matrix formed by the user's software, which may have been previously downloaded from the proxy searcher, for example, when the user signed up for the service. If the user is interacting with the proxy searcher 110 entirely via a web page interface, then the proxy searcher 110 may itself form the complex search request matrix.
- the proxy searcher 110 forwards the complex search request matrix along with the customer's 125 pseudonym to the central searcher 115 .
- the central searcher breaks up the complex search request matrix into multiple simple search requests with sequence numbers for internal use and with associated random-appearing identifiers that are placed into the search requests, which are performed on the various databases 130 .
- the central searcher 115 combines them back into matrix form for each individual search “hit” and then forwards the results matrices for all of the search hits back to the proxy searcher 110 .
- the proxy searcher may then provide the results matrix to the customer 125 via the customer's 125 pseudonym.
- the customer 125 may view the results through various software filters to organize the results in a way that is desirable for the customer 125 , either via the downloaded software and/or via a proxy server web page capability, and/or some combination.
