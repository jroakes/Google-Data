- FIG. 8 is an example social graph 800 .
- a social graph is a way to represent, graphically, social connections between two parties that may, or may not, be on the same social network, and to represent connections between parties and content.
- a party may be an individual (e.g., users 108 , 110 ) or an entity, e.g., a company, organization, country, or the like.
- content items 408 , 410 , 412 , 414 , 416 , 418 , 420 , 422 , 424 , 426 , 428 , 430 are associated with user 110 through one or more connections in a social graph (e.g., social graph 800 ).
- Types of connections in social graphs may include, but are not limited to, other users to which a user is in direct contact (e.g., user messaging or chat contact, direct contacts on social sites) and users to which the user is in indirect contact (e.g., contacts of contacts, connections of users that have a direct connection to the user).
- a direct connection may be unilateral or bilateral.
- a social graph includes content generated by individuals (e.g., blog posts, reviews) as connections to the user.
- the social graph may include connections within a single network or across multiple networks.
- Distinct social graphs may be generated for different types of connections. For example, a user may be connected with chat contacts in one social graph, electronic message contacts in a second social graph, and connections from a particular social network in a third social graph.
- a social graph may include edges to additional parties at greater degrees of separation from the user.
- an electronic message contact may have its own electronic message contacts to others adding a degree of separation from the user (e.g., user ⁇ electronic message contact ⁇ contact of electronic message contact). These contacts may, in turn, may have additional contacts at another degree of separation from the user.
- a party's connection to someone in a particular social network may be used to identify additional connections based on that person's connections.
- Distinct social graphs may include edges connecting one or more social graph to one or more other social graphs.
- a social graph may include a single social graph or multiple interconnected social graphs.
- users may designate content as endorsed, share or comment on content, quote URLs, or otherwise indicate an interest or liking of content, examples of which include, but are not limited to, a particular resource, Web page, or search result.
- an application, widget, or scripting may be provided in search results pages, Web pages, or within a browser application that allows a user to indicate liking, sharing, or other evaluation of an associated resource or search result.
- the user may mark the particular resource, Web site, or search results to indicate endorsement or other evaluation (e.g., through a browser control or user interface element presented with the associated content).
- Such relationships to information from others may be captured in a user's social graph.
- Affinity between entities of a social graph may be represented by the above-noted edges in the user' social graph.
- affinity may identify the closeness of a party to a user. For example, a contact of a contact who has five common middle contacts with the user has more of an affinity with the user (e.g., is considered closer to the user) than a contact of a contact who has only one common middle contact.
- Factors in determining affinity may include, e.g.: how a contact is connected to the user (e.g., a source of a connection), which social networking site the contact is a member of, whether contact or contact of contact, and how many paths to get to the contact of a contact (e.g., common middle contacts).
- Edges may be weighted, either in a database containing the social graph or elsewhere, to reflect a level of affinity between connections (e.g., parties) in the social graph.
- Affinity between parties may be content specific in some cases.
- social graph data may identify specific types of content associated with an edge between parties and specific affinities for that content.
- the social graph data may specify that, between two connected parties, the first party has a first level of affinity for the second party's videos and a second, different level of affinity for the second party's written work.
- the social graph may specify that the second party has a third, different level of affinity for the first party's blogs.
- the social graph data may specify that, between two connected parties, the first party has a first level of affinity for the second party's content about baseball and a second, different level of affinity for the second party's content about basketball.
- Affinity may also be based on the user's interactions with members of the social graph (e.g., the frequency of interaction, the type of interaction, and so forth). For example, a user that frequently clicks on posts by a particular contact may be considered to be closer to that contact than to other contacts where they click on respective posts less frequently. Likewise, if a user frequently “mouses-over” content by an author (e.g., a search result link), but does not select that content, the degree of affinity may be less than if the link were selected.
- an amount of time viewing content may be an indicator that one party likes content from another party. The amount of time viewing particular content may be an indication that one party likes that particular type of content from the other party, as opposed to other types of content from the other party.
- affinity may be defined by indirect interaction between users. For example, if two users interact with the same content regularly or frequently, those two users may be considered to have an affinity with one other. In still other examples, if two users interact with the same people regularly or frequently, those two users may be considered to have an affinity with one other.
- FIG. 8 shows sources of information for a social graph.
- the user's social graph is a collection of connections (e.g., users, resources/content, etc.) identified as having a relationship to user 110 (“ME”) within some degree of separation.
- the user's social graph may include parties and particular content at different degrees of separation.
- the social graph of a user may include contacts, contacts of contacts (e.g., as defined by a user, social graphing site, or other metric), the user's social circle, people followed by the user (e.g., subscribed blogs, feeds, or Web sites), co-workers, and other specifically identified content of interest to the user (e.g., particular Web sites).
- FIG. 8 shows that it is possible to extend the user's social graph to people and content both within a single network and across one or more external networks.
- the user may have a profile or contacts list that includes a set of identified contacts, a set of interests, a set of links to external resources (e.g., Web pages), and subscriptions to content of a system (e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including electronic messages, chat, video, photo albums, feeds, or blogs).
- blogs that include links to a user's contacts may be part of the user's social graph.
- These groups may be connected to other users or resources at another degree of separation from the user.
- contacts of the user may have their own profiles that include connections to resources as well as contacts of the respective contacts, a set of interests, and so forth.
- a user may be connected to a social network account. That social network account may reference an article in a newspaper. A social connection, therefore, may be established between the user and the author of the article.
- the connections to a user within a specified number of degrees of separation may be considered the bounds of the social graph of a user. Membership and degree of separation in the social graph may be based on other factors, including a frequency of interaction. For example, a frequency of interaction may be by the user (e.g., how often the user visits a particular social networking site) or it may be a type of interaction (e.g., endorsing, selecting, or not selecting items associated with contacts). As interactions change, the relationship of a particular contact in the social graph may also dynamically change. Thus, the social graph may be dynamic rather than static.
- Social signals may be layered over the social graph (e.g., using weighted edges or other weights between connections in the social graph). These signals, for example, frequency of interaction or type of interaction between the user and a particular connection, may be used to weight particular connections in the social graph or social graphs without modifying the actual social graph connections. These weights may change as the interaction with the user changes.
- Social graphs may be stored using suitable data structures (e.g., list or matrix type data structures).
- Information describing an aspect of a stored social graph may be considered relationship data.
- relationship data may include information describing how particular members of a user's social graph are connected to a user (e.g., through what social path is a particular entity connected to the user).
- Relationship data may also include information describing social signals incorporated in the user's social graph.
- relationship data may be stored in a relationship lookup table (e.g., a hash table).
- Suitable keys for locating values (e.g., relationship data) within the lookup table may include information describing the identities of both a user and a member of the user's social graph.
- a suitable key for locating relationship data within the lookup table may be (User X, User Y), where User Y is a member of User X's social graph.
- Social graph information may be indexed for use in information retrieval.
- the social graph information may be part of a search index (not shown) in data repository 114 .
- the search index may be searched to identify relevant search results that are dependent upon social signals, e.g., that are associated with one or more aspects of a user's social graph, examples of which are provided above.
- a search system may receive a query and identify, e.g., general search results and user-generated content.
- the user-generated content may include, e.g., search results based on the indexed social graph information (e.g., content from electronic messages, posts, blogs, chats, etc. of members of the searcher's social graph).
- the indexed social graph information may be updated intermittently or periodically, for example, to include recently added information associated with the user's social graph.
- the indexed social graph information may also be updated, e.g., on an on-going basis to reflect relationships determined in accordance with the processes described herein.
- a user may prevent addition of members to the user's social graph, e.g., using an opt-out option or by keeping contacts out of particular groups used to generate the social graph.
- privacy features provide a user with an opt-in or opt-out option to allow or to prevent, respectively, being included (or removed the user if already included) as a member of another's social graph.
- users may have control over what personal information or connection information, if existing, is included in their social graphs and, consequently, that is included in the content streams and search results described herein.
- a system is configured to generated viral metrics, including, e.g., VA and VC metrics.
- the system is also configured to generate derivative, viral metrics, including, e.g., CPVC and CPCA metrics.
