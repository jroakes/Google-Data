Definitions
- This invention relates to client software for wireless communication devices. Specifically, the invention relates to software that provides an interface for accessing and displaying information from a video database using a wireless communication device.
- Wireless devices include, for example, cellular telephones, pagers, “palmtop” personal information managers (PIMS), and other small, primarily handheld communication and computing devices.
- PIMS personal information managers
- Wireless communication devices have matured considerably in their features and are now used alternately with computers for more advanced communications functions, such as electronic mail, facsimile receipt and transmission, Internet access, browsing the World Wide Web, and the like.
- wireless communications devices are also commonly used as personal entertainment devices in the same way the computers are currently used. Wireless devices are commonly used to play music, watch videos, play video games etc.
- wireless communication devices present a variety of more challenging design and implementation issues that do not arise with larger processor-based systems, such as notebook and desktop computers, which may also have similar telecommunication features. These design challenges include the design of the user interfaces and the integration of Internet and World Wide Web access with other communication functionality.
- wireless communication devices have a form factor that requires a very small screen display size.
- Desktop computers typically have displays with at least 14′′ screen size, and resolution typically between 800 ⁇ 600 and 1280 ⁇ 1024 pixels.
- wireless communication devices typically have a screen size between 25 ⁇ 25 mm and 80 ⁇ 120 mm, and resolutions between 176 ⁇ 144 to 240 ⁇ 320 pixels, or about 5% of the size of the desktop or notebook screen.
- the user interface design of the wireless communication device must provide access to essentially the same features as desktop computers, such as Web browsing, yet with only a fraction of the screen area for displaying text, images, icons, and the like. This problem of constructing the user interface to provide these features is particularly significant when handling Web-based content, since conventional Web content is frequently designed for presentation on the larger screen size of conventional desktop computers.
- the severely restricted set of inputs available to user provides another constraint in the design of user interfaces for wireless communication devices.
- Conventional desktop or notebook computers have cursor-based pointing devices, such as a computer mouse, trackballs, joysticks, and the like, as well as a full-sized keyboard. This enables navigation of the Web content by clicking and dragging of scroll bars, clicking of hypertext links, and keyboard tabbing between fields of forms, such as HTML forms.
- wireless communication devices have a very limited number of inputs, typically up and down keys, and one to three soft keys.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional video database interface designed for a mobile device. Due to limited screen space, only a subset of video information may be displayed at one time. The video information is displayed in a list format in order to facilitate user selection of videos using the up and down keys of the wireless communication device. In order to view additional or different video information, the user must select the next button. Upon this selection, the user must wait for the next set of video information to load onto the screen. Depending on the speed at which the wireless communication device can retrieve and process video information from the video database server, it may take several seconds to load the next set of video information.
- a menu of the video database functions is listed in association with the different number keys. Navigation of the video database by highlighting and selecting the menu options or by using the number keys is cumbersome as the user is required to select from the entire menu of options. Further, the display of the entire menu of options takes up significant screen space and is difficult to read due to the large number of menu options displayed.
- the described embodiments of the present invention provides a video database client application configured to execute on a wireless communication device or a device with a small display screen.
- the video database client application includes a user interface including user interface components designed to access video information and view videos using the wireless communication device. These user interface components include buttons to display menu options and account information to users. Other user interface components include a carousel display to interactively browse information associated with videos. These user-interface components facilitate browsing and navigation of the video database using the small screen display of the wireless communication device.
- the video database client application includes a video player module to integrate and control a native video player within the user interface.
- the incorporation of a native video player within the interface facilitates user control of the video player.
- Control of the video player through the interface provided by the video database client application further enables the video database client application to monitor video viewing data and store this information in the video database.
- the video database client application further includes a video database interface module adapted to retrieve videos and video information from the video database.
- the video database interface module functions to pre-fetch information from the video database based on anticipated user information needs.
- the video database interface module pre-fetches video information to allow the user to interactively and continuously browse large sets of videos using the carousel display without the user having to explicitly request and wait for new video information to be retrieved from the video database.
- the video database interface module also pre-fetches video information regarding videos that are related to a video the user has selected to view.
- the video database interface module further pre-fetches user account information such as playlists the user has created or videos that have been sent to the user.
- FIG. 1 is an illustration of a conventional video database interface for designed for a mobile device.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of the top level software and system architecture of a wireless communication device in one embodiment of the present invention.

Description
- 1. Field
- This invention relates to client software for wireless communication devices. Specifically, the invention relates to software that provides an interface for accessing and displaying information from a video database using a wireless communication device.
- 2. Background
- Due to advancement in wireless communication device technology, wireless devices have become an increasingly prevalent substitute for personal computers. Wireless devices include, for example, cellular telephones, pagers, “palmtop” personal information managers (PIMS), and other small, primarily handheld communication and computing devices. Wireless communication devices have matured considerably in their features and are now used alternately with computers for more advanced communications functions, such as electronic mail, facsimile receipt and transmission, Internet access, browsing the World Wide Web, and the like.
- In addition to communications related functions, wireless communications devices are also commonly used as personal entertainment devices in the same way the computers are currently used. Wireless devices are commonly used to play music, watch videos, play video games etc. However, wireless communication devices present a variety of more challenging design and implementation issues that do not arise with larger processor-based systems, such as notebook and desktop computers, which may also have similar telecommunication features. These design challenges include the design of the user interfaces and the integration of Internet and World Wide Web access with other communication functionality.
- One constraint in the design of the user interfaces for wireless devices is the limited size of the display screen of the wireless device. Unlike desktop and notebook computers, wireless communication devices have a form factor that requires a very small screen display size. Desktop computers typically have displays with at least 14″ screen size, and resolution typically between 800×600 and 1280×1024 pixels. In contrast, wireless communication devices typically have a screen size between 25×25 mm and 80×120 mm, and resolutions between 176×144 to 240×320 pixels, or about 5% of the size of the desktop or notebook screen. As a direct result, the user interface design of the wireless communication device must provide access to essentially the same features as desktop computers, such as Web browsing, yet with only a fraction of the screen area for displaying text, images, icons, and the like. This problem of constructing the user interface to provide these features is particularly significant when handling Web-based content, since conventional Web content is frequently designed for presentation on the larger screen size of conventional desktop computers.
- The severely restricted set of inputs available to user provides another constraint in the design of user interfaces for wireless communication devices. Conventional desktop or notebook computers have cursor-based pointing devices, such as a computer mouse, trackballs, joysticks, and the like, as well as a full-sized keyboard. This enables navigation of the Web content by clicking and dragging of scroll bars, clicking of hypertext links, and keyboard tabbing between fields of forms, such as HTML forms. In contrast, wireless communication devices have a very limited number of inputs, typically up and down keys, and one to three soft keys.
- For websites that aim to provide the user with the ability to browse a large amount of information, such as video content distribution websites, the above constraints severely limit both the amount of information presented to the user and the ease with which the user can browse the information.
-
FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional video database interface designed for a mobile device. Due to limited screen space, only a subset of video information may be displayed at one time. The video information is displayed in a list format in order to facilitate user selection of videos using the up and down keys of the wireless communication device. In order to view additional or different video information, the user must select the next button. Upon this selection, the user must wait for the next set of video information to load onto the screen. Depending on the speed at which the wireless communication device can retrieve and process video information from the video database server, it may take several seconds to load the next set of video information. - At the bottom of the screen, a menu of the video database functions is listed in association with the different number keys. Navigation of the video database by highlighting and selecting the menu options or by using the number keys is cumbersome as the user is required to select from the entire menu of options. Further, the display of the entire menu of options takes up significant screen space and is difficult to read due to the large number of menu options displayed.
- The described embodiments of the present invention provides a video database client application configured to execute on a wireless communication device or a device with a small display screen. The video database client application includes a user interface including user interface components designed to access video information and view videos using the wireless communication device. These user interface components include buttons to display menu options and account information to users. Other user interface components include a carousel display to interactively browse information associated with videos. These user-interface components facilitate browsing and navigation of the video database using the small screen display of the wireless communication device.
- The video database client application includes a video player module to integrate and control a native video player within the user interface. The incorporation of a native video player within the interface facilitates user control of the video player. Control of the video player through the interface provided by the video database client application further enables the video database client application to monitor video viewing data and store this information in the video database.
- The video database client application further includes a video database interface module adapted to retrieve videos and video information from the video database. The video database interface module functions to pre-fetch information from the video database based on anticipated user information needs. The video database interface module pre-fetches video information to allow the user to interactively and continuously browse large sets of videos using the carousel display without the user having to explicitly request and wait for new video information to be retrieved from the video database. The video database interface module also pre-fetches video information regarding videos that are related to a video the user has selected to view. The video database interface module further pre-fetches user account information such as playlists the user has created or videos that have been sent to the user. By pre-fetching information based on anticipated user needs, the video database client application compensates for slow retrieval of information through a wireless network minimizing time delays in providing video information to users.

FIG. 12 illustrates a high-level block diagram of a wireless communication environment adapted to execute the videodatabase client application 102 according to one embodiment. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , there is shown an illustration of the system and software architecture of awireless communication device 100 configured to execute a videodatabase client application 102 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The hardware of thewireless communication device 100 includes aprocessor 124,memory 126,screen display 136, and keypad 128.Memory 126 includes ROM, RAM, and a flash memory for long term storage of data. A suitablewireless communication device 100 for providing the hardware features is a Nokia N series phone manufactured by Nokia Telecommunications, Inc. - The
wireless communication device 100 stores in thememory 126 and executes a conventional realtime operating system 122, which includes modules for managing power, memory, threads (communication connections), keypad inputs, and timer activities. The realtime operating system 122 provides a standard application programming interface allowing higher level components of a videodatabase client application 102 to request functionality of thewireless communication device 100, and to send and receive data. - Also stored in the
memory 126 and in communication with the realtime operating system 122 istelephony control module 120 that provides the primary telephone controls, including making and receiving telephone calls, managing multiple telephone lines (if appropriate), management of text messaging (if appropriate), monitoring of telephone signals, and other basic telephony functions. Thetelephony control module 120 includes a conventional telephone protocol stack that implements an air-interface protocol. Thetelephony control module 120 and the realtime operating system 122 are typically provided by the manufacturer of thewireless communication device 100, and their particular implementation is not material here. - The
screen display 136 is a bitmapped LCD or similar display device. Thescreen display 136 is typically of very limited resolution, for example about 90×60 to 240×320 pixels (at about .28 mm dot pitch) as would be appropriate for a compact, portable, hand-held electronic device. It is anticipated that advances in display technology will result in screen displays 136 of significantly higher resolution, but even so, the ergonomic and form factor requirements of wireless communication devices will result in screen displays that are relatively small (e.g., between 25×25 mm and 80×120 mm) as compared to the screen displays of notebook and desktop computers, and as a result will not display content designed for such larger screen displays in the exactly the same manner. The present invention is adapted to increase the ease of use of such screen displays when displaying video database content. In some embodiments, thescreen display 136 is a touch screen. Touch screens arescreen displays 136 which are sensitive to human touch and allow the user to enter inputs by touching the screen, either with a finger or a pointing device. - The
wireless communication device 100 has a keypad 128 that includes a number of fixedfunction keys 132 for accessing defined functions of the wireless communication device 100 (e.g., “Send,” “End,” and “Power”),number keys 134 for entering digits (and if suitably encoded, for entering other characters), and programmablesoft keys 130.Soft keys 130 are buttons that have variable functionality that changes depending on the particular screen display of the videodatabase client application 102 being shown. - The
wireless communication device 100 stores in itsmemory 126 and executes an instance of a videodatabase client application 102 made in accordance with the present invention. This videodatabase client application 102 includes: anavigator 107, a set ofuser interface components 116, avideo player module 140, a videodatabase interface module 145 and auser interface layer 118. Thenavigator 107 provides the primary user interface mechanism to the user, allowing access touser interface components 116 and through them to features of the application. Theuser interface components 116 provide a set of graphics primitives, file store functions, data elements and localization features that allow theapplication 102 to be used on a variety ofwireless communication devices 100. Theuser interface layer 118 provides an interface for thenavigator 107 anduser interface components 116 to the realtime operating system 122 and thetelephone control module 120. - The video
database client application 102 executes as a multi-threaded application, and is generally designed to run on any realtime operating system 122,telephone control module 120, andwireless communication device 100 that provides sufficient ROM, RAM, and flash memory, ascreen display 136, and basic services. - The
navigator 107 provides the basic user interface of the videodatabase client application 102 and displaysuser interface components 116 used to access and browse thevideo database 147 on thescreen display 136 of thewireless communication device 100. The video content displayed by thenavigator 107 is retrieved by the videodatabase interface module 145 from avideo database 147. - The
navigator 107 includes avideo player module 140 which integrates and controls anative video player 149 within thenavigator 107. Anative video player 149 is a software application which plays videos and that is native to thewireless communication device 100. Thenative video player 149 is usually associated with the realtime operating system 122 of thewireless communication device 100. According to the type ofwireless communication device 100, differentnative video players 149 specific to thewireless communication device 100 may be provided. Examplenative video players 149 include: RealPlayer®, Windows Media Player and QuickTime Video Player. - The
video player module 140 identifies thenative video player 149 of thewireless communication device 100. Thevideo player module 140 interacts withuser interface components 116 to control the display and interaction with thenative video player 149 within thenavigator 107. Thevideo player module 140 further transmits information obtained from the user interaction with thenative video player 149 to the videodatabase interface module 145. The videodatabase interface module 145 stores user interaction information in thevideo database 147. - The
navigator 107 further includes a videodatabase interface module 145. The videodatabase interface module 145 provides an interface between thenavigator 107 and avideo database 147. The videodatabase interface module 145 retrieves videos and video information from thevideo database 147 responsive to user selection ofuser interface components 116. The videodatabase interface module 145 also retrieves videos and video information from the video database based on anticipated user information needs. The videodatabase interface module 145 pre-fetches packets of video information containing information for plurality of videos. In some embodiments, the videodatabase interface module 145 communicates directly with thevideo database 147. In some embodiments, the videodatabase interface module 145 is adapted to communicate with an application programming interface (API) for avideo database 147. - The
video database 147 stores videos and video information. Thevideo database 147 can be any database of videos which resides on a server. Thevideo database 147 stores videos in a format compatible withnative video player 149. Thevideo database 147 also includes information about the videos such as, for example, length, name and source of the videos. Thevideo database 147 further includes annotations of the videos based on information such as: user ratings, genre or type of the videos, frequency at which the videos are viewed and other videos that are related to the videos. Thevideo database 147 stores information specific to users of thevideo database 147 such as: videos selected by the users, videos sent to the users, videos watched by the users, ratings submitted by the users, user subscriptions to video playlists or video providers, demographic information regarding the users and selected preferences of type of genre of videos selected by the users. -
