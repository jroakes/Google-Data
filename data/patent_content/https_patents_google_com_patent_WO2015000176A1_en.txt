Definitions
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results.
- Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- the content can then be provided to the user on any devices associated with the user such as a personal computer (PC), a smartphone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or some other user device.
- PC personal computer
- smartphone smartphone
- laptop computer a laptop computer
- tablet computer or some other user device.
- Some content sponsors can have, or be associated with, social network webpages.
- a company that makes a car may periodically update its social network webpage with car-related content, including text, images and/or other format types.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content.
- the method includes identifying a social network webpage associated with a content sponsor.
- the method further includes linking the social network webpage to a campaign, the campaign providing content responsive to requests for content.
- the method further includes periodically evaluating the content of the social network page including evaluating recent content included in the social network page and storing portions of the content for serving in a database.
- the method further includes receiving a request for content.
- the method further includes determining that the campaign includes selection criteria that match the request.
- the method further includes identifying one or more portions stored in the database that are associated with the campaign, including evaluating the one or more stored portions.
- the method further includes generating a creative based at least in part on one or more of the stored portions and providing the creative responsive to the request.
- Evaluating the content can includes: crawling the content to identify target social content that has been updated or new social content, filtering the content based on one or more filter criteria, classifying the content based on verticals or other interest-based classifiers, and indexing the content based on the classification and storing the content for serving. Indexing can include storing classification terms and using the classification terms as campaign selection criteria.
- the filtering criteria can be provided by the content sponsor and/or an advertisement system.
- the method can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is a follower of the content sponsor and/or whose network includes at least one connected user that is a follower of the content sponsor and generating a creative for a follower, including generating a creative using most recent content stored in the database that is associated with the social network webpage.
- the method can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is not a follower of the content sponsor, and generating the creative for a non-follower can include generating a creative based on interests of the requestor.
- the method can further include receiving user information about a requestor that generated the request, and generating the creative can include determining whether the user is a follower of the content sponsor and customizing the creative based at least in part on whether the user is a follower. Customizing can include determining which content from the database to include in the creative and determining a format of the creative.
- the method can further include storing a single creative form associated with the campaign in a database, where the single creative form includes a plurality of different layouts, and where generating the creative includes, at run-time, selecting one of the different layouts depending on what portion of content is to be included in the creative.
- the portions can be selected from location, posts, images or videos.
- Evaluating the content can includes: crawling the content to identify target social content that has been updated or new social content, filtering the content based on one or more filter criteria, classifying the content based on verticals or other interest-based classifiers, and indexing the content based on the classification and storing the content for serving.
- the instructions can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is a follower of the content sponsor and/or whose network includes at least one connected user that is a follower of the content sponsor and generating a creative for a follower, including generating a creative using most recent content stored in the database that is associated with the social network webpage.
- the instructions can further include storing a single creative form associated with the campaign in a database, where the single creative form includes a plurality of different layouts, and where generating the creative includes, at run-time, selecting one of the different layouts depending on what portion of content is to be included in the creative.
- Evaluating the content can includes: crawling the content to identify target social content that has been updated or new social content, filtering the content based on one or more filter criteria, classifying the content based on verticals or other interest-based classifiers, and indexing the content based on the classification and storing the content for serving.
- the system can further include instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: determine that the request is associated with a user that is a follower of the content sponsor and/or whose network includes at least one connected user that is a follower of the content sponsor, and generate a creative for a follower, including generating a creative using most recent content stored in the database that is associated with the social network webpage.
- the system can further include instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: determine that the request is associated with a user that is not a follower of the content sponsor, and generate the creative for a non- follower including generating a creative based on interests of the requestor.
- the system can further include instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: receive user information about a requestor that generated the request, wherein generating the creative includes determining whether the user is a follower of the content sponsor, and customize the creative based at least in part on whether the user is a follower.
- Customizing can include determining which content from the database to include in the creative and determining a format of the creative.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages.
- content sponsors e.g., merchants
- content sponsors e.g., advertisers
- content sponsors can have their advertisements presented with different social content to different users (e.g., followers versus non-followers) without having to manually edit advertisements or create multiple campaigns.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment for delivering content.
- FIG. 2 shows an example system for providing dynamic content generated from social network webpages.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for providing dynamic content generated from social network webpages.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- This document describes methods, processes and systems for providing dynamic content generated from web resources (e.g., social network webpages).
- web resources e.g., social network webpages
- a company may have a page that appears in a social network.
- a content sponsor associated the page can specify, e.g., in a content sponsor interface, that advertisements related to the pages are to be generated automatically from content of the page.
- Information such as posts on the page
- the formats can depend, for example, on the format of a particular post on the page, e.g., whether it includes text, images, video, or other content.
- the selection of which content (e.g., post) to use to generate a creative at run-time can depend at least on the type of user and the request for content. For example, if the user is a follower of the page, then the creative provided to the user can be based on information from the most recent post on the page. However, if the user is a non-follower of the page, then the creative provided to the user can be based on, for example, information that is likely to be of interest to the user, and which may include any post from the page.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content and at least one social networking system 120 that allows users to interact with other users within a social network.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104, user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109, the content management system 110 and the social networking system 120.
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104, user devices 106, content sponsors 108 and publishers 109.
- a data store of user control and privacy preferences 142 can include information that the user has provided regarding if and how the user's information, including social network information, can be used. For example, users can use one or more user preferences webpages to set up preferences. In some
- users can set a preference that says, "Do not use my information to provide content to me or others based on information in the social network”.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102.
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScriptTM scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102.
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102.
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104.
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106.
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented.
- These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114.
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102.
- the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116.
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the search results 118 include the content itself, such as a map, or an answer, such as in response to a query for a store's products, phone number, address or hours of operation.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112.
- An example search result 118 can include a webpage title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the webpage, and the URL of the webpage.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other webpages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- a schedule e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X
- content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation).
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110.
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116.
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request ("eligible content items").
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116.
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals and behavioral signals.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations).
- the offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection or other interaction with) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- the content management system 110 can include plural engines. For example, a webpage evaluation engine 121 can periodically evaluate the content presented on a page that is associated with a social network.
- the webpage evaluation engine 121 can crawl a page that is associated with a social network in order to determine content that can be used in campaigns (e.g., stored in a data store of campaigns 124).
- the content can include social network webpage content that is updated periodically (e.g., posts, activity stream updates, or other content updates).
- the webpage evaluation engine 121 can store portions of the content obtained from social network webpages in a data store of stored portions of content 125.
- a creative generation engine 122 can dynamically generate creatives in response to requests for content, e.g., to fill an advertisement slot with an advertisement.
- Requests can be handled, for example, by a request handler 123.
- the creative generation engine 122 can access the stored portions of content 125 in order to dynamically generate a content item.
- the content that is generated can be different depending on whether or not the user associated with the request is a follower of the social network webpage.
- a follower for example, can be provided with content that is based on the most recent content update (e.g., post) on the social network webpage.
- a non-follower for example, can be provided with a content item that is determined to be more likely of interest to the user, as described below.
- Dynamically generating content in this way can be of great benefit to a page sponsor.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular
- What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used
- the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by selecting content based at least in part on whether or not the user is a follower of an entity (the entity having a social network webpage).
- content sponsors may specify to provide content to followers, where the content is based on the most recent information available, e.g., the latest post on a social network webpage.
- Content sponsors may elect to provide non-followers content from the social network webpage that includes content portions that are likely to be of most interest to the user, e.g., based on the webpage that the user is currently requesting or a history of webpages visited by the user.
- the environment 100 includes one or more social networking systems 120 (though only one is shown) that provide functions and tools for users to share information in a social network or social framework.
- a social networking system 120 can be associated with a social networking website that users can use to identify friends and social groups (e.g., circles), send and receive email, post messages and multi-media (e.g. photos, video, audio), track social events, provide updates, receive content, visit and interact with social network webpages associated with companies, products and services, and so on.
- friends and social groups e.g., circles
- send and receive email e.g., posts and receive email
- post messages and multi-media e.g. photos, video, audio
- track social events provide updates, receive content, visit and interact with social network webpages associated with companies, products and services, and so on.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user' s identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user' s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 2 shows an example system 200 for providing dynamic content generated from social network webpages.
- the content management system 110 can dynamically generate content to be presented on a resource (such as webpage 202 that is being viewed by a user 203) using content that has been updated/ presented on a social network webpage 204.
- the social network webpage 204 may be the social network webpage for a camera company that makes Camera X and other cameras.
- the social network webpage 204 can include a post 206, e.g., related to Camera X, including an image 208 and text 210.
- the post 206 may be, for example, the most recent post on the social network webpage 204, e.g., more recent than an older post 212 (e.g., from the previous day) and other posts indicated by ellipses 213.
- the webpage 202 can include the content item 214 (e.g., an advertisement related to Camera X) that is based on content included in and obtained from the post 206.
- the content item 214 e.g., an advertisement related to Camera X
- an image 216 can be obtained from image 208 on the post 206
- text 218 can be part or all of the text 210 from the post 206.
- This is an example of an image plus text format, but other layouts are possible.
- other layouts include video, image, text, article (e.g., title plus content), article plus image, and album (e.g., a collection of thumbnail images).
- Content items 214 that are generated by the system 200 can include other components and/or controls, such as a webpage visit control 220 and a follow control 222. If the user 203 selects the webpage visit control 220, for example, navigation of the user's browser session can be directed to the social network webpage 204. User selection of the follow control 222, for example, can enable future notification to the user 203 of content from the social network webpage 204, such as automatically generating posts on the user's social network activity stream that are generated from posts on the social network webpage 204.
- the generation of content on the webpage 202 using content from the social network webpage 204 can be accomplished in several steps.
- the content management system 110 can identify 224 the social network webpage 204 that is associated with the Camera X content sponsor.
- the content management system 110 can link 226 the social network webpage 204 to a content sponsor associated with the social network webpage 204.
- the information can be stored, for example, in the campaigns 124 or the stored portions of content 125.
- the webpage evaluation engine 121 can perform a periodic evaluation 228 of content on the social network webpage 204.
- the evaluation can include evaluating recent content included in the social network page, e.g., since the last evaluation. This can occur, for example, on an ongoing basis, such as periodically (e.g., every five minutes) or on demand (e.g., when it is known that the content of the social network webpage 204 has changed).
- the evaluation can include, for example, crawling the social network webpage 204 for new content that was posted or updated since the last time the social network webpage 204 was crawled.
- the content management system 110 for example, can store the new or updated portions of content, e.g., in the stored portions of content 125.
- Steps l-3b can occur over time for many social network webpages, including the social network webpage 204.
- the stored portions of content 125 can include portions of content from the most recently-crawled social network webpages that are known to the content management system 110.
- the request handler 123 can receive a request for content 232.
- the received request can be a request for an advertisement to fill an
- the request for content 232 may include, for example, keywords and/or other selection criteria for selecting a content item responsive to the request.
- a determination 234 is made that the campaign (e.g., an advertising campaign for Camera X) includes selection criteria that match the request.
- the request for content 232 can be a request to fill an advertisement slot on a camera- related webpage, and the request can include camera-related keywords that match keywords in the advertising campaign.
- the creative generation engine 122 can identify 236 one or more portions of content 125 that are associated with the campaign, including evaluating the one or more stored portions.
- the creative generation engine 122 can generate a creative 238 based at least in part on one or more of the stored portions, and provide the generated creative 238 in response to the request.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for providing dynamic content generated from social network webpages.
- the content management system 110 can perform steps of the process 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.
- FIGS. 1-2 are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of the process 300.
- a page e.g., a social network webpage
- the content management system 110 can identify the social network webpage 204 that is associated with the content sponsor of Camera X.
- the content management system 110 can also verify that the content sponsor has ownership of the social network webpage or is otherwise authorized (e.g., has copyright authority).

- generating a creative can be accomplished, for example, by mapping each different update type to different
- advertisement creative templates For example, if a post contains an image, the social content can be mapped to a template with an image field.
- information from the social network webpage can be used to generate the creative.
- the information can include profile content, a company's or entity's name, a description, a logo, an address, phone numbers, maps, and so on.
- Other information that can be used includes posted text, images, videos, locations, event information, the number of re-shares, the number of replies, content generated by other users in the user's social network, or other information.
- follower information and/or statistics can also be used, including information about and the numbers of users who follow the advertiser who have +l'ed, re-shared, replied or otherwise interacted with a given portion of content (e.g., a post).
- the webpage evaluation engine 121 can use an application programming interface (API) to access the content (e.g., the post 206).
- API application programming interface
- the webpage evaluation engine 121 can obtain timestamps of posts 206, maintain a record of timestamps, and evaluate only the posts 206 that have timestamps not already processed.
- virtually all of a post can be stored such that, at the time that dynamic content is to be generated from content in the post, all of the content is available.
- evaluating the content can include crawling the content to identify target social content that has been updated or is new social content, filtering the content based on one or more filter criteria, classifying the content based on verticals or other interest-based classifiers (e.g., using clusters), indexing the content based on the classification, and storing the content for serving.
- the webpage evaluation engine 121 can evaluate the content and determine whether the content is related to sports, art, cameras and/or other verticals so that the portions of content 125 can be indexed by subject matter, keywords, etc.
- indexing the content can include storing
- classification terms and using the classification terms as campaign selection criteria.
- indexing can be based on verticals or some other selection criteria.
- the filtering criteria can be provided by the content sponsor and/or an advertisement system.
- the webpage evaluation engine can be provided by the content sponsor and/or an advertisement system.
- the webpage evaluation engine can be provided by the webpage evaluation engine
- 121 can filter out undesirable social content (e.g., porn) to ensure that the content follows the policies of the content management system 110, the content sponsor, and/or the social networking system.
- undesirable social content e.g., porn
- content sponsors may set up lists of subjects to be filtered, such as by specifying keywords.
- example portions of content can include locations, posts, images or videos.
- the portions of content 125 evaluated and stored by the webpage evaluation engine 121 can include the physical location of the business entity associated with the post 206 (e.g., the Camera X Company street address), text from posts, images (e.g., photos/pictures of a camera) and videos (e.g., a demonstration of the camera's features).
- a request for content is received (308).
- the content management system 110 can receive the request for content 232 from the user device 106, e.g., for a camera-related advertisement to fill an advertisement slot on the webpage 202.
- the request can be handled by the request handler 123.
- the content management system 110 can compare keywords or other criteria associated with the request with selection criteria associated with campaign 124. The comparison can identify, for example, an advertising campaign for Camera X.
- One or more portions stored in the database are identified that are associated with the campaign (312). This includes evaluating the one or more stored portions, e.g., to identify the stored portions of content 125 that are to be provided to the user 203 in the form of creative s 238.
- a creative is generated based at least in part on one or more of the stored portions, and the creative is provided responsive to the request (314).
- the creative generation engine 122 can generate the creative 238, and the request handler 123 can provide the creative 238 to the user device 106.
- Some implementations of the process 300 can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is a follower of the content sponsor and/or whose network includes at least one connected user that is a follower of the content sponsor.
- Generating the creative can include using the most recent content stored in the database that is associated with the social network webpage. For example, if the user 203 is a follower of the social network webpage 204, or if a threshold number or percentage of the user's social network friends are followers of the social network webpage 204, then the creative generation engine 122 can generate a creative that uses portions of content 125 from the most recent post 206 of the social network webpage 204.
- determining that a particular user is a follower of a particular social network webpage can be done by comparing the user's various identifiers, including social identifiers, with lists of known followers of the target page (e.g., the social network webpage).
- Some implementations of the process 300 can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is not a follower of the content sponsor, and generating the creative for a non-follower can include generating a creative based on interests of the requestor. For example, if the user 203 associated with the request for content 232 is not a follower of the social network webpage 204, then the creative generation engine 122 can generate a creative that uses portions of content 125 that are likely to be of interest to the user 203, such as based on the subject matter of the user's current webpage 202 and/or recently-viewed webpages.
- Some implementations of the process 300 can further include receiving user information about a requestor that generated the request, where generating the creative includes determining whether the user is a follower of the content sponsor, and customizing the creative based at least in part on whether the user is a follower.
- the creative generation engine 122 can customize the generated creative 238 based on whether the user 203 is a follower, as described above.
- customizing the creative can include determining which content from the database to include in the creative and determining a format of the creative.
- Some implementations of the process 300 can further include storing a single creative form associated with the campaign in a database, wherein the single creative form includes a plurality of different layouts, and where generating the creative includes, at run-time, selecting one of the different layouts depending on what portion of content is to be included in the creative.
- the webpage evaluation engine 121 can store a single creative associated with a post 206.
- the creative can have defined for it several possible layouts that can be selected at run-time.
- the creative generation engine 122 can select the format to be used based on the request, the content to be included in the creative and type of user 203 (e.g., follower or non-follower). For example, for a non-follower associated with the request for content 232, the creative generation engine 122 can select stored portions of content 125 obtained from an older post 212.

Description
PROVIDING DYNAMIC CONTENT FROM SOCIAL NETWORK WEBPAGES
BACKGROUND
[0001] This specification relates to information presentation.
[0002] The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results.
[0003] Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content. The content can then be provided to the user on any devices associated with the user such as a personal computer (PC), a smartphone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or some other user device.
[0004] Some content sponsors can have, or be associated with, social network webpages. For example, a company that makes a car may periodically update its social network webpage with car-related content, including text, images and/or other format types.
SUMMARY
[0005] In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes identifying a social network webpage associated with a content sponsor. The method further includes linking the social network webpage to a campaign, the campaign providing content responsive to requests for content. The method further includes periodically evaluating the content of the social network page including evaluating recent content included in the social network page and storing portions of the content for serving in a database. The method further
includes receiving a request for content. The method further includes determining that the campaign includes selection criteria that match the request. The method further includes identifying one or more portions stored in the database that are associated with the campaign, including evaluating the one or more stored portions. The method further includes generating a creative based at least in part on one or more of the stored portions and providing the creative responsive to the request.
[0006] These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Evaluating the content can includes: crawling the content to identify target social content that has been updated or new social content, filtering the content based on one or more filter criteria, classifying the content based on verticals or other interest-based classifiers, and indexing the content based on the classification and storing the content for serving. Indexing can include storing classification terms and using the classification terms as campaign selection criteria. The filtering criteria can be provided by the content sponsor and/or an advertisement system. The method can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is a follower of the content sponsor and/or whose network includes at least one connected user that is a follower of the content sponsor and generating a creative for a follower, including generating a creative using most recent content stored in the database that is associated with the social network webpage. The method can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is not a follower of the content sponsor, and generating the creative for a non-follower can include generating a creative based on interests of the requestor. The method can further include receiving user information about a requestor that generated the request, and generating the creative can include determining whether the user is a follower of the content sponsor and customizing the creative based at least in part on whether the user is a follower. Customizing can include determining which content from the database to include in the creative and determining a format of the creative. The method can further include storing a single creative form associated with the campaign in a database, where the single creative form includes a plurality of different layouts, and where generating the creative includes, at run-time, selecting one of the different layouts depending on what portion of content is to be included in the creative. The portions can be selected from location, posts, images or videos.
[0007] In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer
program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: identify a social network webpage associated with a content sponsor, link the social network webpage to a campaign, the campaign providing content responsive to requests for content, periodically evaluate the content of the social network page including evaluating recent content included in the social network page and store portions of the content for serving in a database, receive a request for content, determine that the campaign includes selection criteria that match the request, identify one or more portions stored in the database that are associated with the campaign, including evaluating the one or more stored portions, and generate a creative based at least in part on one or more of the stored portions and provide the creative responsive to the request.
[0008] These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Evaluating the content can includes: crawling the content to identify target social content that has been updated or new social content, filtering the content based on one or more filter criteria, classifying the content based on verticals or other interest-based classifiers, and indexing the content based on the classification and storing the content for serving. The instructions can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is a follower of the content sponsor and/or whose network includes at least one connected user that is a follower of the content sponsor and generating a creative for a follower, including generating a creative using most recent content stored in the database that is associated with the social network webpage. The instructions can further include storing a single creative form associated with the campaign in a database, where the single creative form includes a plurality of different layouts, and where generating the creative includes, at run-time, selecting one of the different layouts depending on what portion of content is to be included in the creative.
[0009] In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems that include a system for providing content and that include a processor and a memory including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the processor to: identify a social network webpage associated with a content sponsor, link the social network webpage to a campaign, the campaign providing content responsive to requests for content, periodically evaluate the content of the social network page including evaluating recent content included in the social network page and store portions of the content for serving in a database, receive a request for content, determine that the campaign includes selection criteria that match the request, identify
one or more portions stored in the database that are associated with the campaign, including evaluating the one or more stored portions, and generate a creative based at least in part on one or more of the stored portions and provide the creative responsive to the request.
[0010] These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Evaluating the content can includes: crawling the content to identify target social content that has been updated or new social content, filtering the content based on one or more filter criteria, classifying the content based on verticals or other interest-based classifiers, and indexing the content based on the classification and storing the content for serving.

The system can further include instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: determine that the request is associated with a user that is not a follower of the content sponsor, and generate the creative for a non- follower including generating a creative based on interests of the requestor. The system can further include instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: receive user information about a requestor that generated the request, wherein generating the creative includes determining whether the user is a follower of the content sponsor, and customize the creative based at least in part on whether the user is a follower. Customizing can include determining which content from the database to include in the creative and determining a format of the creative.
[0011] Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. For example, content sponsors (e.g., merchants) who want to use the latest social content in their advertisements can have their advertisements update automatically without having to manually update their advertisement campaigns for each of frequent updates to social pages. In another example, content sponsors (e.g., advertisers) can have their advertisements presented with different social content to different users (e.g., followers versus non-followers) without having to manually edit advertisements or create multiple campaigns.
[0012] The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.
Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0018] This document describes methods, processes and systems for providing dynamic content generated from web resources (e.g., social network webpages). For example, a company may have a page that appears in a social network. A content sponsor associated the page can specify, e.g., in a content sponsor interface, that advertisements related to the pages are to be generated automatically from content of the page.
Information, such as posts on the page, can be accessed on an ongoing basis to generate, for example, advertisements of different formats and with different content. The formats can depend, for example, on the format of a particular post on the page, e.g., whether it includes text, images, video, or other content. The selection of which content (e.g., post) to use to generate a creative at run-time can depend at least on the type of user and the request for content. For example, if the user is a follower of the page, then the creative provided to the user can be based on information from the most recent post on the page. However, if the user is a non-follower of the page, then the creative provided to the user can be based on, for example, information that is likely to be of interest to the user, and which may include any post from the page.
[0019] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content. The example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content and at least one social networking system 120 that allows users to interact with other users within a social
network. The example environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. The network 102 connects websites 104, user devices 106, content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109, the content management system 110 and the social networking system 120. The example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104, user devices 106, content sponsors 108 and publishers 109.
[0020] In some implementations, a data store of user control and privacy preferences 142 can include information that the user has provided regarding if and how the user's information, including social network information, can be used. For example, users can use one or more user preferences webpages to set up preferences. In some
implementations, users can set a preference that says, "Do not use my information to provide content to me or others based on information in the social network".
[0021] A website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
[0022] A resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102. A resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts).
[0023] A user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. A user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
[0024] A user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104. In turn, data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by
the user device 106. The data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
[0025] To facilitate searching of these resources, the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114.
[0026] User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102. In response, the search system 112 accesses the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116. The search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages. A search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. In some implementations, the search results 118 include the content itself, such as a map, or an answer, such as in response to a query for a store's products, phone number, address or hours of operation. In some implementations, the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112. An example search result 118 can include a webpage title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the webpage, and the URL of the webpage. Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented. In some implementations, slots on search results pages or other webpages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process. In a reservation process, a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria. In some implementations, content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation).
[0027] When a resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content are requested by a user device 106, the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110.
[0028] For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource ("resource keywords") or a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116.
[0029] Based at least in part on data included in the request, the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request ("eligible content items"). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals and behavioral signals.
[0030] The content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection or other interaction with) of their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
[0031] The content management system 110 can include plural engines. For example, a webpage evaluation engine 121 can periodically evaluate the content presented on a page that is associated with a social network. For example, the webpage evaluation engine 121 can crawl a page that is associated with a social network in order to determine content that can be used in campaigns (e.g., stored in a data store of campaigns 124). The content can include social network webpage content that is updated periodically (e.g., posts, activity stream updates, or other content updates). The webpage evaluation engine 121 can store portions of the content obtained from social network webpages in a data store of stored portions of content 125.
[0032] A creative generation engine 122 can dynamically generate creatives in response to requests for content, e.g., to fill an advertisement slot with an advertisement. Requests can be handled, for example, by a request handler 123. In response to a request, for example, the creative generation engine 122 can access the stored portions of content 125 in order to dynamically generate a content item. For example, the content that is generated can be different depending on whether or not the user associated with the request is a follower of the social network webpage. A follower, for example, can be provided with content that is based on the most recent content update (e.g., post) on the social network webpage. A non-follower, for example, can be provided with a content item that is determined to be more likely of interest to the user, as described below.
Dynamically generating content in this way can be of great benefit to a page sponsor.
[0033] A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular
transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used
[0034] In some implementations, the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by selecting content based at least in part on whether or not the user is
a follower of an entity (the entity having a social network webpage). For example, content sponsors may specify to provide content to followers, where the content is based on the most recent information available, e.g., the latest post on a social network webpage. Content sponsors may elect to provide non-followers content from the social network webpage that includes content portions that are likely to be of most interest to the user, e.g., based on the webpage that the user is currently requesting or a history of webpages visited by the user.
[0035] The environment 100 includes one or more social networking systems 120 (though only one is shown) that provide functions and tools for users to share information in a social network or social framework. For example, a social networking system 120 can be associated with a social networking website that users can use to identify friends and social groups (e.g., circles), send and receive email, post messages and multi-media (e.g. photos, video, audio), track social events, provide updates, receive content, visit and interact with social network webpages associated with companies, products and services, and so on.
[0036] For situations in which the systems discussed here collect and/or use personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user' s identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user' s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
[0037] FIG. 2 shows an example system 200 for providing dynamic content generated from social network webpages. For example, the content management system 110 can dynamically generate content to be presented on a resource (such as webpage 202 that is being viewed by a user 203) using content that has been updated/ presented on a social network webpage 204.
[0038] As an example, the social network webpage 204 may be the social network webpage for a camera company that makes Camera X and other cameras. The social network webpage 204 can include a post 206, e.g., related to Camera X, including an
image 208 and text 210. The post 206 may be, for example, the most recent post on the social network webpage 204, e.g., more recent than an older post 212 (e.g., from the previous day) and other posts indicated by ellipses 213.
[0039] The webpage 202 can include the content item 214 (e.g., an advertisement related to Camera X) that is based on content included in and obtained from the post 206. For example, an image 216 can be obtained from image 208 on the post 206, and text 218 can be part or all of the text 210 from the post 206. This is an example of an image plus text format, but other layouts are possible. For example, other layouts include video, image, text, article (e.g., title plus content), article plus image, and album (e.g., a collection of thumbnail images).
[0040] Content items 214 that are generated by the system 200 can include other components and/or controls, such as a webpage visit control 220 and a follow control 222. If the user 203 selects the webpage visit control 220, for example, navigation of the user's browser session can be directed to the social network webpage 204. User selection of the follow control 222, for example, can enable future notification to the user 203 of content from the social network webpage 204, such as automatically generating posts on the user's social network activity stream that are generated from posts on the social network webpage 204.
[0041] In some implementations, the generation of content on the webpage 202 using content from the social network webpage 204 can be accomplished in several steps. At step 1, for example, the content management system 110 can identify 224 the social network webpage 204 that is associated with the Camera X content sponsor. At Step 2, the content management system 110 can link 226 the social network webpage 204 to a content sponsor associated with the social network webpage 204. The information can be stored, for example, in the campaigns 124 or the stored portions of content 125.
[0042] At step 3a, the webpage evaluation engine 121, for example, can perform a periodic evaluation 228 of content on the social network webpage 204. The evaluation can include evaluating recent content included in the social network page, e.g., since the last evaluation. This can occur, for example, on an ongoing basis, such as periodically (e.g., every five minutes) or on demand (e.g., when it is known that the content of the social network webpage 204 has changed). The evaluation can include, for example, crawling the social network webpage 204 for new content that was posted or updated since the last time the social network webpage 204 was crawled. At step 3b, the content
management system 110, for example, can store the new or updated portions of content, e.g., in the stored portions of content 125.
[0043] Steps l-3b can occur over time for many social network webpages, including the social network webpage 204. As a result, at any given time, the stored portions of content 125 can include portions of content from the most recently-crawled social network webpages that are known to the content management system 110.
[0044] At step 4, the request handler 123 can receive a request for content 232. For example, the received request can be a request for an advertisement to fill an
advertisement slot on the webpage 202. The request for content 232 may include, for example, keywords and/or other selection criteria for selecting a content item responsive to the request.
[0045] At step 5, a determination 234 is made that the campaign (e.g., an advertising campaign for Camera X) includes selection criteria that match the request. For example, the request for content 232 can be a request to fill an advertisement slot on a camera- related webpage, and the request can include camera-related keywords that match keywords in the advertising campaign.
[0046] At step 6, the creative generation engine 122, for example, can identify 236 one or more portions of content 125 that are associated with the campaign, including evaluating the one or more stored portions. At step 7, the creative generation engine 122, for example, can generate a creative 238 based at least in part on one or more of the stored portions, and provide the generated creative 238 in response to the request.
[0047] FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for providing dynamic content generated from social network webpages. In some implementations, the content management system 110 can perform steps of the process 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors. FIGS. 1-2 are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of the process 300.
[0048] A page (e.g., a social network webpage) is identified that is associated with a content sponsor (302). For example, the content management system 110 can identify the social network webpage 204 that is associated with the content sponsor of Camera X. In some implementations, the content management system 110 can also verify that the content sponsor has ownership of the social network webpage or is otherwise authorized (e.g., has copyright authority).
[0049] The page (e.g., the social network webpage) is linked to a campaign that provides content responsive to requests for content (304). As an example, the content
management system 110 can link the social network webpage 204 to at least one of the campaigns 124 that is associated with the content sponsor of Camera X. In some implementations, social extensions in a social network can be used to link social network webpage to campaigns.
[0050] The content of the page is periodically evaluated, including evaluating recent content included (presented or updated) in the page. Based on the periodic evaluation, portions of content are stored in a database (306). For example, the webpage evaluation engine 121 can evaluate content on the social network webpage 204 that is new content posted since the last time that the webpage was evaluated, e.g., that evaluated at least the older post 212.
[0051] In some implementations, one single creative can be generated from which different layouts are selectable at run-time. For example, the single creative can be stored, including storing portions of content that can be used to serve different layouts such as video, image, text, article (e.g., title plus content), article plus image, and album (e.g., one or more image thumbnails). In some implementations, generating a creative can be accomplished, for example, by mapping each different update type to different
advertisement creative templates. For example, if a post contains an image, the social content can be mapped to a template with an image field. In some implementations, information from the social network webpage can be used to generate the creative. The information can include profile content, a company's or entity's name, a description, a logo, an address, phone numbers, maps, and so on. Other information that can be used includes posted text, images, videos, locations, event information, the number of re-shares, the number of replies, content generated by other users in the user's social network, or other information. Follower information and/or statistics can also be used, including information about and the numbers of users who follow the advertiser who have +l'ed, re-shared, replied or otherwise interacted with a given portion of content (e.g., a post).
[0052] In some implementations, the webpage evaluation engine 121 can use an application programming interface (API) to access the content (e.g., the post 206). In some implementations, the webpage evaluation engine 121 can obtain timestamps of posts 206, maintain a record of timestamps, and evaluate only the posts 206 that have timestamps not already processed. In some implementations, virtually all of a post can be stored such that, at the time that dynamic content is to be generated from content in the post, all of the content is available.
[0053] In some implementations, evaluating the content can include crawling the content to identify target social content that has been updated or is new social content, filtering the content based on one or more filter criteria, classifying the content based on verticals or other interest-based classifiers (e.g., using clusters), indexing the content based on the classification, and storing the content for serving. For example, the webpage evaluation engine 121 can evaluate the content and determine whether the content is related to sports, art, cameras and/or other verticals so that the portions of content 125 can be indexed by subject matter, keywords, etc.
[0054] In some implementations, indexing the content can include storing
classification terms and using the classification terms as campaign selection criteria. As an example, indexing can be based on verticals or some other selection criteria.
[0055] In some implementations, the filtering criteria can be provided by the content sponsor and/or an advertisement system. For example, the webpage evaluation engine
121 can filter out undesirable social content (e.g., porn) to ensure that the content follows the policies of the content management system 110, the content sponsor, and/or the social networking system. In some implementations, content sponsors may set up lists of subjects to be filtered, such as by specifying keywords.
[0056] In some implementations, example portions of content can include locations, posts, images or videos. For example, the portions of content 125 evaluated and stored by the webpage evaluation engine 121 can include the physical location of the business entity associated with the post 206 (e.g., the Camera X Company street address), text from posts, images (e.g., photos/pictures of a camera) and videos (e.g., a demonstration of the camera's features).
[0057] A request for content is received (308). For example, the content management system 110 can receive the request for content 232 from the user device 106, e.g., for a camera-related advertisement to fill an advertisement slot on the webpage 202. The request can be handled by the request handler 123.
[0058] A determination is made that a campaign includes selection criteria that match the request (310). As an example, the content management system 110 can compare keywords or other criteria associated with the request with selection criteria associated with campaign 124. The comparison can identify, for example, an advertising campaign for Camera X.
[0059] One or more portions stored in the database are identified that are associated with the campaign (312). This includes evaluating the one or more stored portions, e.g.,
to identify the stored portions of content 125 that are to be provided to the user 203 in the form of creative s 238.
[0060] A creative is generated based at least in part on one or more of the stored portions, and the creative is provided responsive to the request (314). For example, the creative generation engine 122 can generate the creative 238, and the request handler 123 can provide the creative 238 to the user device 106.
[0061] Some implementations of the process 300 can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is a follower of the content sponsor and/or whose network includes at least one connected user that is a follower of the content sponsor. Generating the creative can include using the most recent content stored in the database that is associated with the social network webpage. For example, if the user 203 is a follower of the social network webpage 204, or if a threshold number or percentage of the user's social network friends are followers of the social network webpage 204, then the creative generation engine 122 can generate a creative that uses portions of content 125 from the most recent post 206 of the social network webpage 204. In some
implementations, determining that a particular user is a follower of a particular social network webpage can be done by comparing the user's various identifiers, including social identifiers, with lists of known followers of the target page (e.g., the social network webpage).
[0062] Some implementations of the process 300 can further include determining that the request is associated with a user that is not a follower of the content sponsor, and generating the creative for a non-follower can include generating a creative based on interests of the requestor. For example, if the user 203 associated with the request for content 232 is not a follower of the social network webpage 204, then the creative generation engine 122 can generate a creative that uses portions of content 125 that are likely to be of interest to the user 203, such as based on the subject matter of the user's current webpage 202 and/or recently-viewed webpages.
[0063] Some implementations of the process 300 can further include receiving user information about a requestor that generated the request, where generating the creative includes determining whether the user is a follower of the content sponsor, and customizing the creative based at least in part on whether the user is a follower. For example, the creative generation engine 122 can customize the generated creative 238 based on whether the user 203 is a follower, as described above.
[0064] In some implementations, customizing the creative can include determining which content from the database to include in the creative and determining a format of the creative. Some implementations of the process 300 can further include storing a single creative form associated with the campaign in a database, wherein the single creative form includes a plurality of different layouts, and where generating the creative includes, at run-time, selecting one of the different layouts depending on what portion of content is to be included in the creative. As an example, the webpage evaluation engine 121 can store a single creative associated with a post 206. The creative can have defined for it several possible layouts that can be selected at run-time. When the request for content 232 is received at run-time, the creative generation engine 122 can select the format to be used based on the request, the content to be included in the creative and type of user 203 (e.g., follower or non-follower). For example, for a non-follower associated with the request for content 232, the creative generation engine 122 can select stored portions of content 125 obtained from an older post 212.
[0065] FIG. 4 is a block diagram of example computing devices 400, 450 that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. Computing device 400 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers. Computing device 400 is further intended to represent any other typically non-mobile devices, such as televisions or other electronic devices with one or more processers embedded therein or attached thereto. Computing device 450 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document.
[0066] Computing device 400 includes a processor 402, memory 404, a storage device 406, a high-speed interface 408 connecting to memory 404 and high-speed expansion ports 410, and a low speed interface 412 connecting to low speed bus 414 and storage device 406. Each of the components 402, 404, 406, 408, 410, and 412, are interconnected using various busses, and may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate. The processor 402 can process instructions for execution within the computing device 400, including instructions stored in the memory 404 or on
the storage device 406 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such as display 416 coupled to high speed interface 408. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 400 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system).
[0067] The memory 404 stores information within the computing device 400. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory 404 is a non-volatile memory unit or units.
[0068] The storage device 406 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 400. In one implementation, the storage device 406 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, the storage device 406 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 404, the storage device 406, or memory on processor 402.
[0069] The high speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 400, while the low speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth- intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled to memory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low- speed controller 412 is coupled to storage device 406 and low-speed expansion port 414. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter.
[0070] The computing device 400 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a standard server 420, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of a
rack server system 424. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as a laptop computer 422. Alternatively, components from computing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such as device 450. Each of such devices may contain one or more of computing device 400, 450, and an entire system may be made up of multiple computing devices 400, 450 communicating with each other.
[0071] Computing device 450 includes a processor 452, memory 464, an input/output device such as a display 454, a communication interface 466, and a transceiver 468, among other components. The device 450 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of the
components 450, 452, 464, 454, 466, and 468, are interconnected using various buses, and several of the components may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate.
[0072] The processor 452 can process instructions for execution within the computing device 450, including instructions stored in the memory 464. The processor may also include separate analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of the device 450, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by device 450, and wireless communication by device 450.
[0073] Processor 452 may communicate with a user through control interface 458 and display interface 456 coupled to a display 454. The display 454 may be, for example, a TFT LCD display or an OLED display, or other appropriate display technology. The display interface 456 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving the display 454 to present graphical and other information to a user. The control interface 458 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to the processor 452. In addition, an external interface 462 may be provided in communication with processor 452, so as to enable near area communication of device 450 with other devices. External interface 462 may provide, for example, for wired communication (e.g., via a docking procedure) or for wireless communication (e.g., via Bluetooth or other such technologies).
[0074] The memory 464 stores information within the computing device 450. In one implementation, the memory 464 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, the memory 464 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, the memory 464 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Expansion memory 474 may also be provided and connected to device 450 through expansion interface 472, which may include, for example, a subscriber identification module (SIM) card interface. Such
expansion memory 474 may provide extra storage space for device 450, or may also store applications or other information for device 450. Specifically, expansion memory 474 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example, expansion memory 474 may be provide as a security module for device 450, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use of device 450. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIM card in a non-hackable manner.
[0075] The memory may include for example, flash memory and/or MRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 464, expansion memory 474, or memory on processor 452.
[0076] Device 450 may communicate wirelessly through communication interface 466, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.
Communication interface 466 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 468. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS receiver module 470 may provide additional wireless data to device 450, which may be used as appropriate by applications running on device 450.
[0077] Device 450 may also communicate audibly using audio codec 460, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.
Audio codec 460 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset of device 450. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating on device 450.
[0078] The computing device 450 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a cellular telephone 480. It may also be implemented as part of a smartphone 482, personal digital assistant, or other mobile device.
[0079] Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
[0080] These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. Other programming paradigms can be used, e.g., functional programming, logical programming, or other programming. As used herein, the terms "machine-readable medium" "computer-readable medium" refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term "machine-readable signal" refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
[0081] To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
[0082] The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and
techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN"), a wide area network ("WAN"), and the Internet.
[0083] The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
[0084] While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
[0085] Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
[0086] Thus, particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
