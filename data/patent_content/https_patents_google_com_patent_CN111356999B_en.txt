Detailed Description
The following is a more detailed description of various concepts related to methods, apparatuses, and systems for modulating voice data packet signals and embodiments thereof. The various concepts introduced above and discussed in more detail below may be implemented in any of a number of ways.
The present solution is generally directed to network source identification via audio signals. For example, a data processing system in a speech-based computing environment may receive a request or search query. The data processing system may access various sources or databases to generate responses to the requests. However, in a speech-based computing environment, identifying sources in an efficient manner can be a challenge. Thus, the system and method of the present technology may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information transmission and network source identification through one or more interfaces or one or more computer networks. For example, a voice-based computing system may have access to a limited number of interfaces, a limited type of interface, or there may be a limited number of interfaces available at a given time. Using currently available interfaces, efficiently transmitting information and identifying the source of the information can be a challenge to the system.
The systems and methods of the present technology may identify an audio signal or audio title stored in a memory of a client computing device. The data processing system may use a chime previously stored in the memory of the client computing device to provide an indication or identification of the information source accessed via a remote server or remote database. Thus, rather than sending the audio chime from the data processing system to the client device, the data processing system may provide a pointer or identifier to the client computing device of the audio chime, in combination with the response, to provide network source identification. The audio chime may include utterances, modulations, tones, frequencies, center frequencies and amplitudes, watermarks, overlays or other audio signals that may be indicative of the data source.
The present solution may reduce bandwidth utilization and associated latency in outputting a response through a speaker by selecting an audio chime previously stored in a memory of a client device. By selecting a previously stored audio chime, the data processing system may reduce bandwidth utilization by transmitting smaller data files that do not include the audio chime, or reduce latency by reducing the amount of data transmitted.
Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary system 100 for network source identification via audio signals. The system 100 may include a content selection infrastructure. System 100 may include a data processing system 102. Data processing system 102 may communicate with one or more of digital component provider device 106 or client computing device 104 via network 105. Network 105 may include computer networks (such as the internet, local area networks, wide area networks, metropolitan area networks, or other regional networks, intranets, satellite networks) and other communication networks (such as voice or data mobile telephone networks). The network 105 may be used to access information resources (such as web pages, websites, domain names, or uniform resource locators) that may be presented, output, rendered, or displayed on at least one computing device 104 (such as a notebook, desktop, tablet, personal digital assistant, smartphone, portable computer, or speaker). For example, via network 105, a user of computing device 104 may access information or data provided by digital component provider device 106. The computing device 104 may or may not include a display. For example, a computing device may include a limited type of user interface, such as a microphone and speaker.

The data processing system 102 can use the network 105 to access information resources (such as web pages, websites, domain names, or uniform resource locators that can be rendered, output, rendered, or displayed by the client computing device 104). For example, via network 105, a user of client computing device 104 may access information or data provided by digital component provider device 106. Network 105 may include or constitute a sub-network of information resources available on the internet that are associated with content delivery or search engine result systems, or that are eligible to include third-party digital components as part of the digital component delivery campaign.

The preprocessor 140 may be configured to detect a keyword and perform an action based on the keyword. Preprocessor 140 may filter out one or more terms or modify terms before passing the terms to data processing system 102 for further processing. The preprocessor 140 may convert the analog audio signal detected by the microphone into a digital audio signal and send one or more data packets carrying the digital audio signal to the data processing system 102 via the network 105. In some cases, the preprocessor 140 may send data packets carrying some or all of the input audio signal in response to detecting an instruction to perform such transmission. The instructions may include, for example, a trigger key or other key or license to send a data packet including the input audio signal to the data processing system 102.
The client computing device 104 may be associated with an end user that inputs a voice query as audio input (via the sensor 134) into the client computing device 104 and receives audio output in the form of computer-generated voice output from the transducer 136 (e.g., speaker) that can be provided from the data processing system 102 (or digital component provider device 106) to the client computing device 104.

The data processing system 102 may include, interface with, or otherwise communicate with at least one synthesizer component 118. Data processing system 102 may include, interface with, or otherwise communicate with at least one data store 124. The at least one data store 124 may include or store the chime data 126, policies 128, configurations 130, or quality scores 132 in one or more data structures or databases.
The interface 110, natural language processor component 112, digital component selector component 114, chime generator component 116, or synthesizer component 118 may each include at least one processing unit or other logic device, such as a programmable logic array engine or module configured to communicate with a database repository or database 124. The interface 110, natural language processor component 112, digital component selector component 114, chime generator component 116, synthesizer component 118, and data store 124 may be separate components, a single component, or a portion of the data processing system 102. System 100 and its components, such as data processing system 102, may include hardware elements, such as one or more processors, logic devices, or circuits.
Data processing system 102 can obtain anonymous computer network activity information associated with a plurality of computing devices 104. A user of computing device 104 may positively authorize data processing system 102 to obtain network activity information corresponding to the user's computing device 104. For example, data processing system 102 can prompt a user of computing device 104 to agree to obtain one or more network activity information. The identity of the user of the computing device 104 may remain anonymous and the computing device 104 may be associated with a unique identifier (e.g., a unique identifier of the user or computing device provided by the user of the data processing system or computing device). The data processing system may associate each observation with a corresponding unique identifier.
Digital component provider 106 may establish an electronic content campaign. The electronic content campaign may be stored as content data in the data store 124. An electronic content campaign may refer to one or more groups of content corresponding to a common topic. The content campaign may include a hierarchical data structure including content groups, digital component data objects, and content selection criteria. To create a content campaign, digital component provider 106 may specify values of campaign-level parameters for the content campaign. The activity level parameters may include, for example, the name of the activity, the preferred content network for delivering the digital component object, the resource values for the content activity, the start and end dates of the content activity, the duration of the content activity, the schedule of delivery of the digital component object, the language, the geographic location, the type of computing device on which the digital component object is to be provided. In some cases, flash (compression) may refer to the time at which a digital component object is extracted from its source (e.g., data processing system 102 or digital component provider 106), and the impressions are countable. In some cases, as click fraud may occur, robot activity may be filtered out and excluded as an impression. Thus, in some cases, an impression may refer to a measure of the response of the Web server to a page request from the browser, which is filtered out of robot activity and error codes, and recorded as close as possible to a point of time at which the digital component object was rendered for display on the computing device 104. In some cases, an impression may refer to a visual or audible impression; for example, the digital component object may be at least partially (e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or more) visible on a display device of the computing device 104, or may be audible via a speaker 136 of the computing device 104. Clicking or selecting may refer to user interaction with a digital component object, such as a voice response to a sound impression, a mouse click, a touch interaction, a gesture, a shake, an audio interaction, or a keyboard click. Conversion may refer to a user taking an intended action with respect to a digital component object; such as purchasing a product or service, completing a survey, visiting an entity store corresponding to the digital component, or completing an electronic transaction.
The digital component provider 106 may further establish one or more content groups for the content campaign. The content set includes one or more digital component objects and corresponding content selection criteria, such as keywords, words, terms, phrases, geographic locations, type of computing device, time of day, interests, topics, or verticals. Content groups under the same content campaign may share the same campaign level parameters, but may have custom specifications for specific content group level parameters, such as keywords, negative keywords (e.g., preventing the placement of digital components if negative keywords are present on the primary content), keyword bids, or parameters related to bidding or content campaigns.
To create a new content group, the content provider may provide values for content group level parameters of the content group. Content group level parameters include, for example, content group names or content group topics, and bids for different content delivery opportunities (e.g., automatic delivery or discretionary delivery) or results (e.g., clicks, impressions, or conversions). The content group name or content group theme may be one or more terms that digital component provider 106 may use to capture a title or theme for which the digital component object of the content group is to be selected for display. For example, an automobile outlet may create a different set of content for each brand of vehicle it is distributing, and may further create a different set of content for each model of vehicle it is distributing. Examples of content group topics that may be used by an automobile dealer include, for example, "Make a sports car", "Make B sports car", "Make C truck", "Make C hybrid", or "Make D hybrid". Exemplary content campaign topics may be "hybrid" and include content groups such as "Make C hybrid" or "Make D hybrid".
The digital component provider 106 may provide one or more keywords and digital component objects to each content group. Keywords may include terms related to products or services associated with or identified by the digital component object. Keywords may include one or more terms or phrases. For example, an automobile outlet may include "sports cars", "V-6 engines", "four wheel drive", "fuel efficiency", as keywords for a content group or content campaign. In some cases, the content provider may specify negative keywords to avoid, prevent, block, or disable content delivery of certain terms or keywords. The content provider may specify a type of match, such as exact match, phrase match, or broad match, for selecting the digital component object.
Digital component provider 106 may provide one or more keywords for use by data processing system 102 to select digital component objects provided by digital component provider 106. The digital component provider 106 may identify one or more keywords to bid and further provide bid amounts for the various keywords. Digital component provider 106 may provide additional content selection criteria to be used by data processing system 102 to select digital component objects. Multiple content providers 106 may bid on the same or different keywords and the data processing system 102 may run a content selection process or advertisement auction in response to receiving an indication of the keywords of the electronic message.
Digital component provider 106 may provide one or more digital component objects for selection by data processing system 102. When a content delivery opportunity becomes available, the data processing system 102 (e.g., via the digital component selector component 114) can select a digital component object that matches the resource allocation, content plan, highest bid, keyword, and other selection criteria specified for the content group. Different types of digital component objects may be included in the content group, such as a speech digital component, an audio digital component, a text digital component, an image digital component, a video digital component, a multimedia digital component, or a digital component link. After selecting the digital component, data processing system 102 may send the digital component object for rendering on computing device 104 or a display device of computing device 104. Rendering may include displaying the digital components on a display device or playing the digital components via speakers of the computing device 104. Data processing system 102 may provide instructions to computing device 104 to render digital component objects. The data processing system 102 may instruct the computing device 104 or an audio driver 138 of the computing device 104 to generate an audio signal or sound wave.
Data processing system 102 may include an interface component 110, which interface component 110 is designed, configured, constructed, or operative to receive and transmit information using, for example, data packets. The interface 110 may use one or more protocols (such as a network protocol) to receive and transmit information. The interface 110 may include a hardware interface, a software interface, a wired interface, or a wireless interface. The interface 110 may facilitate converting or formatting data from one format to another. For example, the interface 110 may include an application programming interface that includes definitions for communication between various components, such as software components.
The data processing system 102 may include applications, scripts, or programs installed on the client computing device 104, such as applications for communicating input audio signals to the interface 110 of the data processing system 102 and driving components of the client computing device to render output audio signals. The data processing system 102 may receive data packets or other signals that include or identify audio input signals. For example, data processing system 102 can execute or run NLP component 112 to receive or obtain audio signals and parse the audio signals. For example, the NLP component 112 can provide interaction between man-machine. The NLP component 112 can be configured with techniques for understanding natural language and allowing the data processing system 102 to derive meaning from human or natural language input. The NLP component 112 can include or be configured with machine learning-based techniques such as statistical machine learning. The NLP component 112 may parse the input audio signal using a decision tree, statistical model, or probabilistic model. For example, the NLP component 112 can perform functions such as named entity recognition (e.g., given a text stream, determining which items in the text map to appropriate names such as people or places, and what is the type of each such name such as people, places, or organizations), natural language generation (e.g., converting information or semantic intent from a computer database into understandable human language), natural language understanding (e.g., converting text into more formal representations such as first order logical structures that a computer module can manipulate), machine translation (e.g., automatically translating text from one human language to another), morpheme segmentation (e.g., dividing words into individual morphemes and identifying classes of morphemes based on the complexity of the morphemes' vocabulary or structure of the word under consideration), semantic processing (e.g., determining answers to human language questions, which may be concrete or open), semantic processing (e.g., processing after recognizing words and encoding their meanings to correlate the recognized words with other words having similar meanings).
The NLP component 112 converts the audio input signal to recognized text by comparing the input signal to a stored set of representative audio waveforms (e.g., in the data store 124) and selecting the closest match. The set of audio waveforms may be stored in data repository 124 or other database accessible to data processing system 102. The representative waveforms are generated throughout a large set of users and may then be enhanced by speech samples from the users. After the audio signal is converted to recognized text, the NLP component 112 matches the text with words that are associated with actions that the data processing system 102 can service, for example, via training throughout the user or through manual specification.
The audio input signal may be detected by a sensor 134 or transducer 136 (e.g., a microphone) of the client computing device 104. Via transducer 136, audio driver 138, or other component, client computing device 104 can provide audio input signals (e.g., via network 105) to data processing system 102, where they can be received (e.g., via interface 110) and provided to NLP component 112 or stored in data store 124.
The NLP component 112 may obtain an input audio signal. From the input audio signal, the NLP component 112 can identify at least one request or at least one trigger keyword corresponding to the request. The request may indicate an intention or topic of the input audio signal. The trigger key may indicate the type of action that may be taken. For example, the NLP component 112 may parse the input audio signal to identify at least one request to leave home at night to attend dinner and to watch a movie. The trigger key may include at least one word, phrase, root or partial word, or derivative indicating an action to be taken. For example, a trigger keyword "to" or "to" from an input audio signal may indicate a need for traffic. In this example, the input audio signal (or identified request) does not directly express the intent of the traffic, but the trigger key indicates that the traffic is an auxiliary action that requests at least one other action indicated.
The NLP component 112 can parse the input audio signal to identify, determine, retrieve, or otherwise obtain the request and trigger keywords. For example, the NLP component 112 may apply semantic processing techniques to the input audio signal to identify trigger keywords or requests. The NLP component 112 can apply semantic processing techniques to the input audio signal to identify trigger phrases that include one or more trigger keywords, such as a first trigger keyword and a second trigger keyword. For example, the input audio signal may include the sentence "I need someone to help I wash and dry clean clothes". The NLP component 112 can apply semantic processing techniques or other natural language processing techniques to the data packets that include the sentence to identify the trigger phrases "laundry" and "dry cleaning. The NLP component 112 can further identify a plurality of trigger keywords, such as laundry and dry cleaning. For example, the NLP component 112 may determine that the trigger phrase includes a trigger key and a second trigger key.
The NLP component 112 can identify a search query or trigger phrase that corresponds to performing a search or other information request. The NLP component 112 can determine that the input audio signal corresponds to a request for information about a topic, event, current event, news event, dictionary definition, historical event, person, place, or thing. For example, the NLP component 112 may determine that the input audio signal corresponds to a search query for information about historical events, such as "when the us revolution occurred? ".
The NLP component 112 can filter the input audio signal to identify keywords, search queries, or trigger keywords. For example, a data packet carrying an input audio signal may include "if someone can help me go to the airport, it is good (It would be great if I could get someone that could help me go to the airport)", in which case the NLP component 112 may filter out one or more terms as follows: "it", "would", "be", "great", "if", "I", "could", "get", "somerone", "that", "could" or "hellp". By filtering out these terms, the NLP component 112 can more accurately and reliably identify trigger keywords, such as "go to airport," and determine that this is a request for a taxi or ride share service.
In some cases, the NLP component may determine that a data packet carrying an input audio signal includes one or more requests. For example, the input audio signal may include multiple requests for information, such as "when the united states independent war is exploded? Which years the georget, washington acts as president? ". The NLP component 112 can determine that the request includes two different queries, the response to which may come from two different sources. In another example, the input audio signal may include the sentence "i need someone to help i wash and dry clean" clothes. The NLP component 112 can determine that this is a request for laundry services and dry cleaning services. The NLP component 112 can determine that this is a single request for a service provider that can provide both laundry services and dry cleaning services. The NLP component 112 can determine that this is two requests: a first request for a service provider performing laundry services, and a second request for a service provider providing dry cleaning services. In some cases, NLP component 112 may combine multiple determined requests into a single request and send the single request to digital component provider device 106. In some cases, NLP component 112 may send each request to a corresponding service provider device 108, or both requests to digital component provider device 106, respectively.
The data processing system 102 can include, execute, or otherwise communicate with a digital component selector component 114 to receive queries, keywords, or trigger keywords identified by a natural language processor, and select digital components based on the trigger keywords. The digital component selector component 114 may select the digital component via a real-time content selection process. The content selection process may include, for example, performing a search via a search engine, or accessing a database stored on a remote server or device, such as digital component provider device 106. The content selection process may refer to or include selecting sponsored digital component objects provided by third party content provider 106. The real-time content selection process may include parsing, processing, weighting, or matching digital components provided by multiple content providers in order to select services for one or more digital components provided to computing device 104. The digital component selector component 114 may perform the content selection process in real-time. Performing the content selection process in real-time may refer to performing the content selection process in response to a request for content received via the client computing device 104. The real-time content selection process may be performed (e.g., initiated or completed) within a time interval (e.g., 1 second, 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 20 minutes) of receiving the request. The real-time content selection process may be performed during a communication session with the client computing device 104 or within a time interval after termination of the communication session. The data processing system 102 may select an audio chime to provide after completing a digital component selection process or other digital task.
For example, data processing system 102 may include a digital component selector component 114 designed, constructed, configured, or used to select digital component objects. To select digital components for display in a speech-based environment, the data processing system 102 (e.g., via the NLP component 112) can parse the input audio signal to identify queries, keywords (e.g., trigger keywords), and use the keywords to select matching digital components. Data processing system 102 may select matching digital components based on a broad match, an exact match, or a phrase match. For example, the digital component selector component 114 may analyze, parse, or otherwise process the subject matter of the candidate digital component to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate digital component corresponds to the subject matter of a keyword or phrase of the input audio signal detected by the microphone of the client computing device 104. The digital component selector component 114 may use image processing techniques, character recognition techniques, natural language processing techniques, or database lookup tables to identify, analyze, or recognize speech, audio, terms, characters, text, symbols, or images of candidate digital components. The candidate digital component may include metadata indicating a subject of the candidate digital component, in which case the digital component selector component 114 may process the metadata to determine whether the subject of the candidate digital component corresponds to the input audio signal.
The digital component provider 106 may provide additional indicators when a content campaign (content campaign) is being conducted that includes digital components. The content provider may provide information at the content activity or content group level that the digital component selector component 114 may identify by performing a look-up table using information about candidate digital components. For example, the candidate digital component may include a unique identifier, which may be mapped to a content group, content campaign, or content provider. Digital component selector component 114 may determine information about digital component provider 106 based on information in a content activity data structure stored in data store 124.
Data processing system 102 may receive requests for content via a computer network for presentation on computing device 104. The data processing system 102 may identify the request by processing an input audio signal detected by a microphone of the client computing device 104. The request may include selection criteria for the request, such as device type, location, and keywords associated with the request.
In response to the request, data processing system 102 may select a digital component object from data store 124 or a database associated with digital component provider 106 and provide the digital component for presentation via network 105 through computing device 104. Computing device 104 may interact with the digital component object. The computing device 104 may receive an audio response to the digital component. Computing device 104 may receive an indication of a selection of a hyperlink or other button associated with a digital component object that causes or allows computing device 104 to identify a service provider, request a service from the service provider, instruct the service provider to perform a service, send information to the service provider, or otherwise query the service provider device.
However, in a speech-based computing environment, where the input is a provided audio signal and the output may also be an audio signal, accurately identifying the digital source that provides a response to a request, query, or keyword may be challenging, cumbersome, or inefficient. For example, for the query "when the U.S. revolution occurs? "may be the first digital component provider device 106, and" how do weather? The "response may come from the second digital component provider device 106. Because the display device may not be accessible or connected to the computing device 104 (e.g., the computing device 104 may be a speaker configured with a digital assistant), the data processing system 102 may not provide a logo, or other visual indication of the source. Further, the data processing system 102 may determine that providing a text-to-speech version of the source, such as "first digital computing device" may be inefficient or result in an output signal having a longer duration. Thus, data processing system 102 may determine to use an audio chime that is an indicator of the source of the digital component selected in response to a request in the input audio signal.
Providing an audio chime indicating a digital component source may utilize additional bandwidth. Further, because the same or similar sources may be used to provide responses to queries from the input audio signals (e.g., an online encyclopedia, online weather database, online dictionary, or online news website), the data processing system 102 may determine to reduce bandwidth consumption by storing frequently used audio chimes on the computing device 104 as the chime data 142.
The data processing system 102 can include a chime generator component 116 that is designed, constructed, configured, or used to generate, identify, or store audio chimes. The chime generator component 116 may register and store the chime provided by the digital component provider device 106. The chime generator component 116 can provide an interface (e.g., via interface 110) via which the digital component provider device 106 can upload or transmit an audio chime. The digital component provider device 106 may send an audio title configured using an audio codec. The chime generator component 116 can process or receive audio chimes in various formats or audio codecs and convert the audio chimes to a generic format for storage in the chime data 126 in the data store 124 or for provision to the computing device 104 for storage in the chime data 142 (e.g., computing device chime data) on the computing device. Data processing system 102 may receive one or more audio chimes from the same digital component provider device 106. The data processing system 102 may receive information associated with the audio chime, such as an identifier of the digital component provider device 106, or a policy for selecting the audio chime. The data processing system 102 may store the received audio chime in the chime data 126 and assign an identifier corresponding to the digital component provider device 106 or an online source to the audio chime.
For example, data processing system 102 may receive a request to register an audio chime from digital component provider device 106. Data processing system 102 may grant a request for digital component provider device 106 to register an audio chime based on the data quality score of digital component provider device 106. The quality score may indicate whether the digital component provider device 106 is trusted, secure, reliable, provides reliable information, or otherwise authorizes or grants for the audio title. Data processing system 102 may receive an audio chime from a digital component provider device. The data processing system 102 may evaluate a quality score of the data processing system 102 in response to a request to register an audio chime. Data processing system 102 may determine the quality score of digital component provider device 106 by performing a lookup in quality score 132 data structure stored in data store 124 using the identifier of digital component provider device 106. If the quality score is less than the threshold quality score, the data processing system 102 may determine to block registration of the audio chime. In response to the quality score being below the threshold, the data processing system 102 may determine to store the audio chime in the chime data 126, but prevent the audio chime from being used or transmitted. The data processing system 102 may dynamically determine a quality score for the provider and then decide in real-time regarding whether to include an audio chip with a digital component in generating a data structure or in outputting an audio signal.
The data processing system 102 (e.g., via the chime generator component 116) can process the digital component provider device 106 or an online site or multimedia content to identify an audio chime. For example, the chime generator 116 may be configured with one or more machine learning techniques to parse, process, or otherwise analyze web sites or multimedia content to automatically identify audio chimes corresponding to information sources. For example, a website may include multiple links to video content or audio content. Each of the video or audio content items may comprise portions having the same audio. Thus, data processing system 102 can determine that portions with the same audio can correspond to an audio chime that can be used as an identifier of an information source. The data processing system 102 may determine to store the audio chime in the chime data 126 and assign an identifier corresponding to the source to the audio chime.
The data processing system 102 may apply natural language processing techniques to determine utterances in video or audio content. The data processing system 102 may determine that the utterance can identify a source of information and form an audio chime. For example, the same utterance may be used on multiple video or audio content items associated with a website, and the data processing system 102 may determine to create an audio chime that includes the utterance. The audio chime with the utterance can identify the source.
The chime generator component 116 may determine that a website associated with the digital component provider device 106 or other source includes a data file labeled as an audio chime for the website. For example, a developer of a website may store a data file with a tag that identifies the data file as an audio chime. The tag may be a predetermined tag or a predetermined format. The chime generator 116 may crawl websites to identify websites with audio chime tags, retrieve audio chimes, assign identifiers to the audio chimes, and store the audio chimes in the chime data 126, or provide the audio chimes for storage in the chime data 142 on the computing device 104.
Data processing system 102 may receive a chime from a user of computing device 104. For example, a user of computing device 104 may select their own audio chime to present with digital components from a particular source or provider. The user may select a list of available audio chimes or provide audio chimes for other sources. The user may assign an audio chime to a digital component provider, or data processing system 102 may match the user-provided audio chime to the provider based on a policy or characteristic of the audio chime.
The data processing system 102 (e.g., via the chime generator 116) may process the audio chime to identify or determine characteristics associated with the audio chime. The data processing system 102 may use natural language processing techniques to determine whether the audio chime includes an utterance. The data processing system 102 may determine whether the audio chime is simply a musical instrument. The data processing system 102 may determine whether the audio chime includes music. Data processing system 102 may determine whether the audio chime includes certain types of words, such as trademark terms, nouns, or verbs. The data processing system 102 may determine the duration of the audio chip, the volume of the audio chip, or the frequency or tone of the audio chip.
The data processing system 102 may rank or score the audio chimes. For example, the digital component provider 106 may be associated with multiple chimes. Different audio chimes may include different characteristics. The data processing system 102 may rank the audio chime for the digital component provider device 106 based on the characteristic. For example, audio chimes of shorter duration may be ranked higher than audio chimes of longer duration; audio chimes with utterances may be ranked higher than audio chimes without utterances; the high-pitched audio chips may be ranked lower than the low-pitched audio chips. Ranking may be based on machine learning techniques, feedback, or preferences. The ranking may be based on the type of digital component provider or the digital component.
For example, because the digital components from the dictionary may have a short duration, the data processing system 102 may determine the ranking of the audio chimes of the dictionary source by ranking characteristics such as a short duration being higher than a long duration. Because digital components from news sources may have a longer duration, data processing system 102 may determine the ranking of the audio chimes of the news sources by ranking characteristics such as a long duration ranking higher than a short duration. The data processing system 102 may determine the ranking of the audio chips of the news source by, for example, speaking higher than the ranking characteristics of the instrument alone.
For example, data processing system 102 can access a website associated with digital component provider device 106. Data processing system 102 may identify a plurality of audio chimes via the web site. The data processing system 102 may rank the audio chimes based on machine learning techniques to assign a higher ranking to the first audio chime relative to a second audio chime of the plurality of audio chimes identified on the web site. The data processing system 102 may send the first audio chime to the computing device 104 for storage in a local chime data 142 memory of the computing device 104 (e.g., a client device) in response to the ranking.
In another example, data processing system 102 can access a website associated with digital component provider device 106. Data processing system 102 may identify, via the website, an audio chime that includes a first audio chime and a second audio chime. The data processing system 102 may determine that the first audio chime includes an utterance and that the second audio chime has no utterances (e.g., only musical instruments). The data processing system 102 may assign a higher ranking for the first audio chime relative to the second audio chime based on the first audio chime including the utterance and the second audio chime without the utterance. In response to the assignment, the data processing system 102 can transmit the first audio chime to the computing device 104 for storage in a local chime data 142 memory of the computing device 104.
Data processing system 102 (e.g., via chime generator component 116) can map chime to an identifier corresponding to digital component provider device 106 or an information source. Data processing system 102 may store a mapping of audio chime to identifiers in chime data 126. Data processing system 102 may store characteristics associated with an audio title in title data 126. The data processing system 102 may store the identifier property and the audio title in a data structure or use an index containing pointers to the audio title data file.
The data processing system 102 may provide the audio chime to the computing device 104. The data processing system 102 may send the local chime data 142 based on time intervals (such as every 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, weekly, monthly, or other time intervals). Data processing system 102 may update local chime data 142 in response to an event, condition, or request. Data processing system 102 may perform bulk transfers of local chime data 142. The data processing system 102 may send the audio chime to the computing device 104 (e.g., a client device) for storage in the local chime data 142 memory of the computing device 104 prior to receiving the input audio signal detected by the sensor 134 of the computing device 104.
Data processing system 102 may send audio chime or chime data to computing device 104. The data processing system 102 may send all or a subset of the chime data 126 to the computing device 104 for storage as local chime data 142 in the memory of the computing device 104. For example, the data processing system 102 may determine the source that is frequently used by the computing device 104 and then select a subset of the home data 126 to store as the local home data 142. The local chime data 142 may be a limited or fixed size or number of audio chimes to avoid taking up excessive storage resources on the computing device 104.
The data processing system 102 may determine a plurality of digital component provider devices associated with digital components responsive to the history request based on the history request received from the computing device 104. Data processing system 102 may identify a set of chimes corresponding to the digital component provider device and then send the set of chimes to computing device 104 for storage in memory as local chime data 142. Historical requests may refer to requests within the last 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, a week, a month, or other time interval. Data processing system 102 may maintain a list of identifiers of providers corresponding to the request and a counter of the number of requests associated with each provider to rank the most frequent providers. Data processing system 102 may provide chime data for all providers associated with requests in the past 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, a week, a month, or other intervals. Data processing system 102 may provide chime data for the top N providers (e.g., top 5, top 10, or other number of providers).
Data processing system 102 can identify a plurality of websites or online databases associated with digital component provider device 106. To reduce memory utilization on the computing device 104, rather than providing all available audio chimes, the chime generator component 116 may filter out multiple audio chimes to select a subset of the audio chimes or a single audio chime to provide for a source or digital component provider device. For example, data processing system 102 can use a memory reduction policy (e.g., stored in policy 128) to filter out audio chimes and select audio chimes for transmission to computing device 104 for storage in local chime data 142. The memory reduction policy may include, for example, selecting an audio chime with the smallest data file size, selecting an audio chime with the shortest duration, or determining to delete one or more audio chimes that may be redundant or duplicated because they identify the same provider.
The data processing system 102 filters the audio chimes based on the memory reduction policy to remove one or more audio chimes to establish a filtered or final set of audio chimes (e.g., chime data 126). The data processing system 102 may send some or all of the audio chimes from the final set of audio chimes to the computing device 104 for storage in the local chime data 142 memory of the client computing device 104.
The data processing system 102 may provide an audio chime for storage in the local chime 142. For example, data processing system 102 may provide audio chime to computing device 104 for storage prior to receiving an input audio signal that results in selection of a digital component. In some cases, data processing system 102 may receive a request for an audio chime from computing device 104.
The computing device 104 may store one or more chime data sets in the local chime data 142. For example, the computing device 104 may use a first set of chime data for a first user and a second set of chime data for a second user of the computing device 104. Data processing system 102 may select a child for the digital component using one or more policies based on a user of computing device 104. For example, data processing system 102 or computing device 104 may use a user-specific matching policy to select the chime to assign to the digital component. In some cases, data processing system 102 or computing device 104 may select a user based on an account or profile that has been logged into computing device 104 or data processing system 102.
The data processing system 102 may include a synthesizer component 118. The synthesizer component 118 may be designed, constructed, configured, or used to provide digital components to an audio chime. The data processing system 102 (e.g., via the synthesizer component 118) can identify an audio chime stored in a memory of the computing device 104. The data processing system 104 may request a list of audio chimes in the local chime data 142. For example, the data processing system 104 may request a list of audio chimes in response to receiving an input audio signal. The computing device 104 may provide a list of audio chimes stored in the local chime data 142 as well as the input audio signals. The data processing system 104 may maintain a list of audio chimes in the data stored in the local chime data 142 of the computing device 104 in the data store 124. Data processing system 102 may select an audio title to use based on a list of available audio titles stored in local title data 142. In some cases, data processing system 102 may send an audio chime to computing device 104. In some cases, data processing system 102 may determine to select an audio chime to use from a list of available audio chimes in local chime data 142 to reduce bandwidth utilization and latency associated with providing the audio chime and digital components.
The data processing system 102 may request a list of audio chimes stored in a memory of the computing device 104 before receiving the input audio signal. In response to the request, the data processing system 102 may receive a list of the identified names of audio names stored in the local names data 142 memory of the computing device 104.
The data processing system 102 can match the identifier of the digital component provider device 106 with a first audio chime of the audio chimes stored in the local chime data 142 memory of the computing device 104 based on the policy (e.g., from the policy 128). The policy may be a one-to-one match of an identifier with an audio chime associated with the same identifier. If an identifier is associated with multiple audio chimes, data processing system 102 can use the policy to select the highest ranked audio chime for the identifier.
The policy may be to select an audio chime based on characteristics of the audio chime or digital components, such as duration, volume, tone, speech, or instrument only. For example, data processing system 102 may determine to maintain the total duration of output within a predetermined time limit (e.g., 30 seconds). Data processing system 102 may determine that the digital component duration is 25 seconds. Data processing system 102 may then select the audio chime associated with the identifier for 5 seconds or less. In another example, if the duration of the digital component is 28 seconds, the data processing system 102 may select an audio chip of 2 seconds for the identifier. In another example, if the duration of the digital component is 30 seconds, the data processing system 102 may select an audio chime configured to overlay or overlap the digital component (e.g., an audio chime of a musical instrument only, rather than an utterance audio chime).
The data processing system 102 may determine a configuration to combine the digital component with the first audio chime based on characteristics of the audio chime. The configuration may be selected from the configurations 130 stored in the data store 124. The configuration may include, for example, adding an audio chime before the digital component, during the digital component, in between the digital component, after the digital component, or overlaying the audio chime on the digital component.
Data processing system 102 may determine the configuration based on characteristics of the digital component or the audio chime, or both. For example, the configuration may be to minimize the duration of the output, in which case the data processing system 102 may determine to overlay the audio title with the digital component. If the audio chime is an instrument only, the data processing system 102 may determine that coverage is possible. However, if the audio chime includes an utterance, the data processing system 102 may determine that coverage is not possible. Data processing system 102 may then determine to add an audio chime after the digital component.
Data processing system 102 may determine a configuration for combining the chime with the digital component to improve, manage, or optimize intelligibility. For example, if the instrument chime contains audio in a first frequency range and the digital component also contains audio in the first frequency range, the data processing system 102 may determine to choose a configuration to append the chime to the digital component before or after the digital component to prevent degrading the intelligibility of the digital component itself. In another example, if the answer to the query is an utterance, data processing system 102 may avoid overlaying the answer with a slab whose components (e.g., principal components) significantly overlap the utterance components. The data processing system 102 may use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques and machine learning to determine if a conflict exists between the chime and the answer. The data processing system 102 may detect a conflict based on a comparison of the amplitude of the audio chime with the amplitude of the audio digital component containing the answer. The data processing system 102 may determine that if the amplitude difference of one or more frequencies or frequency ranges is less than a threshold (e.g., 20 db, 15 db, 12 db, 10 db, 8 db, 5 db, or less), the audio chime may cause the audio digital component or answer to be unintelligible, resulting in a conflict. The frequency or frequency range may correspond to a frequency range of the audio digital component or the utterance in the audio chime, such as between 300-3000Hz (or 300-4000Hz or 300-5000 Hz). If the chime is at least lighter than the audio digital component or the utterance of the audio digital component by a threshold dB, especially in the frequency range where they overlap, the data processing system may determine that any chime may be overlaid on the audio digital component.
If data processing system 102 determines that a conflict may exist between the audio chime and the answer (e.g., within a range of speech frequencies of 300-3000Hz less than 12 dB), data processing system 102 may use one or more techniques to avoid the conflict. For example, data processing system 102 may select a different audio chime available on the local computing device, which may also indicate the source of the answer. The data processing system 102 may set a configuration that combines the audio chime with the audio digital components, including adjusting or manipulating the audio chime or the audio digital components that contain the answer. For example, the data processing system 102 may set the configuration to include increasing the amplitude or decibel of one or more frequencies of the audio digital component or answer and/or decreasing the amplitude or decibel of one or more frequencies of the audio chime. The data processing system 102 may set the configuration to combine the audio chime with the audio digital component in a non-overlapping manner.
In another example, if the instrument chime contains audio in a first frequency range, the utterance chime contains audio in a second frequency range, and the digital component also contains audio in the first frequency range, the data processing system 102 may determine to select the utterance audio chime because it contains audio in a second frequency range that does not overlap (or substantially overlaps, such as less than 10% overlap, 20% overlap, 30% overlap, 40% overlap, or 50% overlap) with the first frequency range. For example, the data processing system 102 may determine that the intelligible portion of the digital component contains audio in the frequency range of 1KHz to 2 KHz.
For example, a characteristic of the audio chime may indicate that there is no utterance in the audio chime. The data processing system 102 determines the configuration to overlay the audio chime with at least a portion of the digital component based on the indication that there is no utterance. In another example, a characteristic of the audio chime may indicate that the audio chime includes an utterance. The data processing system 102 may determine the configuration to append the first audio chime to the digital component in a non-overlapping manner before or after the digital component in response to a characteristic of the audio chime that indicates the utterance.
Data processing system 102 may determine to add an audio chime before or after the digital component based on the topic or keyword associated with the request or digital component. For example, for a digital component of news, data processing system 102 may determine to provide an audio chime before the digital component because the source may be more important or relevant to the content of the digital component. For example, for a digital component related to a recipe, the data processing system 102 may determine to set the configuration to provide an audio chime (e.g., ingredients of the recipe) after the digital component, as the source of information may be less critical.
The data processing system 102 (e.g., via the synthesizer component 118) can generate an action data structure. The action data structure may include the digital component provided by the digital component provider device 106, an indication of the audio title selected for the digital component, and the configuration. The indication of the audio chime may include, for example, a pointer, an identifier, a file name, or other indication of the audio chime. For example, the action data structure may include a first field for a digital component, a second field for indicating an audio chime to use, and a third field for a configuration of the audio chime with the digital component.
Data processing system 102 may send the action data structure to computing device 104 via a network. The data processing system 102 may cause the computing device 104 to generate an output audio signal based on the action data structure. The output audio signal may include the digital component received via the digital component provider device and the first audio title retrieved from the local title data 142 memory of the computing device 104. Accordingly, the computing device 104 may construct an output signal (e.g., via the audio driver 138) and play the output signal via a speaker (e.g., transducer 136).
Computing device 104 may perform a lookup in local chime data 142 to retrieve the audio chime selected by data processing system 102. In some cases, the data processing system 102 may provide an identifier of the source and the computing device 104 may select a corresponding audio chime from the local chime data 142.
The data processing system 102 may select a plurality of digital components in response to a single request or a single input audio signal. For example, a single input audio signal may include multiple queries, such as "how does weather for the day of the last year baseball tournament? ". Data processing system 102 may select a plurality of digital components provided by a plurality of different digital component provider devices in response to the request. Each digital component provider device may be associated with its own identifier (e.g., an alphanumeric identifier, an account identifier, a brand name, an entity name, or an organization name). The data processing system 102 may identify and select a different audio chime for each digital component provided by each digital component provider. The data processing system 102 may determine a configuration to combine each digital component and each audio chime based on the characteristics of each audio chime. Data processing system 102 may generate an action data structure using each digital component, the indication of each audio chime, and the configuration.
The configuration may include, for example, adding each audio chime before a corresponding digital component. The configuring may include adding an audio chip before the first digital component and adding a second audio chip after the second digital component. The configuration may include overlapping or overlaying one or two audio chimes on one or more of the two digital components. Data processing system 102 may determine the configuration based on a policy for determining the configuration of the individual digital components. When multiple digital components and multiple audio chimes are present, data processing system 102 may use multiple digital component policies to determine configuration. For example, data processing system 102 may use a higher duration limit (e.g., 1 minute versus 30 seconds) for the output audio signals of multiple digital components than is available for a single digital component. Based on the higher duration limit, data processing system 102 may determine to add audio chips in a non-overlapping manner based on the duration of the digital component itself.
The data processing system 102 may receive multiple requests in different input audio signals. The data processing system 102 may receive requests from multiple computing devices 104 that are associated or linked with each other, or that are not associated or linked. For example, the data processing system 102 may receive a first request corresponding to a first client device. The data processing system 102 can receive a second request corresponding to a second client device different from the first computing device. Data processing system 102 may select the same digital component in response to the first request and the second request. However, data processing system 102 may determine that the first list of names stored in local name data 142 for the first computing device is different from the second list of names stored in local name data 142 for the second computing device. Based on the policy, data processing system 102 may match the identifier of the digital component provider device with a second audio chime in a second list of audio chimes stored in a memory of the second client device, wherein the second audio chime may be different from the first audio chime.
Therefore, the present solution may reduce the amount of time consumed by resources, processor utilization, battery consumption, bandwidth utilization, size of audio files, or speaker. For example, a network or data request may traverse various routes through a complex network infrastructure, thereby increasing the difficulty of determining the information source. Furthermore, using the limited available interfaces of voice-based computing devices to efficiently transfer information and identify information sources can be challenging for a system, as some types of interfaces may consume more computing resources or batteries. By selecting an audio chime pre-stored in the memory of the client device, the present solution may reduce resource consumption, processor utilization, battery consumption, bandwidth utilization, the size of the audio file, or the amount of time consumed by the speaker, while also providing an indication of the source via the audio chime.
Fig. 2 is an illustration of operations 200 of the system 100 for providing network source identification via audio signals. The system may include one or more components of the system 100 shown in fig. 1. In operation 200, at 205, the client computing device 104 may transmit data packets carrying an input audio signal detected by a microphone or other sensor of the computing device 104. The input audio signal may include keywords, trigger keywords or phrases. The computing device 104 may send the input audio signal 205 in response to detecting a hotword or an actionable word in the user's speech input.
At 210, the data processing system 102 may request a digital component in response to a query or request in the input audio signal 205. Data processing system 102 may query one or more digital component provider devices 106 to obtain a response or digital component. Data processing system 102 may receive digital components from digital component provider device 106.
At 215, data processing system 102 may identify available audio chimes based on the list of chimes stored in local chime data 142. Data processing system 102 may have previously obtained an indication of the list of chimes. Data processing system 102 may obtain an indication of the list of home stored in local home data 142 in parallel with searching or selecting the digital component. By determining the list of available chimes in parallel with or in an overlapping manner (rather than serially) with searching the digital components, data processing system 102 may reduce latency.
At 220, data processing system 102 can determine a configuration of an audio chime having a digital component based on one or more policies. For example, data processing system 102 may determine to overlay the audio chime over the beginning of the digital component. At 225, data processing system 102 may generate an action data structure having a digital component, an indication of the audio chime, and an indication of the configuration. At 230, data processing system 102 may send the action data structure to computing device 104, and computing device 104 may play, render, or otherwise execute the action data structure.
Fig. 3 is an illustration of an exemplary method for providing network source identification via audio signals. Method 300 may be performed by one or more components, systems, or elements of system 100 or system 400. The method 300 may include receiving an input audio signal at 305. The input audio signal may be received via an interface of the data processing system. The input audio signal may be received via a network. The input audio signal may comprise data packets or be in the form of data packets. The data packets may comprise an input audio signal. The input audio signal may be detected by a microphone of the client computing device.
At 310, the method 300 may include parsing the input audio signal and identifying a request. The data processing system may use one or more NLP processing techniques or machine learning techniques to identify or identify queries, keywords, or other requests in the input audio signal. At 315, method 300 may include selecting a digital component. The data processing system may select the digital component provided by the digital component provider device in response to the request. The digital component provider device may have an identifier, such as a name, alphanumeric identifier, user name, account identifier, or other identifier. The digital component provider device may be remote from the data processing system. The data processing system may use search indexes, web crawls, selection processes, look-up tables in a database to select the digital components.
At 320, the method 300 may include identifying an audio chime. The data processing system may identify available audio chimes stored in a memory of the client device. The available audio chime may refer to an audio chime previously downloaded to the client device. The data processing system may have previously received an input signal or request. The data processing system may query the client device for a list of audio chimes stored on the device. The data processing system may have previously queried the client device (e.g., prior to the current request) and store the list of available chimes in a data store of the data processing system.
At 325, the method 300 may include matching the identifier with the first audio chime. The data processing system may match an identifier of the digital component provider device with a first audio chip of a plurality of audio chips stored in a memory of the client device based on the policy. The policy may include matching an identifier assigned to the audio chime with an identifier of the digital component provider. The policy may include selecting a higher ranked audio chime for the digital component provider.
At 330, method 300 may include determining a configuration. The data processing system may determine a configuration to combine the digital component with the first audio chime based on the characteristics of the first audio chime. For example, if the audio chime is a musical instrument only and does not distract or confuse the digital components, the data processing system may determine to overlay the audio chime with the digital components.
At 335, method 300 may include generating an action data structure. The data processing system may generate an action data structure including the digital component, the indication of the first audio chime, and the configuration. At 340, method 300 may include sending an action data structure. The data processing system may send the action data structure to the client device via the network to cause the client device to generate an output audio signal based on the action data structure. The output audio signal may include a digital component received via the digital component provider device and a first audio title retrieved from a memory of the client device.

Computer system or computing device 400 may include or be used to implement system 100 or components thereof, such as data processing system 102. Computing system 400 includes a bus 405 or other communication component for communicating information and a processor 410 or processing circuit coupled to bus 405 for processing information. Computing system 400 may also include one or more processors 410 or processing circuits coupled to the bus to process information. Computing system 400 also includes a main memory 415, such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 405 for storing information, and instructions to be executed by processor 410. Main memory 415 may also be or include a data store 145. Main memory 415 also may be used for storing location information, temporary variables, or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor 410. Computing system 400 may further include a Read Only Memory (ROM) 420 or other static storage device coupled to bus 405 for storing static information and instructions for processor 410. A storage device 425, such as a solid state device, magnetic disk, or optical disk, may be coupled to bus 405 to persistently store information and instructions. The storage device 425 may include the data store 124 or be part of the data store 124.
The computing system 400 may be coupled via bus 405 to a display 435, such as a liquid crystal display or an active matrix display, to display information to a user. An input device 430, such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, may be coupled to bus 405 for communicating information and command selections to processor 410. The input device 430 may include a touch screen display 435.

For example, display 435 may be part of data processing system 102, client computing device 104, or other components of fig. 1.
The processes, systems, and methods described herein may be implemented by computing system 400 in response to processor 410 executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory 415. Such instructions may be read into main memory 415 from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device 425. Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory 415 causes computing system 400 to perform the exemplary processes described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory 415. Hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions in combination with the systems and methods described herein. The systems and methods described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
Although an exemplary computing system has been described in FIG. 4, the subject matter comprising the operations described in this specification can be implemented in other types of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
For the case where the system discussed herein collects personal information about a user or may utilize personal information, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features may collect personal information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, the user's preferences, or the user's location) or whether or how to receive content from a content server or other data processing system that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways prior to storage or use to remove personally identifiable information when generating parameters. For example, the identity of the user may be anonymized so that personally identifiable information of the user cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user (e.g., to a city, zip code, or state level) from which the location information was obtained may be summarized so that a specific location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user can control how the content server collects and uses information about him or her.
The subject matter and operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs (e.g., one or more circuits of computer program instructions encoded on one or more computer storage media for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus). Alternatively or additionally, the program instructions may be encoded on a manually generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by data processing apparatus. The computer storage medium may be or be included in a computer readable storage device, a computer readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Although the computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, the computer storage medium may be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded with an artificially generated propagated signal. Computer storage media may also be or be included in one or more separate components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices). The operations described in this specification may be implemented as operations performed by a data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer readable storage devices or received from other sources.
The terms "data processing system," "computing device," "component" or "data processing apparatus" encompass a variety of devices, apparatus, and machines for processing data, including, for example, a programmable processor, a computer, a system-on-a-chip, or a plurality of systems-on-a-chip, or a combination of the foregoing. The apparatus may comprise a dedicated logic circuit, such as an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). In addition to hardware, the apparatus may include code that creates an execution environment for the computer program, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them. The apparatus and execution environment may implement a variety of different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing, and grid computing infrastructures. Digital component selector component 114, chime generator component 116, synthesizer component 118, or NLP component 112 and other data processing system 102 components may include or share one or more data processing apparatuses, systems, computing devices, or processors.
A computer program (also known as a program, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. The computer program may correspond to a file in a file system. A computer program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs (e.g., components of data processing system 102) to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disk; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
The subject matter described herein may be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component (e.g., as a data server) or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server) or that includes a front-end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described herein), or a combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include local area networks ("LANs") and wide area networks ("WANs"), inter-networks (e.g., the internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
A computing system such as system 100 or system 400 may include clients and servers. The client and server are typically remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network (e.g., network 165). The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, the server sends data (e.g., data packets representing digital components) to the client device (e.g., in order to display data to or receive user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., results of user interactions) may be received from the client device at the server (e.g., received by the data processing system 102 from the client device 104 or the digital component provider device 106).
Although operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, such operations need not be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, and not all illustrated operations need be performed. The acts described herein may be performed in a different order.
The separation of the various system components need not require separation in all embodiments, and the described program components can be included in a single hardware or software product. For example, NLP component 112 or digital component selector component 114 may be a single component, an application or program, or a logic device having one or more processing circuits, or a portion of one or more servers of data processing system 102.
Having now described some exemplary embodiments, it should be apparent that the foregoing is by way of illustration and not limitation, and has been presented by way of example. In particular, although many of the examples presented herein involve specific combinations of method acts or system elements, these acts and those elements may be combined in other ways to achieve the same objectives.
