Definitions
- This invention relates in general systems and methods for identifying and ranking user preferences.
- a first model may wish to learn an underlying objective (or “correct”) ranking from noisy data or noisy expressions of user preferences (e.g., as in web search, where user selection suggests relevance).
- a second model may assume that users have different “types” with inherently distinct preferences, and aim to learn a population model that explains this diversity.
- Learning preference types can be critical to effective personalization and preference elicitation: e.g., with a learned population preference distribution, choice data from a specific user allows inferences to be drawn about her preferences.
- Examples of relevant prior art include: Amazon.com, which recommends consumer products based on past purchases, product details viewed and other relevant features; and Netflix.com, which recommends movies primary based on movie ratings on a predefined scale.
- Another aspect that has been the subject of prior art research is finding an objective, or ground truth, and ranking of items based on expert relevance ratings or (noisy) user feedback in the form of comparisons on pairs of items.
- Algorithms for this problem have typically been applied in the domain of web search engines, where an objective ranking must be outputted for a given user search query.
- a computer implemented method for identifying and ranking preferences regarding a plurality of options, for a group including two or more members, the method comprising: (a) obtaining from one or more data sources, preference information, including partial preference information, for the members, or a subset of the members, wherein the partial preference information may include a set of pairwise comparisons involving one or more of the options; (b) analyzing, by operation of one or more server computers, the pairwise comparisons so as to learn one or more statistical models for inferring and ranking a set of preferences based on the partial preference information; and (c) applying the one or more statistical models so as to identify the set of preferences and rank the options.
- the one or more statistical models are selected to fit with the partial preference information.
- a plurality of mixtures of statistical models for inferring and ranking preferences is selected, thus enabling the formation of clusters consisting of probabilistic distributions applied to segments of the group.
- the method includes a further step of automatically determining (i) a series of model parameters that best fit the available preference information for selecting one or more statistical models that best fits the preference information, and (ii) based on the model parameters, selecting one or more applicable statistical models.
- the method enables prediction of unobserved preferences of specific members.
- the one or more statistical models include a Mallows model for specifying a probability distribution over a ranking of the choices.
- the Mallows model is specified by a mean ranking reflecting the average preferences of the group plus a dispersion parameter representing the variability of preferences in the group.
- the preference information is obtained from one or more of: (a) user ratings or comparisons of products/services on an explicit basis; (b) user actions such as product selections, social media interactions or clicking on web links, past survey responses, on an implicit basis.
- model parameters are inferred given observations of user behavior, survey data, or implicit choice data
- model parameters consists of inferred clusters of users, or preference types, based on partial preference data.
- a computer network implemented system for identifying and ranking preferences regarding a plurality of options, for a group including two or more members, the system comprising: (a) one or more server computers, connected to an interconnected network of computers, and linked to a server application; (b) the server application includes or is linked to an preference inference engine that: (i) obtains from one or more data sources linked to the one or more server computers, preference information, including partial preference information, for the members, or a subset of the members, wherein the partial preference information may include a set of pairwise comparisons involving one or more of the options; (ii) analyzing the pairwise comparisons so as to learn one or more statistical models for inferring and ranking a set of preferences based on the partial preference information; and (iii) applying the one or more statistical models so as to identify the preferences and rank the set of options.
- the one or more statistical models are selected to fit with the partial preference information.
- the server application is operable to automatically determining (i) a series of model parameters that best fit the available preference information for selecting one or more statistical models that best fits the preference information, (ii) based on the model parameters selecting one or more applicable statistical models, (iii) the inference engine applying the selected one or more applicable statistical models so as to infer a preference set or preference ranking.
- the inference engine is operable to predict unobserved preferences of specific members.
- the one or more statistical models include a Mallows model for specifying a probability distribution over a ranking of the choices.
- the Mallows model is specified by a mean ranking reflecting the average preferences of the group plus a dispersion parameter representing the variability of preferences in the group.
- a further step includes identifying the preferences enables the prediction of the preferences, and using the pairwise preferences and application of a Mallows model/mixture.
- the system is operable to enable the prediction of the preferences, by applying a Mallows model/mixture to the pairwise references.

- FIG. 5 is a generic system diagram illustrating an implementation of the invention.
- One aspect of the invention is a novel and innovative way of learning probabilistic distributions over ranking preferences of a user population based on one or more ranking models.
- Various ranking models exist and these generally enable the determination of ranking choices within a population of interest (such as a defined user base or a target market), and also optionally the segmentation of the population of interest based on participation in different probabilistic distributions.
- a common ranking model is the so-called Mallows model although other ranking models exist such as for example the Plaskett-Luce model, the Thurstonian model and several others (see the book “Analyzing and Modeling Rank Data” by J. I. Marden).
- a novel and innovative method and system for inferring the parameters of one or more statistical models for inferring and ranking preferences (such as known ranking models).
- the method and system enables inference of a plurality of mixtures of statistical models for inferring and ranking preferences, thus enabling the formation of clusters consisting of probabilistic distributions applied to segments of the population.
- Mixtures of Mallows models may consist of a variable number of Mallows models, each associated with a weight. Mixture models may be more flexible, allowing for representation of different segments of the user population whose preferences may be more distinct than permitted by a single model.
- a population may also be referred to a “group”, and the segments or sub-population may also be referred to as “sub-groups”.
- Yet preference information that is most widely available for example that can be obtained explicitly from user ratings or comparisons of products/services, or implicitly from user actions like product selection, social media interactions, “check in” using location-aware services like FourSquareTM or FacebookTM, or simple clicks on links (e.g., of different search results, advertisements, or news items, etc.) generally does not meet these specific requirements. It should be understood that this information may be obtained from one or more data sources that are connected to a server computer that implements the operations of the present invention, for example as an Internet service.
- This widely available information generally consists of partial preference information, which may be expressed as a set of pairwise comparisons over alternatives (items, products, options, information, web/search results etc.). Each pairwise comparison may be represented for example in the form of “I prefer item A to item B”. This is in contrast to the full ranking or partial ranking with a plurality of top ranked items, as referenced above.
- partial preference information While preference information in this form is widely available, referred to as “partial preference information”, the use of such partial preference information for learning one or more statistical models for inferring and ranking preferences in a given population is not considered to be computationally feasible based on prior art solutions.
- the inventors realized that one or more statistical models for inferring and ranking preferences may be learned using partial preference information if the partial preference information is expressed as pairwise comparisons.
- a plurality of particular methods are provided that enabling learning of one or more applicable statistical models for inferring and ranking preferences by automatically determining (i) a series of model parameters that best fit the available preference information for selecting one or more statistical models that best fits the available preference information, and (ii) based on the model parameters selecting one or more applicable statistical models.
- the statistical models may then be used to make predictions about the unobserved preferences of specific users, and to make decisions such as product recommendations based on the predictions.
- a method that utilizes a Mallows model (as a particular example of a common statistical model for inferring and ranking preferences) to specify a probability distribution over the ranking of the items.
- This ranking is operable to represent the preferences of a random user, with higher ranked items being more preferred.
- the Mallows model specifies the probability that a randomly selected user from a population of interest will have a specific preference ranking. More specifically, suppose a collection of items (e.g. products) given a population of interest (e.g., a target market). Given a ranking r of these items, reflecting an ordering of preferences associated with the collection of items, the Mallows model describes the probability with which a random user has preferences represented by r.
- the Mallows model is specified by a mean ranking reflecting the “average preferences” of the population plus a dispersion parameter representing the variability of preferences in the population.
- a plurality of different Mallows models may be utilized (or a “mixture” of Mallows models) that segment the population into sub-populations, each having a corresponding Mallows model.
- Each sub-population so generated consists of a cluster, segment, or group of users who have similar preferences.
- a group member's true preference ranking is a random perturbation of the average preference ranking of that group.
- Mixtures of Mallows models are generally more flexible, allowing one to represent different segments of the user population whose preferences are much more distinct than permitted by a single model.
- the model parameters are inferred given observations of user behavior, survey data, implicit choice data, etc.
- the model parameters consist of inferred clusters of users, or preference types, based on partial preference data. Prior to present invention, no mechanism was known in order to generate these model parameters based on pairwise comparisons or arbitrary choice data.
- a key operation for generating the model parameters consists of approximately sampling rankings from a Mallows distribution conditioned on observed choice data. This operation may be implemented using a sampling algorithm.
- the sampling algorithm is used to generate a plurality of samples to optimize the model parameters, thereby maximizing the degree of statistical fit. Further details are provided below.
- the invention provides, in one aspect, one or more operations (which may be implemented using suitable algorithms) that relate to the generalized repeated insertion model (GRIM), for sampling from arbitrary ranking distributions.
- GRIM generalized repeated insertion model
- the present invention may also include operations (which may be implemented using suitable algorithms or other calculations) for evaluating log-likelihood, learning Mallows mixtures, and non-parametric estimation.
- the techniques described may also be used for the purpose of generating an approximation to the true probability distribution in a variety of domains.
- Two experiments conducted using these techniques are explained below, using real-life data sets that demonstrate that the techniques described herein may effectively and efficiently learn good population preference models.
- the first data set utilized in the experiments consists of the elicited preferences of five thousand people for ten varieties of sushi.
- the second data set consists of the movie preferences of six thousand users, each giving ratings of movies they liked/disliked.
- Application of the present invention utilizing these data sets may produce results that reveal interesting preference patterns, as discussed below.
- methods and systems that enable the use of partial preferences to revise a particular individual's (full) preference ranking distribution, which can be used for example for inferring preference, e.g. in generating personalized recommendations.
- the present invention may include the use of approximate samplers that are exact for many important special cases—and have provable bounds with pairwise evidence.
- the present invention may be used for offline operation as well, for example in connection with a computer system used for discovering preferences based on partial preference information. It should be understood that the present invention enables a method of making preferences about one or more specific members of a target population given pairwise preference information about that specific member of the population, relative to the statistical models applicable at the population level. These methods may be embodied in a computer implemented system of the present invention, which may be implemented for example using the inference engine described below.
- the system of the present invention may consist of a computer network implemented inference service or engine that is configured to (i) utilize partial preference information, (ii) apply one or more operations for selecting one or more applicable statistical models based on the method as described above, and (iii) apply the one of more statistical models so as to generate one or more outputs.
- the partial preference information may be obtained from a variety of entities (including human and computer entities such as software agents, input provided by users using an input means (for example a web page) or online or offline databases, opinion or review sites, or social networking sites.
- entities including human and computer entities such as software agents, input provided by users using an input means (for example a web page) or online or offline databases, opinion or review sites, or social networking sites.
- Preferences may be elicited in a number of ways, by one or more queries posed to a member of a group about their pairwise preferences.
- the system may be implemented by one or more server Computers, connected to an interconnected network of computers, and linked to a server application.
- the system may also be implemented as part of a cloud service that is part of a cloud computing network.
- the computer program of the present invention in one aspect thereof, may be implemented as a server application, whether linked to one or more server computers or to the cloud service.
- the computer program may also be linked to or integrated with various other platforms or services that may benefit from the preference inference operations of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 One example of an implementation of the present invention is shown in FIG. 4 .
- the present invention may be understood as providing an online inference service for inferring preferences for a population, and for dynamically generating preference clusters that may define sub-populations that are associated with the generated preference clusters.
- the online service may be configured in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art, so as to embody the operations described herein.
- the computer system may be implemented for example, as shown in FIG. 4 .
- the computer system may include for example a server computer ( 50 ), but may include one or more linked server computers, a distributed computer architecture, or a cloud computing environment.
- the server computer ( 50 ) is linked to a server application ( 52 ).
- the server application ( 52 ) includes functionality for enabling the operations described herein.
- the server application ( 52 ) includes or is linked to an inference engine ( 54 ) that is operable to implement one or more operations that implement the learning procedure herein.
- the server application ( 52 ) may include a web presentment utility ( 56 ) that is operable to present one or more web pages that include a user interface for example for providing access to the output from the inference engine ( 54 ).
- preference information may be obtained from a variety of data sources, including for example online or offline databases, product review websites, social networking websites, location-aware applications or services, applications (including mobile applications) and so on.
- the server application ( 52 ), in one implementation, may also include for example one or more filters for detecting if preference information may not be expressed as pairwise preference. Additionally, the server application ( 52 ) may include programming that is operable to extrapolate pairwise preferences from preference information provided in other forms. Additional the server application ( 52 ) may include logic for generating all of the pairwise preferences that may be implied from particular preference input information.
- the server computer ( 50 ) is connected to an interconnected network of computers such as the Internet.
- Various computer systems may connect to the server computer ( 50 ) to obtain services described.
- Prior art in collaborative filtering may involve a setting where users' numerical preference ratings are given.
- a collaborative filtering service based on present invention requires only pairwise comparisons. This may be less restrictive than the prior art, since numerical ratings of items can be converted to pairwise preference comparisons over items, however, pairwise preferences cannot be converted to numerical ratings without positing strong assumptions regarding strength of preference. In other words, numerical preferences may implicitly require strength of preference such as “I like A twice as much as B” while choice data may only rely on qualitative and inherently relative preference data. Therefore, the present invention may provide benefits over the prior art in that it may require fewer assumptions about the form of the observed, surveyed or otherwise revealed preferences of users. The present invention may also impose less cognitive burden on users who are asked to explicitly to specify information about their preferences. At the same time, the present invention may produce models that are better aligned to the actual observed evidence from choice settings (including web search and voting applications).
- the present invention may also provide a benefit over the prior art with respect to computing an objective ranking. This may be as simple as assuming there is only one component in the Mallows mixture model and that user preferences are noisy deviations from the central, objective ranking.
- the present invention may further provide benefits over the prior art with respect to learning Mallows models.
- the present invention may allow learning and inference with arbitrary choice data, which may be building blocks of a wide range of practical preference structures, and may be much broader than the restrictive preferences used in the prior art.
- the utility of learning probabilistic models of user preferences may be significant. Such models may be used, and may be necessary, for a variety of purposes. Some of these uses may include:
- a vendor choosing which product or products to offer its target market may want to select those with the greatest potential for sales.
- Optimal choice of a product may depend on the distribution of preferences of members of its target market/population.
- a probabilistic model of consumer preferences may be a necessary input to any sound method or algorithm (or other calculation) for optimal selection of product offerings.
- Different products may be selected or designed for sales/marketing to each sub-group.
- a possible example may be displaying a slate of new release movies on a movie rental website such that there is at least one movie from the slate which appeals to any given subgroup.
- a model of population preferences may also be used to optimally segment the target market into sub-groups where members of a sub-group have similar preferences, but members of distinct subgroups have much more divergent preferences.
- the observed behavior or revealed preferences of a specific consumer may often be minimal.
- information about a consumer may consist of a small number of choices (perhaps even a single choice) of a product from a set of alternatives (e.g., the consumer chose to buy book X when presented with a set of options which included X).
- this single piece of information may be used to probabilistically estimate that consumer's preferences for a variety of other products by conditioning on the observed choice.
- the population preference model combined with the observed choice it may be possible to provide a much more precise specification of that consumer's preferences than is offered by the population model alone.
- This form of inference may be used to place the consumer in a particular market segment (see above) with more precision and greater confidence, and may form the basis of tailored marketing strategies, personalized product recommendation, etc.
- This form of inference may also be used to support the dynamic aggregation of individuals based on their inferred preferences for the purposes of demand-driven group discounting. When (sub) groups of individuals with similar preferences are automatically identified and targeted in this way, more customization of offers to sub-groups may take place, leading to greater yield (acceptance of offers) with less intrusion (fewer unwelcome offers).
- Application services may be designed to make recommendations (e.g., products, services, or information sources) after asking a user a number of queries related to their preferences.
- a model of population preferences can be used directly to optimize the query selection strategy in an adaptive fashion so as to minimize the expected (average) number of queries a user must face to determine good or optimal recommendations. This may lead to less cognitive burden on the part of users and hence more satisfaction with a recommendation system that incorporates or links to the inference engine of the present invention.
- Such technology may also be applied to group decision making, where preferences of group members may be diverse and a consensus choice must be made. In this case preference queries should be carefully chosen so as to ask the right individual the right preference query, in such a way as to recommend the best consensus choice requiring minimal interaction with users.
- the present invention may include the generalized repeated insertion model (GRIM), a method for sampling from arbitrary ranking distributions including conditional Mallows that generalizes the repeated insertion method for unconditional sampling of Mallows models (Doignon et al., 2004).
- GRIM generalized repeated insertion model
- the present invention may utilize such a sampler as the core of a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to learn Mallows mixtures, as well as to evaluate log likelihood. It may be possible to extend the non-parametric framework of Riverside & Mao (2008) to handle unrestricted ordinal preference data. Experiments have shown that the algorithms and other calculations of the present invention may effectively learn Mallows mixtures, with very reasonable running time, on datasets (e.g., Mocludes) with hundreds of items and thousands of users.
- the present invention may be used for targeted advertising purposes.
- preference data of a very general kind: i.e. a set of pairwise comparisons
- the present invention is operable to a statistical model that reveals the clustering structure of the users wherein in each cluster (i.e. group) of users their preferences are similar to one another. This allows advertisers and marketers to tailor their messages to the interests of groups of similar users. Furthermore, the groups of similar users reveal preference patterns that help businesses to design their products in order to target different user groups.
- the system of the present invention may be operable for example to generate in real time or near real time clusters of users and associated inferred preferences, in support of for example an ad network.
- Crowdsourcing applications are applied in a variety of context including for gathering information, opinion, judgments from users, including to arrive at a more accurate answer or decision.
- One prominent use case involves inferring the correct option (or choice, or object, etc.) (or a ranking of such options) from a multitude of options. For example, consider a website that wants to categorize restaurants, for a given restaurant it can present users with a pair of categories such as “Korean” and “Japanese” and have the user choose the more appropriate categorization (e.g. Korean), this allows the website to collect, for each user, a set of pairwise comparisons about the most plausible categorization of a particular restaurant. To aggregate such pairwise comparisons from users and present a ranked list in order of plausible categorization, our algorithms can be used to make such an inference.
- x denotes the restriction of ⁇ to items in X.
- 1[.] is the indicator function.
- a preference set ⁇ is a partitioned preference if A can be partitioned into subsets A 1 , . . . , A q s.t.: (a) for all i ⁇ j ⁇ q, if x ⁇ A i and y ⁇ A j then x tc( ⁇ ) y and (b) for each i ⁇ q, items in A i are incomparable under tc ⁇ .
- Mallows (1957) model The two most popular in the learning community are the Mallows (1957) model and the Plackett-Luce model (Plackett, 1975: Luce, 1959).
- the present invention focuses on Mallows models, though embodiments of the present invention may extend to include other models.
- the Mallows ⁇ model may be parameterized by a modal or reference ranking ⁇ and a dispersion parameter ⁇ (0, 1]. It may be possible to let r refer to an arbitrary ranking, then the Mallows model specifies:
- the output ranking will be an ordering of and ⁇ 1 , . . . , ⁇ i-1 and ⁇ 1 will be inserted at rank j ⁇ i with probability p ij .
- the insertion probabilities are independent of the ordering of the previously inserted items.
- I ⁇ (j 1 , . . . , j m )
- ⁇ there is a one-to-one correspondence between rankings and insertion vectors.
- sampling by RIM may be described as: draw an insertion vector (j 1 , . . .
- RIM may offer a simple, useful way to sample rankings from the Mallows distribution.
- RIM may also be used to sample from variants of the, Mallows model, e.g., those using weighted Kendall-tau distance.
- RIM may provide a powerful tool for sampling from Mallows models (and by extension, Mallows mixtures), it samples unconditionally, without (direct) conditioning on evidence.
- the present invention may generalize RIM by permitting conditioning at each insertion step.
- the present invention may utilize the generalized repeated insertion model (GRIM) to sample from arbitrary rank distributions.
- GRIM generalized repeated insertion model
- the present invention may apply GRIM abstractly as a means of sampling from any distribution over rankings.
- the chain rule allows the present invention to represent any distribution over rankings in a concise way, as long as dependencies in the insertion probabilities are admitted: specifically, the insertion probabilities for any item ⁇ 1 in the reference ranking may be conditioned on the ordering of the previously inserted items ⁇ 1 , . . . , ⁇ i-1 .
- RIM is run in the present invention with the conditional insertion probabilities p ij
- the chain rule ensures that the resulting insertion vector is sampled from the distribution Q′.
- This procedure is referred to as the generalized repeated insertion model (GRIM).
- FIG. 3 shows an example of trace or run of the GRIM algorithm and the probability of any ranking that it may produce at each step of the process in a tabular format.
- the resulting ranking distribution Q may be given by the product of the conditional insertion probabilities:
- GRIM may allow sampling from arbitrary distributions over rankings, as presented above it may be viewed as largely a theoretical device, since it requires inference to compute the required conditional probabilities.
- Mallows posterior Given arbitrary pairwise comparisons ⁇ , the present invention may compute the required terms in a tractable fashion.
- the Mallows posterior may be given by:
- One embodiment of the present invention may use RIM for rejection sampling: sample unconditional insertion ranks, and reject a ranking at any stage if it is inconsistent with ⁇ .
- RIM rejection sampling: sample unconditional insertion ranks, and reject a ranking at any stage if it is inconsistent with ⁇ .
- This may be impractical because of the high probability of rejection.
- GRIM GRIM.
- the main obstacle is computing the insertion probability of a specific item given the insertion positions of previous items in Eq. 4 when Q′ (more precisely, the corresponding Q) may be the Mallows Posterior. Indeed, this is #P-hard even with a uniform distribution over ⁇ ( ⁇ ).
- Proposition 5 Given ⁇ , a reference ordering ⁇ , a partial ranking r 1 . . . r i-1 over ⁇ 1 . . . ⁇ i-1 ⁇ and j ⁇ 1 . . . i ⁇ , computing the probability of inserting ⁇ 1 at rank j w.r.t. the uniform Mallows posterior P (i.e., computing P(r) ⁇ 1[r ⁇ (r)]) is #P-hard.
- the present invention may include an approximate sampler AMP that is efficient to compute. While it can perform poorly in the worst-case, it may be possible that, empirically, it may produce posterior approximations. (It may be possible to provide theoretical bounds on approximation quality.)
- Example 2 may use the same intuitions as illustrated in Example 1, where the (unconditional) insertion probabilities may be used by RIM, but subject to constraints imposed by ⁇ .
- AMP may induce a sampling distribution P ⁇ that does not match the posterior P ⁇ , exactly: indeed the KL-divergence between the two may be severe, as the following example shows.
- the true Mallows posterior P ⁇ may be uniform over ⁇ (r).
- AMP may perform poorly in the worst-case, it may do well in practice. It may be possible to prove interesting properties, and provide theoretical guarantees of exact sampling in important special cases. First, AMP may always produce a ranking (insertion positions may always exist given any consistent ⁇ ). Furthermore:
- Proposition 7 The support of distribution ⁇ circumflex over (P) ⁇ ⁇ , induced by AMP is ⁇ ( ⁇ ) (i.e., that of the Mallows posterior, Eq. 5).
- Proposition 9 If ⁇ is partitioned, the distribution P ⁇ induced by AMP is the Mallows posterior P ⁇ .
- AMP may have (theoretically) poor worst-case performance
- Eq. 8 it may be possible to derive the acceptance ratio for Metropolis.
- r (t) be the previous sampled ranking.
- Ranking r, proposed by AMP independently of r (t) may be accepted as r (t+1) with probability
- Theorem 10 The Markov chain as defined in MMP is ergodic on the class of states ⁇ (r).
- Extending the GRIM, AMP and MMP algorithms to sampling from a mixture of Mallows models may be straightforward.
- the prior art includes relatively little work on probabilistic models of partial rankings, and the prior art contains no known proposed generative models for arbitrary sets of consistent paired comparisons.
- One embodiment of the present invention may include such a model while other embodiments may extend algorithms and calculations to sample from a mixture of Mallows models.
- r, ⁇ ) ⁇
- r, ⁇ ) 0 otherwise. It may be possible to view this as a process in which an a-coin is flipped for each pair of items to decide whether that pairwise comparison in r is revealed by ⁇ . Taken together, the outcome is the joint distribution: P ( ⁇ , r,z
- ⁇ , ⁇ , ⁇ , ⁇ ) P ( ⁇
- z (t) )P(z (t) ) ⁇ k d(r, ⁇ k ) 1[r ⁇ ( ⁇ )] if z k (t) 1.
- This form of Mallows posterior sampling may be applied by embodiments of the present invention with AMP or MMP.
- the present invention may implement maximum likelihood learning of the parameters ⁇ , ⁇ , and ⁇ of a Mallows mixture using EM. Before implementing an EM algorithm or calculation, it may be necessary to consider the evaluation of log likelihood, which is used to select K or test convergence.
- V) in models applied by the present invention may be written as:
- GRIM-based Gibbs sampling as described herein
- indicator vector z l (t) denote the mixture component to which the t-th sample of l belongs.
- Embodiments of the present invention may apply Lagrange multipliers yields:
- Optimizing ⁇ k may require computing “Kemeny consensus” of the rankings in S k , an NP-hard problem. Drawing on the notion of local Kemenization (Dwork et al., 2001), the present invention may instead compute a locally optimal ⁇ k , where swapping two adjacent items in ⁇ k may not be operable to reduce the sum of distances in the Kemeny objective.
- Optimizing ⁇ Some embodiments of the present invention may optimize ⁇ in Eq. 12. The objective decomposes into a sum that may permit independent optimization of each ⁇ k . Exact optimization of ⁇ k may be difficult: however, the present invention may use gradient ascent with
- one iteration of the E-step takes O(nTpT Gibbs (T Metro m 2 +Km log m)) time where T Metro is number of Metropolis steps, T Gibbs the number of Gibbs steps, and T P is the posterior sample size for each ⁇ l .
- the M-step takes time O(Km 2 ) dominated by the K tournament graphs used to compute Kemeny consensus.
- q l ⁇ ( s , r ) ⁇ d ⁇ ( r , s ) ⁇ ⁇ ( v l ) ⁇ ⁇ Z ⁇ , where Z ⁇ is the Mallows normalization constant. This corresponds to drawing a ranking s uniformly from ⁇ ( ⁇ l ), then drawing r from a Mallows distribution with reference ranking s and dispersion ⁇ .
- the present invention may extend the non-parametric estimator to paired comparisons using:
- the present invention assessed how well AMP approximates the true Mallows posterior P v .
- the experiment of the present invention generated 20 preferences ⁇ using the mixture model, and evaluated the KL-divergence of ⁇ circumflex over (P) ⁇ ⁇ and P ⁇ (normalized by the entropy of P ⁇ ).
- the experimental results show that AMP can approximate the posterior well, with average normalized KL error ranging from 1-5%, across the parameter ranges tested.
- the Sushi dataset 20 consists of 5000 full rankings over 10 varieties of sushi indicating sushi preferences (Kamishima et al., 2005).
- the experiment used 3500 preferences for training and 1500 for validation.
- EM experiments were run by generating revealed paired comparisons for training with various probabilities ⁇ . To mitigate issues with local maxima the experiment was run on the present invention EM ten times (more than is necessary) for each instance.
- FIG. 2 shows the learned clusters (all with reasonably low dispersion), illustrating interesting patterns (e.g., fatty tuna strongly preferred by all but one group; strong correlation across groups in preference/dispreference for salmon roe and sea urchin (atypical “fish”): and cucumber roll consistently dispreferred).
- interesting patterns e.g., fatty tuna strongly preferred by all but one group; strong correlation across groups in preference/dispreference for salmon roe and sea urchin (atypical “fish”): and cucumber roll consistently dispreferred).

where λ=−1nφ≧0. To overcome the unimodal nature of Mallows models, mixture models have been proposed. A mixture with K components may require reference rankings σ=(σ1, . . . , σK) dispersion parameters φ=(φ1, . . . , φK) and mixing coefficients π=(πn, . . . , πK). EM methods for such mixtures (limited to complete or top-k data) have been studied (Murphy & Martin, 2003: Russe et al., 2007).

where Zk is the Mallows normalization constant. It may be easy to derive the maximum likelihood estimate for
So it may be possible to ignore this additive constant, and focus on the first term in the sum, denoted £(π, σ, φ|V). Unfortunately, evaluating this theorem may be provably hard:
and estimate the inner expectations by sampling from the Mallows model P(r|σk, φk). However, this can require exponential sample complexity in the worst case (e.g., if K=1 and ν is far from σ, i.e. d(ν, σ) is large, then a sample of exponential size may be expected to ensure ν is in the sample). But it is possible to rewrite the summation inside the log as:
