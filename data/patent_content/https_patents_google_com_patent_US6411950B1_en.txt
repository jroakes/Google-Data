Definitions
- the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for searching records stored in an electronic database. More specifically, but not by way of limitation, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for dynamic search result refinement by refining a vague text-search query into a more specific text-search query.
- a common and accurate searching technique is full-text searching—shown in FIG. 1 .
- a full-text search the entire text that is to be searched, e.g., a database record, is scanned to find a match with a particular received query. Steps 100 and 110 . When a match between that which is scanned and the search query is located, the location of the match is returned as a search result—called a hit. Step 120 . This location corresponds to a particular database record or in terms of the Web, the location or the URL of a particular Web page.
- full-text searching is very accurate, this accuracy sometimes presents major drawbacks.
- the full-text search is accurate and efficient in that it returns only a few locations. Thus, a user can quickly scan through the records corresponding to these returned locations.
- full-text searching is most useful and most powerful when it is searching for a needle in a haystack. If, however, a user is not searching for such a needle, i.e., does not have a very specific query, the full-text search is cumbersome and inefficient. For example, if the user attempts to search the Web for the phrase “New York,” a full-text search could return millions of hits. obviously, it would be virtually impossible for the user to wade through millions of records to find specific records of interest. Even if the particular site for which the user is searching is included in the hits, the user could easily overlook this site because it is buried among the other records.
- One way to reduce the number of hits from a full-text search is to narrow the search term. For instance, the phrase “New York” could be narrowed to “New York transit.” Although it may seem elementary to modify the query by, for example, adding another term, many times it is not clear as to which term to add or how to otherwise modify the query. If a user is looking for commuter buses leaving New York City, it is not clear whether the proper query would include “buses”, “commuter”, “transit”, or any combination thereof. Very possibly, the proper query might involve terms that elude a user, i.e., “port authority,”—because many commuter buses leave from the New York Port Authority.
- Some current search engines provide a user with possible or suggested terms to be added to their search. For example, a search engine might suggest that for the query“law” one of the following terms be added: “legal,” “intellectual,” “court” or “appeals.” Thus, the new search could be, e.g., “law appeals” or “law legal.” Thus, the suggested query is not a coherent phrase but rather a jumble of related words.
- the flaw with these current search engines is that the suggested terms do not necessarily focus a user's search.
- An additional flaw with these current search engines is that their list of suggested terms is not dynamically updated to reflect the most popular or most requested records.
- an invention is needed that provides the user the ability to focus a general search query so that a user can readily refine a general search query until the search results contain a usable amount of record locations. Further, an invention is needed that dynamically generates lists of more specific queries for a given query, thereby giving a user the most up-to-date and most popular choices for query refinement.
- the present invention overcomes the above identified problems as well as other deficiencies of existing technologies by providing, in one aspect, a method for generating an index useable to refine a vague query into more specific queries for searching stored records.
- the method includes the step of generating a phrase list.
- This phrase list can be constructed by receiving a number of queries from various users and then extracting phrases from those queries. These extracted phrases may be quoted phrases, i.e., user's search phrases that were placed in quotation marks. Further, the phrase list could include only those phrases that are determined to be statistically significant. The statistical significance of the search phrase may be determined by the number of times a particular phrase appears in the received user queries. This number is the query frequency.
- Another step of the method of this invention includes computing the index frequency of the phrases in the phrase list.
- the index frequency indicates to what degree a phrase is general or specific, and it can be calculated a number of ways.
- the index frequency for a particular phrase can be the number of times that the particular phrase appears in all the html pages associated with a particular search engine database.
- a step is included that determines whether the frequency for a particular phrase is lower than that of another particular phrase. Good results have been achieved by utilizing either of the index frequency or the query frequency.
- the present invention stores the two phrases in an index, the two phrases being associated with each other in the index.
- the two phrases are stored in an index only if the index frequency for one phrase is many times larger, e.g. 10 times larger, than that of another particular phrase.
- the two phrases should be at least partial syntactic matches. In other words, the two phrases should share at least one common term before the two phrases can be stored in the index. It is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention that the two phrase can be stored in the index if the common terms are similar but not an exact match.
- the method of the invention includes the step of receiving a query from a user. If an entry similar to this query is stored in an index, index entries associated with the that entry are transmitted to the user. The user then can use the transmitted index entries to either search the database or to further refine the original query.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a process used by current search engines
- FIG. 2 illustrates a computer system in accordance with the present invention
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing the process for building a query refinement index
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the refinement of a query using the query refinement index.
- FIG. 5 illustrates the results of two refinements of an original query.
- the present invention generates an index of queries by utilizing a log-file created by a search engine such as Alta Vista.
- a log-file is created by capturing all user queries transmitted to the search engine. These queries can be transmitted between computers 200 attached to a network 210 and a search engine run by computers 230 , which are attached to another network 240 .
- Some log-files, such as the one created by the Alta Vista search engine capture each query in the exact format as was entered by the user. Thus, in this type of log-file, all punctuation, capitalization and quotations are preserved.
- a log-file may grow to contain a large number of entries. Accordingly, to efficiently store the log-file, the data may be manipulated and stored according to data handling techniques. If necessary, the log-file can be stored in distributed storage 250 .
- any quoted phrases are identified and in certain embodiments, extracted, i.e., any text between quotation marks is identified and extracted.
- Step 300 Not every extracted phrase, however, need be quoted. For example, non-quoted phrases such as “New York” or “Bill Clinton” may be recognized and extracted. Further, phrases may be extracted that are set off by indicators other than quotation marks.
- the query frequency for “eigen value theorem” might be low, the phrase still might be useful in refining a user query. Any of the well-known statistical techniques can be used to determine exactly how low a query frequency must be before the associated phrase is no longer useful and, thus, considered statistically insignificant.
- an index frequency will be computed. Step 320 . If statistically insignificant phrases were previously discarded, then the index frequency does not need to be computed for those phrases.
- the index frequency can be calculated a number of ways. For instance, the index frequency can be computed as the number of times that the phrase occurs in all the html pages contained in a search engine database. Alternatively, the index frequency could be the number of records that contain the particular phrase. Regardless of how the index frequency is calculated, it indicates to what degree a particular phrase is general or specific. For example, a phrase such as “New York,” as would be expected, has a high index frequency (3,394,000 according to one search engine) and, thus, would be considered a very general phrase. On the other hand, a phrase such as “eigen value theorem” has a low index frequency (5 according to one search engine) and, thus, is considered a more specific phrase.
- step 330 a determination is made as to whether all phrases and subphrases have been considered. If the determination is negative, the “no” branch is followed to step 340 and a particular phrase from the log-file is selected. Step 340 .
- the index becomes dynamic and will continuously adapt to users' changing informational needs. As terms become more or less popular, their position in the index will change accordingly.
- Step 350 a subphrase of that selected phrase is identified.
- the term “car rental” would be identified as a subphrase of the phrase “alamo car rental.”
- a determination is then made as to whether the selected phrase is a refinement of the identified subphrase, e.g., whether “alamo car rental” is a refinement of “car rental.”
- Step 360 a subphrase of the identified subphrase, e.g., whether “alamo car rental” is a refinement of “car rental.”
- the subphrase should have an index frequency or query frequency higher than that of the particular phrase.
- the subphrase must have an index frequency or query frequency higher than that of a particular phrase but lower that of another subphrase of terms included in the particular phrase, or in other words, the index frequency or query frequency for the subphrase must fall within a certain range.
- the query frequency or the index frequency for “car rental” should be higher than that of “alamo car rental” and lower than that of “car.”
- step 360 If the determination is made in step 360 that the identified subphrase does not qualify as a refinement, the “no” branch is followed back to step 330 . If, however, the “yes” branch is followed in step 360 , then the identified subphrase qualifies as a refinement, and the subphrase and the particular phrase are stored in association with each other. Step 370 .
- the two data pieces can be associated with each other in accordance with any number of data structure construction techniques.
- the subphrase may be stored with a pointer pointing. to the particular phrase. As illustrated by the loop between step 370 and step 350 , any other subsets are identified and processed in the same fashion.
- Step 330 The above described steps can be repeated for each subphrase of the particular phrase and for each phrase extracted from the log-file. Step 330 .
- the subphrases “alamo,” “car,” “rental,” and “alamo car” would need to be processed.
- the inclusiveness of a subphrase can be changed.
- Subphrases can consist of only consecutive words or they can consist of ordered consecutive words and ordered nonconsecutive words.
- subphrases can consist of any possible permutation of a phrase or any possible permutation after certain terms within the phrase are discarded.
- the final index includes phrases extracted from the log-file stored in association with the subphrases for which the phrase is a refinement.
- different phrases will contain similar subphrases.
- the subphrase “car rentals” is contained in the phrases “alamo car rentals, “budget car rentals” and “enterprise car rentals.”
- the final index is generated and stored in an efficient, clean manner.
- the “yes” branch is followed to step 380 wherein the index can be further enhanced through various refinement means.
- refinement includes setting an index frequency threshold associated with a particular phrase. If the index frequency for a particular phrase is below the threshold, the particular phrase will not be indexed. It is contemplated that the refinement step can occur throughout the process of building the index. Thus the placement of the refinement step 380 in FIG. 3 just prior to the termination step 390 is not meant to be limiting.
- FIG. 4 there is illustrated a block flow diagram detailing the refinement of a query using the query refinement index wherein a user can follow the links in the index between subphrases and phrases to create a more specific query.
- the user transmits a query to the database search engine.
- Step 400 The index is then searched for any refinement of the query.
- Step 410 Whether a refinement is found or not, the search engine performs a search based upon the query.
- Step 420 This search can be done before, after or simultaneously with the index being searched.
- Step 450 it is determined whether a refinement is available.
- the search engine displays the results of the search and ends the search for this query. Steps 430 and 440 . If in step 450 there is a refinement in the index the “yes” branch is followed and both the results of the search and the list of refinements are displayed. Step 460 .
- the displayed list may be shortened for aesthetic or management reasons.
- the list may also be arranged in a variety of ways, such as according to the query frequency of each refinement in the list. Thus, for certain queries, the displayed refinement list may only be twenty ( 20 ) refinements with the highest query frequency.
- the determination about which refinements to display is based at least partially upon which of the refinements is most often selected to refine a particular query.
- Another example of refining the display list includes setting an index frequency threshold associated with a particular phrase. If the index frequency for a particular phrase is below the threshold, the particular phrase will not be displayed.
- Step 470 If the user chooses to run a new search with the refinements the “yes” branch is followed and the above steps are repeated with the user's chosen refined query. Thus, a user can traverse the entire list of refinements for a particular query and each time find a more focused query than the time before. If at any time the query is focused enough, the user can opt to use the results of the search engine and not to further refine the query. Step 470 .
- the user transmits the original query “car” 500 .
- the user receives back the search engine results for “car” 500 (not shown) and a list of refinements 510 .
- the user chooses an additional refinement, “rental cars” 530 .
- the term “rental cars” 530 is presented to the search engine, and as before, the user receives back the search engine results (not shown) and a new list of refinements 520 .
- the user can then select a query from the new list of refinements 520 .
