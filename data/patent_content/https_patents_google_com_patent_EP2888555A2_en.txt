- the memory 280 includes software instructions 282 for storing and/or processing the data 284 for calculating a travel route based on the navigational preferences and travel history of the user.
- the server 170 is connected to the network 140 via a communications module 262.

- data e.g., location data 246
- the communications module 262 can be, for example, a modem or Ethernet card.
- the processor 260 of the server 1 70 is configured to execute instructions, such as instructions physically coded into the processor 260, instructions read from the memory 280, or a combination of both. As an example, the processor 260 of the server 170 executes instructions for calculating a travel route based on the navigational preferences and the travel history of the user.

- FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a process 300 for calculating a travel route based on navigational preferences and travel history of the user.
- the navigational preferences and the travel history of the user are stored as data 284 in the memory 280 of the server 170.
- the navigational preferences of the user include routing preferences and points of interest of the user.
- the travel history includes location data 246 from a respective date and time received from the location-aware device 1 10 associated with the user.
- the points of interest of the user can be included in the stored navigational preferences in a number of ways.
- a point of interest can be included in the stored navigational preferences based on a check-in.
- a check-in is an indication of the user's presence at, or the user's interest in the location ("check-in location") corresponding to the check-in.
- a check-in may be performed on demand. For example, in response to an input (e.g., an input 206 received via the input device 202), location data 246 indicating the user's presence at the check-in location can be sent to the server 170. For example, a user present at a particular restaurant may indicate his presence by performing a check-in associated with that restaurant.
- a check-in may be performed automatically. For example, a user may grant permission for location data 246 to automatically be provided to the server 170, at certain intervals or continuously. Thus, as the user travels with the location-aware client device 1 10, check-ins associated with the various locations visited by the user, may be performed automatically.
- Points of interest can be added to the user's navigational preferences remotely. That is, a user may add a location as a point of interest without being present at that location to perform a check-in. For example, a user who enjoys dining at a particular restaurant may add that restaurant as a point of interest without being present at that restaurant. Adding a point of interest may thought of as performing a check-in remotely.
- the travel history of a user includes location data 246 from respective dates and times. That is, the travel history of the user includes locations identified by the location data 246 received by the server 170.
- a user can select whether or not certain locations are included in his travel history. For example, to include locations in travel history, the user may enable the location- aware module 224 to automatically provide location data 246 to the server 170 prior to visiting those locations. Similarly, to exclude locations from being included in the travel history, the user may disable the location-aware module 224 prior to visiting those locations.
- the server 170 retrieves and analyzes various aspects of the locations in the user's travel history to prepare and/or further refine the user's navigational preferences. For example, the server 170 can, based on the user's travel history, determine travel routes preferred by the user.
- the various aspects of a particular location may include one or more
- Environmental factors can include crime statistics, street conditions, demographic information, and/or weather conditions associated with a particular location. Street conditions can include length (i.e., distance), complexity (e.g., number of turns), grade (e.g., incline), elevation, width, number of lanes, number of traffic lights and/or stop signs, railroad crossings, school zones, traffic speed, street closures, detours (e.g., due to construction), potholes, street lighting, police presence, a police camera, or any other information that can be related to a street.
- Demographic information can be any statistical characteristics of the local population. For example, demographic information can include statistics related to the gender, race, age, disabilities, mobility, home ownership, employment status, and/or income levels of the residents of the local area.
- Further information about the various aspects may be retrieved by the server 170 based on information that is publicly available, explicitly received from the user, and/or implicitly received from the user.
- Publicly available information may be retrieved by accessing various public information databases and/or Internet searches. For example, crime statistics provided by the FBI and/or various police departments can be correlated to specific locations. News stories and/or social media can also be searched to obtain information associated with a particular location.
- Information about a particular location may be explicitly received at the server 1 70 from the user.
- a location may be explicitly designated by a user as his home, workplace, and so forth.
- the user can provide a descriptor to provide additional context for a location.
- Information about a particular location may be implicitly received from the user. For example, if the user grants access privileges to the server 170 for accessing a particular information repository, any information retrieved from that information repository may be considered to be implicitly received by the server 170.
- Examples of information repositories include a user's Internet browsing history, Internet search history, email accounts, social media accounts, and financial transactions.
- the server 170 can analyze the information retrieved from public sources, explicitly received from the user, and/or implicitly received from the user. Based on the analysis, the server 170 can determine and/or further refine the user's navigational preferences. As an example, the server 170 may treat a search query for a particular coffee shop as an indication that the user may enjoy visiting that coffee shop. The server 170 may, based on the Internet search, add the coffee shop as a point of interest of the user. T hus, implicitly received information, such as an Internet search, is another way that a point of interest can be included in the stored navigational preferences of the user.
- the server 170 Based on an analysis of the received location data 246, and the various information related to the corresponding locations, the server 170 associates an affinity value with each location.
- the affinity value is a numerical measure of a user's preference for, or interest in a location. As an example, if the user frequently visits a particular location, the user's affinity value for that location will be higher than a location that the user visits less frequently.
- the affinity value of a location can be affected by whether it is included in the user's points of interest, and/or information retrieved from the user's information repositories. For example, a location included in the user's points of interest would have a higher affinity value than a location that is not included in the user's points of interest. Similarly, a location included in the user's information repositories (e.g., email, Internet search history, Internet browsing history) would have a higher affinity value than a location that is not included in the user's information repositories.
- a location included in the user's information repositories e.g., email, Internet search history, Internet browsing history
- affinity value of a particular location can have a positive influence on the affinity value of a particular location.
- other types of information can have a negative influence. As an example, if the user avoids traveling along a particular route, the affinity value for the locations corresponding to that travel route may be decreased.
- a user's avoidance of a route may be detected based on the user's travel history. For example, based on the user's travel history, the user's actual travel route may be compared to the route that was calculated for the user, a shortest travel route, or a fastest travel route from the origin location to the destination location. That is, an avoidance may be indicated when the user opts for a longer route, a more complicated route (e.g., with more turns), or a slower route than the route that is calculated for the user, the shortest possible route, the simplest possible route (e.g., with fewest turns), or the fastest possible route.
- a route e.g., a particular street, a particular intersection
- the server 170 infers a cause for the avoidance. To infer the cause of the avoidance, the server 170 compares one or more locations on the avoided route to one or more locations on the user's travel route. That is, the server 170 compares the avoided route to the actual travel route of the user.
- the server 170 analyzes any available data related to the avoided route.
- the server 170 can retrieve traffic reports, crime statistics, news reports, construction information, street lighting conditions, power outages, and any other available data related to the locations on the avoided route.
- the server 170 then compares the retrieved data to similar data related to the location(s) on the user's actual travel path.
- the server 170 infers one or more causes for the avoidance.
- the server 170 adds to the user's stored navigational preferences, the cause for the avoidance and/or the avoided route.
- the server 170 may lower the affinity value of the avoided location on the avoided route. For example, the server 170 may associate a negative affinity value with the avoided location on the avoided route.
- location data 246 may be received most frequently from a user's home and/or workplace. Based on the frequency of the user's visits, these locations may have high affinity values associated with them.
- a user may not wish to have his home and/or workplace included in routes to and from other locations.
- a user may wish to have other locations (e.g., a coffee shop that the user visits frequently) with high affinity values to be included in a routes to and from other locations.
- the server 170 attempts determine the nature of those locations. To designate a particular location as the user's home and/or workplace, the server 170 correlates the user's travel history with factors such as day, date, time, public holidays, business hours associated with the location, and/or weather.
- the server 170 treats the user's presence at or near a location for extended periods during business hours associated with that location, as an indication that the location is the user's workplace. Similarly, the user treats the user's presence at or near a location for extended periods of time during other hours (e.g., night hours) as an indication that the location is the user's residence.
- other hours e.g., night hours
- time decay aspect of a location. This time decay aspect prevents a particular location from permanently affecting the user's navigational preferences.
- an origin location and a destination location are received by the server 170 from the client device 1 10.
- the origin location may be a start location or a current location.
- a start location is one which is explicitly specified by the user.
- a current location is one which is discerned based on the user's detected current geographic location. The start location and the current location can be the same.
- step, 330 in response to the received request, the travel route from the origin location to the destination location is calculated based on the user's navigational preferences and stored travel history.
- the travel route is calculated based on a heuristic search.
- the heuristic search algorithm explores a number of travel paths from the origin location to the destination location.
- Each travel path can include one or more route segments.
- a route segment is the shortest navigable route between two points. That is, a route segment is the path that can be traveled along a navigable route between two points.
- the navigability of a travel path is defined in context of the type of transportation being used to navigate that potential travel path. This is because a travel path navigable using one form of transportation may not be feasibly navigable using another form of
- the type of transportation being used may be specified by a user. The type of transportation may be discerned based on the user's speed of travel and/or the routes taken.
- Each route segment may include locations with affinity values associated with them. For example, a route segment frequently traveled by the user may have locations with higher affinity values than a route segment less frequently traveled by the user. As another example, a route segment avoided by the user may have a lower affinity value than a route traveled by the user.
- the affinity values of the various route segments of a travel path can be aggregated to determine the ranking of that travel path as a whole.
- each route segment may be affected by environmental factors. For example, street conditions such as the length of a route segment, complexity (e.g., number of turns), and traffic speed may affect the desirability of the route segment, and consequently the travel path as a whole. Therefore, the travel paths may be altered to select the route segments with the most favorable environmental factors.
- the travel routes are ordered from most desirable to least desirable. The travel routes may then be provided for display.
- FIG. 4A is an illustration of an example associated with the example of the process 300 of FIG. 3.
- the user is using a smartphone which is a location- aware client device 1 10.
- the user has granted permissions on the smartphone 1 10 to allow the location-aware module 224 of the smartphone 1 10 to automatically provide location data 246 to the server 170.
- the user drives (i.e., travels in an automobile) from an origin location 402 to a restaurant 404. Because the user is driving a car in an urban setting, the shortest navigable route between two points would be a paved road connecting the two points. That is, a route segment for the purposes of this example will be a paved road connecting the two points.
- the user drives along route segments 420-440, 440-430, 430-460, 460-470, and 470-490.
- the user's smartphone 1 10 automatically provides the user's location 246 and a corresponding date and time from the various locations along the user's travel route.
- step 310 the navigational preferences and the travel history of the user are received, and stored as data 284 in the memory 280 of the server 170.
- the location data 246 and the respective dates and times, received from the user's smartphone 1 10 from various points along the travel route are stored in the memory 284 of the server 170 as the user's travel history.
- affinity values associated with the various locations and corresponding route segments on the travel route are increased due to the user's presence at these locations.
- These affinity values and the corresponding locations are stored in the user's navigational preferences.
- the restaurant 404 is stored as a point of interest in the user's navigational preferences, based on the check-in performed by the user.
- the server 170 compares the user's travel route along route segments 420-440, 440-430, 430-460, 460-470, and 470-490 to other possible routes that the user could have taken.
- the user had not requested a travel route from the origin location 402 to the restaurant 404. Therefore, the server 170 is unable to compare the user's actual travel route to a calculated travel route provided to the user.
- the server 170 compares the user's actual travel route to the shortest possible route, and the fastest possible route from the origin location 402 to the restaurant 404.
- the server 170 determines that the shortest route between the origin location 402 and the restaurant 404 is a travel route along route segments 420-440, 440-470, and 470-490.
- the server 170 determines that the fastest route between the origin location 402 and restaurant 404 is along route segments 420-450, 450-480, and 480-490.
- the server 170 determines that the user started out traveling along the shortest route but then deviated and consequently traveled along a relatively longer travel route. Specifically, the server 170 determines that the user deviated from the shortest travel path to seemingly avoid traveling along the route segment 440-470. [0071] The server compares the avoided locations along the avoided route segment 440- 470 to locations along the user's actual travel path.
- the server 170 determines that the key difference between route segments (e.g., 420-440, 440- 430, 430-460, 460-470, and 470-490) that were seemingly acceptable to the user, and route segment 440-470 avoided by the user, is that the route segment 440-470 falls within a high- crime area 492.
- route segments e.g., 420-440, 440- 430, 430-460, 460-470, and 470-490
- the server 170 Based on the inferred cause, the server 170 adds a preference for avoiding high- crime areas to the user's stored navigational preferences. Furthermore, based on this avoidance, the server 170 associates negative affinity values with locations along route segment 440-470. These negative affinity values are also stored in the user's navigational preferences. Because of the negative affinity values, route segment 440-470 would be deemed less desirable in subsequent calculations for navigational instructions by the user.
- the user stops at a gas station 406 to fill up his car's gas tank. While at the gas station 404, the user receives a call from a friend inviting him to a coffee shop 408. The user requests navigational instructions from the gas station 406 to the coffee shop 408. In step 320, the user's request for a travel route from the gas station 406 (i.e., the origin location) to the coffee shop 408 (i.e., the destination location), is received by the server 170.
- step 330 the server 170 calculates, in response to the received request, a travel route from the gas station 406 to the coffee shop 408, based on the stored navigational preferences and stored travel history of the user.
- the server 170 begins by performing a heuristic search to explore the various possible routes from the gas station 406 to the coffee shop 408.

- Travel Route 15, illustrated in FIG. 4P involves traveling along route segments 410- 420, 420-450, and 450-480.
- the possible travel routes 1 through 15 are then analyzed and ranked in accordance with the user's stored navigational preferences and the user's stored travel history. For example, the server 170 determines that Travel Routes 3, 4, 8, 9, 13, and 14 contain the route segment 440-470 which was previously avoided by the user. Based on negative affinity values associated with this route segment, the server associates a ranking with these travel routes which is lower than the remaining possible travel routes.
- the remaining possible travel routes are Travel Routes 1 , 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 1 1 , 12, and 15.
- the server 170 had inferred that the user avoided route segment 440-470 because it fell within a high-crime area 492, and had added to the user's stored navigational preferences, the user's preference for avoiding high-crime areas.
- the server 170 further determines that route segment 450-480 also falls within a high-crime area, which is incidentally the same high-crime area 492.
- the server 170 determines that Travel Routes 5, 10, and 15 include route segment 450-480. Consequently, based on the user's preference for avoiding high-crime areas, the server 170 associates with Travel Routes 5, 10, and 15, a ranking that is lower than the remaining possible travel routes.
- the remaining possible travel routes are Travel Routes 1 , 2, 6, 7, 1 1 , and 12.
- the server 170 further takes into consideration the various environmental factors (e.g., street conditions) that affect each possible travel route but may or may not be included in the user's stored navigational preferences and the user's stored travel history. For example, the number of route segments, length of each route segment, traffic speed of each route segment, and so on can be used to associate rankings with the travel routes including those route segments.
- the server 170 determines that traffic along route segment 470-480 is moving particularly slowly. Thus, the server 170 associates a ranking with travel routes containing route segment 470-480 which is lower than other remaining paths. Consequently, the server 170 associates with Travel Routes 2, 7, and 12, a ranking that is lower than the other remaining possible travel routes.
- the remaining possible travel routes are Travel Routes 1 , 6, and 1 1.
- the server 170 further considers the number of route segments included in each possible travel route.
- a route with fewer route segments may be less complex. For example, a travel route with fewer route segments may have fewer turns than a travel route with more route segments.
- the server 170 determines that Travel Route 1 includes five segments, Travel Route 6 includes seven segments, and Travel Route 1 1 includes eight segments. Based on the number of route segments of each path, the server 170 arranges the travel routes as Travel Route 1 (five segments), Travel Route 6 (seven segments), and Travel Route 1 1 (eight segments).
- the server 170 can provide for display the various remaining travel routes.
- the number of travel routes that may be provided by the server 170 is configurable. In this example, the user has specified that he wishes to receive the top three travel routes. Based on the user's preference, the server provides Travel Routes 1, 13, and 6 for display on the user's smartphone 1 10.
- the user may then select a particular travel route and begin driving in accordance with the navigational instructions corresponding to that travel route.
- the travel route selected by the user may be used by the user's smartphone 1 10 for providing turn-by-turn driving directions.
