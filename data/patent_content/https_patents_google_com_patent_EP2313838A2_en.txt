- FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a web page 100, as displayed on a client device.
- the web page which may be associated with an online dictionary service, includes a text entry box 102 depicting the entry of a partial search query of "bank".
- a user has selected from a pull-down menu 104 a pair of languages indicating that the user is seeking translation of a word or term in a first language into a second language.
- the client system obtains a set of predicted complete queries from a server and displays the predicted complete queries in a display area of the web page for possible selection by the user. As depicted, the complete predictions are presented in a drop-down box 106 that extends from the text entry box 102.
- the partial query "bank” generates predicted complete queries, such as ⁇ bank>, ⁇ banker>, and ⁇ banking>, as well as their Korean translations. If one of the predictions matches the user's intended (but not yet fully entered) query, then the user can select a respective predicted query from the drop down box 106, for example by "clicking" on (or scrolling to or highlighting) that predicted query. If the user selects a predicted query or finishes typing the complete query, the user may press the "Find" button 108 or click on the predicted query to obtain further information from a dictionary.
- the complete query may be a word or term for which the user is requesting a translation
- the obtained information includes a translation and optionally includes additional information, such as examples of use of the word or term in various contexts.
- the user may modify the partial query, input more characters to the partial query, or terminate the query.
- the predicted complete queries each begin with the same letters or symbols as the partial query. However, in some other embodiments, if a potential misspelling has been identified (e.g., by a server), one or more of the predicted complete queries may begin with the letters or symbols of a suggested spelling correction. Alternately, in some embodiments the predicted complete queries each include a component (e.g., a word or syllable) that begins with the same letters or symbols as the partial query or a suggested spelling correction of the partial query.
- a component e.g., a word or syllable
- FIG. 2 illustrates a distributed system 200, suitable for practice of embodiments of the invention.
- the distributed system 200 may include one or more client systems 202 connected to a server 206 by a communication network 204.
- Each client system 202 has a prediction assistant (described below with reference to Figures 5A, 5B and 6).

- the server 206 which may be a system that includes multiple servers, includes a prediction server 210, for processing partial search queries.
- a query server 214, for processing complete search queries, is optionally included in the server 206.
- the prediction server 210 accesses query prediction information in a prediction database 212, while the query server 214 accesses translations and optionally additional information from a dictionary database 218.
- the prediction server 210 and the query server 214 are distinct servers, for example at distinct locations and/or having distinct URLs or IP addresses, while in other embodiments the prediction server 210 and the query server 214 are either the same server or located within the same server system.
- An optional query log 216 stores information about search queries submitted by a community of users.
- the query log 216 stores complete search queries submitted to the server 206, while in other embodiments it stores search queries submitted to one or more other services, such as an Internet search engine.
- the prediction database 212 may be generated based on information in the query log 216 and a dictionary database, which may or may not be the same dictionary database 218 used by the query server 214.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a mapping function and data structures for processing partial search queries, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- a partial search query 302 received from a respective user is processed by a mapping function 304.
- the mapping function 304 identifies, within a chunk table 306, an entry 307 that matches the partial search query 302.
- the mapping function 304 and chunk table 306 may be implemented using a hash function and hash table; however, other implementations may be used as well.
- Each entry 307 of the chunk table 306 is associated with a text string that is a potential partial search query that may be received from a user.
- a respective entry 307 in the chunk table contains, for a respective partial search query, one or more pointers 310 to entries 314 in a token table 312 for complete query terms 320.
- each entry 307 of the chunk table contains a text string 308 or other value (e.g., a fixed-length CRC value) for verifying a match between the user specified partial search query and the chunk table entry identified by the mapping function 304.
- a pointer 310-1-2 in a respective chunk table entry 307-1 is associated with a string 308-1 (or other value representing a string) and points to an entry 314-2 in the token table 312.
- multiple entries 307 in the chunk table 306 include pointers 310 to the same entry 314 in the token table.
- entries in the chunk table for ⁇ b>, ⁇ ba> and ⁇ ban> each contain a pointer to the token table entry 314 for the complete query term ⁇ bank>.
- Each entry 314 in the token table 312 specifies a complete query term 320 and a short translation 318 of the complete search query.
- each entry 314 also includes a frequency 316 or other value associated with the complete query term.
- the frequency or other value 316 if included, may represent a weight, importance or popularity of the complete query term.
- the complete query term 320 is in a different language from the short translation 318.
- a single token table 312 may contain entries 314 that translate terms in a first language (e.g., English) into a second language (e.g., Korean) as well as other entries 314 that translate terms in the second language into the first language.
- the server 206 or prediction server 210 used for generating predicted complete search queries and definitions include multiple chunk tables and token tables, each for providing prediction information relating to a particular pair of languages.
- FIG 4 depicts a conceptual block diagram that shows how a database builder builds the chunk table and token table of Figure 3, in accordance with some embodiments.
- Historical query log 402 contains queries submitted by a community of users. The queries may be queries for looking up translations of those queries, or they may be queries submitted to an Internet search engine or other online service(s).
- Dictionary database 404 contains terms and their translations. Contents of the historical query log 402 and the dictionary database 404 are processed by a filter 406 to create a token table 408.
- the filter removes queries (from the log 402) that do not have matching entries in the dictionary database 404.
- the filter 406 may further remove queries matching a set of predefined terms, such as words that may be considered to be objectionable, even though they are included in the dictionary database.
- the filtered queries become terms 410 (also called complete search queries) in the token table 408.
- the token table 408 also includes a short definition of each term 410, and optionally includes a frequency or weight 412 for each term 410.
- the frequency 412 is derived from the historical query log 402. For example, the frequency 412 for a respective term 410 may be computed as a count or normalized count of the number of historical queries that include the term 410. As noted, the frequency 412 may be normalized so that all frequency values in the token table 408 fall within a predefined range, such as 0 to 1, or 0 to 2 N -1, or 0 to M, where N is an positive integer and M is a positive value.
- the filter 406 creates a token table 408 with the contents of the dictionary database 404, without access to the historical query log 402.
- the token table 408 may contain the terms from the entire dictionary database or a subset of terms in the dictionary database.
- the short definition 414 in a respective token table entry 416 is copied from or derived from the dictionary database 404; for example, the short definition 414 may be extracted from the first definition of the term 410 in the dictionary database 404.
- the short definition 414 may be derived from information in the dictionary database 404 in accordance with a set of rules whose goal is to extract the most meaningful portion of a definition that can be presented in just a few words.
- the term 410 is in a first language (e.g., English) and the short definition 414 is a translation of the term 410 in a second language (e.g., Korean).
- the "translation" of the term 410 can be either a conventional translation, or it can be an explanation of the term in the second language.
- the short definition 414 is (or includes) a synonym or completion of the corresponding term 410 in the same language as the corresponding term 410.
- the corresponding short definition 414 in the token table 408) includes a completion or synonym of the abbreviation or shortened term, in addition to or instead of translations.
- the short definition 414 can be "United States of America" for an entry in which the term 410 is "USA;” other examples are “etcetera” for the term “etc.” and “for example” for the term “e.g.”
- the completions also called “spelled out terms" and/or synonyms are copied from or derived from the dictionary database 404.
- the completions and/or synonyms are separately inserted from a different dictionary or a database. In these special cases (e.g., synonyms or completions), the synonym or completion is in the same language as the corresponding predicted complete query.
- the terms 410 in the token table 408 are further processed by a parser 418 and a chunk table builder 420.
- the parser 418 takes each term 410 from the token table 408 and parses the term into partial queries 422.
- the partial queries 422 are strings corresponding to the initial one or more characters of the terms 410.
- a parser may generate partial queries ⁇ b>, ⁇ ba>, ⁇ ban>, and ⁇ bank> from a term "bank”.
- a parser may generate partial queries ⁇ b>, ⁇ ba>, ⁇ bat>, and ⁇ bath> from a term "bath”.
- the chunk table builder 420 builds a chunk table 424 based on the partial queries 422 and the token table 408.
- the chunk table 424 contains partial queries 426 and pointers 428 to token table entries associated with the partial queries 426.
- a chunk table entry for the partial query ⁇ ba> may have pointers to token table entries for the complete query terms ⁇ bank> and ⁇ bath>.
- the chunk table 424 may be structured into one or more tables to facilitate access to partial queries 426 and/or pointers 428 to token table entries.
- the partial queries 422 include, in addition or alternatively, sequences of characters that begin at the syllable boundaries of two or more distinct syllables in multi-syllable terms 410.
- the partial queries in the chunk table 424 may include ⁇ b>, ⁇ ba>, ⁇ bas>, etc. as well ⁇ d>, ⁇ da>, ⁇ dat>, and so on.
- the chunk table builder 420 includes in the chunk table
- the chunk table builder 420 may add a search query "ahqkdlf and its partial search queries (in addition to the Korean search query and its partial search queries) to the chunk table 424.
- Each of these additional entries includes a pointer 428 to an entry 416 in the token table token 408 corresponding to the Korean term "Ht. ⁇ ".
- the conversion of a Korean character string in a query into a Romanized representation can be accomplished by calculating an index for each consonant or vowel forming a constituent of each syllabic block character.
- Korean characters represented in Unicode the characters are arranged as:
- FIG. 5A depicts a process of handling a partial search query and obtaining predicted complete queries, in accordance with some embodiments including a client system 502 and a server 504. Additional details and embodiments of this process are discussed below with reference to Figures 5A, 6 and 7.
- the process starts when a client receives a partial search query from a user (also called a search requestor) (506).
- the partial search query may be one or more characters, or one or more words.
- the client obtains from a server a set of predicted complete queries and translations of the predicted complete queries (508).
- the server may be accomplished by making a request to the server and receiving a response from the server.
- the request includes the partial search query from the user.
- the server predicts, from the partial search query, a set of complete queries (512).
- the prediction is made by mapping the partial search query to an entry in a chunk table, as described with reference to Figure 3.
- the server also obtains translations of at least a subset of the predicted complete queries, where the predicted completed queries are in a first language, and the translations (also called definitions or short definitions) are in a second language (512).
- the server conveys to the client a response which includes the predicted complete queries and corresponding translations (514).
- the client receives the response as described above.
- the client displays two or more complete queries from the set of predicted complete queries and at least a portion of the translations of the displayed predicted complete queries (516).
- the received prediction data for one or more of the predicted complete queries may include a short definition other than a translation of the corresponding complete query.
- the information returned to the client optionally includes a completion or synonym of the predicted complete query, either in addition to or instead of a translation of the predicted complete query.
- the client may display the entire set of predicted complete queries as obtained from the server. In some other embodiments, the client displays two or more complete queries selected based on predefined criteria, including factors such as the screen size or window size of an Internet browser window and/or the number of complete queries to display set by the user or by default.
- the client displays the translations obtained from the server.
- the client displays portions of the translations. The portions are selected based on another predefined criteria, including one or more factors such as the screen size or window size of an Internet browser window and the string length of the translations.
- the client displays synonyms or spelled out terms, in addition to or instead of translations, if any synonyms or spelled out terms are included in the information returned by the server.
- Figure 5B illustrates an embodiment that may be implemented in the prediction assistant 550 of a client system 202.
- a prediction assistant 550 monitors the user's entry of a search query into a text entry box on a client system (552).
- the user's entry may be one or more characters, or one or more words (e.g., the first word or two of a phrase, or a first word and the beginning letter, characters or symbols of a new word of a phrase of a compound term).
- the prediction assistant 550 may identify two different types of queries. First, the prediction assistant 550 receives or identifies a partial search query when an entry is identified prior to when the user indicates completion of the input string (as described below). Second, the prediction assistant 550 receives or identifies a user input when the user has selected a presented prediction, or indicated completion of the input string.
- the completed user input is transmitted to a server for processing (554).
- the server returns a set of search results, which is received by the prediction assistant 550 or by a client application, such as a browser application (556).
- the browser application displays the search results at least as part of a web page.
- the prediction assistant 550 displays the search results.
- the transmission of a completed user input 554 and the receipt 556 of search results may be performed by a mechanism other than a prediction assistant 550. For example, these operations may be performed by a browser application using standard request and response protocols.
- a user input may be identified by the prediction assistant 550 (or by a browser or other application) as a completed user input, in a number of ways such as when the user enters a carriage return, or equivalent character, selects a "find” or “search” button in a graphical user interface (GUI) presented to the user during entry of the search query, or by selecting one of a set of predicted queries presented to the user during entry of the search query.
- GUI graphical user interface
- a partial search query Prior to the user signaling a completed user input, a partial search query may be identified. For example, a partial search query is identified by detecting entry or deletion of characters in a text entry box. Once a partial search query is identified, the partial search query is transmitted to the server (558). In response to the partial search query, the server returns predictions, including predicted complete search queries and translations of at least a subset of the predicted complete search queries.
- the prediction assistant 550 receives (560) and presents (e.g., displays, verbalizes, etc.) the predictions (562).
- the user may select one of the predicted complete search queries if the user determines that one of the predictions matches the intended entry. In some instances, the predictions may provide the user with additional information which had not been considered. For example, a user may have one query in mind as part of a search strategy, but seeing the predicted results causes the user to alter the input strategy.
- the user's input is again monitored. If the user selects one of the predictions, the user input is transmitted to the server (554) as a complete query (also herein called a completed user input). After the request is transmitted, the user's input activities are again monitored (552).
- the prediction assistant 550 may preload additional predicted results from the server (564).
- the preloaded predicted results may be used to improve the speed of response to user entries. For example, when the user enters ⁇ ban>, the prediction assistant 550 may preload the prediction results for ⁇ bana>, ..., and ⁇ bank>, in addition to the prediction results for ⁇ ban>. If the user enters one more character, for example ⁇ k>, to make the (partial search query) entry ⁇ bank>, the prediction results for ⁇ bank> can be displayed without transmitting the partial search query to the server or receiving predictions.
- one or more sets of predicted results are cached locally at the client.
- the search requestor modifies the current query to reflect an earlier partial input (e.g., by backspacing to remove some characters)
- the set of predicted results associated with the earlier partial input is retrieved from the client cache and again presented again to the user instead of the partial input being sent to the server.
- the prediction assistant 550 After receiving the results or document for a final input (556), or after displaying the predicted complete search queries (562), and optionally preloading predicted results (564), the prediction assistant 550 continues to monitor the user entry (552) until the user terminates the prediction assistant 550, for example by closing a web page that contains the prediction assistant 550.
- Figure 6 illustrates a method or process for processing a partial search query at a server in accordance with some embodiments.
- the process at the server starts when the server receives a partial search query from a client device (602).
- the server receives the partial search query from a web page on the client device (608).
- the server Prior to receiving a respective partial search query, the server identifies a pair of languages, for use when returning a result that includes a word or term in a first language and a translation of that word or term into a second language.
- the server may receive from the client a language pair selected by the user (604).
- the server may predict the language pair, for example, based on multiple factors, such as the Unicode of the partial search query, the Internet protocol (IP) address of the client, and/or statistics based on search queries submitted by a community of users.
- IP Internet protocol
- the server predicts, from the partial search query, a set of complete queries (610).
- the set of predicted complete queries include a plurality of distinct terms.
- all of the predicted complete queries are different from each other.
- the predictions are based on complete queries previously submitted by a community of users.
- the queries may be queries for looking up translations of those queries, or they may be queries submitted to an Internet search engine or other online services.
- the prediction includes, in addition to obtaining a set of complete queries for the partial search query, converting the partial search query in a first language to a representation in the second language (e.g., by treating the user's keystrokes as if they had be used to enter a partial query in the second language), and obtaining a set of complete queries for the converted partial search query.
- the predictions are made by mapping the partial search query to an entry in a chunk table (612).
- the chunk table may be structured, including pointers to entries in a token table, as described with reference to Figure 3.
- a distinct chunk table is used for each language pair for mapping partial search queries to predicted complete search queries.
- the server obtains corresponding translations (610).
- the translations may be obtained from a prediction database 212, a dictionary database 218, a token table 312, or any other dictionary database by looking up entries that match respective predicted complete queries.
- the information returned to the client optionally includes a completion or synonym of the respective predicted complete query, either in addition to or instead of a translation of the respective predicted complete query.
- the prediction data includes a short definition, which comprises a completion or synonym of the term, or both (A) a completion/synonym in the same language as the term and (B) a translation or other explanation of the term in a second language.
- the predicted complete queries are filtered to remove any queries that match set of predefined terms, such as words that may be considered to be objectionable (614). Stated in another way, the set of predicted complete queries are filtered to remove any predicted complete queries that are members of a set of predefined queries.
- a subset of queries is selected from the predicted complete queries, where the number of queries in the subset is a predefined number, N (616).
- the selection may be made based on predefined criteria, such as a lexicographical order (sometimes called alphabetical order), the frequency of submission of each of the predicted complete queries by a community of users, the order of entry of the complete queries in a database, and the predefined number, N.
- the identified (or selected) predicted complete queries are ordered (618) by the server.
- the ordering (618) re-orders the predicted complete queries in lexicographical order (620).
- the predicted search queries are ordered in accordance with the frequency of submission of the predicted complete queries by a community of users.
- the search queries are ordered, at least in part, in accordance with a last time/date value that the query was submitted.
- the search queries are ordered in accordance with personalization information, such as user personalization information or community information.
- user personalization information may include information about subjects, concepts and/or categories of information that are of interest to the user.
- the user personalization information may be provided directly by the user, or may be inferred with the user's permission from the user's prior search or browsing activities, or may be based at least in part on information about a group associated with the user or to which the user belongs (e.g., as a member, or as an employee).
- the set of predicted search queries may be initially ordered in accordance with a first ranking criteria, such as predefined popularity criteria, and then reordered if any of the predicted search queries match the user personalization information of the user so as to place the matching predicted search queries at or closer to the top of the ordered set of predicted search queries.
- the partial search query can be placed at the top or in a predefined first place of the ordered predicted complete queries (622).
- the server formats a response, including the identified
- the server will also incorporate a spelling corrected term into the response, if a spelling corrected term is provided (626).
- a spelling corrected term is provided if the server (or another server that performs spell checking) determines that the user input may include a spelling error.
- the spelling correction can be generated in many ways. For example, the partial search query can be checked against entries in a spelling dictionary, which contains misspelled search queries and corresponding search queries with correct spelling (628). In another example, spelling correction may be suggested based on the similarity and dissimilarity between the partial search query and the closest matching complete search query. Regardless of the method to generate spelling corrections, if there is a spelling correction, the spelling correction is returned (630).
- the server will convey to the client the response, which includes predicted complete queries and corresponding translations (632).
- receiving a partial search query (and language pair selection) from the client and conveying the response is completed in a single transaction between the client and the server (634).
- the single transaction may comprises a single HTTP request and single response to the HTTP request.
- Figure 7 illustrates the processing of a partial search query at a client in accordance with some embodiments.
- the process at the client starts when the client receives a partial search query from a search requestor (702).
- the client receives the partial search query from a web page on the client (706).
- a user may select a language pair, indicating that the user is seeking translation of a word or term in a first language into a second language (704).
- the user's previous selection of the language pair or the language pair predicted by the server may be stored locally, for example in a cache or a cookie.
- the client may look up the language pair used previously and transmit the language pair information as part of the transaction with the server.
- the client obtains, from a server, a set of predicted complete queries and translations of the predicted complete queries (710).
- the client may transmit a request and receive a response, as described with reference to Figure 5B.
- the predictions are based on complete queries previously submitted by a community of users.
- the queries may be queries for looking up translations of those queries, or they may be queries submitted to an Internet search engine or other online services.
- the client may obtain a spelling corrected term as part of the response (712).
- the predicted complete queries are filtered at the client to remove any queries that match a set of predefined terms (714).
- the set of predefined terms may be words that may be considered to be objectionable, or words set by a user or provided by other applications, such as parental control applications.
- the predicted complete queries are filtered at the server to remove objectionable terms, in which case the filtering at the client, if performed, is in addition to the filtering at the server.
- the client may implement more stringent filtering than the filtering (if any) performed by the server.
- a subset of queries is selected from the predicted complete queries, where the number of queries in the subset is a predefined number, N (716).
- the selection may be made based on predefined criteria, such as a lexicographical order, the order of the predicted complete queries in the response received from the server, the order of entry of the complete queries in a database, and the predefined number, N.
- the predicted complete queries in the response are monotonically ordered (within the response) from most popular to least popular, or highest value to lowest value, and the client selects the N most popular or N highest value queries in the response.
- the client may lexicographically order (e.g., alphabetically order) the predicted complete queries in the response (720) and then select the N first queries in the reordered list of predicted complete queries.
- the identified (or selected) predicted complete queries are ordered by the client (718). For example, the ordering can reorder the identified (or selected) predicted complete queries in a lexicographical order (720). In some embodiments, if the partial search query matches an entry of the set of predicted complete queries, the partial search query can be placed at the top of a list (or in a predefined first place) of the predicted complete queries (722).
- the client formats a response, including the identified
- the server will also incorporate a spelling corrected term into the response, if a spelling corrected term is provided (726).

- the number of predicted complete queries to display and the portion of the translations to display may be determined using any of the methods described above.
- One skilled in the art will recognize a number of ways to present the predicted complete search queries and translations to the user.
- the predicted complete search queries and translations can be displayed in a portion of a non-persistent window, a pop-up window, or in a portion of the current display or a portion of a user interface.
- the client may also display spelling corrected term, if a spelling corrected term is provided (730).

- the high speed random access memory may include memory devices such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices.
- Memory 906 may optionally include mass storage that is remotely located from CPU's 902. Memory 906, or alternately the nonvolatile memory device(s) within memory 906, comprises a computer readable storage medium. Memory 906 stores the following elements, or a subset of these elements, and may also include additional elements:
- an operating system 916 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks
- a network communication module (or instructions) 918 that is used for connecting the server system 900 to other computers via the one or more communications network interfaces 904 and one or more communications networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on;

- the query server 920 may include the following elements, or a subset of these elements, and may also include additional elements:
- a client communication module (or instructions) 924 that is used for communicating queries and responses with a client;
- a query receipt, processing and response module (or instructions) 926 • a database 928, including one or more dictionaries 930 that contain information including translations and optionally additional information, such as examples of use of the word or term in various contexts; and
- the prediction server 922 may include the following elements, a subset of these elements, and may also include additional elements:
- a prediction database builder 912 that may optionally include one or more filters 406;
- a prediction database 946 may include one or more chunk tables 424 and one or more token tables 408 (described above with reference to Figure 4).
- the prediction server 922 may optionally include:
- mapping function 942 and token table 408 and chunk table 424 for the most popular searches may be periodically downloaded to a client system 800, thereby providing fully client-based processing for at least some partially search queries.
- the prediction assistant 826 may include a local version of the prediction server 922, for making complete search query predictions based at least in part on prior queries by the user.
- the local prediction server may generate predictions based on data downloaded from a server or remote prediction server.
- the prediction assistant 826 may merge locally generated and remotely generated prediction sets for presentation to the user. The results could be merged in any of a number of ways, for example, by interleaving the two sets or by merging the sets while biasing queries previously submitted by the user such that those queries would tend to be placed or inserted toward the top of the combined list of predicted queries.
- the prediction assistant 826 inserts queries deemed important to the user into the set of predictions. For example, a query frequently submitted by the user, but not included in the set obtained from the server could be inserted into the predictions.
- stages which are not order dependent may be reordered and other stages may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.
