Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for generating a text query from a voice query which is not limited by any predefined vocabulary.
- Web search is an important activity in daily life for many individuals. Individuals use queries to characterize topics of interest and then gain information from the Web on those topics. For convenience, and sometimes necessity, users of the Web prefer to deliver a query in voice and expect a search engine return web results with respect to the voice query.
- search engines which are able to accept a voice query, have a voice interface (or a speech-to-text system) which converts the voice query to a text query; then a standard text search engine produce results with respect to the text query.
- a speech-to-text system has a predefined “vocabulary” or a list of words, which the system can recognize.
- a word outside of this list is an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word and cannot be recognized, instead being recognized as word in the predefined vocabulary.
- OOV out-of-vocabulary
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system for generating a text query from a voice query.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a text transcription output from a speech-to-text converter.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing operation of the system of FIG. 1 .
- references to specific implementation embodiments such as “circuitry” may equally be accomplished via replacement with software instruction executions either on general purpose computing apparatus (e.g., CPU) or specialized processing apparatus (e.g., DSP).
- general purpose computing apparatus e.g., CPU
- specialized processing apparatus e.g., DSP
- a method and apparatus for generating a corresponding text query from an utterance is provided herein.
- a search system will receive a voice query (utterance) and use traditional speech recognition with a predefined vocabulary to generate a textual transcription (or multiple textual transcriptions) of the voice query.
- a textual transcription or multiple textual transcriptions
- words or short word sequences extracted from the textual transcription(s) are used to generate n initial text queries.
- Each of the n text queries is independently sent to a text search engine—retrieving multiple web page results for each of these initial text queries. Then, the collection of the keywords and/or key phrases extracted from the resulting web pages of all n initial text queries is phonetically indexed to form a voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index database. Finally, a phonetically-based voice search engine (which does not predefine a vocabulary) is used to search the original voice query against the voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index database to find the keywords and/or key phrases that best match what was originally spoken. The keywords and/or key phrases that best match what was originally spoken are then used as a final text query for a search engine. Search results from the final text query are then presented to the user.
- the text query generated from keywords and/or key phrases that best match what was originally spoken is not bound by the predefined vocabulary of the speech recognition system—it can contain words and/or expressions which are out of the speech recognizer's predefined vocabulary.
- OOV words in the generated text query can never directly come out from the speech recognition sub-system, but they could appear in the voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index database by virtue of their co-occurrence or association with words of the predefined vocabulary in the web pages which resulted from the n initial text queries.
- the keywords and/or key phrases that best match what was originally spoken are determined by matching the phonetic representation of the original voice query and indices of the voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index database.
- This phonetically-based voice search is able to produce words and/or expressions which are out of the predefined vocabulary of the speech recognition system. These previously OOV words and/or expressions can be selected from the voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index database based upon their better phonetic match to the original voice query.
- the original voice query was “C# example” with a user intention of finding a C# programming language example
- the keyword “C#” was not in the predefined vocabulary of the speech recognizer
- the Yahoo BOSS® search engine shows C# is a keyword among the resulting web pages for the text query “see Sharp”.
- All key-words and/or keyphrases are extracted from the collection of resulting web pages to form the voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index database for the voice query, “C# example”.
- the best matched key-phrases will be “C# example” and “see Sharp example”.
- the top phrase is then presented as text to a search engine.
- the present invention encompasses a method for generating a text query from a voice query.
- the method comprises the steps of receiving a textual transcription of a spoken query, generating a plurality of search strings based on the textual representation of the spoken query, and sending the plurality of search strings to a first search engine. Results are received from the first search engine and keywords are obtained from the results.
- a text query is derived from keywords that best match the spoken query and the text query is sent to a second search engine.
- the present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus comprising speech recognition circuitry receiving a textual transcription of a spoken query and outputting a textual representation of the spoken query, wherein the text output is taken from a vocabulary.
- Logic circuitry is provided for generating a plurality of search strings based on the textual representation of the spoken query and sending the plurality of search strings to a first search engine.
- Second logic circuitry receives results from the first search engine and determines keywords from the results.
- phonetic voice search circuitry derives a text query from keywords that best match the spoken query and sends the text query to a second search engine.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing apparatus 100 capable of generating a text query from a voice query, and returning search results to more accurately reflect what was in the voice query.
- system 100 comprises speech recognition circuitry 101 , logic circuitry 102 , second logic circuitry 105 , phonetic voice search circuitry 106 , and storage 104 .
- search service 103 is provided, and preferably comprises an internet-based search engine such as, but not limited to Google®, Bing®, Yahoo®, . . . , etc. However, in alternate embodiments of the present invention search service 103 may comprise other search services such as file search services, database search services, . . . , etc. Finally, search service 103 is shown existing external to apparatus 100 , however, in alternate embodiments of the present invention search service 103 may be located internal to apparatus 100 .
- search service 103 is shown existing external to apparatus 100 , however, in alternate embodiments of the present invention search service 103 may be located internal to apparatus 100 .
- Speech recognition circuitry 101 comprises commonly known circuitry that converts user speech into text. As part of speech recognition circuitry 101 , a database exists (not shown in FIG. 1 ) which contains a “vocabulary” of possible spoken words. When converting spoken words into text, any text output is chosen from the vocabulary.
- Logic circuitry 102 and second logic circuitry 105 both comprise a digital signal processor (DSP), general purpose microprocessor, a programmable logic device, or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and are utilized to formulate a query.
- DSP digital signal processor
- ASIC application specific integrated circuit
- Phonetic voice search circuitry 106 comprises a circuitry that converts a voice to the phonemes that were actually spoken, and compares the phoneme string with phoneme indices of a database.
- storage/database 104 comprises standard random access memory and is used to store information such as the voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index database.
- Speech recognition circuitry 101 outputs text transcription of the voice query.
- the text transcription includes a plurality of words that exist within a “vocabulary” which were spoken between a beginning and ending times of the voice query. Each word can be associated with an acoustic score (e.g., a probabilistic score). For example, if a user utters a voice query “all by myself”, speech recognition may return the text transcription shown in FIG. 2 to logic circuitry 102 .
- Logic circuitry 102 receives the text output from speech recognition circuitry 101 as text transcription 200 , and generates a set of queries (search strings).
- the set of queries may comprise “all”, “by”, “myself”, “I'll”, “my”, “self”, “buy”, “all by”, “by myself”, “I'll buy”, “buy my”, . . . , . . . “all by myself”, . . . , “I'll buy my self”.
- the queries may become quite numerous. Because of this, in an embodiment of the present invention, the number of queries may be limited. This limitation may be accomplished by selecting those with a high confidence score and/or a high keyword-like score, excluding those so-called stop (or function) words which appear often in every document such as ‘of’, ‘in’, etc.
- logic circuitry 102 sends the queries to search service 103 .
- the queries are sent via the internet to a web-based search engine such as Yahoo BOSS®.
- query results are received at second logic circuitry 105 .
- the rank-ordered results could comprise rank-ordered files, rank-ordered text, . . . , etc.
- each web page has an associated (predefined) set of keywords, or it can be analyzed to extract a set of keywords.
- Second logic circuitry 105 obtains the keywords from the multiple pages returned from the search and stores them in storage 104 .
- second logic circuitry 105 generates the phonetic indices from the phonetic representation of each keyword in order to perform fast and effective matches against any phonetic string.
- the phonetic indices are stored in storage 104 as a voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index.
- Second logic circuitry 105 then instructs phonetic voice search circuitry 106 to perform a phonetic based voice search and compare the phonetic representation of the voice query to the phonetic representation of the collected keywords via the phonetic indices.
- Phonetic voice search circuitry 106 determines a short list of keywords based on the comparison and ordered based on match likelihood. It should be noted that a comparison is not made between the vocabulary words returned from speech recognition circuitry 101 and the keywords. Instead, the keywords are phonetically compared to the phonemes that were actually spoken from the original voice query.
- One such technique is to compare the phonetic histograms of voice query and each keywords described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/669,865, entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INTENTION BASED COMMUNICATIONS FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, and incorporated by reference herein.
- phonetic voice search circuitry 106 determines the best matches and uses these to create a final text query or compound text queries with logic operations, such as AND, OR, etc. This text query is sent to a search engine 103 , and final results are returned to second logic circuitry 105 , which are then presented to a user.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing operation of the system of FIG. 1 .
- the logic flow begins at step 301 where speech recognition circuitry 101 receives speech as a voice query, and creates a textual transcription of the voice (spoken) query (step 303 ), and outputs the textual transcription to logic circuitry 102 as a textual transcription (step 305 ).
- the text output is taken from a vocabulary.
- logic circuitry 102 receives the text output from speech recognition circuitry 101 as text transcription 200 , and generates a set of text queries (search strings) based on the textual representation of the spoken query.
- logic circuitry 102 then sends the search strings to a text search service, or search engine (e.g., a web-based search engine) 103 .
- Search results are received at second logic circuitry 105 (step 311 ).
- the results obtained from the search engine may, for example, comprise a plurality of web pages.
- second logic circuitry 105 obtains the keywords from the results (step 313 ).
- the keywords are those keywords associated with the returned results.
- Phonetic indices are generated from the phonetic representation of each keyword by second logic circuitry 105 .
- Second logic circuitry 105 then stores them in storage 104 as a voice query dependent and phonetically searchable index in order to perform fast and effective matches against any phonetic string (step 315 ).
- phonetic voice search circuitry 106 compares the phonetic representation of the voice query to phonetic representation of the collected keywords via phonetic indices; and a short list of keywords is determined and ordered based on match likelihood.
- phonetic voice search circuitry 106 derives a text query from the best-matched keywords (i.e., best matched to what was spoken) and transmits this query to the text search engine 103 again. It should be noted that in a first embodiment, the first and the second search engine are the same, however in alternate embodiments this query may be transmitted to a second search engine (not shown). Additionally, the step of deriving the text query from keywords comprises the step of comparing the phonetic representation of the spoken query to phonetic representations of the keywords. Finally, at step 321 , search results are received by logic circuitry 105 and presented to a user.
