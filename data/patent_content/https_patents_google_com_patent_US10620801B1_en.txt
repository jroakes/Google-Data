Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments described herein is omitted for sake of brevity.
- System 2000 is configured to automatically (e.g., without user input), determine or infer what information cards to associate with a video and when to reveal a teaser for the information cards during playback of the video, prior to video playback or during video playback (e.g., in real-time), based on various factors, including but not limited to: the content of the video, the duration of the video, user preferences, user demographics, user social affiliations, user behavior regarding past usage of streaming media provider 102 by the user watching the video and/or other users of the streaming media provider, user context, device type, and user engagement (e.g., during playback).
- a plurality of pre-existing information cards can be accessible to streaming media provider (e.g., stored in memory associated with streaming media provider 102 ).
- These pre-existing information card can include information cards created by users and authorized for use by system 2000 in association with integration with videos provided by the streaming media provider.
- a user can create a plurality of information card for his or her video.
- the selection component 2002 can then select a subset of the information cards for associating with the video based on various factors tailored to the other user (e.g., user preferences, user demographics, user social affiliations, user behavior, user context, device type, and user engagement).
- a user can create information cards for his or her video and authorize system 2000 to use them on other videos provided by streaming media provider 102 .
- a user can create a video or playlist card for association with his or her video.
- the user can also allow system 2000 to use this card for association with other video provided by the streaming media provider 102 .
- These pre-existing information cards can also include information cards automatically created by information card component as discussed supra (e.g., based on content of a video, based on metadata associated with a video, etc.).
- information card component 104 can be configured to automatically generate information cards for the streaming media provider for association with videos provided by the streaming media provider, such as information cards promoting videos, playlists, or channels provided by the streaming media provider 102 .
- information card component 104 can automatically create information cards that promote other websites or products sponsored by the streaming media provider 102 .
- selection component 2002 can select one or more pre-existing information cards to associate with a video based on content of the video. For example, selection component 2002 can select an information card to associate with a video based on a correlation or similarity between the content of the information card and the content of the video. For instance, selection component 2002 can select a fundraising information card that supports an animal rescue organization for association with a video about animals. In another example, selection component 2002 can select a playlist information card with music videos from a particular artist for association with another video from the particular artist.
- Selection component 2002 can also select one or more pre-existing information cards to associated with a video based on a duration of the video. For example, selection component 2002 can determine the number of information cards to associate with a video based on the duration of the video, wherein the longer the video, the more information cards for association therewith.
- Selection component 2002 can further select one or more pre-existing information cards to associate with a video based on various personalized factors related to the user viewing the video, such as preferences of the user, demographics of the user, social affiliations of the user. For example, selection component 2002 can select information cards to associate with a video that the user will likely select or view based on the information cards having content that the user tends to prefer, that other users similar to the user in demographics tend to prefer, or that the user's friends tend to prefer. Selection component 2002 can also consider past usage behavior of the user of the streaming media provider 102 . For example, past usage can include watch history of the user and media endorsed by the user as determined based on media the user is subscribed to, media the user likes, media the user shares, media the user comments on, etc.
- Selection component 2002 can also select one or more information cards to associate with a video based on information regarding past information card interaction/selection by the user. For example, if the user tends to select information cards of a particular type (e.g., video or playlist information cards vs. merchandise information cards), the selection component 2002 can select information cards to associated with a video selected for watching by the user that are of the particular type.
- a particular type e.g., video or playlist information cards vs. merchandise information cards
- Selection component 2002 can also select one or more information cards to association with a video selected for watching by a user based on a current context of the user.
- context can include a current location of the user, a current time of day, and events, things, other users, activities of the user, etc., associated with the current location of the user and the current time of day. For example, if a user is located at the zoo and watching a video, selection component 2002 can select an information card that is a fundraising card for the zoo. In another example, if a user is watching a video at a shopping mall, selection component 2002 can select more merchandise information cards to associate with the video based on the assumption that the user is in a shopping frame of mind.
- system 2000 can also determine or infer where to integrate an information card with a video. For instance, integration component 108 , server interface component 110 and/or client interface component 114 can determine or infer when to display a teaser for an information card for a video during playback of the video. In an aspect, the timing of display of the teaser and/or the particular information card for which to display a teaser is based on monitored user engagement levels during playback of the video. For example, integration component 108 can be configured to flash a teaser for an information card at a point during playback of the video when the viewer's engagement with the video falls below a threshold level of user engagement/interest.
- engagement component 2004 can monitor user engagement/interest with a video during playback to dynamically determine when the user's engagement falls below a threshold level of user engagement.
- the level of user engagement can be based on various factors, including but not limited to: user interaction with the video and/or the client device during playback (e.g., cursor movement, control of playback), size of the media player, visibility of the media player, sound level of the video (e.g., whether the video is on mute), and direction of view (e.g., whether the user is looking at the display screen).
- integration component 108 can also consider previous determinations of drop of off points in a video based on watch histories of a plurality of users with respect to the video. For example, integration component 108 can receive information indicating points in the video where users tend to drop off and stop watching the video and/or lose interest/engagement with the video. Integration component 108 can further chose to integrate an information card at these drop off points.
- Inference component 2006 is configured to provide for or aid in various inferences or determinations associated with aspects of systems and interfaces described herein. For example inference component 2006 can facilitate selection component 2002 in associating inferring what pre-existing information cards to associate with a video based on the various factors described above. In another example, inference component 2006 can facilitate integration component 108 in association with determining or inferring where to integrate an information card into a video and when to display a teaser for the information card during playback of the video.
- inference component 2006 can examine the entirety or a subset of the data to which it is granted access and can provide for reasoning about or infer states of the system, environment, etc. from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data.
- An inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example.
- the inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events.
- An inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data.
- Such an inference can result in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.
- Various classification (explicitly and/or implicitly trained) schemes and/or systems e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc.
- support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc. can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.
- Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed.
- a support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data.
- directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., na ⁇ ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

Description
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/017,003 filed on Jun. 25, 2014, and entitled “PRESENTATION OF METADATA IN A MEDIA ITEM PLAYER.” The entirety of the aforementioned application is incorporated by reference herein.
This disclosure generally relates to systems, methods, and interfaces for generating information cards for a video and rendering the information cards during playback of the video.
While online video provides a rich medium to present information to a viewer there is often other information related to the video that may be interesting, but not directly part of the video. For example, a user watching a video about gardening may want to learn more about specific species of plants talked about in the video even though that information is not directly presented in the video. With traditional media viewing services, the user would navigate away from the website or media item player and manually search for the desired information. Thus there is a need to provide viewers with an avenue to access additional information about a video without directing them away from the video service.
Numerous aspects, embodiments, objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:

As used herein, the term information card refers to a data object (e.g., including text, images, video, a hyperlink, etc.) having auxiliary information related to a video that it is associated with. The auxiliary information can be related to the content of the video, a channel that the video is provided on, a creator of the video, an audience of the video, or the like. For example, an information card can include a link to a website with information about a product presented in a video. Another example information card can include information about other videos related to the video being watched or provided on the same channel as the video. Another example information card can include a solicitation for a donation to the video creator.
While online video provides a rich medium to present information to a viewer there is often other information related to the video that may be interesting, but not directly part of the video. For example, a user watching a video about gardening may want to learn more about specific species of plants talked about in the video even though that information is not directly presented in the video. Information cards offer a means for a viewer of a video to be able to learn more about entities in that video without leaving the video player or going to another destination.
The disclosed systems, methods, and interfaces provide a mechanism for enriching a user's media consumption experience by presenting the user with additional information associated with a video that the user may have a desire to view, without interrupting the user's viewing experience and bombarding the user with unwanted and irrelevant information. In various embodiments, after an information card has been created and associated with a video, during playback of the video, a clickable information icon is included within the media player that indicates the association of the information card with the video. The information icon can remain in a consistent fixed position within the media player throughout the playing of the video. In some aspects, the information icon can be configured to be hidden following initial display after a fixed period of time and revealed in response to user input (e.g., cursor movement, hovering over the position of the interface including the information icon, pausing of the video, etc.).
The information card is further rendered only in response to user input indicating a request to view the information card. For example, the information card can be rendered in response to selection of the information icon. The information card is further displayed (e.g., as a video overlay) while the video continues to play and can be removed or minimized in response to user input. Accordingly, the subject mechanisms for providing users with additional information associated with a video minimize a spam environment while creating a more positive user experience. The information icon provides a sufficient hint or visual cue to inform the user that there is deeper information that may be of interest to the user without overloading a user. In addition, in various embodiments, a notification or teaser object can be configured to flash as a flyout from the information icon that includes information (e.g., text) providing an indication of the content of the information card. For example, the notification or teaser for an information card including a link to product included in the video can include text stating “click here to purchase.” In an aspect, the notification or teaser can be configured for display for a short predetermined duration of time (e.g., 5 seconds).
The position, size, and appearance of the information card can be adapted based on the type of the client device, the orientation of the client device, and the size of the media player (e.g., full screen vs. partial screen). In an aspect, the information card is rendered within the media player as an overlay over the video content while the video continues to play. According to this aspect, by being inside the player, the information card is easily portable to multiple platforms via embedding. For example, when the video is embedded at a third party site (e.g., a website that does not host the video and/or the information card), by including the information card as metadata with the video for presentation within the video player, the information card can still be rendered when the video is played at the third party site. In another aspect, the information card can be rendered outside of the media player.
The number of information cards associated with a video can vary. In some aspects, when a plurality of information cards are associated with a video, one or more of the cards can be displayed in response to selection of the information icon or another triggering event (e.g., a time point in the video, user interaction with the video, selection of the teaser object, etc.). In an aspect, when a plurality of cards are associated with a video, a condensed representation of the cards can be presented in the form of a gallery. A user can select a condensed representation of one of the cards for to view, thereby bringing that card to the forefront of the display and/or enlarging that card.
The subject information cards can also be associated with specific points or time frames in a video. For instance, an information card promoting a product mentioned in a video could be timed to be brought to the viewer's attention at a point when the product is initially mentioned. In an aspect, the information icon could be displayed or distinguished at that time point or time frame so as to notify the user that an information card is associated with that point or time frame in the video. In another aspect, a teaser object or notification for the information card could be displayed at that time point or time frame in the video.
In an embodiment, a system is provided that facilitates user creation of information cards and/or association of the information cards with a video. For example, they system can allow a creator of a video (or an owner of the video, or entity otherwise having ownership/editing authority of the video) to choose one or more preformed information cards to associate with the video. In another example, the system can allow the creator of the video to design/create information cards for the video. The system can further generate the information cards and associate the information cards with the video based on guided user input such that the information cards provided by the system are consistently formatted and rendered across various platforms.
In an aspect, the system can provide a card creation graphical user interface that includes a menu with different information card types to choose from (e.g., a merchandise card, a fundraising card, a video or playlist card, an associated website card, a fan funding card, a poll card, etc.), wherein each type of card provides a different purpose and represents a different type of content. Each card type can be associated with a card creation form with different input fields that guide the user with selection of content to include in the card. The input fields can vary depending on the card type. Example form fields can include but are not limited to: a title field, a call to action text field, a teaser text field, a product identifier field, an add hyperlink filed, an add image filed, an add video field, or an add poll/survey field. Using the guided form fields, the user can provide the required input and the system can generate the corresponding card with a preconfigured format. In addition, the system can allow the user to associate the card with a specific time point or time frame in the video. For example, the user can choose when an information icon for the card should appear during playback of the video and/or when the teaser/notification for the card should appear during playback of the video.
In other embodiments, a system is provided that can automatically create information cards for a video and/or associate information cards with a video. According to this aspect, the system can determine what information cards to associate with a video and where to associate them, including when to reveal a teaser for the respective information cards during video playback, based on the content of the video, viewer behavior, and/or the type of device being used. The system can further consider user preferences, user context, and user engagement during playback of the video to dynamically determine what information cards to associated with a video, when to associate them and when to reveal teasers/notifications for the respective information cards.
In one or more aspects, a device is disclosed that includes a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes at least the computer executable components stored in the memory.

The various components of system 100 can be connected either directly or via one or more networks 120. Such network(s) can include wired and wireless networks, including but not limited to, a cellular network, a wide area network (WAD, e.g., the Internet), a local area network (LAN), or a personal area network (PAN). For example, client device 112 can communicate with streaming media provider 102 (and vice versa) using virtually any desired wired or wireless technology, including, for example, cellular, WAN, wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Wi-Max, WLAN, and etc. In an aspect, one or more components of system 100 are configured to interact via disparate networks.
In various embodiments, streaming media provider 102 is an entity configured to provide various type of streaming media and related services that are accessed by client devices (e.g., client device 112) via a website or thin client application employed by the streaming media provider 102. The website and/or thin client application employed by the streaming media provider 102 can provide a dynamic graphical user interface via which respective users can interface with the streaming media provider 102. For example, the dynamic graphical user interface can include at least a media player configured to play a video provided by (e.g., hosted by) the streaming media provider 102, and display one or more interactive information cards and associated interface elements as described herein. Client device 112 can include a presentation component 116 to facilitate rendering or presentation of the dynamic graphical user interface at a display of the client device 112.
In an exemplary embodiment, the streaming media provider 102 provides users access to a voluminous quantity (and potentially an inexhaustible number) of shared media (e.g., video and/or audio) files. The streaming media provider can receive media (e.g., user generated content) uploaded thereto by respective users of the streaming media provider and publish the uploaded media to other users. The streaming media provider can further stream these media files to one or more users at their respective client devices (e.g., client device 112) using network accessible platform (e.g., via a website or thin client application). The media can be stored in memory accessible to streaming media provider 102 (e.g., at various servers or caches employed by the streaming media provider 102). In addition, the streaming media provider can allow users to establish their own channels which serve as avenues via which they share their own media content (e.g., media created, collected or otherwise associated with ownership by the user). Other users of the streaming media provider can subscribe to desired channels to receive information regarding the channels, such as new videos added to the channels, recommended videos from the channels, comments provided by other users in association with the channels, etc.
As used herein, the term channel refers to data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic or theme. A channel can be associated with a curator who can perform management actions on the channel. Management actions may include, for example, adding media items to the channel, removing media items from the channel, defining subscription requirements for the channel, defining presentation attributes for channel content, defining access attributes for channel content, etc. The channel content can be digital content uploaded to the internet-based content platform by a channel curator and/or digital content selected by a channel curator from the content available on the Internet-based content platform. A channel curator can be a professional content provider (e.g., a professional content creator, a professional content distributor, a content rental service, a television (TV) service, etc.) or an amateur individual. Channel content can include professional content (e.g., movie clips, TV clips, music videos, educational videos) and/or amateur content (e.g., video blogging, short original videos, etc.). Users, other than the curator of the channel, can subscribe to one or more channels in which they are interested.
The term media content or media item can include but is not limited to streamable media (e.g., video, live video, video advertisements, animations, music, music videos, sound files and etc.) and static media (e.g., pictures, thumbnails). The term media content or media item also includes a collection of media items such as a playlist including several videos or songs, or a channel including several videos or songs associated with a single media creator or curator.
In accordance with various embodiments, to facilitate generating information cards for a video and rendering the information cards during playback of the video, streaming media provider 102 can include information card component 104, card enticer component 106, integration component 108, and server interface component 110. Information card component 104 is configured to generate and/or provide one or more information cards for a video having additional information about the video. The information card can serve various purposes, such as informing the viewer about content presented in the video, offering the user an avenue to purchase an item mentioned or presented in the video, providing information about additional videos or playlists associated with the video, providing the user with a link to a website with additional information associated with the video, etc. An information card can include text, images, links, video, audio and/or animation.
In one or more embodiments, information card component 104 is configured to generate and/or provide a predefined set of information card types, including but not limited to: a merchandise card, a fundraising card, a video or playlist card, an associated website card, a fan funding card, and an a survey card. A merchandise card can promote licensed merchandise directly from the video. For example, a merchandise card can include a link a website where the user can purchase merchandise mentioned in the video and include an image of the merchandise. A fundraising card can provide viewers with a link directly to projects on fundraising sites promoted by the video creator and/or the streaming media provider. For example, a fundraising card can include a link to a source where the user can contribute to a fundraising project associated with the video.
A media card can provide a link to another video, playlist or channel hosted by the streaming media provider 102 which can be of interest to the viewer of the current video. For example, a media can include a thumbnail image for another video or playlist and include a destination URL for the video or playlist at the streaming media provider. In some aspects, a media card can include a link to a specific time in a video or to an individual video in a playlist. An associated website card can be used to provide a direct link to a website associate with a video. A fan funding card can allow viewers/fans to show their appreciation for the video or the channel/creator of the video by allowing the viewer to make a monetary contribution directly on the video page. A survey card can include an interactive survey associated with the video. A survey card can provide a means for a video creator to collect solicited feedback from viewers. For example, a video creator could use a survey card to ask viewers what the theme or title of the next video should be. In another example, a video creator could use a survey card to ask viewers to provide a rating of the video.
With reference back to FIG. 1 , in an aspect, information card component 104 can automatically generate information cards for a video based on information associated with the video, such as information identifying a creator of the video or a channel of the video. For example, information card component 104 can generate a video card that promotes another video provided by the creator or included on the creator's channel. In another example, information card component 104 can automatically generate a website promotion card that promotes a website affiliated with the channel creator as gathered base on information from the channel creator's profile. In another aspect, the information card component 104 can automatically generate a playlist card that compiles a playlist of other videos provided on the creator channel. In another aspect, information card component 104 can automatically generate information cards that facilitate cross-promotion between channels. For example, when two channel curators have agreed to allow cross promotion between their channels, information card component 104 can generate an information card that advertises or promotes the first channel for display on videos of the second channel, and vice versa.
In some aspects, information card component 104 can automatically generate information cards for a video based on metadata associated with the video, such as metadata identifying key terms or content in the video, metadata identifying a title of the video, metadata identifying a genre of the video, etc. For example, information card component 104 can be configured to identify merchandise information cards for items mentioned or presented in a video based on metadata associated with the video identifying those items.
In other aspects, information card component 104 is configured to generate information cards for a video based on and in response to user input identifying the content for the information card. These aspects of information card component 104 are discussed in greater detail infra with reference to FIGS. 14-19 .
In various embodiments, card enticer component 106 is configured to generate teasers based on user provided input identifying the content/text for the teaser. Such embodiments are discussed in greater detail infra with respect to FIGS. 14-19 . In some embodiments however, card enticer component 106 can automatically generate an appropriate teaser for an information card. For example, card enticer component 106 can be configured to combine a suitable call to action term (e.g., donate, watch, share, purchase, etc.) with another term representing the content or purpose of the card to generate a teaser. In other aspects, card enticer component can employ a set of stock teasers that are generally appropriate for different card types. For example, a stock teaser for a merchandise card could read “click here to purchase.” In another example, a stock teaser for a fundraising card could read, “Donate now.”
In an embodiment, card enticer component 106 is configured to personalize teasers for each particular viewer. For example, the card enticer component 106 can integrate the viewer's name into the teaser (e.g., “Erin, Watch this Video,” as opposed to “Watch this Video”). In another example, card enticer component 106 can draw on information included in a viewer's watch history and interaction with the streaming media provider 102 to facilitate personalizing teasers. For instance, card enticer component 106 can learn that based on a user's previous contributions, an additional contribution of the user to the particular channel curator associated with a video would place the user in a higher status or win the user an honor or badge of some sort. Accordingly, card enticer component 106 can generate a personalized teaser for a fan funding card that states, “Erin, contribute to this channel and receive Gold status.”
In another aspect, the card enticer component 106 can include relevant and authorized social annotations with a teaser to facilitate enticing a viewer to select the teaser and view the associated card. For example, a teaser with a personalized touch and social annotation could state “Erin, watch this video your friends John and Amy liked,” or “Erin, buy this necklace Jaime wore to the party last week” (e.g., as discerned from information, such as pictures, comments, etc., published on an Jaime's social network profile page).
In an aspect, the integration component 108 can dynamically, determine or infer what information cards to associate with a video and where to reveal them and/or their associated teasers in real-time or substantially real-time during playback based on user behavior, user context, user preferences, user profile information, and/or user engagement. According to this aspect, what information cards are presented to a user and when during playback of a video are personalized on a per user basis. In other aspects, discussed in greater detail infra, a user (e.g., a creator of the video), can determine what information cards to associate with a video and where to include them. According to this aspect, the user can create his or her own information cards and/or teasers or select a information card that was automatically created by information card component 104. In some aspects, the user can also set a duration for the amount of time a particular teaser is revealed. In other aspects, the duration for presentation of a teaser is controlled by streaming media provider 102 (e.g., 5 seconds total).
In various embodiments, the integration component 108 incorporates information cards and their associated teasers into a video as metadata included with or associated with the video file. According to this embodiment, when the streaming media provider 102 streams streams the video to the client device 112 for playback, the metadata including the information cards associated with the video and their associated teasers is also provided. The metadata can further define the points/time frames in the video the respective information cards are to be made available, and/or the teasers for the respective information cards are to be shown. With this embodiment, the information cards associated with a video and/or their locations within the video can be preset prior to playback of the video.
To facilitate rendering the subject information cards in association with playback of a video provided by streaming media provider 102, client device 112 can include client interface component 114, presentation component 116, and input component 118. In one or more embodiments, client interface component 114 is configured to generate a graphical user interface including at least a media player configured to play a video streamed to the device from streaming media provider 102. For example, the client device 112 can access a website hosted by the streaming media provider 102 or open a resident thin client application serviced by the streaming media provider 102, and select a video for playing. In response to selection of the video, client interface component 114 can generate a graphical user interface configured by the streaming media provider (e.g., via server interface component 110) that includes a media player that begins playing the requested video. In another example, client device 112 can access another network source (not shown), such as a website provided by a social networking service and generate a graphical user interface configured by the social networking service. According to this example, the graphical user interface can include a having a feed with an embedded video provided by the streaming media provider 102.
In association with generation of the graphical user interface, and based on association of one or more information cards with the video, client interface component 114 can include an information icon positioned within the media player and overlaying the video. The information icon indicates the association of the one or more information cards the video. In an aspect, the information icon can remain visible throughout the duration of playing of the video. In another aspect, the information icon can become visible in response to a trigger, such as cursor movement, hovering of a cursor near an area where the information icon generally appears, in response to presentation of a teaser, in response to occurrence of a frame in the video associated with a particular information card, etc.
For example, FIG. 3 depicts an example graphical user interface 300 provided by streaming media provider 102 and presented at client device 112 in association with access of the streaming media provider. The graphical user interface includes a video currently being played entitled “Chocolate Truffles, Raw. Vegan. Not Gross.” This video has at least one information card associated therewith, as indicated by the information icon 302 displayed in the upper right corner of the media player as an overlay over the video. In various embodiments, the client interface component 114 is configured to surface the one or more information cards associated with the video and include the one or more information cards in the graphical user interface in response to user input (e.g., provided via input component 118) indicating selection of information icon 302.
For example, FIG. 4 shows an example graphical user interface 400 provided by streaming media provider 102 that is displayed at client device 112 in response to user input indicating selection of information icon 302. The graphical user interface includes an information card window 402 with text stating “in this video,” to introduce the information cards that are included in the video. This video includes at least two information cards, information cards 404 and 406. Only a portion of information card 406 is displayed within the information card window 402. In an aspect, the remainder of information card 406 can be revealed in response to scrolling through the information card window 402. For example, additional information cards (e.g., in addition to information cards 404 and 406, may be revealed in response to scrolling).
With this example interface, the information cards 404 and 406, and the information card window 402 are included as an overlay over the video and within the media player. The information cards and the information card window are positioned at a right side of the media player so not as to obstruct the entire visible display area of the media player. Accordingly, the user can continue watching the video while the information card are displayed. The user can also dismiss the information cards at will (e.g., via selecting the X icon in the upper right corner of the information card window 402).
Example interfaces 300, 400 and other interfaces described herein are considered dynamic graphical user interfaces. As used herein, a dynamic graphical user interface is an interface whose elements dynamically change in response to user input, user navigation of the interface, the occurrence of various events or actions, the passage of time, user context, and other conceivable factors. In an aspect, presentation component 116 can present or render a dynamic graphical user interface employed by the streaming media provider in response to opening of a website of the streaming media provider 102, or in response to opening of a client application of the streaming media provider. The dynamic graphical user interface can include various elements that facilitate interfacing with the streaming media provider 102 in order to receive the content and/or services provided thereby.
In some embodiments, the streaming media provider 102 controls the changing appearance of the dynamical graphical user interfaces described herein (e.g., the rendering of information cards and associated interface elements). For example, a dynamic graphical user interface presented at client device 112 via presentation component 116 (e.g., interfaces 300, 400 and the like) can include a server-side dynamic webpage/application page. A server-side dynamic webpage is a webpage whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.
According to this aspect, streaming media provider 102 can include server interface component 110 to generate scripts that define the elements of each instance of the dynamic graphical user interface. Such scripts can control the look and feel of the dynamic graphical user interface, including when and where an information icon is displayed, when and where a teaser/notification is displayed, when and where an information card is displayed, how an information card appears, etc. As the elements of the dynamic graphical user interface change, such as in response to requests/input received from the client device 112, server interface component 110 can generate new scripts that redefine the current elements of the dynamic graphical user interface. Server interface component 110 can further provide the scripts to the client device 112 for interpretation and generation/presentation of the dynamic graphical user interface by presentation component 116.
In another aspect, a dynamic graphical user interface presented at client device 112 via presentation component 116 (e.g., interfaces 300, 400 and the like) is a client-side dynamic webpage/application page. A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using hypertext markup language (HTML) scripting running in the browser as it loads. According to this aspect, client device 112 can include client interface component 114 to use client-side scripting to change the elements/behaviors of the dynamic user interface presented by presentation component 116 in response user input (e.g., mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, vocal commands, etc.) via input component 118, and/or at specified timing events. In this case the dynamic behavior occurs within the presentation.
In yet another aspect, a dynamic graphical user interface presented at client device 112 via presentation component 116 (e.g., interfaces 300, 400 and the like) is produced as a result of combined server-side and client-side processing. According to this aspect, server interface component 110 is configured to provide the server-side processing and client interface component 114 is configured to provide the client-side processing necessary to generate and present the subject dynamic graphical user interface. The client and server components that collectively build a dynamic web page/application page are called a web application. Web applications manage user interactions, state, security, and performance. For example, Ajax programming uses a combination of both client-side scripting and server-side requests. It is a web application development technique for dynamically interchanging content, and it sends requests to the server for data in order to do so. The server returns the requested data which is then processed by a client side script. This technique can reduce server load time because the client does not request the entire webpage to be regenerated by the server's language parser; only the content that will change is transmitted.
The manner in which information cards and associated interface elements (e.g., the information icon, teasers, etc.) are presented in a graphical user interface can vary. For example, streaming media provider 102 and/or client device 112 can determine and adapt (e.g., via integration component 108, server interface component 110, client interface component 114, and/or presentation component 116) the size, shape, location, elements (e.g., images, text, icons, etc.), and appearance of an information card, an information icon, and a teaser included in a graphical user interface based on various factors, including but not limited to: client device type (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop PC, smart TV, etc.), client device orientation (e.g., portrait vs. landscape), media player dimensions (e.g., full screen vs. partial screen), location of the media player (e.g., embedded at a location external to streaming media provider 102, rendered on a webpage employed by the streaming media provider, rendered via a thin client application employed by the streaming media provider, etc.), type of the information card, content of the information card (e.g., text, images, hyperlinks, etc.), type of teaser, content of the teaser, and number of information cards associated with the video.
In various embodiments, the server interface component 110 (and/or the integration component 108), and/or the client interface component 114 is configured to integrate one or more information cards associated with a video in the graphical user interface as an overlay over the video and within the media player during playing of the video. In other embodiments, the server interface component 110 (and/or the integration component 108), and/or the client interface component 114 is configured to integrate the one or more information cards in the graphical user interface outside of the media player during playing of the video.
With reference to FIG. 5 presented is another example graphical user interface 500 provided by streaming media provider 102 that is displayed at client device 112 in response to user input indicating selection of information icon 302. Interface 500 is similar to interface 400 with the modification of the location of the information card window 402 and the orientation of the information cards included within the information card window. In example interface 500, the information card window 402 is located outside of the media player and the information cards are provided in a horizontal or landscape orientation. With this configuration, an additional information card 502 is capable of being included within the visible display area of the information card window.
In an aspect, presentation component 116 (and/or client interface component 114) is configured to render interface 300 or interface 400 depending on the type of client device employed (e.g., a desktop PC, a laptop PC, a smart TV, tablet, a smartphone, etc.), the orientation of the client device, and/or the size of the media player (e.g., full screen vs. partial screen).
In various embodiments, client interface component 114 and/or server interface component 110 can alter (initiate rendering, hide, disable rendering, alter level of opaqueness, etc.) how the information icon 802 is rendered in response to a triggering event(s). For example, when a user navigates to a website or initiates playback of a media item, the media player can display information icon 802 at a highest level of visibility (e.g., low or no opaqueness). In other embodiments, information icon 802 can be rendered based on user actions, such as a user hovering over the media player 804 (e.g., via a computer mouse, etc.), a user providing input (e.g., clicking an area of interface 800, scrolling interface 800, etc.), or the like. It is noted that the triggering event can be based on other criteria, such as a passage of time, entering a playback period, or the like.
As an example, information icon 802 can be hidden during playback times that are not associated with information cards and rendered when an information card is associated with a playback period. When the playback period associated with the information card ends, the information icon 802 can be hidden. It is noted that any combinations of triggering events can be utilized. For example, information icon 802 can be rendered based on user input, a playback time, and the like. In another aspect, information icon 802 can be hidden based on not receiving user actions for a determined period of time, in response to a user manually hiding information icon 802, or the like. In embodiments, a level of opaqueness associated with information icon 802 can gradually alter (e.g., fade information icon 802). For instance, if a user does not select information icon 802 for a period of time, information icon 802 can gradually fade until information icon 802 is no longer visible.
Traditional media item players do not have built in control of metadata displays, such as information cards. Further, other media item players may not be capable of selecting metadata for information cards as described herein. Various embodiments disclosed herein can allow for an enhanced user experience, increased visibility of metadata, and a more efficient media item sharing system.
In an embodiment, in association with playback of the cat video in the embedded media player 804, information icon 802 is rendered with a representation 1006 of an information card stemming from the information icon 802. The representation 1006 can include a predetermined number of fields or amount of information, such as an image field and a title field. Selection of the representation 1006 of the information can result in the rendering of a full sized version of the information card. In an aspect, the representation 1006 of the media card functions as a teaser and indicates the association of the media card with the current time frame of the video. The representation 1006 may be configured to disappear after a preset duration of time.
In an aspect, information cards 1102 and 1106 can represent other information cards associated with the cat video. As depicted, portions of these additional information cards are revealed. In an aspect, the other available information cards 1102 and 1104 can be rendered in an order relative to selected information card 1106. For instance, the order can be based on respective time periods associated with the information cards. The user can provide input to cycle through or select different information cards to display in a focused position (e.g., the position of selected information card #1). For example, the input can include a swipe, a mouse click, an arrow key, or the like.
Turning now to FIG. 14 , presented is another example system 1400 for generating information cards for a video and rendering the information cards during playback of the video, in accordance with aspects and embodiments described herein. System 1400 includes same or similar features and functionalities as system 100 with the addition of card generator component 1402, teaser generator component 1404, and card editing component 1406. Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments described herein is omitted for sake of brevity.
In an embodiment, the streaming media provider 102 an provide a card creation graphical user interface that includes a menu with different information card types to choose from (e.g., a merchandise card, a fundraising card, a video or playlist card, an associated website card, a fan funding card, a poll card, etc.), wherein each type of card provides a different purpose and represents a different type of content. Each card type can be associated with a card creation form with different input fields that guide the user with selection of content to include in the card. The input fields can vary depending on the card type. Example form fields can include but are not limited to: a title field, a call to action text field, a teaser text field, a product identifier field, an add hyperlink filed, an add image filed, an add video field, or an add poll/survey field. Using the guided form fields, the user can provide the required input and the system can generate the corresponding card with a preconfigured format. In addition, the card creation interface can allow the user to associate the card with a specific time point or time frame in the video.
For example, FIG. 15 provides an example card creation graphical user interface 1500 that facilitates generating information cards for a video and associating the information cards with the video in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein. In an aspect, interface 1500 is generated/configured by streaming media provider 102 and displayed at client device 112 via presentation component.
In an aspect, in response to selection of the card menu option 1502, an “add card” dialogue box 1506 is displayed adjacent to the media player 1504. The add card dialogue box 1506 includes a list of different information cards types from which the use can chose to add to the video. This include an associated website card, a fundraising card, a merchandise card, and a video or playlist card. Each of the respective cards options are associated with a create button. Selection of the create button can result in the generation of card creation form that facilitates guided user input in association with selecting content to include in the respective cards. The card creation input forms can vary depending on the selected card type.
Each or the respective forms 1600, 1700 and 1800 include an input field that allows the user to enter a URL for a specific item represented by the card, (e.g., a URL for a fundraising website, a URL for a video or playlist, and a URL for a merchant). In an aspect, after the user enters a suitable URL and selects the create card button on the form, the card generator component 1402 generates the corresponding card, populating the card with information based on the selected URL. For example, the card generator component 1402 can select a thumbnail image for the card, and include stock text for the card based on the URL and/or the selected card type. The card generator component 1402 can format the appearance of the card according to a predefined layout. In another embodiment, streaming media provider 102 can provide a more detailed card creation form that facilitates guided user input of additional information for inclusion in the card.
For example, FIG. 19 presents another card creation form 1900 that facilitates entering information for inclusion in a merchandise information card. In an aspect, card creation form 1900 is generated in response to selection of the create card button on form 1800. In another aspect, card creation form 1900 is generated in response to selection of the create button associated with the merchandise card option in dialogue box 1506 of interface 1500.
Referring now to FIG. 20 , presented is another example system 2000 for generating information cards for a video and rendering the information cards during playback of the video, in accordance with aspects and embodiments described herein. System 2000 includes same or similar features and functionalities as system 1400 with the additions of selection component 2002, engagement component 2004 and inference component 2006 to client device. Although these components are included at client device in system 2000, one or more of the selection component 2002, the engagement component 2004 or the inference component 2006 can also or alternatively be included at streaming media provider 102. Repetitive description of like elements employed in respective embodiments described herein is omitted for sake of brevity.
For instance, in some aspects, a plurality of pre-existing information cards can be accessible to streaming media provider (e.g., stored in memory associated with streaming media provider 102). These pre-existing information card can include information cards created by users and authorized for use by system 2000 in association with integration with videos provided by the streaming media provider. For example, a user can create a plurality of information card for his or her video. When the video is selected for playing by another user, the selection component 2002 can then select a subset of the information cards for associating with the video based on various factors tailored to the other user (e.g., user preferences, user demographics, user social affiliations, user behavior, user context, device type, and user engagement). In another aspect, a user can create information cards for his or her video and authorize system 2000 to use them on other videos provided by streaming media provider 102. For example, a user can create a video or playlist card for association with his or her video. The user can also allow system 2000 to use this card for association with other video provided by the streaming media provider 102.
These pre-existing information cards can also include information cards automatically created by information card component as discussed supra (e.g., based on content of a video, based on metadata associated with a video, etc.). For example, information card component 104 can be configured to automatically generate information cards for the streaming media provider for association with videos provided by the streaming media provider, such as information cards promoting videos, playlists, or channels provided by the streaming media provider 102. In another example, information card component 104 can automatically create information cards that promote other websites or products sponsored by the streaming media provider 102.
In an embodiment, selection component 2002 can select one or more pre-existing information cards to associate with a video based on content of the video. For example, selection component 2002 can select an information card to associate with a video based on a correlation or similarity between the content of the information card and the content of the video. For instance, selection component 2002 can select a fundraising information card that supports an animal rescue organization for association with a video about animals. In another example, selection component 2002 can select a playlist information card with music videos from a particular artist for association with another video from the particular artist.
In addition to automatically selecting information cards to associate with a video, system 2000 can also determine or infer where to integrate an information card with a video. For instance, integration component 108, server interface component 110 and/or client interface component 114 can determine or infer when to display a teaser for an information card for a video during playback of the video. In an aspect, the timing of display of the teaser and/or the particular information card for which to display a teaser is based on monitored user engagement levels during playback of the video. For example, integration component 108 can be configured to flash a teaser for an information card at a point during playback of the video when the viewer's engagement with the video falls below a threshold level of user engagement/interest.
In an embodiment, engagement component 2004 can monitor user engagement/interest with a video during playback to dynamically determine when the user's engagement falls below a threshold level of user engagement. The level of user engagement can be based on various factors, including but not limited to: user interaction with the video and/or the client device during playback (e.g., cursor movement, control of playback), size of the media player, visibility of the media player, sound level of the video (e.g., whether the video is on mute), and direction of view (e.g., whether the user is looking at the display screen).
In some aspects, integration component 108 can also consider previous determinations of drop of off points in a video based on watch histories of a plurality of users with respect to the video. For example, integration component 108 can receive information indicating points in the video where users tend to drop off and stop watching the video and/or lose interest/engagement with the video. Integration component 108 can further chose to integrate an information card at these drop off points.
In order to provide for or aid in the numerous inferences described herein, inference component 2006 can examine the entirety or a subset of the data to which it is granted access and can provide for reasoning about or infer states of the system, environment, etc. from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. An inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. An inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data.
Such an inference can result in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification (explicitly and/or implicitly trained) schemes and/or systems (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc.) can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.
A classifier can map an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x4, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, such as by f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

At 2106, the system can provide the media item to the client device for playing. For example, the system can stream the media item/video to the client device. The system can also provide the client device with the information cards and/or information identifying when to render the information cards. In response to provision of the media item to the client device, the client device can play the media item and render the information cards (e.g., via presentation component 116) during playback of the media item in response to detecting a triggering event. For example, a triggering event can include occurrence of a specific frame or playback time in the video, selection of the information icon, selection of a teaser, or the like.
