Definitions
- This patent document relates to virtual machines.
- Cloud computing is network-based computing in which typically large collections of servers housed in data centers or “server farms” provide computational resources and data storage as needed to remote end users.
- Some cloud computing services allow end users to run user-provided server software applications (e.g., e-commerce server application, web server, or file server) in the cloud.
- Some other cloud computing services provide access to software applications such as word processors and other commonly used applications to end users who interface with the applications through web browsers or other client-side software.
- Users' electronic data files are usually stored in the server farm rather than on the users' computing devices. Maintaining software applications and user data on the server farm may simplify management of end user computing devices.
- Some cloud computing services allow end users to execute software applications in virtual machines.
- An aspect of the described technologies can be implemented in a method that includes creating, at a server system, a boot image based on one or more user-specified parameters associated with virtual machine booting, providing a first virtual drive that includes the boot image, booting a virtual machine using the boot image on the first virtual drive, and providing a second virtual drive to the virtual machine, where the virtual machine mounts the second virtual drive as a root file system.
- Other implementations can include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage mediums.
- One or more parameters can include an identifier of an operating system kernel. Creating the boot image can include an operating system kernel in the boot image. One or more parameters can include an identifier of a kernel module. Creating a boot image can include including a kernel module in the boot image.

Booting a virtual machine can include initializing a RAM disk in accordance with the size parameter. In some implementations, the one or more parameters include an image for a RAM disk. Booting the virtual machine can include initializing the RAM disk with the image. In some implementations, a virtual machine is configured to allow kernel modules to be loaded after the booting is complete.
- RAM random access memory
- a virtual machine is configured to restrict user-provided kernel modules from being loaded after the booting is complete. Implementations can include receiving one or more user-specified parameters via a network. Creating a boot image can be in response to receiving one or more user-specified parameters. Implementations can include providing, via the network, a web-based user interface. One or more user-specified parameters can be specified via the web-based user interface. In some implementations, the virtual machine is configured to restrict all kernel modules from being loaded after the booting is complete. Implementations can include providing, via the network, an application programming interface. The one or more user-specified parameters can be specified via the application programming interface.

- the host machines 102 , 104 included in the server system 100 can contain one or more data processing apparatuses such as rack mounted servers or other computing devices. Host machines 102 , 104 can have different capabilities and computer architectures. Host machines 102 , 104 can communicate with each other through an internal data communications network 116 .
- the internal network 116 can include one or more wired (e.g., Ethernet) or wireless (e.g., WI-FI) networks, for example. In some implementations the internal network 116 is an intranet.

- a host operating system 106 , 108 can boot a virtual machine using a virtual boot disk.
- a virtual boot disk can be a digital file such as a bootable disk image.
- the virtual boot disk can be provided by a web server 118 .

- Virtual hardware e.g., virtual hardware 110 a , 112 a and 114 a .
- Software that is executed by the virtual hardware can be referred to as guest software.
- guest software cannot determine if it is being executed by virtual hardware or by a physical host machine. If guest software executing in a VM, or the VM itself, malfunctions or aborts, other VMs executing on the host machine will not be affected.
- a host machine's microprocessor(s) can include processor-level mechanisms to enable virtual hardware to execute software applications efficiently by allowing guest software instructions to be executed directly on the host machine's microprocessor without requiring code-rewriting, recompilation, or instruction emulation.
- Each VM (e.g., VMs 110 , 112 and 114 ) is allocated a set of virtual memory pages from the virtual memory of the underlying host operating system and is allocated virtual disk blocks from one or more virtual disk drives for use by the guest software executing on the VM.

- a VM's guest software can include a guest operating system (e.g., guest operating systems 110 b , 112 b and 114 b ) which is software that controls the execution of respective guest software applications (e.g., guest applications 110 c , 112 c and 114 c ), within the VM and provides services to those applications.
- a guest operating system can be an operating system such as a variant of the UNIX operating system. Other operating systems are possible.
- Each VM can execute the same guest operating system or different guest operating systems.
- Booting a VM can include using a virtual boot disk to load a kernel image associated with a guest operating system into memory.
- a guest operating system's access to resources such as networks and virtual disk storage is controlled by the underlying host operating system.
- the guest application 110 c or guest operating system 110 b attempts to perform an input/output operation on a virtual disk, initiate network communication, or perform a privileged operation, for example, the virtual hardware 110 a is interrupted so that the host operating system 106 can perform the action on behalf of the virtual machine 110 .
- the host operating system 106 can perform these actions with a process that executes in kernel process space 106 b , user process space 106 a , or both.
- the kernel process space 106 b is virtual memory reserved for the host operating system 106 's kernel 106 d which can include kernel extensions and device drivers, for instance.
- the kernel process space has elevated privileges (sometimes referred to as “supervisor mode”); that is, the kernel 106 d can perform certain privileged operations that are off limits to processes running in the user process space 106 a . Examples of privileged operations include access to different address spaces, access to special functional processor units in the host machine such as memory management units, and so on.
- the user process space 106 a is a separate portion of virtual memory reserved for user mode processes. User mode processes cannot perform privileged operations directly.
