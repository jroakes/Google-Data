Abstract
Techniques and apparatus for task related classification, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking of an application manager are described herein. By using an application manager, multiple applications (including stand-alone applications, instant applications, websites, and other content) that someone can use to accomplish a single task or multiple related tasks are categorized into separate groups for display in the application manager. The application manager is capable of automatically identifying relationships between activities performed with the application and identifying user behavior with the application related to the activities. Based on the relationships and user behavior, the application manager can automatically determine that the activity and behavior represent a task and display a task group including the application representing the task. The task group may be visually displayed as a stack, band, or heap of windows or thumbnails representing each application or other content that the person may use for the task.
Description
RELATED APPLICATIONS
The present utility model claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/112,400, filed on 8/24/2018, which in turn claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 62/599,295, filed on 12/15/2017, according to 35U.S. C. ≡119 (e), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Background
An application manager, such as an overview screen or a screen displaying recently viewed content, is a common feature of many electronic devices. Some users mainly use the application manager to close applications, as conventional application managers only provide a fixed chronological list of recent activities. The user can only see some of the most recently used applications in the list and must scroll through the list to view the remaining applications. Furthermore, over time, some items in the list may become outdated, blocked, or lose value to the user. Thus, it may be difficult for a user to use an application manager to complete tasks and improve workflow and production efficiency.
For example, suppose a person is always preparing to conduct a afternoon meeting with a colleague by reading an email via an email application and viewing the prepared document on a collaboration website. The person then takes a break before the meeting and uses another application to schedule weekend activities and replies to the personal email in a different email application. During the meeting, some questions about the email and documents appear, and the person goes to the application manager on his device to find previously viewed material that can be used to answer the questions. It is further assumed that the history of the meeting preparations of the person becomes obscured, deleted, or unavailable due to the passage of time, the person's intervening personal tasks, and the various applications for accomplishing these tasks. In this example, and in many similar examples, the application manager may not enable the person to complete the desired tasks, and may even make it more difficult to complete certain tasks.
This background description is provided to generally present the context of the present disclosure. Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are neither expressly nor implicitly admitted as prior art to the present disclosure or the appended claims.
Disclosure of Invention
Techniques and apparatus for task related classification, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking (bookmark) by an application manager are described herein. By using the application manager, multiple applications (including stand-alone applications, instant applications, websites, and other content) that someone can use to accomplish a single task or multiple related tasks are categorized into separate groups for display in the application manager. The application manager can automatically identify relationships between activities performed with the application and identify user behavior with the application related to the activities. Based on the relationships and user behavior, the application manager can automatically determine that the activity and behavior represent tasks and display a task group that includes applications that represent the tasks. The task groups may be visually displayed as stacks, bands, or piles of windows or thumbnails representing each application or other content that the person may use for the task. These aspects may be considered to relate to solving the technical problem of how to easily provide a user with materials or tasks related to a particular activity. By grouping tasks and conveniently presenting them to a user, user time and effort may be reduced. Further, these aspects may also reduce the use of computing resources, such as battery resources of the mobile device and processing time consumed when the user manually searches for related materials.
In some cases, someone can bookmark (or "pin") websites, applications, documents, and other content. All bookmarked items will then be available in the application manager. For bookmarked items, the technique may be used to create new tasks that may be shared with other applications, such as calendars or task managers. For example, if a person is preparing documents for a presentation at a meeting in another city, the person may mark the documents as tasks for later final review and bookmark an airline website page showing the person's travel reservations for the meeting, and search results for restaurants and attractions near the meeting location. Thereafter, the person may view the documents, subscriptions, and search results in a single task group in the task related application manager. Thus, the person's activities related to the meeting may be organized and found at a convenient location in the application manager.
Aspects described below include an electronic device having one or more computer processors and one or more computer-readable storage media. The one or more computer-readable storage media include storage instructions executable by the one or more computer processors to implement an application manager. The application manager is configured to perform an analysis of activities associated with an application running on the electronic device and determine, based on the analysis, that at least two particular activities are related activities included in the task. The application manager also presents the task group on a display of the electronic device. The task group includes representations of respective applications associated with the related activities that are available to launch the respective associated applications.
Aspects described below also include a system having: an electronic device; one or more computer processors; and one or more computer-readable storage media. The computer-readable storage medium includes storage instructions executable by the one or more computer processors to implement an application manager. The application manager is configured to perform an analysis of activities associated with an application running on the electronic device and determine, based on the analysis, that at least two particular activities are related activities included in the task. The application manager also presents the task group on a display of the electronic device. The task group includes representations of respective applications associated with the related activities that are available to launch the respective associated applications.
Aspects described below also include a method implemented in an electronic device. For example, the method may be implemented in an electronic device or in communication with a network, such as a remote server. The method includes performing an analysis of an activity associated with an application running on the electronic device.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
Techniques are described herein that enable task-related classification, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking of an application manager. These techniques enable improvements in workflow and organization related to computer-aided tasks by organizing items displayed in an application manager into task-related item groups, displaying updates to applications and applications related to the tasks, and enabling the inclusion of scaled and bookmarked items in the task groups. Further, a machine learning module may be employed to improve future results based on the person's optional rearrangement of content in the task group or an indication of the usefulness of the task group.
Consider, for example, a situation where someone wants to watch a movie with a friend. The person may open the video application during the middle of the day and watch some trailers for the new movie. The person then uses a search engine to find out if any potential movie selections are playing in the vicinity. The person bookmarks the movie theatre schedule and sends a short message to a group of friends to invite them to watch the movie at a later time in the evening. Once the group of friends confirms, the person accesses the application store to search for and download the movie theatre ticketing application, which is then used to purchase tickets. The person then opens the ride share application and arranges for the ride to go to the movie theater and first stop to receive the other two members of the group of friends. After a few hours, just before the movie starts, two other friends send a short message saying that they are not. The person now needs to cancel both tickets and adjust the scheduled itinerary. Using the described techniques, the application manager may display a set of marking tasks related to the person's movie planning activity. Thus, the described techniques enable the person to find the applications needed to make these adjustments using the application manager.
As another example, consider the case where someone is planning to order pizzas for the work team at the next day's meeting. The person uses a search application to find several pizza restaurants near the meeting. During the meeting, the person votes for the participant to choose between the restaurants and then opens the application manager to quickly find the order application for the selected restaurant. Given the long dispatch queue of the selected restaurant, pizza is too late for the meeting to arrive. The described techniques may provide advice on an application manager screen to install an application that accepts third party distribution services that may take pizzas and distribute in a shorter time. Furthermore, these techniques may suggest updates to the person's restaurant application that enable the estimated delivery time to be displayed.
As another example, please consider the above case: someone is always preparing for an early meeting by reading e-mail and documents. It is assumed that the person has checked all documents and needs to prepare an agenda summarizing the discussion about the documents, but since there is an intermediate meeting, the person has no time to write down the summary before the intermediate meeting. The described techniques may enable the person to bookmark or mark documents together as a single task that may be viewed later from the application manager. Thus, once the other conferences are over, the person can easily find the documents needed to prepare the agenda.
These are just a few examples of how the described techniques and apparatus may be used to improve the workflow and organization associated with computer-aided tasks by organizing items displayed in an application manager into task-related item groups. Other examples and embodiments of the technology and apparatus will be described herein. Turning now to the example environment, example systems, devices, methods, and components are described hereinafter.
Operating environment
FIG. 1 illustrates an example operating environment 100 in which techniques implementing task related classification, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking of an application manager can be implemented. The example environment 100 includes: an electronic device 102 comprising or associated with: one or more computer processors 104; and a computer readable storage medium 106, which may include various memory media, storage media, or both.
Electronic device 102 is shown with various example devices, including: smart phone 102-1, tablet computer 102-2, laptop computer 102-3, desktop computer 102-4, computing watch 102-5, smart home appliance 102-6, computing glasses 102-7, home automation and control system 102-8, and vehicle 102-9. The electronic device 102 may also include other devices such as televisions, entertainment and gaming systems, audio systems, drones, touch pads, drawing tablets, netbooks, electronic readers, home security systems, and other home appliances. Note that the electronic device 102 may be wearable, non-wearable but removable, or relatively stationary (e.g., desktop computers and home appliances).
The computer-readable storage medium 106 also includes an application manager 108, various applications 110, and an operating system (not shown), any or all of which may be implemented as computer-readable instructions that may be executed by the computer processor 104 to provide some of the functions described herein. The application manager 108 is described in more detail in fig. 2.
The electronic device 102 may also include a network interface 112. The electronic device 102 may use the network interface 112 to communicate data over a wired, wireless, or optical network. By way of example, and not limitation, network interface 112 may communicate data over a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), a Personal Area Network (PAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), an intranet, the Internet, a peer-to-peer network, or a mesh network. The electronic device 102 also includes or is capable of communicating with a display 114.
In general, the application manager 108 may organize information about activities performed by the electronic device 102 or performed with the electronic device 102 and provide accurate and useful tools to a user that may improve production efficiency and workflow. For example, the application manager 108 may analyze activity associated with an application running on the electronic device. These activities may include any of a variety of operations, such as operations performed by a user, operations performed by an application, and so forth. Further, a single activity may include multiple elements (e.g., user behavior, one or more background operations by an application, and additional user behavior responsive to the operation). Based on the analysis, the application manager 108 may determine that at least two particular activities are related activities and that the related activities are included in the task. For example, the application manager may determine that user emails, user interactions with calendar applications, and user interactions with the online reservation system of the restaurant are related activities included in the scheduled tasks (e.g., the scheduled lunch meetings).
Once the tasks are determined, the application manager 108 may present (e.g., on the display 114) the task groups. The task group includes representations of respective applications or other entities (e.g., programs, websites, and captured images) associated with the related activities. For example, continuing with the example above, the task group may include representations of the user's email program, the user's calendar application, and the reservation system.
These representations may be windows, icons, thumbnail images, or other representations of associated applications. Examples of these representations are described in more detail with reference to fig. 4-7. These representations can be used to launch a corresponding associated application (e.g., when a user interacts with the representation, the associated application launches). In some implementations, these representations can be used to launch an associated application in a saved state (e.g., the application launched and appeared as the last time the application was used by the user) or in an active state (e.g., the application was launched in a default manner and appeared as usual when opened). In other embodiments, the application manager may create and present an image or "screenshot" of the application, as it appears last time it was used, and present one or both of the screenshot and the representation in the task group.
In some implementations, the application manager 108 automatically performs the described operations (analysis of activities, determination of related activities included in tasks, and presentation of task groups) without user input or instruction. In other cases, the application manager may perform some or all of the steps under the direction of the user, or may provide the user with a user interface (e.g., a dialog window) that allows the user to decide whether the application manager should create a task group. It should be noted that while the application manager 108 may automatically perform the above-described operations without user input, other operations described herein may be performed based on or in consideration of user input.
In addition, the application manager 108 may enable a user to edit a task group. For example, the application manager 108 may receive user input indicating that one or more particular activities are not related activities and, in response to the user input, remove a representation of an application associated with the indicated activities from the task group. Similarly, the application manager 108 may receive user input indicating that additional activities not initially determined to be related activities are related activities. In response, a new representation of the respective application associated with the indicated activity may be added to the task group. The user input for editing the task set may take any of a variety of formats, such as drag and drop input, input from a menu or dedicated control, and so forth. The user may delete the entire task group, add or delete a single representation, or rearrange the order or arrangement of task groups without adding or deleting any representation. In some implementations, if multiple related activities are performed with a single application, the user may add additional representations of the application.
In fig. 1, the application manager 108 is illustrated as part of the electronic device 102. It should be noted that the application manager 108 (or computer-readable storage medium 106) may be implemented in a separate device, such as a remote server or another electronic device, and communicate with the electronic device 102 via a network connection (e.g., using the network interface 112).
In some implementations, the user can create a new task group by bookmarking or rating the content and designating it as relevant. For example, the application manager 108 may receive user input indicating that one or more activities are related activities. These activities may be associated with applications already included in the task group or with other corresponding applications. Based on the user input, the application manager 108 may automatically cause the application manager to create a new task group or add representations of other corresponding applications to an existing task group. Similar to the editing functionality described above, the user input for creating a new task group may be in any of a variety of formats, such as drag and drop input, input from a menu or a dedicated control (e.g., a "calibration" or "bookmark" control), and so forth.
Alternatively, the application manager 108 may present a tag (e.g., "lunch meeting") to the task group. The tag may be based on the content of one or more related activities, such as the subject line of an email, the time or location of a calendar item, or the title of a file or document (e.g., the name of a video or meeting agenda). In some cases, the tags may be automatically determined by the application manager 108 and may be edited by a user. In other cases, the application manager 108 may provide a user interface that allows a user to create or select a tab for a task group.
Additionally or alternatively, the application manager 108 may be used to assist the user in completing tasks. For example, the application manager 108 may determine available upgrades to applications presented in the task group, such as upgrades to one or more activities or portions of activities that may be used to perform the task. Similarly, the application manager 108 may determine new applications (e.g., applications that are available but not currently associated with the electronic device) that may be used to perform one or more activities or portions of activities of the task. When an upgrade or available application is determined, the application manager 108 may display a selectable control that may be used to enable the upgrade or new application to be installed on the electronic device 102.
Fig. 2 illustrates an example embodiment 200 of the application manager 108. In the example embodiment 200, the application manager 108 includes or has access to a context manager 202 and a link manager 204. In some cases, the application manager 108 may also include or have access to the machine learning module 206. As indicated by dashed line 208 in fig. 2, application manager 108 may be part of electronic device 102. In other implementations, the application manager 108 may be a stand-alone device (or part of a stand-alone device) such as a remote server or another electronic device, and communicates with the electronic device 102 over a network 210 (e.g., using the network interface 112).
The application manager 108 may work with the context manager 202 and the link manager 204 to analyze activities associated with applications running on the electronic device 102 and organize the task groups presented by the application manager 108. For example, the context manager 202 may use various techniques to automatically determine relationships between user interactions with different applications, websites, and other content. The relationship may be determined by a variety of factors including: information from applications, internal devices or modules, application Programming Interfaces (APIs), or user inputs. The application manager 108 (including one or both of the context manager 202 and the link manager 204) may receive information about the application from the application using the existing connection (e.g., the application manager knows which applications were launched and may determine the link by launching).
In other implementations, the application manager 108 may obtain information (e.g., with the appropriate rights granted by the user) by analyzing the content and information in the application user interface. Thus, the application manager 108 may receive and analyze information from links between applications, comments in the electronic device memory, data related to user behavior (e.g., if the user explicitly links the applications or uses copy/paste to transfer text between applications or websites), phone conversation data, recommendations of applications or websites, another API, display data (e.g., applications used together in a split screen configuration), an operating system of the electronic device, and so forth. Once determined, the application manager 108 may use these relationships to define initial content for the set of tasks that may be presented by the application manager 108 (e.g., on the display 114). In some cases, the user may choose to include or exclude various sources of contextual information used by the context manager 202.
The link manager 204 can automatically determine relationships explicitly created by users (e.g., by users editing existing groups, rating related items, or bookmarking related items) and communicate these user-initiated relationships to the context manager 202 and the application manager 108. Using this analysis and information, the application manager 108 may update the task groups determined by the context manager 202 or display separate task groups related to the user's behavior. In some cases, the link manager 204 may also create tasks based on groupings by another application (e.g., a task manager or "to-do" application) separate from the application manager 108. The context manager 202 and link manager 204 may also work with the application manager 108 to determine if there are new applications (or upgrades to applications already in use) that may help the user perform tasks.
The machine learning module 206 receives information about groups and about user behavior and communicates with the application manager 108 to improve the process for creating and managing content displayed by the application manager 108. For example, the application manager 108 (e.g., using the machine learning module 206) may analyze user input associated with the related activity and based on the analysis of the user input, modify one or more processes corresponding to one or both of the analysis of the activity associated with the application running on the electronic device or the determination that the at least two particular activities are related activities included in the task using machine learning techniques to improve accuracy of the determination of the related activity. It should be noted that the user input described with reference to the analysis by the machine learning module 206 is a behavior such as a user editing a task group (e.g., by moving a representation from one task group to another, deleting an item from a group, or deleting an entire group). Thus, even when analysis of activities associated with an application running on an electronic device, at least two particular activities are user behavior is not considered in the determination of related activities included in a task or present in a task group, the application manager 108 or the machine learning module 206 may consider user behavior in such context.
Consider, for example, the case where the application manager 108 creates a task group that includes several representations. The user may view the task group and determine that one representation is associated with a duplicate calendar reminder that does not belong to the group (e.g., the user is processing documents, but has interacted with the reminder right between documents). In this case, the machine learning module 206 may inform the application manager 108 that the repeated calendar reminder will not be included in the task group unless the context of the reminder is explicitly related to other items in the task group. In this way, the subsequently created task groups may more accurately reflect the relevant activities, thereby saving user time and improving the user experience of the application manager 108.
These and other capabilities and configurations, as well as the manner in which the entities of FIG. 1 interact and interact, are set forth in more detail below. These entities may be further divided, combined, etc. The example environment 100 of fig. 1 and the detailed diagram of fig. 2 illustrate some of many possible environments and devices that can employ the described techniques.
Example method
FIG. 3 depicts an example method 300 of task related categorization, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking by an application manager. The method 300 may be performed with an electronic device, such as the electronic device 102. Method 300 is illustrated as specifying a set of blocks for the operations performed, but is not necessarily limited to the order or combination shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. Further, any of one or more of the operations may be repeated, combined, reorganized, or linked to provide a wide variety of additional and/or alternative approaches. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to the example operating environment 100 of FIG. 1 or to the entities or processes detailed in FIG. 2, by way of example only. The techniques are not limited to being performed by an entity or entities operating on a device.
In 302, analysis of activity associated with an application running on an electronic device is performed. The analysis may be performed by any of a variety of entities, such as the application manager 108 (including the context manager 202 and/or the link manager 204).
At 304, it is determined based on the analysis that at least two particular activities are related activities included in the task. The determination may be performed by any of a variety of entities, such as the application manager 108 (including the context manager 202 and/or the link manager 204). For example, the application manager may determine that user emails, user interactions with calendar applications, and user interactions with the online reservation system of the restaurant are related activities including scheduled tasks (e.g., a scheduled lunch meeting).
In 306, a task group including representations of respective applications associated with the related activities is presented on a display of the electronic device. These representations may be any of a variety of visual representations, such as windows, thumbnails, or icons, and may be used to launch a corresponding associated application. Optionally, a tab (e.g., "lunch meeting") may be presented to the task group. As described with reference to fig. 1, the tags may be based on the content of one or more related activities, may be automatically generated (e.g., by the application manager 108), and may be edited by a user. In other cases, a user interface may be provided to the user that allows the user to create or select a tab for the task group.
In some implementations, a user can create a task group by bookmarking or rating the content and designating it as relevant. For example, the user may provide an input indicating that one or more activities are related activities. These activities may be associated with applications already included in the task group, as well as with other corresponding applications. Based on user input, a new task group may be created, or representations of other respective applications may be added to an existing task group (e.g., automatically by application manager 108 or via user interaction). As described with reference to fig. 1, the user input for creating or adding to a task group may be in any of a variety of formats, such as drag and drop input, input from a menu, or a dedicated control (e.g., a "calibration" or "bookmark" control), and so forth.
In some implementations, available upgrades (e.g., by the application manager 108) for applications presented in the task group can be determined, such as upgrades for one or more activities or portions of activities that can be used to perform the task. Similarly, new applications (e.g., applications that are available but not currently associated with the electronic device) may be determined that are available to perform one or more activities or portions of activities of the task. When an upgrade or available application is determined, a selectable control may be displayed that may be used to enable the upgrade or new application to be installed.
In some implementations, the described operations (analysis of activities, determination of related activities included in tasks, and presentation of task groups) are performed automatically without user input or instruction. In other cases, some or all of the steps should be performed under the direction of the user, or the user may be provided with a user interface (e.g., a dialog window) that allows the user to decide whether the application manager should create a task group.
Once the task group is established, the user may edit the task group. For example, the user may provide an input indicating that one or more activities are not related activities. In response, a representation of the respective application associated with the indicated activity may be removed from the task group. Similarly, the user may indicate that the additional activity that was not originally determined to be a related activity is a related activity. In response, a new representation of the respective application associated with the indicated activity may be added to the task group. As described with reference to fig. 1, the user input for editing the task set may be in any of a variety of formats.
In some implementations, user input corresponding to the related activity can be analyzed (e.g., by the application manager 108) and, based on the user input, one or more processes corresponding to one or more of analysis of the activity associated with the application running on the electronic device or determination that the at least two particular activities are related activities included in the task can be modified to improve accuracy of the determination of the related activity. For example, consider a task group that includes several representations, as described with reference to FIG. 2. The user may view the task group and determine that one representation is associated with a duplicate calendar reminder that does not belong to the group. In this case, the process (the process of the application manager 108) may be informed that the duplicate calendar reminder will not be included in the task group unless the context of the duplicate reminder is explicitly related to other items in the task group. In this way, the subsequently created task groups may more accurately reflect the relevant activities and thereby save user time and improve the user experience.
Example embodiment
FIGS. 4, 5, 6, and 7 depict example embodiments of task related categorization, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking by an application manager. Fig. 4 and 5 depict embodiments in which an application manager (e.g., application manager 108) displays representations of related activities in a task group. FIG. 6 depicts an embodiment in which an application that may be made invisible to other activities of a user on a device obtains access rights to activity data to allow the application to provide additional functionality based on the other activities of the user. FIG. 7 depicts an embodiment of a technique for uniformly bookmarking (or calibrating) is provided. The techniques enable an application manager to create a task group (also displayed by the application manager) based on related items or content (e.g., from an application, web page, screen shot, or document) that a user bookmarks or demarcates.
These and other embodiments herein are illustrated and described as performing techniques and operations, but are not necessarily limited to the order or combination of techniques and operations illustrated herein. Further, any one or more of the operations may be repeated, combined, reorganized, or linked to provide a wide variety of additional and/or alternative approaches. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to the environment 100 mentioned in FIG. 1 and described in detail in FIG. 2, by way of example only. The techniques are not limited to being performed by an entity or entities operating on a device.
FIG. 4 illustrates an example implementation 400 of the electronic device 102 of FIG. 1 (in this case, the smart phone 102-1) that can enable task-related classification, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking by an application manager. In the example embodiment 400, two example task groups are shown: an "interesting cat video" group 402 (video group 402) and a "today's meeting" group 404 (meeting group 404). Both task groups 402 and 404 include three representations of related different user activities or content (e.g., related activities as described above).
As shown in fig. 4, the video group 402 includes a first representation, labeled "inbox," that represents an email application by which someone receives emails containing links to videos of cats doing something interesting. The second one, labeled "video player" and representing an application or website that can play video, and the third one, labeled "screenshot", represents an image viewing application that can display still images captured by the person from the video. In the example video group 402, assume that the person receives an email, views the video and captures a still image (e.g., a screenshot) of the video. The application manager 108 automatically and without explicit input or selection by the person, identifies these three activities as being task-related and places them into a task group (e.g., using information found by the context manager 202 or link manager 204 as described above). The application manager 108 also provides a tag for the group ("interesting cat video") that can be generated by the application manager 108 based on any of a variety of sources (e.g., text from an email, a title of a video, or an annotation of a captured image).
Meeting group 404 includes a first representation labeled "calendar" that indicates that the person has scheduled a calendar application for the meeting. The second representation is labeled "document" and represents a word processing application (or document sharing application), and the third representation labeled "video conference" represents a video conference application. In meeting group 404, it is assumed that the person has arranged a meeting on a calendar application and created an online meeting using a video conferencing application. The person attaches the document (and the link to the document sharing application) to calendar events and video conferences. The application manager 108 automatically and without explicit input or selection by the person, identifies the three activities as related activities and places them into a task group (e.g., using information found by the context manager 202 or the link manager 204). The application manager 108 also provides the group with a tag ("today's meeting (3:00 PM)") that can be generated by the application manager 108 based on any of a variety of sources (e.g., information from calendar events or video conferences or text from documents).
FIG. 5 illustrates another example embodiment 500 of the electronic device 102 of FIG. 1 (in this case, the smart phone 102-1) that may enable task related classification, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking by the application manager. In the example embodiment 500, two example task groups are shown: a "news" group 502 (news group 502) and a "games" group 504 (games group 504). The task groups 502 and 504 each include three visual representations representing different applications or websites through which user activities or content may be executed or accessed and which are associated with activity categories.
For example, in FIG. 5, a newsgroup 502 includes three representations. The first representation is labeled "local newspaper," representing a web site or application with a local volume of newspaper. The second representation is labeled "national newspaper," representing an application or web site for a newspaper having a national publication number. The third representation is labeled "cable news," representing an application or website of the national cable news organization.
In the example embodiment 500, it is assumed that someone views content over a period of time using an application or website represented by the three representations. The application manager 108 automatically and without explicit input or selection by the person, recognizes these three activities as similar types of applications and places them into the task group 502 with a "news" tab (e.g., using information found by the context manager 202 or the link manager 204). The tags may be generated by the application manager 108 based on information from the application or website that the person views.
Similarly, the game set 504 also includes three representations. The game set 504 includes a first representation labeled "cards" and representing a card game application. The second representation is labeled "martial arts" and represents a martial arts combat game. The third, labeled "80 year game" represents a website that represents a arcade game that allows a user to play the 80 year of the 20 th century. In the example game set 504, the person plays several games over a period of time. The application manager 108 automatically and without explicit input or selection by the person, identifies these activities with the three applications as similar types of activities and applications and places them into a task group 504 with a "game" tab (e.g., using information found by the context manager 202 or the link manager 204). The tag may be generated by the application manager 108 based on information from an application or website playing the game.
FIG. 6 illustrates another example implementation 600 of the electronic device 102 of FIG. 1 (in this case, the smart phone 102-1) that may implement these aspects of task-related classification, application discovery, and unified bookmarking by the application manager. In the example embodiment 600, at least one service providing new applications and updates to currently installed applications on the electronic device 102-1 has no visibility of other activities of the user on the electronic device 102-1.
Example embodiment 600 is similar to the above case: someone schedules a work team ordering pizza for a meeting at night the next day. The person uses a search application to find several nearby pizza restaurants. Then, during the meeting, the person uses the survey application to vote on the participants to select between the restaurants, and opens the application manager 108 to quickly find the order application for the selected restaurant. The scenario is illustrated by an example "dinner plan" group 602 that includes a search engine results representation, a survey application representation, and a restaurant distribution application representation. However, as previously mentioned, the distribution time of the selected restaurant is long and the pizza is too late for the meeting to arrive.
In addition, using the described techniques, the application manager 108 may automatically (e.g., without explicit input or selection by the person) provide suggestions for upgrading or downloading the application to address certain elements of the task or problem. For example, notification window 604 describes an update to the restaurant delivery application that provides an estimated delivery time (although this update is useful for future orders, it is not necessarily able to address the person's current problem). Another notification window 606 describes a new application (foodlayer) of a third party service that will deliver food orders if the restaurant does not provide delivery or, as in this case, if the restaurant's delivery time is too long. The person may use a selectable control in another notification window 606 to download the application and ensure that the order is timely delivered for the meeting.
In another example (not shown), the application manager 108 may display other notification windows describing availability of purchases within applications of the installed applications related to the task group. For example, the person may regularly use an application for a favorite coffee shop franchise. When traveling, the person can use the application to find nearby locations. When the person checks the application manager 108 to see the location at the new city or return, the application manager 108 may provide a notification window associated with the coffee shop franchise group that describes in-application purchases that enable the franchise's application to provide alerts and notifications of new and nearby franchise sites.
FIG. 7 illustrates another example implementation 700 of the electronic device 102 of FIG. 1 (in this case, the smart phone 102-1) that may enable further other aspects of task-related classification, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking by the application manager. Example embodiment 700 is similar to the above case: one prepares a meeting in the morning by viewing the relevant emails and documents and wishes to prepare an agenda summarizing the discussion about the documents. As previously described, since there is an intermediate meeting, the person has no time to write a summary before the intermediate meeting. In the example embodiment 700, the person may bookmark or mark the document as a single task group that may be later viewed from the application manager 108.
This scenario is illustrated by an example "weekly meeting review" task set 702 that includes three representations of applications for creating and displaying documents (weekly report, manager report, and draft summary representations) and an email application representation that represents the application that the person uses to review. As described above, the person may bookmark or fix the three documents and emails as tasks, and the application manager 108 may create and present the task group 702 (including attachments and links). In some implementations, the application manager 108 can include a sharing control 704, which sharing control 704 can be used to share weekly meeting review groups with other applications, such as calendars, email applications, or task manager applications.
Although the above examples described with reference to fig. 1-7 are for applications and websites on smartphones, they are not the only content sources and devices considered by the described technology. Other devices including devices connected via an internet of things (IoT) network, as well as applications (e.g., instant applications, digital media, or raw data), etc., may be used with the technology.
In addition to the above description, a control may be provided to the user that allows the user to make a selection as to whether and when the system, program, or feature described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social behavior or activity, profession, user's favorites, or the user's current location), and whether content or communications from a server are sent to the user. In addition, the specific data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that the personal identity information may be removed. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personal identity information of the user cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized, wherein location information (such as city, zip code, or state county level) may be obtained such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may control which information about the user is collected, how the information is used, and what information is provided to the user or what information about the user is provided.
Example computing System
FIG. 8 illustrates various components of an example computing system 800 that can be implemented as any type of client, server, and/or electronic device described with reference to FIGS. 1-7 above to implement task-related classification, application discovery, and uniform bookmarking of an application manager.
