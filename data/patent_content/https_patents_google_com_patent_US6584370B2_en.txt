Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to computer implementable decision support systems for determining a production schedule of feasible material releases within a complex multi-stage manufacturing system architecture.
- the present invention relates to a system for rationing manufacturing resources among competing demands according to a defined set of business rules.
- the manufacturing of semiconductors is a complex and refined process. This process includes everything from growing silicon crystals, to the actual placement and soldering of chips to a printed circuit board. Initially, raw wafers are cut from a silicon ingot and processed through a specific sequence of work centers. The end goal of this process is to build a set of integrated circuits on the surface of the silicon wafer according to a specific circuit design. This process involves repeatedly applying four basic steps: deposition, photolithography, etching, and ion implantation. These steps are the means by which materials with specific dielectric properties (e.g., conductors, insulators) are deposited on the surface of the wafer according to the precise circuit design specifications. These steps are repeated many times to build up several layers (typically between 12 and 25 layers) of the circuits.
- deposition deposition, photolithography, etching, and ion implantation. These steps are the means by which materials with specific dielectric properties (e.g., conductors, insulators) are deposited on the surface of the wafer
- circuits After the circuits have been built on the wafers they are tested to determine the resultant yield of operational circuits and tagged for later reference. The circuits are then diced and sorted, and subsequently wire bonded to a substrate to assemble a module. These modules, which are further tested to determine electromagnetic and thermal characteristics, are eventually combined on printed circuit boards to form cards. Finally, the cards are tested and those that pass are eventually used in the assembly of a wide range of finished electronic products (e.g., personal computers, printers, CD players, etc.). From the point of view of semiconductor manufacturing, the modules and cards are, mostly, the finished products taken to market.
- finished electronic products e.g., personal computers, printers, CD players, etc.
- FIG. 1 shows a high level block diagram of the BOM for semiconductor manufacturing which can be broken into the following four aggregate stages: wafer stage 110 , device/substrate stage 120 , module stage 130 , and card stage 140 .
- These aggregate stages may involve many steps each of which may significantly impact the flow of materials through the manufacturing system.
- the wafer stage 110 may involve wafer fabrication involving many passes through photolithography work centers to build multiple levels of a circuit structure.
- the dicing of the silicon wafer stage 120 involves a single item in the production process which is then converted into different devices.
- the card stage 140 may involve the assembly of many devices to generate a single card.
- Resource requirements at various stages in the manufacturing system play an important role in the development of a feasible production schedule in most industries.
- These resources are typically machines for carrying out the above mentioned processes in semiconductor manufacturing and may include items such as furnaces, cutting tools for dicing chips, and testing machines for determining the operational characteristics of devices.
- insufficient resources are available to accommodate perfect just-in-time processing at the various manufacturing stages for all orders.
- the finite availability of resources must be accounted for in computing a schedule, and in some cases processing must be carried out earlier or later than desired depending on such availability.
- a property of resource requirements which is typical in semiconductor manufacturing, but not common to most industries, is the fact that a component processed within the manufacturing system may have to revisit the same resource many times. This is referred to as reentrant flow scheduling.
- Tier 1 Long range (3 months to 7 yr) strategic level decisions such as mergers, capacity acquisition, major process changes, new product development, and long term policy based decisions.
- Tier 2 Medium range (1 week to 6 months) tactical scheduling involving yield and cycle time estimation, forecasting and demand management, material release planning and maintenance scheduling.
- Tier 3 Short to medium range (weekly planning) operational scheduling for optimizing consumption and allocation of resources and output of product, demand prioritization techniques, capacity reservation and inventory replenishment.
- Tier 4 Short range (daily) dispatch scheduling for addressing issues such as machine setups, lot expiration, prioritizing of late lots, job sequencing, absorbing unplanned maintenance requirements and assigning personnel to machines.
- the above taxonomy of planning and scheduling decisions is a hierarchical one, i.e., decisions in higher tiers affect lower tiers. For example, long range capacity acquisition decisions determine eventual yield and cycle times, the available resources that can be utilized, and the extent to which maintenance is to be scheduled in the future. As is known, decisions in higher tiers, by the nature of their long time frames, are made under considerable uncertainty and thus seek to anticipate future requirements based on current information. On the other hand, lower level tier decisions are of a corrective/reactive nature and act to absorb uncertainty not accounted for in the higher tiers.
- advanced production planning and scheduling decision support systems are typically run on a weekly basis; however, the planning horizon for such runs may range several years depending on the planning horizon of interest and the level of detail in forecasting.
- advance planning systems may impact decisions in tiers 1, 2 and 3 which, in turn, may affect tier 4 decisions. Therefore, the matching of assets to demand is a major planning activity which affects decisions within all tiers.
- the production schedule which includes major activities involved in the production planning process, can be divided into three categories: Supply Aggregation (SA), Materials Requirements Panning (MRP) and Resource Allocation (RA).
- SA Supply Aggregation
- MRP Materials Requirements Panning
- RA Resource Allocation
- the Supply Aggregation involves capturing and transforming micro/factory floor details into a manageable data set.
- WIP at a particular work center in the manufacturing system may ultimately travel through a variety of different routings. These routings depend on which type of finished product is eventually produced by the WIP.
- a set of operations can be isolated which are common to all potential routings that the WIP can travel through from that point forward. In other words, a limited set of the immediate future operations required for the WIP are known.
- the purpose of the Supply Aggregation step is then to project the WIP forward through the required work centers to points at which decisions regarding alternative routings are necessary. As the WIP is moved forward, its amount is adjusted for yield losses at the work centers through which it has traveled. Furthermore, the time at which the WIP becomes available at the projected work center is computed based on known cycle times at each work center. In reality, these times occur over a continuum; however, in practice, these times are discretized into a finite set of time periods. The end result of the Supply Aggregation is then to significantly reduce the number of material release points considered in future calculations which, in turn, decreases computation time to compute a feasible production schedule.
- Material Requirements Planning is a well known production scheduling method based on “explosion” of finished product demand using manufacturing information such as the BOM, yield and cycle times, inventory and planned receipts.
- the MRP is based on taking demand for finished product and sequentially moving backwards through the BOM (exploding). Required material releases are determined as well as the ideal release date based on cycle times at each work center at each level of the BOM.
- AMRP Advanced Material Requirements Planning
- MRP generates a set of ideal material releases under the assumption that unlimited resources are available.
- the purpose of Resource Allocation is then to systematically adjust this ideal set of releases to make them feasible with respect to constraints due to limited resources. That is, RA is concerned with the allocation of limited capacity to generate a feasible production schedule.

- LLC low level codes
- production plans are determined level by level, according to the sequence defined by the assignment of LLCs, where the entire time horizon is planned for the complete set of components at a given LLC.
- the computation of LLCs is a critical preprocessing step to the complete production scheduling system.
- This algorithm takes as input a table containing all individual BOM dependencies between each given PN and its components.
- the basic idea of the algorithm is to begin by assigning all PNs to the same (highest) level. Using the BOM, PNs in the lowest level (i.e., with the highest LLC) are tested to determine whether they need to be promoted to the next level due to dependency within their current level. Finally, through iterations, PNs which are components of other PNs are moved to the next level of the BOM (a process referred to as bumping).
- FIG. 2 is an example that illustrates the application of the algorithm described above.
- the individual PN-component BOM relationships are shown at level 210 .
- This list of records for part numbers (indicating which components are required for assembly) is used to assign LLCs to each PN.
- all PNs are assigned a LLC of “1” and ITERATION is set to “1”.
- a determination is made among PNs with LLC “1” which ones are components to other PNs with LLC “1”. The result in this case is that B, C and D are determined (from the list in level 210 ) to be components and, therefore, should have their LLCs increased by “1”.
- the basic modifications involve classifying PNs as siblings that either (a) result from the same binning process or (b) can be substituted for or by that part number.
- PNs LLC is increased in step 2 then so are the LLCs of its siblings.
- FIG. 3 further shows the problem with allocating capacity by traditional LLC generation. Assuming the following:
- PN A is made from PN B
- PN B is made from PN C
- PN C is made from PN D
- PN X is made from PN Y
- PN Y is made from PN Z.
- B would receive priority in allocation of capacity over X since it would be processed first.
- it may be desirable to instead give X priority over B thus illustrating the possible failure of traditional LLC generators.
- a method for computing modified low level codes (LLC) for part numbers throughout a bill of material (BOM) supply chain.
- the method includes identifying part numbers that share a same capacity resource but cannot be made to have a same LLC due to a BOM material restriction.
- the part numbers which cannot be made to have the same LLC due to the BOM material restriction are oscillating part numbers (OPN).
- OPN oscillating part numbers
- the highest LLC within the part numbers that share the same capacity resource except for the OPN is identified, and the LLC for the part numbers that share the same capacity resource, excluding the OPN, to the highest LLC are adjusted such that the part numbers which share the same capacity resource have a same LLC.
- the method then recalculates the LLC for part numbers which violate BOM dependencies by going through the entire BOM supply chain.
- the recalculated LLC is higher than or equal to the highest LLC provided in the adjusting step for each capacity resource.
- the adjusting of the LLC to the same LLC permits part numbers at different levels of the BOM which share the same capacity resource to be treated at a same level of the BOM in order to sequence the part numbers for resource allocation.
- the method of the present invention comprises identifying part numbers that share a same capacity resource but cannot be made to have a same LLC due to BOM material restriction, where the part numbers which cannot be made to have a same LLC due to the BOM material restriction are oscillating part numbers.
- Constraints associated with BOM dependency and resource dependency excluding ones associated with oscillating part numbers are identified, and a linear programming formulation is provided which includes the BOM dependency and resource dependency constraints and an objective function defined as sum of the LLC's for all of the PNs.
- the linear programming formulation excludes the BOM dependency and resource dependency constraints associated with the oscillating part numbers.
- the linear programming is then solved by determining a minimum total value of the objective function subject to the BOM dependency and resource dependency constraints to thereby determine modified low level codes.
- the present invention is also directed to a system of computing modified low level codes (LLC) for part numbers throughout a bill of material (BOM) supply chain.
- the system includes a mechanism for identifying part numbers that share a same capacity resource but cannot be made to have a same LLC due to a BOM material restriction and a mechanism for identifying a highest LLC within the part numbers that share the same capacity resource.
- the system further includes a mechanism for adjusting the LLC for all the part numbers that share the same resource to the highest LLC such that the part numbers, except the OPNs, which share the same capacity resource have a same LLC as well as a mechanism for recalculating the LLC for part numbers which violate BOM dependencies.
- the system can be implemented via a machine readable code or be hard wired into a circuit or other computational component.
- the changing of the LLC to the same LLC permits part numbers at different levels of the BOM which share the same capacity resource to be treated at a same level of the BOM in order to sequence the part numbers for resource allocation according to priority ranking based on business rules.
- the present invention further provides for computer programmable code for implementing the steps of the present invention.

- the present invention is directed to a system and method for computing low level codes (LLC) for part numbers (PN) in order to define an appropriate resource-based ordering for sequentially evaluating PNs in the Bill of Material (BOM) supply chain.
- LLC low level codes
- PN part numbers
- BOM Bill of Material
- the system and method of the present invention accounts for capacity resource sharing among PNs as well as complicated dependencies due to specialized processes like binning and material substitution in, for example, semiconductor manufacturing processes.
- the present invention is also generalizable to resource rationing problems found in other manufacturing industries.
- the present invention modifies the LLCs for controlling sequential capacity allocation through modification of conventional low level codes.
- the present invention employs a systematic set of decision rules for interactively adjusting LLCs so that the LLCs are consistent with interdependencies of resources among PNs due to resource sharing.
- the modified LLCs implemented by the present invention are suitable not only for sequencing the evaluation of PNs in Material Requirements Planning (MRP) but also for appropriately sequencing of PNs for Resource Allocation (RA).
- MRP Material Requirements Planning
- RA Resource Allocation
- the latter sequencing permits PNs at different levels of the BOM, which share resources, to be treated as if they are at the same level of the BOM. Therefore, such resources are able to share capacity according to appropriately defined business rules for priority ranking of material requirements for different PNs. This promotes the rationing of resources among material releases between specified levels of the BOM for the generation of a feasible production schedule in such a way that the resources are allocated according to a priority ranking.
- the present invention employs an iterative process.
- the first step of this process is to take, as input, the LLCs computed for PNs according to any known conventional methodology.
- the next step begins by preprocessing the PNs to determine the interdependence resulting from resource sharing. This step may be performed by creating a finite set of resource groups in which each PN requires a resource that is required by at least one other PN in the group. Thus, no group contains PNs in common with another group.
- These group dependencies among PNs are computed using a recursive algorithm based on a user input data table for the capacity resource requirements for each PN in the BOM. The dependencies are stored as a data table for use in the later stages of the present invention.
- OPN oscillating part numbers
- the OPNs are systematically identified within the resource groups and removed from consideration for modification of their LLCs due to this inconsistency. The removal of the OPNs corresponds to assigning each one to its own unique resource group.
- the present invention then performs a series of iterations. At each iteration, PNs within each of the resource groups are bumped to the highest level within the group. Having made the PNs consistent with resource dependency, PNs may then be bumped based on their BOM dependency. These iterations proceed until either (i) no further modifications to LLCs are necessary or (ii) a user specified maximum number of iterations has been performed.
- Step 1 Evaluate LLC based on conventional algorithms
- Step 2 Search for, Identify, and Remove OPNs
- Step 3 Iteratively apply a two pass algorithm comprising (a) bumping (or adjustment) PNs until LLCs are consistent with resource dependency and (b) systematically adjusting BOM requirements that were violated in step (a), or some maximum number of allowable iterations has been reached.
- results of this processing are then stored in a data table and used throughout the remainder of the production scheduling process to determine the sequence in which PNs are considered for MRP and RA heuristics.
- FIG. 4 shows an example of LLC assignment in a simple 3-level BOM.
- PN A is made from components B 1 and B 2 which, in turn, are made from sub-components C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 .
- PN A would be assigned an LLC of “1” since it is not a part to any other part and all remaining PNs would be incremented to a LLC of “2”.
- components B 1 and B 2 are assigned a LLC of “2” since they are not components of any other parts with LLC “2”.
- components C 1 , C 2 and C 3 are incremented to a LLC of “3”.
- FIG. 5 shows an actual effect of requirement for some finished product A on the next level of MRP releases for parts of A.
- product A is assembled from components B 1 and B 2 in the ratios 1:2 and 1:1, respectively.
- requirements for A induces requirements for a material release of 200 units of B 1 and 100 units of B 2 .
- MRP releases induce requirements for MRP releases of parts for B 1 and B 2 (i.e., C 1 , C 2 and C 3 ).
- This simple example illustrates the determination of material release quantities based on requirements for finished products.
- MRP release dates. This is performed by using manufacturing times for each level of the BOM to work backwards from the finished product delivery date. For example, in FIG. 5, if one week is required to assemble A and two weeks is required to assemble each of B 1 and B 2 , then releases for C 1 , C 2 and C 3 must be scheduled three weeks in advance of the delivery date for product A.
- the material release sizes and timing obtained from MRP in the example shown in FIG. 5 comprise the uncapacitated production schedule.
- the next step is to compute a capacitated production schedule. This is performed by proceeding in the opposite direction to MRP and at each level allocating capacity to material releases at each discrete time period. Since capacity is limited, situations are inevitably encountered in which releases planned using MRP are infeasible. In these situations, capacity is allocated among releases according to a priority ranking of the releases. Thus, higher ranked releases are allocated capacity before lower ranked releases. When insufficient capacity is available for a release, the release (or some portion thereof) must be moved either to an earlier or later time period with available capacity.
- FIG. 6 shows an example in which B and X utilize a same resource denoted by the oval enclosing B and X.
- This Figure shows the correct manner for assigning LLCs as implemented by the present invention.
- B and X are assigned the same LLC in such a way that the BOM dependencies are not violated.
- the BOM dependencies require that LLC for A be less than B which is less than C which, in turn, is less than D.
- BOM dependencies require LLC for X be less than Y which is, in turn, less than Z.
- the production planning heuristic would consider both B and X (which share capacity) while processing parts with low level code of “2” would be able to sequence the allocation of capacity according to priority based business rules.
- the resource groups are used to define dependencies between PNs due to the fact that they share resources. These dependencies are above and beyond those implied by the BOM supply chain.
- the groupings are defined as follows.
- Each PN within a group requires a capacity resource required by at least one other PN in the group.
- the resource group categorization is independent of any BOM dependency between PNs. So, PNs in the same group may be at different levels from the point of view of LLC generated through conventional methods.
- PNs B and X would have been in the same resource group.
- FIG. 7 shows the situation in which there are multiple groups of PNs (as shown by enclosing the respective PNs in ovals).
- parts B and X form one group of PNs
- parts C and Z form a second group, both groups of which share respective capacity resources.
- B and X have the same LLC.
- Y remains at level “3” and C is incremented or bumped to level “4”.
- C and Z have the same LLC.
- the adjustments of LLCs by the use of the present invention is a sequential process resulting in LLCs that correspond to PNs which are in the same group having the same LLC.
- LLC_D LLC_F (Resource Group dependency) 4.
- LLC_B LLC_E (Resource Group dependency) 5.
- LLC_B LLC_F (Resource Group dependency) 6.
- LLC_A is a variable representing the LLC for PN A.
- Oscillating PNs are PNs that cannot be guaranteed to have the same LLC with all other PNs with which it shares a common capacity resource because of inconsistent resource group dependencies. However, the OPNs nonetheless have to be assigned an LLC consistent with BOM dependencies.
- FIG. 9 represents a flow diagram showing the steps implemented by the present invention, but may equally represent a high level system diagram showing the system of the present invention (much like that of FIGS. 10, 11 and 13 ).
- the steps of FIG. 9 may be implemented on computer program code in combination with the appropriate hardware.
- This computer program code may be stored on storage media such as a diskette, hard disk, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or tape, as well as a memory storage device or collection of memory storage devices such as read-only memory (ROM) or random access memory (RAM). Additionally, the computer program code can be transferred to a workstation over the Internet or some other type of network.
- the present invention takes several sources of input data which may include, for example,
- Output from the modified LLC includes Oscillating PN Table and Modified LLC Table for both oscillating and non-oscillating PNs.
- Steps 910 to 940 generally identify PNs that share the same capacity resource but cannot be made to have the same LLC because of the BOM material restriction.
- Resources or capacity resources are typically machines or workcenters for carrying out processes in, for example, semiconductor manufacturing and may include items such as furnaces, cutting tools for dicing chips, and testing machines for determining the operational characteristics of devices.
- the present invention computes the initial LLCs for each PN using a known method such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,943,484 assigned to International Business Machines, Corp., and incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
- the method of the present invention determines the capacity resources required to manufacture each PN. If, for example, part X can substitute for part Y, then the present invention will add a dummy resource, for example, sub_X_Y, and model as if parts X and Y each consume capacity resource sub_X_Y.
- a map is generated containing for each resource the parts consuming that resource and the part's initial LLC.
- an identification of groups of resources is made so that the resource of each group shares PNs with other resources of that group and where each PN is in a single group. The net result of this step is that all PNs which share capacity belong to the same group.
- the identification of the groups for each resource described at step 930 may be performed in accordance with the following steps (as shown in FIG. 10 ).
- Step 1010 Does resource R contain at least one PN which consumes the capacity of another resource?.
- Step 1020 If yes, find all resources which contain at least one PN which also consumes capacity of resource R.
- Step 1030 Put each of these resources and all other resources which are a member of the resource's group, if any, into a single group and remove these resources from any other group.
- Step 1040 If no, then create a new group for resource R.
- step 930 there are groups of resources which imply a grouping of PNs which would have the same LLC because they are in the same resource group.
- a recursive BOM structure for identifying PNs such that giving them the same LLC will be impossible based on BOM dependencies is performed. This step is performed by searching for and identifying infeasible LLC requirements (such as in the example in FIG. 8) due to BOM dependencies between PNs in different resource groups. These PNs are called oscillating PNs (OPN).
- OPN oscillating PNs
- the present invention also checks if any of the OPNs are binned, or if they can be substituted with or for another PN at step 950 . If so, at step 960 , the present invention checks for other PNs in this binning point that are within the same group. These are also identified as OPNs and are written to an output file at step 970 .
- the LLCs associated with the PNs are changed in such a way that PNs that share the same resource and PNs that substitute for each other will have the same LLC.
- This step assumes that the initial LLCs and OPNs have already been created at steps 910 through 970 .
- the present invention begins to execute the a same procedure as shown and described at steps 910 and 920 . This results in each resource having the parts consuming that resource and the part's initial LLC. Now an iterative process is performed.
- the maximum number of iterations is specified in order to limit/fix the maximum possible running time of the steps implemented in the present invention in the event that there are undetected OPNs. In practice, the steps of the present invention almost always converges before the maximum number of iterations is reached.
- step 980 the following steps may be performed (as shown in FIG. 11 ):
- Step 1110 For each resource, go through the PNs that consume the resource.
- Step 1120 Identify the highest LLC within these PNs
- Step 1130 Bump (increment) or adjust the LLCs for all the PNs that share this resource to the highest LLC except OPNs.
- Step 1140 Recalculate the LLCs to be consistent with BOM dependencies of parts and sub parts by going through the entire BOM supply chain due to a violation or restriction.
- the recalculated LLC should be higher than or equal to the highest LLC adjusted in step 1130 for each capacity resource.
- Step 1150 Examine binning and material substitutions also to determine and execute necessary recalculations of LLCs due to these relationships.
- Step 1160 End iterations. If at any point bumping is determined to be unnecessary for all resources then all the LLCs have been adjusted in such a way that PNs that share the same resource have a same LLC and iterations are halted because of convergence.
- steps 1110 though 1130 The net result of steps 1110 though 1130 is to satisfy the desire for PNs in the same resource group having the same LLC. It is also noted that in step 1140 priority is given to BOM dependencies and binning and material substitution relationships to restore LLC requirements that may have been violated in steps 1110 though 1130 . Finally, step 1160 is a check to determine if the algorithm has converged. Step 980 may alternatively be implemented via linear programming providing the same results as described above.
- step 990 the computed modified LLCs are written and/or saved to an output file for use in the remaining production scheduling system.
- the present invention has been implemented on a IBM SP2 machine with AFS for data storage.
- the SP2 is a collection of IBM RISC 6000 systems running under a common AIX operating system.
- the steps implementing the present invention are preferably programmed in C/C++. It should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, however, that the present invention is not limited to the above implementation and is independent of the computer/system architecture. Accordingly, the present invention may equally be implemented on other computing platforms, programming languages and operating systems, and may also be hardwired into a circuit or other computational component.
- An alternative embodiment to the present invention relates to the use of linear programming techniques.
- a linear programming (LP) based approach can be used to generate LLCs.
- the LLC for each PN would be associated with a decision variable in the linear program.
- a PN A would be represented by decision variable LLC_A
- an LP formulation is defined by an objective function and a set of constraints.
- the objective function is a linear function of the linear programs decision variables which measures the quality of different feasible alternative values for the decision variables.
- the constraints are linear equations that must be satisfied by the decision variables and thus define feasible values of the decision variables (i.e., LLCs).
- Each constraint falls into one of two groups (i) BOM dependency constraints and (ii) Resource dependency constraints.
- the basic form of the two types of constraints is illustrated for some specific examples in FIG. 12 .
- the BOM dependency constraints are illustrated. These constraints require a component of a given PN having a higher LLC than the PN, itself.
- a binning and substitution example is illustrated in which PN A and PN B bin from PN C and, furthermore, PN B may substitute for PN A. Either the binning or substitution relationship indicates a need for constraints in 1220 .
- the resource dependency constraints are illustrated. In this case it is desirable to have PN A and PN B to have the same LLC, and PN B and PN C to have the same LLC, as represented by the equality constraints in 1230 . For an actual large-scale production planning and scheduling problem these various types of constraints together mathematically define the complex requirements that determine feasible values of the LLCs.
- the actual formulation of the LP uses the types of linear constraints illustrated in the examples of FIG. 12 (albeit on a much larger scale) together with an appropriately defined objective function.
- This objective function can be defined as the sum of the LLCs for all PNs. Solving the problem as a minimization problem (i.e. where the goal is to determine the minimum total value of the objective function subject to the given constraints) thus directing the solution to the LP towards a particular feasible solution with minimal values for the LLCs.
- the linear program involves determining the minimum value of the LLCs subject to the conditions that (i) all of the BOM dependency and resource dependency constraints are satisfied and (ii) the LLC decision variables are nonnegative.
- the latter constraints are due to the nonnegativity constraints common to LPs and familiar to those of skill in the art.
- This LP can be solved using existing LP methods such as those used in commercial LP solvers.
- FIG. 13 shows the new steps of the alternative approach to the present invention.
- the linear programming model is formulated according to the BOM and resource dependency constraints described in FIG. 13 .
- the resource dependency constraints associated with the oscillating parts are identified and left out of the linear programming formulation since they would lead to an infeasible LP.
- the resulting linear program is solved, and at 1370 the modified LLCs obtained from solving the linear program are output for use in MRP and BCD steps of the production and scheduling system.
