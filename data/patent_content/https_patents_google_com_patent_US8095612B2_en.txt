- the ranking server 118 and the mail server 120 may be integrated into a single hardware thus providing both the functionality of ranking messages and managing email clients such as 108 .
- FIG. 2 various hardware and software components associated with the computing devices 102 and the ranking server 118 are illustrated.
- Each of the computing devices such as the computer 104 may include, apart from other things, a memory 202 , an operating system 204 , application programs 208 and other applications 210 .
- standard hardware such as a processor, I/O devices and other components may be a part of the computing device 102 as know in the art.
- the computer 104 may enable the user 128 (i.e., recipient) to access the email client 108 in FIG. 2 and view all received messages from other users (i.e., senders). Likewise, the user 128 may send messages to another user A. In this case, the user 128 will act as a sender and the user A will act as a recipient.
- an email client similar to the email client 108 may be installed at the end of user X.
- the email client 108 in FIG. 2 may include a collating facility 212 , a messaging facility 214 and a presentation facility 218 .
- the messaging facility 214 may facilitate the delivery of outgoing messages and receipt of incoming messages to the ranking server 118 . Furthermore, the messaging facility 214 may be coupled to a network interface 220 for exchanging information with other devices such as the ranking server 118 , the mail server 120 and the Internet 124 . It may be noted that the ranking server 118 may adjust one or more fields associated with standard email exchange protocols to communicate a rank to the email client. Standard protocols, such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), IMAP, and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and the like are contemplated herein. In an example, the IMAP protocol includes a “category” field that may be used by the ranking server 118 to communicate the rank to the email client plug-in software so that the rank may be displayed by the email client.
- PPP Point-to-Point Protocol
- IMAP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- the IMAP protocol includes a “category” field that may be used by the ranking server 118 to communicate the rank to the email client plug-in software so that the rank may be displayed by
- the messaging facility 214 associated with the email client 108 as shown in FIG. 2 may perform a plurality of tasks including extracting scores associated with outgoing messages and providing them to the ranking server 118 . These scores may be utilized for computing new scores for the email address so that subsequent messages (hereinafter interchangeably referred to as ‘second set of messages’ from the same email address may be associated with the new scores.
- Any of the collating facility 212 , the messaging facility 214 , the presentation facility 218 or any combination or sub-portion thereof may be configured as a plug-in that can be installed to work cooperatively with the email client 108 , such as to provide an integrated interface that conforms with the native interface of the email client 108 .
- the ranking server 118 may include a memory 222 , an operating system 224 , application programs 228 , other application programs 228 , and other applications 230 . Additionally, the ranking server 118 may be configured to implement the algorithms for ranking of messages received by a communication facility 232 .
- the communication facility 232 may be associated with an analysis facility 234 . Analysis of emails may be performed by aggregating the emails from all the email clients such as the computer 104 , the laptop 110 , the PDA 112 and the cellphone 114 related to the ranking server 118 .
- the analysis facility 234 may execute ranking of algorithms and/or sets of rules for ranking the messages received from all email clients 108 .
- the rank may be in the form of a score, an attribute, a numeric value or some other type of parameter or meta-data. These scores may be assigned for each user 128 for a definite time period. The time period may be a day, a week, a month or some other type of time period. In addition, these scores may change over time according to a decay factor that may be predefined, user defined, automatically determined, and the like.
- the ranking server 118 may compute ranks for each message associated with the email client 108 and may provide a score to it. As described herein and elsewhere, the ranking server 118 may aggregate messages from different email clients 108 and accumulate them in one place. Subsequently, each message may be analyzed by the analysis facility 234 to obtain a score. For example, X 1 represents a first user and may have an email address E 1 ; similarly, X 2 corresponds to a second user with an email address E 2 ; likewise, a third user X 3 may have an email address E 3 .
- the first user X 1 may exchange messages with the second user X 2 and the third user X 3 ; based on this exchange, the ranking server 118 may determine a score for users X 2 and X 3 and assign these scores to the email address E 2 of the second user X 2 and the email address E 3 of the third user X 3 , respectively.
- the second user X 2 may exchange messages with the first user X 1 thus assigning a score to the first user X 1 (email address E 1 ).
- the third user X 3 may still have a score associated with it based on the messages exchanged with X 1 and X 2 .
- one or more new/unknown users who are exchanging messages with the existing/known user, may be provided with a score. This score may be computed based on the interaction of the new user with the existing users. Thus, one or more new users may have a ‘cold start,’ and subsequently as they exchange messages with the other existing users, a score may be determined and assigned to these new users, who eventually integrate with the existing users.
- the ranking sever 118 may dynamically update the score for each user after each interaction based on a predetermined algorithm and/or on a fixed rule.
- the interaction of the user may be a user's response to a received message.
- the interaction of the user may be a history of responses of the user to messages (i.e., hereinafter interchangeably referred to as other messages) that were received by the user previously.
- An algorithm for determining a rank may measure how quickly a user performs certain actions on a message and correlates this measure to determine importance of the message to that specific user.
- a global parameter know as SWAY that measures a global importance of each email address and may represent an influence across all measured instances of an email address.
- SWAY may be a measure of a quantity of influence weighted by the strength of the influence, discounting all points of influence that do not reach a minimal importance threshold level (e.g., 30% importance).
- SWAY may be calculated by taking a value of importance of a first email address (or first user) to others (50% to user 2 , 90% to user 3 , 1% to user 4 ), and for each value above the importance threshold (e.g.
- SWAY may be calculated each time a message is ranked, may be calculated when certain messages are ranked, may be calculated from time to time, and the like. A new user may be assigned a default SWAY.
- SWAY may be important because (i) it accounts for quality through the importance of a first user to other users as well as the importance of the other users to others, (ii) it discounts noise from spammers who might otherwise game the system by accumulating bits of SWAY, and (iii) it distributes all the tallies linearly from 0 to 100 by representing the answer in terms of a percentile, so that it can depict real variance in the results (e.g. a tally difference of only 5% can yield a SWAY difference of 20 percentile).
- the sender information may be a user-defined score of the sender. In this case, all messages received from this sender may be provided with the user-defined score. In embodiments, the sender information may be a predetermined score for the sender.
- the ranking server 118 may have earlier determined a score of high/low/medium for sender X (or ranked sender X on a scale of 1 to 5) for an email that is received from sender X and destined for the user. Now, when sender X sends another email to the same user, the ranking server 118 may attach this pre-determined score to the email and deliver it to the email client 108 .
- the plurality of parameters utilized by the ranking server 118 may include the recipient address (i.e., the recipient marked in the ‘To’ field of the email), the addresses of recipients who are copied in the email (i.e., the recipients marked in the ‘CC’ field of the email), the addresses of the recipients who have been marked in BCC, number of recipients, priority attached with the message, time of sending/receiving the message, content in the subject field of the message, sender score (i.e., sender information), and sender's ITM (Importance To Me), subject ITM, and the like.
- the ranking sever 118 may increase the score of the first user X 1 which may increase the message rank.
- the ranking server 118 may increase the score of the sender.
- these parameters may also be used to increase the authenticity of the recipient, if the sender is an authentic source.
- the score of the recipient may also be increased using any of the parameters described herein.
- the ranking server 118 may examine a message subject to distinguish potentially important messages from potentially less important messages.
- An example of such a distinction includes determining the importance of a first message with “There is a problem with your order” as the subject compared a second message with “Thank you for your order” as the subject.
- the first message may be assigned a higher score than the second message because the second message may be of a more informational nature than the first message.
- the sender score may be a function of the frequency of user's action on the received message. For example, if the user frequently (or always) deletes the email messages received from a sender X, then the score of the sender X may be reduced. Alternatively, if the user frequently (or always) replies to one or more email messages received from a sender Y, then the score of the sender Y may be increased. In other embodiments, the sender score may be a function of the recentness of the received message.
- the frequency of the user's action may include an open email rate, a reply email rate, a delete email rate, rate of click-through of the hyperlinks received in an email, rate of download of the graphics, filing or archiving rate, and the like.
- a prompt action by the first user X 1 on the received email may increase the rank of the message and therefore of the sender's importance to me (ITM). This may also impact the sender's global SWAY because individual ITM values impact global SWAY. Likewise, if the second user X 2 regularly deletes the email from a particular receipt, the authenticity of the sender falls and finally the user may be classified a spammer.
- ITM sender's importance to me
- the user 128 may add different personalization features by altering the set rules that decide the score.
- the user 128 may define a threshold score; this score may be utilized in deciding whether the message may be spam or non-spam. For example, the user 128 may consider software update information from a particular organization to be spam and may therefore define a much higher cut-off score for such messages to indicate this.
- the ranking server 118 may be highly scalable thus allowing personalization for each user.
- the algorithm implemented on the ranking server 118 may be configured to provide computational ability in view of the high volume of traffic, messages and the like.
- the ranking server 118 may be capable of optimizing the usage of memory such as RAM, flash memory, virtual memory for creation of plurality of data structures including stacks, trees, graphs, linked list and the like.
- the memory management scheme may be altered to facilitate the optimization of the memory scheme.
- the ranking server 118 may utilize the same memory management scheme as provided by the server software and/or the techniques well known in the art.
- the ranking server 118 may be capable of calculating the score based on the participation of a subset of users.
- the subset of users may exchange messages with other non-participating users; since the score for each user may be computed on the total number of message exchanges with the subset of participating users, the score for the non-participating users may still be updated.
- the ranking server 118 may be configured with the mail server 120 thus reducing the load.
- the mail server 120 may be relieved of the process of identifying some spam emails because the ranking server 118 would already have given the spam email a low rank.
- a plurality of servers may be utilized for distributing the load and thus creating a server farm or server cluster.
- a graph of user interactions along with SWAY, ITM, and TALLY for the users depicts elements used to compute the score associated with each user.
- U 1 302 , U 2 304 , U 3 308 , U 4 310 and U 5 312 each represent a user and data corresponding a rank. It may be appreciated that the number of users shown in FIG. 3 are exemplary, and the number may increase or decrease depending upon the actual number of users.
- community interaction of the user with other users may be gathered and recorded.
- the email client 108 may monitor (and hence gather) a user interactions with the other users.
- U 1 302 is initially considered as an authentic user, then an exchange of messages with other users as shown in FIG. 3 may increase the score of U 2 304 and U 3 308 .
- the analysis facility 234 may decrease the score of the user represented by user data U 5 312 if the messages originating from this user are continuously deleted by other users.
- users whose messages are responded to quickly by a recipient e.g. a user's boss, wife, and the like
- the process 400 for ranking messages may be implemented in the memory of the ranking server 118 .
- the process 400 may be initiated by creating a data structure such as graph, linked list, tree and the like for all the users. It may be noted that the ranking server 118 may be a specialized server with memories for creating data structures of large sizes.
- the process 400 may identify the email address of each user and the score associated with it and gather the interaction of a recipient with the community.
- a message, destined for the recipient may be received from a sender at the email client at step 404 . This message may be forwarded to the ranking server 118 in order to update the score of the sender and prepare a rank for the message.
- the ranking server may determine the new score of the sender and prepare a rank for the message based on sender information and the attributes of the received message. Each message from a sender may receive a different rank based on the contents of the message, the subject line, or other attributes of the received message.
- the score may be provided to the email client 108 at step 410 .
- the email client 108 may display the received message along with the score of the received message at a user interface associated with the email client 108 .
- the email client 108 may mark the message with the determined score, and then display it at the user interface. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the score may be displayed along with the message at the user interface using any other known techniques or third party email client interfaces.
- the user may control the display of the messages based on the rank or score provided therewith. In an example, the user may choose to display only messages with a rank score above 80.
- the user interface 500 may include a search facility 504 , an arrangement facility 508 , plurality of emails 510 , an indicator for read 514 and a score 518 provided from the ranking server 118 .
- the read indicator 514 may indicate if the email has been read by the recipient/user 128 .
- the score 518 may provide the score associated with a particular email. The score may be obtained from the ranking server 118 .
- the arrangement facility 508 may provide the arrangement of emails by name, type, date and the like.
- the search facility 504 may facilitate searching of emails received by the user 128 .
- the user interface 500 may be any third party email user interface such as those provided from MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, YAHOO, and the like.
- the ranking server 118 may be freely available to all the users.
- the ranking server may enable providing scores to each in order to facilitate a user separating the important emails from non-important emails.
- the ranking server may allow the user 128 to personalize the criteria for identification of important emails and non-important emails by initially defining the rules in the ranking algorithm. For example, the user 128 may input the most trusted email address as a starting point for execution of the ranking algorithm for personalization of scores. Alternatively, the user may define one or more spam email addresses for ranking these email recipients very low.
- the user 128 may operate the ranking server 118 with email services/accounts provided by YAHOO, HOTMAIL, GMAIL and the like.
- the user 128 may configure the email service accounts by registering with the ranking server 118 through a web interface. For example, the user 128 may access a registration page of the ranking server 128 and register his/her email accounts and addresses for availing the ranking/scoring of emails. The user 128 may then utilize scoring/ranking of email.
- the ranking server 118 may be configured into the email account of the user 128 such as Yahoo, Hotmail Gmail and the like.
- the user may access the corresponding tab/checkbox/link and the like, and initialize it for ranking/scoring emails.
- the tab may appear in the welcome page of the email recipient; the email recipient may click on the tab to initialize the ranking server 118 and thereafter receive emails with ranks/scores.
- a web interface may be provided to the user 128 ; the user may visit the web interface to register with the ranking server 118 .
- the web interface may be a webpage, a web client, an application program that interfaces with the ranking server 118 or some other type of web interface.
- the user 128 may visit the webpage and register with the ranking server 118 by filling in the required details. Subsequently, the user 128 may start receiving emails with scores indicating the relative importance of the emails.
- a registration may be free for any number of email addresses that the user may want to subscribe to.
- the user 128 may pay for one or more email addresses depending upon the categorizations of the user 128 . For example, if the user 128 is a student, the service may be provided free; for a professional, the registration may attract a nominal registration fee.
- user 128 may configure a plug-in, which may allow the user 128 to configure the ranking server 118 with the email clients such as MS OUTLOOK, EUDORA and the like.
- the plug-in may facilitate personalization of the scores by modification of the initial condition of the ranking algorithm. Additionally, the plug-in may also allow configuration of VoIP call that may be received by the recipient, and based on the identification of the called number, the ranking server 118 may score the calls.
- a software utility in cell phone 114 may be provided for ranking/scoring emails.
- a software utility may be configured into an IPHONE that may be integrated to the ranking server 118 , which may provide a score to the received emails at the recipient terminal.

- the ranking server 118 may provide high score for promotional emails sent by the registered marketers to the recipient. Subsequently, all the promotional/advertising/product and/or service trial emails delivered to the recipient's inbox may be accumulated together because of the same score/ranking. For example, an email from a registered advertiser relating to a free product trial may be given a score of 100, or an exceptional score such as “SPONSORED”.
- the email recipient may respond to this promotional/product trial email and in response an amount may be debited from the advertisers account for each response.
- the advertiser may be debited on one or more criteria including pay-per-click, successful download of the trial software, clicking on the download link, receiving a read receipt from the recipient, clicking on the email or some other type of criteria.
- a facilitator of the mail ranking invention may monetize its use.
- the ranking server 118 may optimize the score based on the history of prior clicks made on the promotional emails; the ranking server may then identify users that are likely to initiate action on promotional emails based on their past history. Scores for each user may be maintained at the ranking server 118 corresponding to each registered advertiser. In this scenario, the ranking server 118 may identify a list of such users for sending promotional emails. This would increase the likelihood of a high degree of responses.
- the email messages may be a more authentic form of promotion since the emails may be saved and may be accessed later. Furthermore, searches may be performed on the saved emails; the email may also be forwarded to other trusted users actively searching for a particular product and/or service trial.
