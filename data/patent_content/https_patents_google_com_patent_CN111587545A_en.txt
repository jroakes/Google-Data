Detailed Description
The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific embodiments and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.
Optical transmission networks are capable of providing extremely high bandwidth for data transmission. Today, optical transmission networks are responsible for transmitting a large part of all human and machine generated information. For example, optical transmission networks enable today's internet and communication networks. Optical transmission networks may communicate information over multiple optical links or "paths". In some cases, the optical link may fail due to a defect in the optical link. In the event of a link failure, traffic on the failed optical link may be rerouted to a different optical link, referred to as a rerouted link. It would therefore be beneficial to design an optical transport network to enable efficient rerouting of traffic along a rerouting link. In order to design an optical transmission network for efficient rerouting, it is important to accurately predict optical link performance and spectral efficiency along a potentially rerouted link. Accordingly, the system and method of the present disclosure provide an apparatus for analyzing the performance and spectral efficiency of optical links in an optical transmission network. These techniques may be used to simulate, design and analyze optical transmission networks.
In a typical optical transport network implementation, optical signals are introduced into an optical link at the start of the link by an end device such as a transmitter or line card. An optical signal may contain multiple channels, each assigned to a particular optical wavelength. The optical link may have one or more optical fiber amplifiers that are optical fibers doped with gain material for enhancing the optical signal as it propagates through the optical link. The fiber amplifier compensates for power loss of the optical signal as it propagates through the fiber. For the purposes of this disclosure, power is defined as a function of energy, which is a function of wavelength, by the relationship: power h ω/time h (c/λ)/(time), where h is the planck constant, ω is the angular frequency of the signal, λ is the wavelength of the signal, and c is the speed of light. Moreover, the angular frequency is related to the frequency by the following relationship: ω -2 pi f, where f is the frequency of the signal. Some modern high bandwidth optical transmission systems may use raman amplifiers and/or Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs). In an EDFA, an optical fiber is doped with a gain material, and pump laser light is injected into the optical fiber. In raman amplifiers, gain is achieved in a transmission fiber that is typically undoped. Terminal equipment such as a receiver is typically present at the end of the optical link. The terminal device converts/from the optical signal to/from the electrical signal.
After demodulating and converting the optical signal, the optical link performance may be expressed as a Bit Error Rate (BER) of the received signal. As an optical signal propagates through an optical link, its distortion and/or power loss may result in bit errors. Distortion may be caused by a variety of factors, such as signal noise, non-linear effects, and optical dispersion. The terminal device may correct some of these errors using Forward Error Correction (FEC). The performance of the FEC capability of the terminal device is expressed as a threshold BER that the terminal device can correct without leaving a large number of post-FEC errors. Expressing the optical link performance in terms of BER may have limited use in the analysis of optical transmission networks due to the dependence of BER on the terminal equipment. In some cases, fiber nonlinearities caused by the sensitivity of the refractive index of the fiber glass to the instantaneous power of the optical signal passing through the glass can be particularly complex to calculate when considered as a penalty to the BER domain. In other cases, the BER of a particular optical link may vary widely depending on the particular transmitter and/or receiver used. For example, end-point devices employing coherent detection may be able to compensate for the chromatic and polarization mode dispersion of optical signals caused by the optical fibers of an optical link, and thus optical networks using coherent line cards typically do not require dispersion compensation modules along the optical fibers. Thus, certain noise sources in the link, such as high symbol (baud) rates (bits/second), spectral shaping at the transmitter of the terminal device, and equalization processes at the receiver of the terminal device, may be considered negligible.
Measuring the performance of the terminal device in terms of optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) rather than BER may allow for easier calculations when considering fiber nonlinearities. The OSNR can be defined as the signal-to-noise ratio over a given reference bandwidth, typically 0.1 nm. The reference bandwidth is independent of noise in terms of modulation format, frequency and receiver type of the terminal device. Therefore, the OSNR does not depend on the variation of modulation format, frequency, and receiver type between terminal devices.
Thus, predicting the performance of the terminal device may be done by predicting the OSNR of the optical signal when it reaches the receiver. If the receiver employs coherent detection, the noise contributed by the high symbol (baud) rate, spectral shaping, and equalization can be represented as an additive gaussian white noise source. This may simplify the prediction of the end device performance by reducing the complexity of the factorial analysis of the fiber non-linearity. Therefore, using the OSNR value to predict the performance of the optical link may reduce the impact of variations between end devices on the results.
The OSNR of the entire optical link can be described as the effective OSNR, which is defined as:
wherein, OSNRTXIs the OSNR contributed by the transmitter and node multiplex structure of the terminal equipment upon entering the optical fiber of the optical link, the OSNRLINIs a contribution of an amplifier of an optical link, OSNRNLIs a contribution of the non-linearity of the fiber, OSNRRXIs a contribution of the receiver and node demultiplexing structure of the terminal equipment, and OSNRIMPIs a contribution of a series of transmission impairments; such as chromatic dispersion, crosstalk, receiver power, polarization mode dispersion, and polarization dependent loss. As described above, when the OSNR is determined for link performance purposes, only the OSNR is calculatedLINAnd OSNRNLSince they are only optical linksAnd the remaining OSNR terms are functions of the terminal device.
The optical link may comprise a series of optical link elements, where each optical link element may comprise an amplifier followed by an optical transmission fiber. Determining the effective OSNR of an optical link may be accomplished by calculating the OSNR of each optical link elementLINAnd OSNRNLTo be implemented. However, since the OSNR is calculatedNLOf a system configured to compute OSNR using conventional methodsNLA significant amount of computation time may be required and additional hardware for predicting optical link performance may also need to be implemented within the system. For example, the OSNR can be calculated for each optical link element by using a step Fourier methodNLAdditional Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are typically required for acceleration. One aspect of the present disclosure provides a system and method that may reduce the calculation of OSNR for each optical link elementNLThe required computational resources. Therefore, the system and method can calculate the OSNR more quicklyNLWithout the need for additional or dedicated hardware to accelerate the process.
Fig. 1 shows a system 100 for analyzing an optical transmission network according to an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. The system 100 includes a processor 110 and a computer readable memory 115 connected by a system bus 116. In some implementations, the processor 110 is a Central Processing Unit (CPU). In some embodiments, processor 110 is a General Purpose Processor (GPP). In some implementations, the processor 110 is a programmable processor, such as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The processor 110 executes a linear module 112, a nonlinear module 113, and an optical link performance module 114. These modules represent processing logic, and each component may be implemented as hardware, such as circuitry and dedicated logic, or software executing on processor 110. The processor 110 is configured to receive optical link data associated with a given optical link and store the optical link data in the computer-readable memory 115. In some embodiments, the processor 110 receives optical link data for a plurality of optical links. In some embodiments, the optical link data includes a number of optical link elements within a given optical link. Each optical link element may include an amplifier coupled to an optical fiber. The amplifier may comprise one or more of a raman amplifier and an Erbium Doped Fibre Amplifier (EDFA). In some embodiments, the optical link data includes a length of optical fiber of each optical link element. The processor 110 is also configured to receive terminal device data associated with a terminal device, e.g., a transmitter, receiver, and/or transceiver, at an endpoint of a given optical link. The terminal device data may include the OSNR due to the transmitter, the OSNR due to the receiver, the OSNR required by the terminal device, and the link margin. The required OSNR refers to the maximum amount of noise that the terminal device, as expressed by the OSNR, can compensate without a large number of errors after forward error correction. The optical link margin refers to an excess of linear OSNR, which means a greater linear OSNR than originally needed and serves to eliminate an increase in loss of the optical link element over its lifetime. The terminal device data is stored in the computer readable memory 115.
The processor 110 is configured to receive amplifier characteristics associated with one or more types of amplifiers. Amplifier characteristics may include, for example, but are not limited to: the amount of self-raman scattering caused by the fiber of a given raman amplifier; given a wavelength-dependent, power-dependent, gain-dependent gain shape of the raman amplifier; given the wavelength-dependent, power-dependent, gain-dependent noise figure of the raman amplifier; wavelength-dependent, power-dependent, gain-dependent gain shapes for EDFAs; and/or wavelength-dependent, power-dependent, gain-dependent noise figure for a given EDFA. In the present disclosure, the term "noise figure" refers to the reduction in SNR caused by the components of a given amplifier compared to an ideal amplifier.
The processor 110 is configured to receive the transmission fiber characteristic. The transmission fiber characteristics include information about the performance and physical properties of the transmission fiber of the optical link element. The transmission fiber characteristics may include, for example, without limitation, attenuation as a function of frequency, raman gain coefficient as a function of frequency difference, chromatic dispersion slope, and nonlinear coefficient.
In some embodiments, the processor 110 is configured to receive the operating parameters of each optical link element within a given optical link and store them in the computer-readable memory 115. In some embodiments, the processor 110 is configured to cause the linearity module 112 to determine the operating parameters of each optical link element within a given optical link based on a set of design rules. In some embodiments, the operating parameters include a desired amplifier type and a desired transmit power. Amplifier types may include raman amplifiers and EDFAs. Some amplifiers employed in optical transmission networks may use pump lasers to amplify optical signals propagating through the amplifiers. Thus, launch power refers to the amount of signal power that the amplifier launches into the optical link element, i.e., the transmission fiber. EDFA parameters such as gain and variable optical attenuator settings may be derived from the desired transmit power. In some embodiments, the design rules include fiber type, optical link element length, and unit loss. The optical fiber type refers to the type of optical fiber used in the optical link element. For example, optical fiber types may include several types of optical fibers used in optical transmission networks, such as single mode optical fibers (SMF), Dispersion Shifted Fibers (DSF), non-zero dispersion shifted fibers (NZDSF), and Ultra Large Area Fibers (ULAF). Optical link element length refers to the length of optical fiber used in the optical link element; hereinafter referred to as "span length". In some embodiments, the length is in kilometers (km). Unit loss refers to the amount of power a signal loses as it propagates through a given length of an optical link element; the given length is for example 1 km. In some embodiments, the unit loss is measured in decibels per kilometer (dB/km). In some embodiments, the linearity module 112 is configured to derive the design rule based on a plurality of inputs. The following discusses the design rules with reference to fig. 2 and 3. The processor 110 is further configured to store the determined operating parameters and the derived design rules in the computer-readable memory 115.
The linearity module 112 is configured to receive operating parameters, input power profiles, transmission fiber characteristics, and amplifier characteristics from the computer readable memory 115. Based on the operating parameters, the input power profile, the transmission fiber characteristics, and the amplifier characteristics, the linearity module 112 is configured to calculate a linear OSNR and output power profile of the optical signal as it exits each optical link element in a given optical link. The calculation of linear OSNR is further discussed with reference to fig. 2 and 3. Linear OSNR represents the contribution of the amplifier of an optical link element to the overall effective OSNR of the entire optical link. The output power distribution or power spectral density refers to the power of an optical signal as it leaves an optical link element, as a function of wavelength. Thus, the output power profile of an optical link element represents the input power profile of the next successive optical link element. The output profile and linear OSNR of each optical link element of a given optical link are stored in a computer readable memory 115.
For each optical link element, the linearity module 112 receives or calculates operating parameters based on information available to the optical link element. The operating parameters may include the amplifier type and the transmit power per channel of each optical link element. The calculation of the operating parameters is described below with reference to fig. 3. Once the linearity module 112 receives/calculates the transmit power per channel for each optical link element, it can calculate the power transfer (transfer) between the different frequencies (i.e., channels) of the optical signal resulting from raman scattering as the signal propagates through the optical fiber of the optical link element and the power loss caused by propagating through the optical fiber. Power transfer and power loss are described by the following system of coupled nonlinear differential equations:ZPK(z)＝-αKPK(z)-∑m＜kgk，mPm(z)PK(z)+∑n＞kgn，k(fk/fn)Pn(z)Pk(z), where z represents the forward propagation direction in length (expressed in km), PkExpressed in frequency fkChannel power centered (expressed in units of W), αkExpressed at a frequency fkThe unit propagation loss (expressed in l/km), gm，nRepresenting the slave frequency fmTo fnWherein the gain coefficient may correspond to a raman gain of the optical fiber of the optical link element caused by self-raman scattering occurring when the optical signal propagates through the optical fiber. The gain factor is known, andand based on the particular fiber type used within the optical link element. In some embodiments, the optical transport network uses polarization multiplexing optics for both long-range and metropolitan optical networks. In that case, the gain factor used is preferably the average of the gain factors for the same and orthogonal polarizations. If the only data available is the co-polarized gain factor, half of the co-polarized gain factor can be used since in practice the orthogonal polarized gain factor is usually much smaller.
After accounting for power transfer and power loss, the linearity module 112 may calculate the linear OSNR contributed by the amplifier in each optical link element by using the relationship NF 58-OSNR, where OSNR and NF are both expressed in dB. First, the linearity module 112 determines the noise figure and gain factor of the amplifiers in each optical link. Depending on the type of amplifier used specifically in the optical link element under consideration.
If the optical link element contains a Raman amplifier, the linearity module 112 may calculate the linear OSNR due to Raman amplification. For the fiber type of the fiber link element, the raman gain coefficient due to raman amplification in the raman amplifier can be expressed as GR(λ，LS，LP). The raman amplifier effect is captured by a series of steps. First, if G is known0，G0Associated with the amplifier raman gain coefficient corresponding to a maximum input frequency (e.g., the resonant frequency of the raman amplifier), the linearity module 112 can calculate the pump point loss L associated with the maximum input frequencyP，EFFSo that G is0＝＜GR(λ，Ls，LP，EFF) > (ii). Function H (L) is interpolated by using spline interpolation or other forms of interpolation such as polynomial interpolationP)＝GR(λ，Ls，LP) Extrapolate to value G0To complete the solution of the pump point loss value. If the Raman gain G0Unknown, the linear module 112 uses a pump point loss of 0.5 dB.
The linearity module 112 may determine the unit loss by deriving design rules, or in the case of brown mode operation, the system 112 may receive operational parametersNumber (and hence design rule) is determined per unit loss. With known unit loss and pump point loss, the linearity module 112 can determine the allowed raman gain (based on the maximum power allowed after the raman amplifier, and the fiber type, unit loss, and pump loss). For a set of data points { λREF，LS，REF，LP，REFProvide Raman gain and noise figure, whereREFIs a set of reference wavelengths; l iss，REFIs a set of reference fiber unit loss values; l isP，REFIs a set of reference point loss values. The linearity module 112 may perform interpolation based on Delaunay triangulation to find the expectation (L) of fiber unit loss and pump point loss, respectivelySAnd LP) Three reference points with the closest values and linearly interpolating them to extract the raman gain and noise index waveforms as L for the expectationSAnd LPLambda of valueREFAs a function of (c). The linearity module 112 may interpolate the waveform to the desired input wavelength using a cubic spline interpolator or other form of interpolation to find the raman gain and noise figure for the desired input wavelength (e.g., transmit power).
For optical link elements including EDFAs, the linearity module 112 may perform calculations similar to those done for raman amplifiers. The linearity module 112 may determine a target EDFA gain based on targeting the maximum possible output power after the EDFA gain block and then use a variable optical attenuator at the output of the EDFA (typically a VOA present in the EDFA) to fill down to the target transmit power of the next optical link element. This configuration reduces the noise figure of the EDFA and improves the link performance by up to 1 dB. For a set of data points { λREF，GREF，POUT，REFTilt provides the EDFA gain and noise figure, whereREFIs a set of reference wavelengths, GREFIs a set of reference EDFA gain values; pOUT，REFIs a set of reference EDFA output power values; tilt is the set gain slope across the amplification band. The linearity module 112 may perform interpolation based on Delaunay triangulation to find the desired (G)REF，POUT，REFTilt) value closest toAnd then linearly interpolated to extract the EDFA gain and noise figure waveforms as a function of the reference wavelength for the desired value. The waveform is then interpolated to the desired wavelength value using a cubic spline interpolator or other form of interpolator. An example method of calculating the linear OSNR is described below with reference to fig. 3.
Once the noise figure for each amplifier is determined, the linearity module 112 may calculate the linear OSNR attributed to each optical link element using the previously described relationship between noise figure and OSNR. The linearity module 112 may store the linear OSNR contribution of each optical link element in the computer readable memory 115.
The nonlinear module 113 is configured to receive from the computer readable memory 115 the output power profile and the linear OSNR of each optical link element of a given optical link, where the output power profile of an optical link element represents the input power profile of the next successive optical link element in the optical link. The nonlinear module 113 is configured to calculate an output nonlinear OSNR for each optical link element in a given optical link based on the linear OSNR, the input power profile, and the transmission fiber characteristics associated with each optical link element. In some embodiments, the output nonlinear OSNR is calculated using a waltzerlan series propagation operator. In some embodiments, the non-linearity module 113 may compute two Volterra series runs. In some embodiments, the output nonlinear OSNR is calculated using a step fourier propagation operator. In some embodiments, the non-linear module 113 may be configured to treat the non-linear effect as a perturbation (perturbation) element in the overall electric field of the signal. Details related to the calculation of the nonlinear OSNR using the waltzerland series propagation operator and/or the step fourier propagation operator are discussed further below with reference to fig. 2. The nonlinear OSNR calculated at the output of each optical link element for a given optical link is stored in a computer readable memory 115.
In some embodiments, the non-linear module 113 may be configured to treat the non-linear effect as a perturbation element in the overall signal electric field. Thus, the total (vector) field after transmission can be defined as ETOTAL＝ELIN+ENL＝ELIN+∑KENL，KWherein the optical link elements are summed and the nonlinear field is decomposed into a sum of each optical link element component. The nonlinear power spectral density produced by the fiber is then expressed as PNL＝|ENL|2＝|∑kENL，X|2＝∑m，nE*NL，mENL，n＝∑k|ENL，k|2+∑m≠nRe(E*NL，mENL，n) Wherein all terms in the two addition operations are at k √ PNL，m√PNL，nWhere k is a correlation coefficient between the pair of consecutive optical link elements (which may take a value between-1 and + 1), and k is purely a function of the difference in Chromatic Dispersion (CD) state between the pair of consecutive optical link elements (i.e., k (CD)m-CDn) In which CDmIs the chromatic dispersion at the beginning of the optical link element (m), while CDnIs the chromatic dispersion at the beginning of the optical link element (n). The correlation coefficient function k has the following properties: (1) when CD is 0, k has a value of 1 (i.e., for a resonant continuous optical link element); (2) k decays to 0 at very high dispersion (i.e., for decorrelated continuous optical link elements). Thus, the nonlinear power spectral density of an optical link takes the form: pNL＝|ENL|2＝|∑kENL，k|2＝∑m，nE*NL，mENL，n＝∑m，nk(CDm-CDn)√PNL，m√PNL，n。
Nonlinear schrodinger equation (NLSE) can be used to describe the propagation of a signal through an optical fiber. The non-linear module 113 using a Woltela series propagation operator may decompose the NLSE using a Woltela series transformation function. This results in a non-linear electric field equal to:
ENL(ω)＝∫∫∫H3(ω，ω1，ω2)E(ω1)E*(ω2)E(ω-ω1+ω2)dω1dω2dz。
H3use of representations in field Voltara series expansionThe third order Voltara nucleus. This expression provides an approximation of the electrical waveform with relatively high accuracy. The third order walterra kernel of the integral takes the form:
∫H3(ω，ω1，ω2)dz＝-(γ/α)[1-exp{(-α/2+iβ2Δ′Ω)/L}]/√[1+{ΔΩβ2/α)2]＝η(ΔΩ)
wherein: Δ Ω ═ ω - ω1)(ω-ω2)。
γ is the nonlinear coefficient of the fiber, α is the loss coefficient of the fiber, β2Is the second order group velocity dispersion, and L is the length of the fiber in a given optical element β2Is a constant parameter but may be different for each center frequency of interest.
In some embodiments, the non-linearity module 113 may be configured to calculate the non-linear power spectral density at a given frequency ω under the assumption that any given pair of contiguous optical link elements has uncorrelated frequency components. This assumption may be valid because optical signals in many optical transmission networks experience sufficient dispersion when propagating through optical fibers. In this case, the nonlinear power spectral density of a given fiber is denoted SNL(ω)＝∫∫|η(Δ′Ω)|2S(ω1)S(ω2)S(ω-ω1+ω2)dω1dω2Where integrals can be discretized with sufficient resolution (in the order of 1 GHz) and computed as a sum of large two-dimensional array elements.
The non-linear module 113 may use efficient numerical integration with the property of controlling the integration error to an arbitrary magnitude. That is, to enable calculation of the nonlinear power spectral density to estimate the integral, three components are considered. These components include S (ω)1)S(ω2)，S(ω-ω1+ω2) And | η (Δ) shunt2. These expressions are treated as two-dimensional arrays, which allow the computation of the power spectral density to be performed as a combination of subarray extraction, element-by-element multiplication, and array summation.
These items may be processed sequentially. First, by forming a one-dimensional array S (ω)1) Tensor product with itself (i.e. VV)TIf V is an Nx1 array [ S (ω)1)]) Obtained from S (ω)1)S(ω2) A defined matrix (hereinafter matrix a). This term remains constant for all values of ω. If the selected frequency grid requires N sample coverages [ -B ]oPT/2+BOPT/2]Then the matrix size NxN may be preferred. Can be obtained by combining the array S (omega)1) Is tiled into a matrix to obtain a matrix S (ω - ω)1+ω2) (hereinafter referred to as matrix B). The matrix is symmetrical about a first diagonal thereof and may be selected to span BOPrXBOPT(i.e., its size is NxN). Matrix M0Corresponding to matrix B where ω is 0. In the process of mixing M0The coefficient in (transform) transforms the number of samples corresponding to the actual value of ω (this is by M)0Is performed with the permutated matrix) and then zeroes out coefficients outside the expected product support range, the desired matrix M can be obtained. The matrix Δ ═ (ω - ω)1)(ω-ω2)＝ω2-ω(ω1+ω2)+ω1ω2A matrix sum can be generated as the following three terms: omega2Is a constant (for each channel selected), ω (ω)1+ω2) Is a scalar and a fixed matrix omega1+ω2Product of, ω1ω2Is the tensor product of the obtained array of frequencies as in matrix A. matrix | η (Δ' Ω) & gtdoes not calculation2(hereinafter referred to as matrix C) can be obtained by element-by-element matrix operation.
A typical matrix size can be estimated as follows: when considering the guard band between the C-band and the L-band, a typical C + L transmit spectrum is estimated to be 9.6THz, i.e., about 10 THz. Assuming a resolution of 1GHz, the matrix size is 104X104I.e. about one hundred million coefficients.
If (in baseband) the spectrum is characterized as [ -Bo [ ]PT/2+BOPT/2]Then in space (ω)1，ω2) The integration region (understood in a topological sense as the support for the function to be integrated) in (a) may preferably satisfy the following condition: (1) -Bopt/2. ltoreq. omega1≤Bopt/2；(2)-Bopt/2≤ω2Bopt/2 is less than or equal to; and (3) -Bopt/2. ltoreq. omega. -omega1+ω2Bopt/2 is less than or equal to. The method allows the calculation of the nonlinear SNR contribution of a single optical link element. However, while the use of the Waltera propagation operator may not be well suited to determine the absolute amount of nonlinear noise, it is well suited to calculate the relative change.
Thus, in some embodiments, the non-linearity module 113 may compute two Volterra series runs. In run 1, the average transmit power is set to span P by using a flat power profile (i.e., the output power profile of each optical link element calculated by the linearity module 112)0To calculate SNL0(ω). In run 2, S is calculated using the actual output power distribution calculated by the linearity module 112NL，1(ω). Then, the number P (ω) ═ S is calculatedNL，1(ω)/SNL，0(ω)]1/3This number indicates the amount of offset that the environment of a given channel (with respect to the average power per channel) exhibitsP2dB, it may mean that the channel is suffering a non-linear penalty (since wavelength depends on the transmit distribution) that is substantially equal to a flat transmit power distribution, but 2dB higher.
Then, it is possible to operate by using the calibration generated by the step-by-step method (for a signal with a flat transmission power P)REFAnd an effective length LEFF，REFOptical link elements) to calculate a nonlinear SNR for each optical link element, where the SNR value is equal to the SNRNLREF(ω). In some embodiments, the calibration run is performed by using a step fourier propagation operator. The nonlinear SNR is defined as SN when using the step Fourier propagation operatorRNL(ω)＝P0P(ω)/PREF]-2[LEFF/LEFF，REF]-2SNRNL，REF(ω). Thus, a calibration run may be performed using a single reference run for each fiber type. The calibration run can be set with high accuracy, which means that the maximum non-linear phase accumulation over a single step of the step is set to 10-5Radian, and even smaller.
As a result of these relationships, one canTo calculate the nonlinear OSNR for the optical link by the following steps. First, a nonlinear OSNR waveform of each optical link element is calculated. In some embodiments, the nonlinear OSNR waveform for each optical link element may be calculated in parallel. This is due to the fact that: the equations for the nonlinear power spectrum allow decoupling between the optical link elements. The contribution of each optical link element can be derived separately and then recombined to obtain the contribution of the entire optical link by the correlation coefficient. The correlation data may be generated by a series of 2-span interference simulations. In the simulation, the transmitted signal can be set to a high dispersion value (on the order of 10 ns/nm). This may ensure that the nonlinear OSNR generated by the two optical link elements is almost the same. The chromatic dispersion between two optical link elements is swept away and the artificially set nonlinear OSNR is compared with the nonlinear OSNR of a single optical link element. In addition, for each optical link element, S may be usedNL(ω)＝∫∫|η(Δ′Ω)|2S(ω1)S(ω2)S(ω-ω1+ω2)dω1dω2To calculate the nonlinear OSNR value for a given optical link element and a given channel as a discrete integral, where the contribution term is expressed as a two-dimensional array, by calculation ∑m，nk(CDm-CDn)√PNL，m√PNL，nThese values are aggregated to calculate the nonlinear OSNR per wavelength value for the entire link.
The use of a Woltela series propagation operator may allow several benefits to be realized. First, the non-linear module 113 may be implemented on commercial CPU hardware, since the computation may be simplified enough that specialized computation hardware is not necessary. Moreover, further reductions in computation and complexity may be achieved when only data associated with a subset of channels (i.e., one out of every six channels) is received. Therefore, the design system can achieve a reduction in cost while reducing the calculation time.
The optical link performance module 114 is configured to retrieve the end device data, the calculated nonlinear OSNR for each optical link element, the generated linear OSNR for each optical link element, and the generated output power profile for each optical link element from the computer readable memory 115. The optical link performance module 114 is configured to calculate an expected performance metric at the output of a given optical link based on the nonlinear OSNR of each optical link element, the linear OSNR of each optical link element, and the output OSNR of the transmitter connected to the optical link. The expected performance metric may be calculated based on the linear OSNR, the non-linear OSNR, and the transmitter output OSNR. In some embodiments, the expected performance metric may be calculated as the sum of the respective noise contributions of each aspect of the optical link expressed by the OSNR value. In general, the noise contribution can be expressed as the inverse of the OSNR value. Thus, for example, the expected performance metric may be calculated as the sum of the inverse of the linear OSNR, the nonlinear OSNR, the transmitter OSNR of the transmitter connected to the optical link, and the receiver OSNR of the receiver connected to the optical link. If the expected performance metric is greater than or equal to the performance metric threshold, the optical link performance module 114 designates the optical link as being active for use within the optical transport network. In some embodiments, the expected performance matrix is the effective OSNR and the performance metric threshold is the desired OSNR. A valid link represents an optical link that is expected to deliver an optical signal to a terminal device that will meet the BER threshold of the terminal device (i.e., the number of BERs that the terminal device can FEC without significant post-FEC errors). If the expected performance metric is less than the performance metric threshold, the optical link performance module 114 determines that the optical link is not being used within the optical transport network. An invalid link represents an optical link that is expected to deliver an optical signal to a terminal device that does not meet the BER threshold of the terminal device, and therefore, serious post-FEC errors may occur in the optical transmission network.
Fig. 2 is a flowchart of a method 200 of analyzing an optical transport network according to an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. Method 200 includes generating a linear OSNR (stage 202), generating a non-linear OSNR (stage 204), determining an expected performance (stage 206), and determining whether the expected performance is less than a performance threshold (decision block 207). If it is determined that the expected performance is not less than the performance threshold, method 200 further includes designating the link as active (stage 208). If it is determined that the expected performance is less than the performance threshold, method 200 further includes designating the link as invalid (stage 209). The method 200 may be performed, for example, by the system 100 for analyzing an optical transmission network.
The method 200 includes generating a linear OSNR (stage 202). The processor 110 causes the linearity module 112 to generate a linear OSNR for each optical element in a given optical link. The linearity module 112 uses the input power profile, the amplifier characteristics, the transmission fiber characteristics, and the set of operating parameters to calculate the linear OSNR contribution for each optical link element. In some implementations, the processor 110 of the system 100 is configured to receive the amplifier characteristic. The output power profile represents the input power profile of the next optical link element of the optical link. The amplifier characteristics may include reference raman gain values for several input signal wavelengths, where raman gain is a function of fiber type, span unit loss, and pump point loss. Thus, depending on the type of fiber used in the optical link element, several reference raman gain values are received for several wavelengths. In some embodiments, these values have been predetermined based on experimental testing. In some embodiments, the amplifier characteristic comprises a reference EDFA gain value for several input signal wavelengths, wherein the EDFA gain is a function of the wavelength and the EDFA power output value. Thus, depending on the type of fiber used in the optical link element, several reference raman or EDFA gain values may be received for several wavelengths. The operating parameters may include a desired transmit power and a desired amplifier type (raman and/or EDFA). An example method of calculating the linear OSNR is described below with reference to fig. 3.
In some embodiments, the method 200 further comprises generating an output power profile. This includes generating an output power profile for each optical link element in a given optical link based on optical link element losses, raman scattering in the transmission fiber, and amplifier gain. For each optical link element, the linearity module 112 may use the optical link element loss and amplifier gain to determine the output power (i.e., output power profile) of each channel as the signal leaves each amplifier by utilizing the power transfer and power loss relationships described above. The linearity module 112 may store each output power profile in the computer readable memory 115.
The method 200 includes generating a non-linear OSNR (stage 204). This includes generating a nonlinear OSNR contribution for each optical link element based on the input power profile and the transmission fiber characteristics of the optical link element. The nonlinear OSNR represents an OSNR contributed by a refractive index change in an optical fiber caused by optical signal power. The nonlinear OSNR may be generated, for example, by the nonlinear module 113 of the system 100. The nonlinear module 113 can retrieve the input power profile and transmission fiber characteristics for each optical link element from the computer readable memory 115 and use them to generate a nonlinear OSNR for the entire optical link. In some embodiments, the non-linearity module 113 may use a Waltz series propagation operator and/or a step Fourier propagation operator to calculate the non-linear OSNR for the entire link.
In some embodiments, method 200 further comprises receiving terminal device data. The processor 110 is configured to receive data related to a terminal device used within a given link in an optical transport network. The terminal device data may include an OSNR of the terminal deviceIMP、OSNRTXROSNR, and its OSNR (margin) due to the optical link margin. The optical link margin refers to an excess of linear OSNR, which means a larger linear OSNR than originally needed, and serves to eliminate an increase in loss of the optical link element during its lifetime. These values are stored in computer readable memory 115.
If the expected performance is not less than the performance threshold metric, method 200 includesThe link is designated as active (stage 208). For a given channel at wavelength λ, if and only if OSNR'EFFAnd when the modulation format is larger than or equal to ROSNR, the link closing and the modulation format under test of the terminal equipment type of the link are realized. Thus, if the effective OSNR of an optical link is greater than or equal to ROSNR, the optical link performance module 114 designates the link as being effective. An effective optical link refers to an optical link that will deliver an optical signal to a terminal device that has a BER that the terminal device can FEC without leaving significant post-FEC errors.
If the expected performance is less than the performance threshold metric, method 200 includes designating the link as invalid (stage 209). For example, the optical link performance module 114 may designate the link as inactive if the effective OSNR is less than the ROSNR. An invalid optical link represents an optical link that will deliver a signal to a terminal device that may have significant post-FEC errors. In some cases, an optical link may be invalid for use with one set of end devices but valid for another set or mode of end devices.
Fig. 3 is a flowchart of an example method 300 of calculating a linear optical signal-to-noise ratio in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the linearity module 112 is configured to perform the method 300. Method 300 includes selecting an operating mode (stage 301). In some embodiments, the user may select the mode of operation. In some implementations, the system 100 can determine the mode of operation based on available information, for example. As shown in fig. 3, the system 100 may operate in one of three modes depending on the information available to the optical link element. In brown ground mode, the type and transmit power (i.e., operating parameters) of the amplifier are known and specified for each optical link element. The brown-out mode may be preferred when authentication of a known optical link is desired. In the greenfield mode, the operating parameters of each optical link element in the optical link are not known and specified. Greenfield mode may be preferred when it is desired to design a new link. During greenfield mode operation, method 300 includes reading the optimal amplifier type and transmit power for each optical link element (stage 302). In the partial brown mode, the amplifier type is known and specified for a subset of optical link elements of the optical link. System 100 can optimize transmit power while respecting amplifier selection for the subset of spans and then compute the expected performance for each line card, modulation format, and channel. The partial brown mode may be preferred when link re-optimization is desired (e.g., for previously designed optical links, the optical link may see an improvement when re-designed). During partial brown-out mode operation, method 300 includes reading the optimal transmit power for the specified amplifier type for each optical link element (stage 307).
In some embodiments, the system 100 operates in a brown-out mode, where the amplifier type and transmit power are known for each optical link element and used to calculate the nonlinear OSNR for each optical link element. Because these operating parameters are known, the fiber type, span length, and unit loss are known for each optical link element.
During greenfield mode operation, method 300 includes reading the optimal amplifier type and transmit power for each optical link element (stage 302). In the greenfield mode, the operating parameters of each optical link element in the optical link are not specified, and the linearity module 112 determines the operating parameters based on the set of design rules 306. In this case, the operating parameters are the desired transmit power and amplifier type required by each optical link element for producing the desired optical link capacity (e.g., the amount of transmitted data that the optical link is capable of supporting). In some embodiments, design rules 306 include fiber type, span length, and unit loss. Design rules 306 may be used to select a set of operating parameters for each optical link element. The operating parameters include a desired transmit power and a desired amplifier type (e.g., raman or EDFA). In some embodiments, linearity module 112 may be configured to select operating parameters based on the set of design rules 306 (fiber type, span length, and unit loss) when operating in greenfield mode. In some embodiments, the linearity module 112 may be configured to derive the design rules 306.
Design rules 306 may be based on the following inputs: (1) set of reference span lengths to be optimized (typically 40km to 1)20km in 5km increments); (2) the set of unit losses of the reference span to be optimized (typically 0.20dB/km to 0.30dB/km in 0.01dB/km increments); (3) a predetermined fiber type; and/or (4) the nonlinear OSNR per signal wavelength produced by standard nonlinear reference operation of a single optical link element of a predetermined fiber type. In the case of p (REF) 0dBm/ch, full channel load, with chromatic dispersion of the input channel predistorted at 10ns/nm, the nonlinear OSNR may be based on an 80km span (L, REF) with 16dB loss, where the nonlinear OSNR calculated in this reference run is defined as the OSNRNLREF(ii) a The range of the transmitting power of each channel is explored to be usually-10 dBm to +3dBm, and the step length is 0.5 dB; and a set of amplifier types is allowed for use with the optical link. Pre-distorting the chromatic dispersion of an input channel by offsetting the chromatic dispersion by such a specified value may be important to set the peak-to-average power ratio of the channel to its steady state value, and thus not underestimate all non-linearities that may be produced by the optical link element.
The design rule may be derived by first selecting a reference span loss and a reference span length. Then, linearity module 112 may calculate an associated span effective length (L) based on the selected reference span loss and the reference span lengthEFF). For a given amplifier allowed, and for a given per-channel transmit power P within an allowed rangeCHCalculating the linear OSNR waveform OSNRLIN(λ). Then, the nonlinear OSNR waveform is equal to the OSNRNL(λ)＝(PCH/PREF)2(LEFF/LEFF，REF)1OSNRNL，REF(λ), wherein all amounts are expressed in linear units. Thus, the effective OSNR waveform of the optical link element is OSNREFF(λ)＝{(1/OSNRLIN(λ))+(1/OSNRNL(λ))}-1Wherein all amounts are expressed in linear units. The operating parameters are then selected by finding:
AmplifierOPT＝argmaxAMPLIFIER{maxP minλOSNREFF(λ，Amplifier，P)}，
POPT＝argmax p{minλOSNREFF(λ，AmplifierOPT，P)}。
AmplifierOPT denotes the optimal amplifier type, POPT denotes the optimal transmit power, maxP and min λ denote the maximum transmit power and minimum wavelength required to establish the maximum minimum or average effective OSNR across all. This means that the linearity module 112 can be optimized for the desired amplifier type and transmit power to achieve the maximum minimum or average effective OSNR across all wavelengths. Thus, when there is a given optical link element, the linearity module 112 may search the design rules for a reference optical link element with a matching fiber type and with a closest smaller span length and unit loss, and may use the design rules to select a desired amplifier type and launch power from the reference optical link element. As previously described, in the partial brown mode, the linearity module 112 selects the desired transmit power for only the specified amplifier type for the subset of optical link elements. The linearity module 112 may do this using a similar procedure, but optimized for transmit power (i.e., POPT) only. During brown mode operation, the operating parameters are known, and thus, the fiber type, span length, and unit loss are known for each optical link element.
When operating in partial brown mode, method 300 includes reading the optimal transmit power for the specified amplifier type for each element (stage 307). In the partial brown mode, the amplifier type is known and specified for a subset of optical link elements of the optical link. In the partial brown mode, the linearity module 112 determines a desired transmit power for each optical element in the subset of optical elements while respecting the specified amplifier type in the subset of optical link elements.
Once the operational parameters are determined, method 300 includes calculating fiber propagation effects (stage 303), calculating Raman/EDFA amplification (stage 304), and outputting linear OSNR (stage 305). The performance of these stages is described above with reference to fig. 2.
