Description
Technical field
Present invention relates in general to media distribution and access on network, and particularly, relate to distribution of media and access by using limited local network access agreement.
Background technology
Universal plug and play (UPnP) is the set of one group of local network agreement, its allow various types of consumer electronics seamlessly be connected to family, close on and the small-business network.UPnP allows to be connected with the network of various compatible equipments, such as computing machine, media player and the wireless device that is connected to single common local network.Equipment can be by obtaining the IP address, announcing its title, pass on its ability and find that what other equipment on network, dynamically adds local network in the situation that need not to configure.The UPnP networking framework utilizes TCP/IP and enterprise network to come the control of equipment on network enabled and the data transmission between equipment.Networking framework allows any two equipment to come swap data according to the order of any opertaing device on network.One of benefit of UPnP is, it can move on any network technology, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, telephone line and power circuit.Another benefit of UPnP technology is, UPnP be platform independently, and the product that allows dealer to set up support UPnP with operating system and the programming language of any type.
Although UPnP has many benefits, the problem of UPnP is that the UPnP equipment on network is subject to the content that it can present.More specifically, common UPnP display device (such as media player) can access with the playback predefined type (for example, media file MP3), this media file is provided by the media server that is positioned on identical network.In the situation that best, media server can be accessed server predetermined, long range positioning in order to access these file types.For example, media server can visit by the Internet and have same type media file (for example, MP3) the book server that is designed to playback with UPnP.Thus, all if (for example show image, JPEG) and movie file (for example, traditional UPnP renderer of digital album (digital photo frame) WMV) and so on can not show the standard web page that comprises HTML, Javascript etc., can not show the feeds of data such as RSS or ATOM.Because traditional UPnP media server is slave, it just can not provide other guide the content that is designed to present except the media renderer to the UPnP renderer in design.In other words, the UPnP display device only can present the content file of its particular type that is designed, and media server also is subject to (as the UPnP framework with interior " subordinate " equipment) and accesses these specific content types.
As a result, in having traditional UPnP network of UPnP media renderer and media server, renderer can not access general internet content (such as, web page and feeds of data).In addition, because UPnP is designed for local network, a UPnP local network can not be shared its content and the 2nd UPnP local network, and the First zone network can not be with its content delivery to the remote server on the First zone network not.
Summary of the invention
Provide and be used for enumerating the content on local network or telecommunication network and allowing the UPnP display device to its system that presents and computer program.This system comprises the media management module, and its inquiry is positioned at the content of the equipment on local network and telecommunication network.The media management module responds enumerates in inquiry the content that identifies.The content of enumerating is used for the content creating catalogue, and it utilizes on local network and telecommunication network obtainable content to upgrade routinely.
File type and the data layout of the content intersect coding that the intersect coding module will identify in response to inquiry for being presented by the UPnP display device on local network for example is rendered as jpeg image with the HTMP webpage.The intersect coding module receives into template and template is treated to data layout and the file type that the UPnP display device can present in inciting somebody to action, and content is carried out intersect coding.The intersect coding module depends on content and uses dissimilar template.This feature allows the user to use the UPnP display device to visit script via the content of UPnP equipment inaccessible.
The reference mark interface configuration is used for opertaing device, so as on renderer rendering content.Equipment on local network is controlled by the first communication protocol, and this first communication protocol is limited to management across the communication between devices of local network.The first communication protocol further is subject to it and does not allow content to transmit.System uses the second communication agreement to transmit content and data in network internal and across a network.
In hereinafter detailed description and accompanying drawing, will represent these and other feature and advantage of the present invention, wherein only show by way of example principle of the present invention.
