Embodiment
Query composition is the inquiry comprising at least two class entity references of being correlated with by relativeness.In some implementations, query composition needs the identification at least two class entity references.As used herein, entity is following things or concept, and this things or concept are independent, unique, definition clear-cut and differentiable.Such as, entity can be people, place, item, idea, theme, abstract concept, concrete element, other suitable things or its combination in any.In some implementations, Search Results comprises the result that identified entities is quoted.As used herein, entity reference is the identifier of such as text or the out of Memory of reference entity.Such as, entity can be that the physics of George Washington embodies, and entity reference is the abstract concept for quoting George Washington.In the appropriate case, based on context, will understand entity as the term is used herein can be corresponding with entity reference, and entity reference can be corresponding with entity as the term is used herein.In some implementations, search system can identify the entity type be associated with entity reference.Entity type can be classification for the entity reference in Identification Data structure or classification.Such as, entity reference " George Washington " can be associated with entity type " US President ", " people " and " officer ".
Inquiry [Bank of America-National Trust & Savings Association near Japanese dining room] comprises quoting two class places, and does not specify any single refers to, but relative space relation." Bank of America-National Trust & Savings Association " result of obtaining near " Japanese dining room " is wanted in this inquiry only indicating user.But which " Japanese dining room " this inquiry does not specify be preferred, and which is not specified yet, and " Bank of America-National Trust & Savings Association " is preferred.The user that may be intended that of this inquiry wants this dining room in past days to have a meal, and stops before and after being at table in Bank of America-National Trust & Savings Association.User wants the Search Results comprising one or more Japanese dining room of satisfied " close " standard and one or more optimal candidate of one or more Bank of America-National Trust & Savings Association.Below Fig. 3,4, will the further discussion about entity reference and entity type be comprised in the context of 5.
Another example of query composition is [company gone bankrupt during economic crisis], and wherein relation is based on time instead of geographic position.Therefore, search system can identify such as economic crisis first instance type, such as Company Bankruptcy application second instance type and such as such as space distance or relative time difference entity type between relation.Such as, search system can determine that entity type is local, and relation is the distance between place.In another example, search system can determine that entity type is event, and relation is the time between event.
In addition, search system can be filtered based on the set of inquiry to the entity reference of or both type.Relatively Search Results can be determined based on the attribute of the entity reference to one or more related entities type.Such as, positional value or time value may be used for comparing to determine whether to meet desirable criterion two entity references.According to the mode making attribute and its corresponding entity quote to be associated, these attributes can be kept in any proper data structure.In some implementations, Search Results comprises the entity reference in data structure, lists of documents, the list of document identifier, the set of link, image, text or other content, other suitable result any or its any combination.
In some implementations, pregenerated table can the generating and storing of off-line, and accessed to contribute to identifying the result entity reference to query composition.Off-line generation table refers to generation table before any ad hoc inquiry of response.Such as, this table can comprise the data structure corresponding with N × M array, and wherein N × M array has N capable and M row.Row corresponds to the entity reference of the such as particular type in such as dining room.Each row corresponds to such as the particular entity type of such as bank, airport and coffee-house.For relevant with the entity reference often row of array and the often row relevant with entity type, respective entries comprise such as based on property value comparison and the target entity be defined as closest to the entity type of entity reference is quoted.It is the entity reference being defined as the most standard compliant particular entity type that target entity is quoted.Entry can also be included in entity entity reference corresponding with row when being event and target entity quote between actual range or the time.By to each entity reference of each respective type with and often go corresponding entity reference and compare and select the target entity of the respective type of the closest entity reference corresponding with this row to quote, generate data structure.Via user interface, result entity reference can be presented to user.The mark that this user interface can comprise such as such as map or timeline has the display of result entity reference.User interface can allow user to filter result entity reference.Such as, the option of the ultimate range of specifying between the entity reference of the first kind and the entity reference of Second Type can be provided for show to user.
Should be appreciated that search system receives query composition and identifies the result entity reference relevant more than the entity type of two with such as three, four, five in some implementations.In the example of the query composition relevant with three types, inquiry [near close to the Bank of America-National Trust & Savings Association in the Japanese dining room of icecream parlor] comprises quoting the place of three types.
Fig. 1 is the block scheme according to the illustrative search systems for solving query composition realized more of the present disclosure.Search system can be included in some or all assemblies illustrated in fig. 1.In some implementations, treatment element 100 receives the inquiry 110 from user's input, and such as input text inquiry, selection are filtered and arranged or both.In some implementations, inquire about 110 to receive from user interface 170.Treatment element 100 can comprise one or more processors with processor.Treatment element 100 can visit data structure 120, table 130, content L40, unshowned other adequate information any or its any combination.Data structure 120 comprises and the data that such as such as multiple entity references in entity title, attribute, entity type and its inter-entity path are relevant.Table 130 to comprise the data structure by the array of entity and entity type index.Such as, as described, carry out his-and-hers watches 130 by entity reference id1 and id2 and entity type Tl, T2, T3 and carry out index.Entity comprises and has and arrange the target entity of type be associated and quote, described in be listed in distance or the time upper entity reference closest to such as joining with line correlation.In some implementations, table 130 is generated and stored in advance to be accessed to contribute to solving the query composition such as such as inquiring about 110 by treatment element 100 subsequently.Treatment element 100 can identify the type of the relation between first instance type, second instance type and entity type.Treatment element 100 can determine the first kind, Second Type or the one or more result entity reference l50 of both based on inquiry 110, data structure l20, table 130, webpage 140, other adequate information any or its any combination at least in part.
Data structure block 120 comprises and comprising at least in part by the data structure of the information of the contextual definition between them.In some implementations, data structure block 120 comprises any suitable data structure, data plot, database, index, list, the list of link, table, other suitable information any or its any combination.In this example, data structure block 120 comprises the data acquisition being stored as node in graph structure and limit.In some implementations, data structure block 120 comprises knowledge graph.In some implementations, knowledge graph comprises the data being organized into the figure comprising node and limit.The data of knowledge graph can comprise the relevant statement of relation between entity reference, and those statements can be expressed as node and the limit of figure.Each in the node of knowledge graph comprises a blocks of data or multi-block data and limit represents relation between the data that are included in node that limit connects.Describe the specific implementation of knowledge graph below in figs. 3-5.
Content blocks 140 comprises the stored information from such as the Internet.In some implementations, web page blocks 140 comprises webpage, hyperlink, text, image, audio frequency, video and other the suitable content on the Internet.In some implementations, content blocks 140 comprise from retrieve to index or tissue data.Such as, the data of Web Organization comprise based on being linked to and coming from the rank of webpage of number of hyperlink of webpage.
Fig. 2 shows according to declarative data representations 200 and 250 that can contribute to solving query composition realized more of the present disclosure.In some implementations, the table 130 of Fig. 1 comprises one or more data acquisitions that such as data structure represents 200 and 250.Data structure can be generated and stored and represent that 200 and 250 to quote in response to query composition subsequently.Represent that by using such as data structure 200 or 250 quote, search system can be reduced candidate's entity ref data size and improve the processing time of response combination inquiry.
Data structure represent the entity of 200 comprise M the special entity with identifier ID 1, ID2 etc. quote and N number of particular type particular type nearest entity between mile distance.Such as, the distance between entity reference ID M and the nearest entity of type 3 is 10 miles.Such as, when the entity of query composition stated clearly or otherwise be can determine time, can usage data representation 200.Based on data structure, search system can represent that 200 filter possible result entity reference, and then determine one or more result entity reference.Such as, based on inquiry, can by " near " contextual definition is within 30 miles.For entity reference lD 2, do not exist and be " near " the entity reference of type 2.Therefore, because type 2 is 40 miles apart from the nearest entity of entity reference lD 2, therefore search system can abandon entity reference lD 2 in the context of determination result entity reference.But for entity reference lD 1, search system can find the entity of the type 2 meeting " close " standard, and therefore search system can only to entity reference ID1 determination result entity reference.
Data structure represent the entity of 250 comprise M the special entity with identifier ID 1, ID2 etc. quote and N number of particular type particular type nearest entity between distance and the entity identifier of nearest entity of each type.Such as, for given entity reference ID 1, search system can search the distance (it is 20 miles) between the nearest entity (it is ID_b1) of type 2 and entity reference ID 1 and ID_b1.In illustrated examples, allow entity reference ID1 be specific Startbuck dining room and allow type 2 be " airports ".Search system can determine near Startbuck dining room, whether to there is airport and determine it is which airport.For the inquiry of type [Startbuck of near airports], dining room is restricted to Startbuck, but airport is without any restriction.Such as data structure represents 250 quote and be especially particularly useful to the query composition that response has a restriction of an only entity reference.In some implementations, data structure table can be generated show 250 to make comprising entity identifier at entity by Update Table representation 200.
Described abovely may be used for generation table or provide the entity reference of such as Search Results, entity type and relation information can be included in data structure as data.The following description and drawings 3-5 describes and more of the present disclosurely realizes operable illustrative knowledge graph.Should be understood that knowledge graph is only the example of the operable data structure of search system and can uses any suitable data structure.
In some implementations, any one or more data structure techniques can be used by Organization of Data in a database.Such as, can by Organization of Data in the figure comprising the node be connected by limit.In some implementations, data can comprise the statement relevant with relation between things with concept, and those statements can be expressed as node and the limit of figure.Each node comprise one or more data and limit represent be included in limit connect node in data between relation.In some implementations, figure comprises the one or more pairs of nodes be connected by limit.Limit and thus figure can be oriented, undirected or both.Such as, in same figure, limit can be unidirectional, two-way, or one or more limit can be undirected and one or more limit can be oriented.Node can comprise any suitable data or data representation.Limit can any suitable relation between data of description.In some implementations, opposite side carries out marking or marking so that it comprises connection between node and the descriptor both relevant with this connection.Specific node can be connected to other node one or more by different edge or itself is to form expander graphs.For the sake of clarity, here by based on just described above the figure of structure be called knowledge graph.In some implementations, knowledge graph may be used for expression information and for providing information in seeking.
Fig. 3 shows according to illustrative knowledge graph parts 300 comprising node and limit realized more of the present disclosure.Illustrative knowledge graph part 300 comprises node 302,304,306,308.Knowledge graph part 300 comprises the limit 310 for connected node 302 and node 304.Knowledge graph part 300 comprises the limit 312 for connected node 302 and node 306.Knowledge graph part 300 comprises the limit 314 for connected node 304 and node 308.Knowledge graph part 300 comprises limit 316 for connected node 302 and node 308 and limit 318.Knowledge graph 300 comprises the limit 320 for making node 308 be connected with self.Each above-mentioned group of different with one or two for limit node can be called 3 tuples.As described, node 302 is directly connected with three other nodes by limit, and node 304 is directly connected with two other nodes by limit with 308.Node 306 is connected with only other node by limit, and in some implementations, node 306 is called terminal node.As described, node 302 is connected by two limits with 308, indicates the relation coming between defined node by more than one attribute.As described, node 308 is connected with himself by limit 320, and instructs node can relate to itself.Although it is oriented limit that illustrated knowledge graph 300 comprises unmarked, but it should be understood that each limit can be unidirectional or two-way.It should be understood that the example of this figure is only example and can adopts node and the limit of any suitable size or layout.
Usually, can be some classifications by the node grouping in knowledge graph.Node can presentation-entity is quoted, such as entity type and attribute the are such relational model between organising data, literal value and other node.
In some implementations, entity reference, entity type, attribute and other suitable content can be created, define, redefine, revise or generate in addition by any proper technology.Such as, can manually user input, by user interactions from dynamic response, by from external source import data, carry out generating content by other proper technology any or its combination in any.Such as, if do not represent the conventional search to word in knowledge graph, the one or more nodes for representing this node can so be added.In another example, user can manually add information and institutional framework.
The node of knowledge graph can presentation-entity.Entity is independent, uniqueness, well-defined and differentiable things or concept.Such as, entity can be people, place, item, idea, abstract concept, concrete element, other suitable things or its combination in any.It should be understood that the physics that knowledge graph comprises entity reference instead of entity in some implementations embodies.Such as, entity can be that the physics of George Washington embodies, and entity reference refers to the abstract concept of George Washington.In another example, entity " New York " refers to physical metropolitan, and knowledge graph uses the concept as the physical metropolitan such as represented by the title of the element in data structure, entity, other suitable element any or its combination in any.In the appropriate case, based on context, it should be understood that word entity as used herein can be corresponding with entity reference, and used word entity reference can be corresponding with entity here.
Node is unique, because do not have two nodes to refer to same thing or concept.Usually, entity comprises the things or concept that are represented on language by noun.Such as, in color " blueness ", city " San Francisco " and imaginary animals " kylin " each can be entity.Entity reference typically refers to the concept of entity.Such as, entity reference " New York " refers to physical metropolitan, and knowledge graph uses the concept as the physical metropolitan such as represented by the title of the element in data structure, entity, other suitable element any or its combination in any.
Represent that the node of organising data can be included in knowledge graph.These can be called entity type node here.As used herein, entity type node can refer to the node in knowledge graph, and entity type can refer to the concept represented by entity type node.Entity type can be the defined feature of entity.Such as, entity type node Y can be connected with entity reference nodes X, the figure shows information " entity X is type Y " by " being " limit of discussion further below or link.Such as, entity reference node " George Washington " can be connected with entity type node " president ".Entity reference node can be connected with multiple entity type node, and such as " George Washington " can also be connected with entity type node " people " and entity type node " army commander ".In another example, entity type node " city " can be connected with " San Francisco " with entity reference node " new New York ".In another example, although incomplete defined notion " tall people ", such as knowledge graph is not the definition that must comprise " height ", and concept " tall people " can exist as entity type node.In some implementations, the existence of entity type node " tall people " and other entity type node can mutual based on user.
In some implementations, entity type node can comprise with following relevant data or be connected with described data: the territory belonging to the attribute list be associated with entity type node, entity type node, description, value, other adequate information any or its combination in any.Territory refers to the set of concerned entity type.Such as, territory " film " can comprise such as entity type " performer ", " director ", " spot for photography ", " film ", any other any suitable entity type or its combination in any.In some implementations, entity reference is associated with the type in more than one territory.Such as, entity reference node " Benjamin Franklin " can be connected with the entity type node " statesman " in territory " government " and the entity type node " inventor " in territory " occupation ".
In some implementations, can also be node by the attribute representation be associated with entity reference node or entity type node.Such as, represent that the node of attribute " population " or " position " can be connected with entity type node " city ".The combination of entity type and attribute thereof and/or layout are called pattern.In some implementations, pattern is kept in the table be associated with entity type node or other proper data structure.In some implementations, knowledge graph can be self-defined or bootstrapping, so that it comprises specific node for the concept of defined node, limit and figure itself and limit.Such as, knowledge graph can comprise entity reference node " knowledge graph (Knowledge Graph) ", and this entity reference node " knowledge graph (Knowledge Graph) " is connected with the attribute node such as " having node " with the attribute for Description of Knowledge figure of " having limit ".
In some implementations, be called that the particular value of word can be associated by quoting with the special entity in terminal node for the limit of defining relation.Word can refer to value and/or bit string.Such as, word can comprise date, title and/or numeral.In this example, " " terminal node that the Bian Eryu that attribute can be had " to have population " by mark comprises word " 815000 " is connected entity reference node in San Francisco.In some implementations, terminal node can comprise quoting or linking the long text string in the one or more documents be stored in outside knowledge graph and out of Memory.In some implementations, word is stored as the node in knowledge graph.In some implementations, word is stored in knowledge graph, but not distributing unique identification as described below quotes, and can not be associated with multiple entity reference.In some implementations, literal type node can define such as the type of word of " date/time ", " numeral ", " gps coordinate ".
In some implementations, the group of limit and two nodes is called tlv triple.Tlv triple represents the relation between node, or in some implementations, represents this node and the relation between itself.In some implementations, the higher order relationship of modeling such as quaternary or n-ary relation, wherein n be greater than 2 integer.In some implementations, the information being used for modeling relation stored in node, this node can be referred to as intermediary node.In this example, information " people X donates stone implement Y to museum Z " is stored in the intermediary node for making entity reference node be connected with X, Y, Z, the role of the entity reference node of the wherein each corresponding connection of each limit mark.In some implementations, knowledge graph can comprise for word and/or the differentiation of entity and the information of disambiguation.As used herein, differentiation refers to the many-one situation that multiple title is associated with single entity.As used herein, disambiguation refers to the one-to-many situation that same title is associated with multiple entity.In some implementations, can quote to peer distribution unique identification.In some implementations, unique identification is quoted can be alphanumeric character string, title, numeral, binary code, other suitable identifier any or its combination in any.Unique identification is quoted and search system can be made uniquely to quote to the peer distribution with same or similar textual identifier.In some implementations, differentiation, disambiguation or both in use unique identifier and other technology.
In some differentiation realize, the differentiation that node can be associated with same entity with multiple word or word is called and is associated.Such as, word " George Washington ", " George Washington ", " Washington president " and " President George Washington " all can be quoted with the single entity of the such as node in knowledge graph and is associated.This can provide differentiation and the simplification of knowledge graph.In some realizations of disambiguation, quoted by their unique identification, by the node be associated in knowledge graph, defined multiple nodes with same or similar title by other adequate information any or its combination in any.Such as, there is entity reference node, with film " Philadelphia " relevant entity reference node and with cream cheese brand " Philadelphia " the relevant entity reference node relevant with city " Philadelphia ".Each in these nodes can have the unique identification for the disambiguation within knowledge graph being such as stored as numbering and quote.In some implementations, the disambiguation in knowledge graph is provided by the connection between multiple node and relation.Such as, city " New York " and state government " New York " can be distinguished, because this city is connected with entity type " city " and state government is connected with entity type " state government ".Should be appreciated that more complicated relation can also defined node and eliminate the ambiguity of node.Such as, defined node can be carried out by the entity type be associated, other entity reference, its title, other adequate information any or its combination in any that are connected with it by particular community.These connections can use in disambiguation, the node " Georgia (Georgia State) " be such as connected with node " U.S. " can be understood to represent the state of the U.S., and can be understood to represent the country in Eastern Europe with the node " Georgia (Georgia) " that node " Asia " is connected with " Eastern Europe ".
In some implementations, node can comprise the data for defining one or more attribute or be connected with described data.Attribute can the special characteristic of defined node.The particular community of node can depend on what node represents.In some implementations, entity reference node can comprise or be connected to: unique identification is quoted, the entity type list that is associated with node, node differentiation call list, the data be associated with entity reference, entity reference text describe, point to that the text of entity reference describes links, other adequate information or its combination in any.As mentioned above, node can comprise quoting or linking of long text string among to the one or more documents be stored in outside knowledge graph and out of Memory.In some implementations, memory technology can depend on customizing messages.Such as, unique identification can be quoted and be stored within node, short bit string can be stored in terminal node as word, and can be stored in long description of entity in be linked to outside document by the reference in knowledge graph.Limit in knowledge graph can represent that the semanteme for defining the relation between two nodes connects.Limit can represent such as "Yes", " having ", " type is? ", " there is attribute ", " there is value ", other suitably statement or such preposition statement connection of its combination in any any.Such as, the entity reference node of particular person can be connected with the terminal node of the word comprising the his or her specific date of birth by " date of birth " limit.In some implementations, by the limit of entity reference connect the attribute that defines can and relevant with the node that the type of entity reference is connected.Such as, entity type node " film " can be connected with " director " with entity reference node " performer ", and certain movie can pass through side attribute " there is performer " with for representing that the entity reference node of specific actors is connected.
In some implementations, node and the relation between limit definition entity type node and its attribute, defining mode thus.Such as, limit can make entity type node be connected with the node that attribute is associated, and described node can be called as attribute node.The entity reference of the type can be connected with the node of the particular value for defining those attributes.Such as, entity type node " people " can be connected with attribute node " date of birth " and node " height ".In addition, node " date of birth " can be connected with literal type node " date/time ", indicates the word be associated with " date of birth " to comprise date/time information.The entity reference node " George Washington " be connected with entity type node " people " by "Yes" limit can also pass through limit " to be had the date of birth " with word " on February 22nd, 1732 " and is connected.In some implementations, entity reference node " George Washington " is connected with " date of birth " attribute node.Should be appreciated that in some implementations, utilize same technology carry out modeling to both pattern and data and be stored in knowledge graph.In this manner, both pattern and data are visited by identical search technique.In some implementations, by pattern storage in separately table, chart, list, other data structure or its combination in any.Should also be appreciated that attribute can carry out modeling by node, limit, word, other proper data any or its combination in any.
Such as, entity reference node " George Washington " can by "Yes" limit with for representing that the entity type node of " people " is connected, indicate the entity type of entity reference thus, and limit can be passed through " there is the date of birth " with word " on February 22nd, 1732 " and be connected, define the attribute of entity reference thus.In this manner, knowledge graph defines both entity type and attribute that to quote with special entity and be associated by being connected with other node.In some implementations, " on February 22nd, 1732 " can be node, and it is connected with other event occurred on this date.In some implementations, this date can further with year node, the moon node and sky node be connected.Should be appreciated that any appropriately combined, node, terminal node, the entity reference of interconnection, any other that this information can be stored in word is suitably arranged or in its combination in any.
Fig. 4 shows according to illustrative knowledge graph parts 400 realized more of the present disclosure.Knowledge graph part 400 comprises the information relevant with the entity reference " George Washington " represented by " George Washington " node 402." George Washington " 402 is connected with " US President " entity type node 404 by the "Yes" limit 414 with semantic content "Yes", makes 3 tuples defined by node 402 and 404 and limit 414 comprise information " George Washington is US President ".Similarly, information " Thomas Jefferson is US President " is represented by the tuple of " Thomas Jefferson " node 410, "Yes" limit 420 and " US President " node 404.Knowledge graph part 400 comprises entity type node " people " 424 and " US President " node 404.
The type portions ground of people is defined by the connection from " people " node 424.Such as, by node 430 and limit 432 type " people " is defined as and there is attribute " date of birth ", and by node 434 and limit 436, type " people " is defined as there is attribute " sex ".These relationship part ground define the pattern be associated with entity type " people ".
In knowledge graph part 400, illustrate that " George Washington " 402 has entity type " people " and " US President ", and be connected with the node comprising the value be associated with those types thus.Such as, " George Washington " node 402 is connected with " male sex " node 406 by " having sex " limit 418, thus instruction " George Washington " has sex " male sex ".In addition, " male sex " node 406 can be connected with " sex " node 434, instruction " male sex is a kind of sex ".Similarly, " George Washington " node 402 is connected with " on February 22nd, 1732 " node 408 by " having the date of birth " limit 416, thus instruction " George Washington has February 22 1732 date of birth "." George Washington " node 402 can also be connected with " 1789 " node 428 by " having the inaugural date " limit 430.
Knowledge graph part 400 also comprises " Thomas Jefferson " 410, to be connected and to be connected with " people " entity type node 424 by "Yes" limit 428 by "Yes" limit 420 with entity type " US President " node 404.Therefore, knowledge graph part 400 indicates " Thomas Jefferson " to have entity type " US President " and " people ".In some implementations, " Thomas Jefferson " node 410 is connected with its date of birth, sex and the node on inaugural date of relating to unshowned in Fig. 4.
Should be appreciated that knowledge graph part 400 is only example and it can comprise unshowned node and limit.Such as, " US President " node 404 can be connected with all US Presidents.The attribute that " US President " node 404 can also limit with duration in the term of office, the such as term of office in " 2 terms of office " of such as such as " 4 years ", the entity type of the office location of such as " Washington D.C. ", other proper data any or its combination in any is relevant is connected.Such as, " US President " node 404 is connected with " taking office the date " node 438 by " having attribute " limit 440, this part define the pattern of type " US President ".Similarly, " Thomas Jefferson " node 410 can be connected with the node of any proper number, described node comprises the further information relevant with " people " with his illustrated entity type node " US President ", and other entity type node unshowned that " Thomas Jefferson " node 410 can be such with such as " inventor ", " vice president " and " writer " is connected.In further example, " people " node 424 can be connected with all entity references with type " people " in knowledge graph.In further example, " 1789 " node 428 can be connected with all events with attribute year " 1789 " in knowledge graph." 1789 " node 428 was unique to 1789, and was quoted by its unique identification that to eliminate with unshowned title in such as Fig. 4 be the ambiguity of " 1789 ".In some implementations, " 1789 " node 428 is connected with entity type node " year ".

Fig. 8 is illustrative 3rd screenshotss 800 of the user interface according to the search systems realized more of the present disclosure.Screenshotss 800 after screenshotss 700, and illustrate as use filter menu 660 the additional queries [within 100 miles] that inputs.Together with the adjustable slip hurdle of user that may be used for filtering shown volcano result, designator 820 shows this standard [within 100 miles].Therefore, the volcano within 100 miles that are only presented at nuclear reactor.Volcano shown in screenshotss 800 and nuclear reactor meet inquiry [nuclear reactor within 100 miles and volcano].Fig. 6,7, the screenshotss 600,700,800 of 8 respectively illustrate user interactions to refine to a results set by another result set is incompatible, and user can be allowed to define one or more standard, such as, distance in map view.Therefore, search system can apply other refine with based on the data in such as user input, knowledge graph, share attribute, the user of gathering selects, any out of Memory or its any combination make Search Results narrow and identify best entity reference to or larger entity reference group.
Fig. 9 is the another illustrative screenshotss 900 of the user interface according to the search systems realized more of the present disclosure.Screenshotss 900 comprise nuclear reactor 902 and are marked by open circles and the map 910 of the part of America & Canada that marked by stain of volcano 904.Urtext inquiry [nuclear reactor within 100 miles, volcano] has been shown in textbox 920.Volcano shown in screenshotss 900 and nuclear reactor meet inquiry [nuclear reactors within 100 miles of volcano].In the example of illustrated Fig. 9, " nuclear reactor " indicates first instance type, and " volcano " indicates second instance type, and " within 100 miles " instruction standard.Should notice that screenshotss 900 show the filter result of the entity reference of the first kind and Second Type, and the entity reference of the first kind that the entity reference that the screenshotss 800 of Fig. 8 show only Second Type is filtered.According to the disclosure, search system can be filtered one or two or the entity reference more than the type of two.In addition, according to the disclosure, search system can show the entity reference of one or two or the type more than two.Such as, with reference to figure 9, search system can only show the nuclear reactor 902 meeting unshowned standard alternatively.
Can by such as Fig. 6,7,8, those similar techniques described in the context of 9 is applied to the entity type with time relationship.Figure 10 is according to illustrative screenshotss 1000 showing the user interface of the search system of timeline 1010 realized more of the present disclosure.Screenshotss 1000 comprise bankruptcy petition 1002 and are marked by open circles and the timeline 1010 of the date range that marked by dash box of U.S. financial crisis 1004 from 1986 to 2015.In screenshotss 1000, show four U.S. financial crises and 16 bankruptcy petitions, meet inquiry [assets are more than the American Bankruptcy Law application of the company of 30,000,000,000 dollars within 2 years of U.S. financial crisis].Therefore; filtered by the entity reference (bankruptcy petition in illustrated example) of company size to first instance type and the entity reference of first instance type close to financial crisis, and substantially the entity reference (in illustrated example U.S.'s financial crisis) of Second Type not to be filtered.In some implementations, if when having, search system can be determined to filter the entity reference of which kind of type and/or to show.Such as, search system can bankruptcy petition 1002 only on displaying time line 1010, and does not show U.S. financial crisis 1004.Search system is determined can based on the type of the entity reference in inquiry, predetermined set, consideration, other adequate information any or its combination by which entity reference filtering and/or showing.Designator 1030 and 1040 shows filter criteria respectively, and this filter criteria can be conditioned by the user interactions with corresponding slider bar.Can based on the type of the entity reference in inquiry, predetermined set, consideration, other adequate information any or its combination to the determination of the designator that will show.Such as, if the filtration that the slider bar of designator 1030 is adjusted to [1 year] by user is arranged, so search system can remove " Rui Fu " bankruptcy petition from screenshotss 1000, because it is not within 1 year of U.S. financial crisis.
Figure 11 is the process flow diagram 1100 according to the illustrative steps for carrying out recognition result entity reference based on query composition realized more of the present disclosure.According to realizations more of the present disclosure, the illustrative steps of process flow diagram 1100 can be rearranged, omits or revise in addition.Although be to be understood that process flow diagram 1100 describes the step for first instance type and second instance type, the entity type of search system to any proper number processes in some implementations.
Step 1102 is search system identification first instance type, second instance type and relation.In some implementations, first instance type, second instance type and its relation can be identified from inquiry.In some cases, both first instance type and second instance type are all the entity types with position attribution.Such as, entity type can be have the dining room of position attribution, bank, building, office, bar, coffee-house, refuelling station, public place of entertainment, department store, stadiums, library, national park, lake, nuclear reactor, volcano, any other suitable entity type, it can be filtered by any proper standard or be limited, such as, be limited to dining room or their combination in any in Japanese dining room.In some cases, first instance type and second instance type are the entity types with time attribute.Such as, entity type can be the birthday, death, the life-span, war, financial crisis, inaugural, term of office, the application of such as bankruptcy petition, broadcasting date of such as TV programme, any other suitable event, there is time attribute be subject to other suitable entity type any that such as US President's birthday filters or limit or its any combination.Relation between entity can comprise such as such as depth of building, animal genus/kind, car gage, any suitable property value that can compare of spouse's income, other attribute any that can compare between entities or its any combination.Such as, [man and wife of income gap more than 100 ten thousand dollars] such inquiry can be solved such as by comparing the property value of " income ".In another example, the inquiry of [the close buildings with the difference in height of at least 500 feet in New York] can be solved such as by the property value comparing depth of building.In aforementioned exemplary, search system can also carry out the property value of comparison position based on " close " standard, two groups of property values therefore based on such as depth of building and position provide Search Results.
Step 1104 is search systems of the node for identifying the knowledge graph corresponding with the entity reference of the entity reference of first instance type and second instance type.Such as, first instance type can be " U.S. financial crisis ", and search system can identify in knowledge graph with the Black Monday, store up and borrow the corresponding node of crisis, Internet bubble and property-value bubble in 2007.
Step 1106 is search systems is each entity reference of first instance type and each entity reference determination property value of second instance type.Such as, search system can determine property value by searching for knowledge graph and accessing related node.In some implementations, property value can comprise the positional information of such as address, lat/longitude value, the relative position quoting another entity, other appropriate location information any or its combination in any.In some implementations, attribute can comprise the temporal information of time in such as date, sky, year, century, the relative time-intervals quoting another entity, other appropriate time information any or its combination in any.Property value can be numeral, text, alphanumeric character string or have other form any.
Step 1108 is that search system compares each entity attributes value of first instance type and each entity attributes value of second instance type.Such as, for N number of entity reference of the first kind and M entity reference of Second Type, search system can perform N × M and compare.In some implementations, search system can by determining that the difference of its respective attributes value compares entity reference.Such as, for two entity references with position attribution value, search system can determine the relative distance of any suitable unit between entity reference.In another example, for two entity references with time attribute value, search system can determine the relative time-intervals of any suitable unit between entity reference.Should be appreciated that search system identification and the property value compared can depend on query composition and special entity quotes the attribute be associated that can have and comprise both position and temporal information.In some implementations, search system can walk around the comparison of some N × M based on all reference tables as shown in Figure 2.Such as, if reference table instruction does not exist the entity reference of the second instance type meeting this standard for the special entity of first instance type is quoted, so search system need not perform this and compares, and this is because this reducing computing time.
Step 1110 is that search system relatively identifies one or more result entity reference based on step 1108.The subset that the aggregate entities that result entity reference comprises first instance type and second instance type is quoted.In some implementations, result entity reference only can comprise the entity reference of first instance type or second instance type.Such as, in response to query composition [Bank of America-National Trust & Savings Association near Japanese dining room], search system only can select " Bank of America-National Trust & Savings Association " entity reference as a result.
In some implementations, search system can carry out selection result entity reference based on standard.This standard can comprise in queries clearly, can be inferred by inquiry, or can be determined based on predetermined set by search system.
In illustrated examples, search system identification has the result entity reference of position attribution.Search system is quoted all geographical entities in knowledge graph and is calculated latitude and longitude.Some entity references itself have the geographical attribute in such as such as Mountain Everest, and other entity reference does not have.Such as, entity reference " New York Office of Google " can have the attribute being called as " position ", and it may be buildings.Buildings itself can comprise the geographic position attribute of such as latitude and longitude.Search system generates data structure to each entity reference in knowledge graph, and this data structure comprises such as quotes the identifier of corresponding identification number and the position of such as latitude and longitude with each corresponding entity.Identifier is the unique ID of entity for carrying out index to the solid data in data structure.In some implementations, Hash maps is used for storaging mark and position data, and therefore, given ID, then search system typically can retrieve corresponding latitude and longitude in 0 (1) time.When search system receives inquiry, this is understood systematicly two entity types in inquiry and identifies the entity reference of these two entity types.Utilize ID and position, the latitude of all entity references of search system identification and longitude.By calculating the distance between each entity reference of first instance type and each entity reference of second instance type, search system based on such as specified by user or determine which is closer to each other to entity by the predetermined criterion distance of search system.For the entity reference with time attribute, search system computing time difference and based on such as specified by user or determine which is closer to each other to entity by the predetermined time standard of search system.In some implementations, the time complexity of disclosed algorithm is 0 (N*M), and wherein N is the number of the entity reference of first instance type, and M is the number of the entity reference of second instance type.
Figure 12 be according to more of the present disclosure realize for storing data in data structure with the process flow diagram 1200 of the illustrative steps used with query composition.In some cases, search system can identify the many entity references in each entity type, such as, cause 10 of larger time complexity, 000 entity reference or more.In this case, secondary for needs operation 10,000*10,000 (thus 100,000,000) distance calculates or more by search system, and then preferably right to comparing each other to find.In order to reduce computing time, the data structure generated in advance can be used.In some implementations, can flowchart 1200 illustrative steps and not for the ad hoc inquiry such as such as when performing as off-line algorithm.Search system can generate table and relative recognition result rapidly off-line.In some implementations, search system only can make restriction to an entity type in inquiry.Such as, reference type " airport ", data structure can comprise the airport of California, because data were set up before responding ad hoc inquiry.According to realizations more of the present disclosure, the illustrative steps of process flow diagram 1200 can be rearranged, omits or revise in addition.Although understanding process flow diagram 1200 is described the step for first instance type and second instance type, the entity type of search system to any proper number processes in some implementations.
Step 1202 is entity references of search system identification first instance type.Search system identifies the entity reference of first instance type by search knowledge graph.First instance type can be such as determined by search system or determined by user.
Step 1204 is search system each entity reference determination property values to the first instance type identified in step 1202.This property value can comprise positional information, temporal information, other adequate information any or its any combination.This attribute can be such as determined by search system or determined by user.
Step 1206 is entity references of the multiple second instance type of search system identification.Second instance type can be determined by search system or determined by user.In some implementations, the search history based on such as searched for most popular entity type determines multiple second instance type.In some implementations, the actual relationship based on itself and first instance type determines multiple second instance type.Such as, for first instance type " airport ", multiple second instance type can comprise " hotel ", " dining room ", " tourist attractions " and " congress tour " center ".
Step 1208 is the differences between the property value of each entity reference of search system determination first instance type and the property value of each entity reference of second instance type.This difference can be distance, the time interval, any other suitably poor or its any combination.
Step 1210 is that search system selects the target entity of second instance type to quote having in each entity reference of the first instance type of the determined lowest difference of step 1208.In some implementations, search system by entity reference, entity type or both identify that these are immediate right.
Step 1212 is that search system will represent that the data that the target entity of each second instance type is quoted are stored in data structure.In some implementations, quote to quote target entity by the corresponding entity of first instance type and carry out index.In some implementations, the difference only between stored attribute values, instead of entity identifier itself.Such as, as shown in Figure 2, data structure can comprise difference, entity identifier or both.
Figure 13 is according to illustrative steps for showing at least some result entity reference based on query composition realized more of the present disclosure.According to realizations more of the present disclosure, the illustrative steps of process flow diagram 1300 can be rearranged, omits or revise in addition.Although understanding process flow diagram 1300 is described the step for first instance type and second instance type, the entity type of search system to any suitable proper number processes in some implementations.
Step 1302 is user's inputs that search system receives the relation of instruction first instance type, second instance type and definition standard.User's input can comprise the thump of the text string such as keyed in, menu setecting, the language in-put being input to microphone, any other suitably input or its combination in any of being input to search system from user.Such as, user's input can be the form of the inquiry of keying in.In another example, user's input can be the form that menu setecting and corresponding filtration are arranged.Standard can be clear and definite, such as [between 10 to 20 miles]; Or implicit, such as [near], in this case search system can determine " near " implication of standard.
Step 1304 is entity references pair that search system identification meets the first and second entity types of standard.This is to the entity reference of the entity reference and second instance type that comprise first instance type, and needs not to be exclusiveness.Such as, the special entity of first instance type can be included in that each corresponding entity with second instance type quotes multipair among.Identify and compare to determine difference to the respective attributes value comprised the entity reference of the first and second entity types, and then this difference and standard are compared.
Step 1306 makes the expression of search system display to the right entity reference identified from step 1304.Can make search system show the entity reference of first instance type, the entity reference of second instance type or both.This expression can be depending on entity reference, entity type, difference, user's input, other adequate information any or its any combination.Such as, search system can show the map of correlation proportion and marking the position of the difference comprising distance such as shown in Fig. 6,7,8,9.In another example, search system can show correlation proportion timeline and as shown in Figure 10 to the time-labeling of difference comprising the time interval.In some implementations, search system also can be made to show one or more filtrator, menu, text box or allow other feature shown of user interactions.Shown feature can allow such as right to the entity reference set of user to filter, and regulates, regulates inquiry, regulate standard display, provides other input any, or its any combination.
