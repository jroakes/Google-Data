It is reduced to threshold value and executes status checkout, the decline of ambient lighting can trigger hazard detector and status checkout is visually presented
Result.Color, animation mode and/or the speed of presentation can be used to convey information to user.For example, being reached in Irradiance
To after threshold luminance level, green light can be presented to the user within the of short duration time.Such green light can be with instruction state
Check the problem of identification does not need user to take action.If display sodium yellow alternatively, if this can be examined with instruction state
Look into the one or more problems for determining and user being required to take action, such as low battery situation.Sodium yellow can be indicated without immediately
Take action.Red light can determine the one or more problems for needing user to immediately treat with instruction state inspection, such as lack
Battery or damage sensor.May be particularly well adapted for use in using lamp providing state avoids excessive interference hazard detector attached
Close user.For example, uninterested user without seeing hazard detector only by can ignore that the state of hazard detector is examined
It looks into.Therefore, for some embodiments, it was found that notified for non-alarm state, the light letter of such as above-mentioned modulating signal is provided
Number, while especially avoiding providing the signal with warning sound, it will be highly beneficial.Although voice signal is strictly actually detected arrives
The necessary part of the Alert Level situation of unsafe condition is believed it has been found that being directed to certain not too important situations without using sound
Number and using such as only have lamp signal more small signal, would be more advantageous.Compared with the scene of alternative, in some feelings
Jing Zhong, this can have very favorable effect.For example, it may be possible to which the case where occurring is, " the chirp of fearful low battery is sent out
The hazard detector of sound " may be only by angry sleepy user from removing in wall and putting on the ground or on desk, hurriedly
It is busy to open battery case and remove battery.This is clearly adverse conditions, because hereafter just completely not to the danger of the position
Detection, until user may reinstall new battery such as second day (I hope so) and unit is put back to its correct position
Until such time.Conversely, just starting the electric situation that is lower for battery, (such as by using soft warning optical signal
Sodium yellow), without sending out ear-piercing chirp, user will appreciate that when seeing the yellow color needs to pay attention to something, but can keep away
Exempt from the case where angry sleepy user makes disabling, so that carrying out hazard detection appropriate always.As another advantage, provide short
Temporarily quietly green light (or other quiet but visually make us the signal felt at ease) can provide comfortable to the user
Reassurance, without angry or be disturbed.For example, just its child has been put on bed for evening mother and feelings of just turning off the light
Condition, of short duration, quiet, comfortable green-glow are capable of providing the happiness and reassurance of satisfaction.It is especially worth noting simultaneously
, either in consciousness or in subconsciousness, it is established that constructively recurrent Cognitive Mode, the reason is that when turning off the light
When can be expected green-glow occur so that if yellow aura replace green-glow, will be apparent., it will be appreciated that
The feature and advantage of preferred embodiment are best suited for battery and just start to be lower under electric but not too low context.According to official's safety
Standard preferably continues to provide unpleasant chirp when battery becomes low battery.However, when according to this paper institutes
One or more of preferred embodiment stated is come when implementing, hazard detector is substantially less likely that " too low " shape can be become again
Condition, because user might have quiet yellow of the chance seeing and in response to will occur in a couple of days or several weeks several times
Battery has been replaced after light warning.
Once state has been presented, the lamp in hazard detector can be closed or can gradually be closed.Once state by
It presents, hazard detector can be configured to be no longer presented state, until at least passing by predefined period (example
Such as, 1 hour, 4 hours, 20 hours, 1 day etc.).In some embodiments, if hazard detector may be configured in danger
Detector nearby detects that action, ambient lighting then provide ambient lighting below threshold value, and hazard detector is configured to
Such lamp (indicating it not in sleeping indoor input for example, hazard detector has received) is provided.The identical lamp of output state
Offer ambient lighting can be provided, different colors, such as white light may be used.
If user checks the state presented by hazard detector and pleases oneself to state or lose interest on the contrary,
User can not execute other actions, can only withdraw from a room, and can go to bed, or can separately continue his or her
One day.However, in some cases, user may need the more information of off status.For example, if hazard detector is presented
Yellow state, then user study may be needed to have one or more details of off status.It is advance after state has been presented
In the determining period, hazard detector can activate motion detector, which can determine whether user has existed
Hazard detector nearby executes any gesture.For example, if hazard detector is attached to ceiling, below hazard detector
Or separately in its vicinity, user can wave one or many, and the shape in relation to previously having shown is provided to trigger hazard detector
The details of state.If gesture is detected, it is different from output visual indicator, hazard detector can export auditory message.Example
Such as, auditory message can refer to the speech information for the further details for being shown with the state for closing hazard detector.As an example, dangerous
Detector can illustrate " the low electricity of battery.Battery is please replaced as early as possible." will there is the details of off status to say to use to trigger using gesture
The ability at family may be particularly useful in the case where that can not touch hazard detector, and such as hazard detector is mounted to ceiling
On.
