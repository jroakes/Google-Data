Technical Field
The present description relates to content selection and presentation.
Background
The computing system may be configured to collect data from a plurality of web pages and organize the collected data into a searchable index of information. The collected data may be in a structured or unstructured data format. For example, a computing system may receive structured or unstructured data for resources that include electronic media content, such as articles and other electronic publications. A user consuming media content may wish to receive a subset of the media content identified as being associated with a particular interest or content preference of the user. However, many existing systems are not particularly effective in identifying appropriate content for provision to a user. Thus, existing systems may expend resources identifying, delivering, and displaying content that the user will ignore. Accordingly, there is a need for computing systems that better utilize computing resources in providing a subset of media content for consumption by a particular user.
Disclosure of Invention
In accordance with the described techniques, a computing system receives a plurality of resources. The resource may include at least a portion of the electronic media content and the text content. For each resource, the system may identify one or more entities associated with the resource. The entity may span a variety of information types and may include an individual's person, political entity, entertainment entity, or business entity. The pairs of entities may be identified by the system, and for each pair of identified entities, the system may determine the number of resources for each entity in which the pair is associated.
The system may then determine the occurrence of an event associated with a particular pair of entities. The event occurrence may be determined based on the number of resources of each entity in which the pair is associated. The system generates a representation corresponding to the event. The representation may be generated based on the resources in which each entity of the pair of entities is associated. The system may provide the presentation for output to the user device.

Detailed Description
A computing system is described that receives various structured and unstructured data, such as online article resources and other media content, from various data sources. The system is configured to annotate the received data and automatically bundle and/or cluster specific content deemed relevant or interesting to at least one user using the annotated data. In this context, the described subject matter relates to enhancing user interest feeds to include targeted media content and resources that match a user's specific interests and preferences.
FIG. 1 illustrates a plurality of interfaces related to an interest feed in an example computing system. The plurality of interfaces includes interfaces 102, 104, and 106. Each illustrated interface corresponds to an example graphical representation associated with a user interest feed that may be displayed on the example user device 108. As shown in fig. 1, the user device 108 may correspond to a mobile smart phone device.
In some implementations, the user device 108 may be one of a variety of computing devices, such as a laptop/desktop computer, a smart television, an electronic book/reader device, a digital streaming content device, a gaming machine, a smart watch device, an electronic wearable device, a tablet device, or other related computing device configured to execute software instructions and applications for providing targeted content to at least one user.
The interface 102 may be displayed on a user device 108 and may include an example user interest feed 110. In some implementations, the interest feed 110 displays a graphical representation corresponding to example media content, such as online articles or other types of resource data. For example, the interest feed 110 may include a first content 112 and a second content 114. As shown, the first content 112 may indicate certain activities of an example business entity, company a, while the second content 114 may indicate certain activities of another example business entity, company B.
The first and second content 112, 114 of the interest feed 110 may be generated according to one implementation. The content 112, 114 may appear to the user of the device 108 to include different entities that do not have obvious contacts or associations. In some instances, potential contact, association, or sharing events involving entities of interest feed 110 may actually exist. However, in one implementation, the system generating the interest feed 110 does not detect relevance nor does the system identify available resource content describing relevance. Furthermore, the system does not infer or predict example second media content to include in the user's interest feeds based on the user's preferences for the particular first media content.
Interface 104 and interface 106 each illustrate an example graphical representation of an interest feed enhanced in accordance with the described techniques. As shown, interface 104 and interface 106 may also each be displayed on user device 108. Interface 104 includes resource interest feeds 116, while interface 106 includes inferred interest feeds 124. The interest feeds 116 and 124 each display a graphical representation of example assets/media content, such as online news articles or other types of data, that are uniquely identified based on the user's particular interests or preferences.
The interest feed 116 may be populated to include first content 118 and second content 120. Unlike the content of the interest feed 110, the first and second content 118, 120 of the interest feed 116 are generated by a computing system enhanced in accordance with the described techniques. The enhanced computing system may be configured to identify entities that match the user's preferences. For example, a user may have an interest or preference in news related to a first identified entity, such as company a's commercial activity, and the enhanced computing system may be configured to use annotated resource data to detect a relevance or association between company a and a second identified entity, company B.
The enhanced system may also detect events related to entities and indicating connections between entities, and populate the resource interest feed 116 to include example electronic articles or other digital resource content about the event and output to the user via the user device 108. In some implementations, the resource can be a web site for accessing online content describing or detailing events that indicate a relationship or correlation between identified entities.
For example, as shown via first content 118, the resource may be a uniform resource locator (uniform resource locator, URL) for accessing an online publication and an electronic article describing a poetic merge event between companies a and B. In some implementations, as shown via the second content 120, the interest feed 116 may be populated to include additional resource data, such as example equity quoters showing the respective equity 122 of the shares of companies a and B, and data regarding changes in the respective equity of each company's shares.
Much like the interest feed 116, the inferred interest feed 124 may be populated to include first content 126 and second content 128 generated by a computing system enhanced in accordance with the described techniques. The enhanced system may perform calculations for identifying or detecting events to be included in the inferred interest feed 124 based on inferences or predictions that match or relate to a particular interest or preference of the user.
In some implementations, an event may also be inferred or predicted by the enhanced system to be relevant to the user based on the relevance or association of the event with another related event identified as being of interest to the user. Thus, as described above, the interest feed 124 displays a graphical representation of the asset/media content for the event identified based on the inference determined with the particular user preference.
For example, as shown via the first content 126, information about the inferred event may be accessed via a URL describing the event as an online article recently purchased by company C for company D. Events indicated via the URL may be predicted to be of interest to the user based on the user's interest in company a's business (e.g., company a merging with company B). Alternatively or additionally, an event may be predicted to be of interest to a user based on the relevance of the event to another related event identified as of interest to the user, e.g., an event generally related to a commercial activity.
In some implementations, the interest feed 124 can be populated to include additional resource data, as shown via the second content 128. The resource may be a web site/link for accessing online content describing or detailing particular data related to the detected event of the first content 126. For example, the resource may be a URL of a web page describing facts and definitions about the merger and acquisition (M & A) and other business concepts. The additional data may be determined by the enhanced system based on inferences or predictions of the system regarding the events of the first content 126. The inference or prediction can be a analytic calculation performed by the system to expect, identify, and select content that will be of interest to the user based at least on the attributes of the event.
For example, a user may have a preference for news related to a commercial activity (e.g., a commercial activity involving at least company A). Additionally, the detected event may indicate that an M & A type business is occurring or will occur between company A and at least one other company. Thus, the enhanced system may cause inferred interests feed 124 to be populated with predictions regarding the user's likely interest in learning more business definitions or other financial concepts in view of the attributes (e.g., mergers) of the business involved by company A.
FIG. 2 illustrates a system diagram of an example computing system for populating an interest feed. The system 200 generally includes an example computing server 109 for generating at least the interfaces 104 and 106 described above with reference to fig. 1. In some implementations, the computing functions of server 109 may be performed in an example cloud-based computing system or environment.
The system 200 corresponds to the enhanced computing system described above with reference to fig. 1 and is used to generate the interface 104 and the interface 106 displayed with the user device 108. Thus, the system 200 may be configured to accurately detect potential contact, association, or sharing events involving two or more entities based on a user's preferences or interests. The system 200 may also be configured to identify available resources or media content describing the relevance, such as online articles about the merger event, and provide it for output to the user.
The system 200 may also identify additional content related to the event indicating the relevance and provide it for output to the user. For example, the additional content may be the stock price of each of two merged companies. The system 200 may also be configured to identify or detect events and related data based on inferences or predictions that match specific user preferences. In some implementations, the event and related data can be inferred using the association of the event with another related event identified by the system 200 as being of interest to the user.
Referring to FIG. 2, the server 109 generally includes an event detection module 202, a resource interest feed module 204, and an inferred interest feed module 206. In some implementations, modules 202, 204, and 206 are each included in server 109, either collectively or individually, or are accessible by server 109. Further, the described functions and computational processes of modules 202, 204, and 206 may be enabled by computational logic or programming instructions executable by a processor and memory associated with server 109.
As used in this specification, the term "module" is intended to include, but is not limited to, one or more computer/computing devices configured to execute software programs comprising program code that causes a processing unit(s) of the computing device to perform one or more functions. The term "computer" is intended to include any data processing or computing device/system, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mainframe computer, a personal digital assistant, a server, a handheld device, or any other device capable of processing data.
The server 109 may include one or more processors, memory, and data storage devices that collectively form one or more computing systems of the server 109. The processor of the computing system processes instructions for execution by the server 109, including instructions stored in memory or on a storage device to display graphical information of a graphical user interface (graphical user interface, GUI) via an example display of the user device 108. Execution of the stored instructions may cause one or more of the actions described herein to be performed by server 109 or user device 108.
In other implementations, multiple processors may be used, as well as multiple memories and classes of memory, as appropriate. For example, the server 109 may be connected to a plurality of other computing devices, where each device (e.g., an array of servers, a group of servers, a module, or a multi-processor system) performs some portion of the actions or operations associated with the various processes or logic flows described in this specification.
Referring again to FIG. 2, the event detection module 202 includes a resource annotator 208, an entity relevance detector 210, and an event detector 212. The module 202 also includes a plurality of resources 216, a user interest profile 218, and filtering logic 220. Annotators 208 can be used by system 200 to annotate each of the plurality of resources 216 or media content received by server 109. For example, the annotator 208 can annotate each received asset by scanning or analyzing entity or content data about the asset.
In some implementations, to annotate the resources 216, the annotators 208 analyze signal data associated with individual entities or other content included in the respective resources 216. Based on this signal analysis, the annotator 208 can identify and/or extract one or more entities included in the content data for or about each resource 216. In some implementations, the extracted entities are stored in a memory of server 109. The stored entities may then be accessed and used by the modules of server 109 to perform calculations for populating resource interest feed 116 or inferred interest feed 124.
As described above, the entities of resource 216 may span multiple information types. For example, the entities of resource 216 may include individuals, people, government and political entities, sports and entertainment entities, or business, scientific and academic entities. As described above, in some examples, two or more entities may have a relationship or correlation and example events involving the two entities may be included in at least one resource item of resource 216.
Entity relevance detector 210 can receive annotated resource items and clusters of identified entities from annotators 208. For example, the relevance detector 210 may receive a cluster of a plurality of electronic articles including associated names or identifiers of individual entities included in the articles. In some implementations, for each resource in a cluster of multiple resources, the relevance detector 210 can analyze the resource and, based on the analysis, identify one or more entities, identify a relevance between the resources, or identify a relevance between entities associated with the respective resource.
For example, the relevance detector 210 can analyze the assets to detect or determine data similarity or related data between electronic text or digital images of a plurality of assets or media content. In some implementations, the relevance detector 210 uses the relative location of particular text or image content, such as the title/title of an article, for each resource to determine resource or entity relevance between the respective resources.
In response to determining the data similarities, the relevance detector 210 can identify relevance between resources or relevance between entities associated with respective resources based at least on the number of data similarities detected. For example, the relevance detector 210 may determine the number of resources having detected data similarities that may indicate relevance or association between two or more entities.
The relevance detector 210 may then identify two or more entities having relevance or association based on the determined number of resources. In some examples, the relevance detector 210 identifies two or more entities based on the determined number of resources exceeding a threshold number.
In some implementations, the relevance detector 210 uses the cluster of annotated resources to identify at least one entity that matches or is associated with the user's interests or preferences. The relevance detector 210 can then determine at least one other entity that has an association or relevance with the at least one entity and/or that also matches the user's interests or preferences. In some examples, the relevance detector 210 analyzes the resources of the clusters to identify pairs of entities based on user preferences and/or based on resource or entity relevance determined using detected data similarity.
For example, the relevance detector 210 may use entity names of companies or people included in respective electronic articles of the cluster to identify at least one entity matching the user's commercial interest, company a. Relevance detector 210 may then determine at least one other entity, such as company B, that has a relevance or relevance to company a based on the user's commercial activity interests/preferences.
In some examples, the entities company a and company B may be identified based on a first electronic article having company a in the headline of the first article and based on a second electronic article having company B in the headline of the second article. Further, the relevance between company a and company B may be determined, for example, based on one or more detected similarities between respective text/image content of a first article about company a and a second article about company B.
As described in more detail below, in addition to the relevance detector 210, the server 109 and the system 200 may use other computing logic of the module 202 to determine a first entity and at least one other entity associated with the first entity. For example, module 202 may be used to track at least one trending topic. The trending topic may be determined based on data associated with multiple user search checks, such as unstructured data. Module 202 may then determine entity relevance based on the number of resources describing or including entities or other content with one or more trending topics (described below).
In some examples, the relevance detector 210 may be configured to detect or identify multiple entities, rather than pairs of entities, or to identify multiple pairs of entities. The relevance detector 210 may also be configured to detect multiple sets of entities, wherein a set of entities includes two or more entities.
The relevance detector 210 may access the user interest profile 218 to obtain or determine one or more preferences for identifying the user of the entity. In some implementations, the user profile 218 may be associated with an example user account and may be populated with user preferences based on interests/preferences defined by the user through the user account profile. Additionally or alternatively, the user profile 218 may be populated with user preferences based on interests or preferences associated with the user's online browsing activity or based on various other online resources about the user or various account profiles of the user.
In some implementations, the relevance detector 210 generates respective resource and entity scores that indicate estimated magnitudes of relevance of the electronic resource 216 and its entities to particular interests of respective users. For example, an article resource may include a title of an article and a body of the article describing the substance of the article. For users interested in the business of various companies, an electronic article that includes company a in the title and multiple references to company a throughout the body may receive a relatively high resource-entity score, such as 0.9.
However, including restaurant X in the title, but including only a few references to company A throughout the text, an electronic article may receive a relatively low resource-entity score, such as 0.2. The resource-entity score may be used by the relevance detector 210 to select a subset of resources and corresponding entities from which to identify or detect relevant entities and one or more events. For example, the relevance detector 210 may select a subset of electronic articles and corresponding individual or company names for those articles that have respective resource-entity scores that exceed a threshold score (e.g., 0.7).
In general, the relevance detector 210 can use one or more of the detected data similarities between the resources 216, entity data related to the trending topics, or user interest data to identify two or more related entities associated with a subset of the resources. For at least each pair of identified entities of two or more related entities, the relevance detector 210 can determine the number of resources in which each entity of the pair of entities is associated. From the determined number of resources, the relevance detector 210 may select a subset of resources and corresponding entities from which one or more events may be identified or detected, and each of the one or more events includes the identified related entities.
Event detector 212 receives a subset of the resources and corresponding entities, such as pairs (or sets) of entities identified and selected by relevance detector 210. The subset of resources may be analyzed by event detector 212 to detect one or more events. For example, the event detector 212 may execute software instructions to analyze various resources and entities that have obvious associations or correlations. Based on this analysis, the event detector 212 may detect or identify one or more events described by the resource and involving at least one entity, at least one entity pairing, or at least one collection of entities.
For example, as described in more detail below, the resources in the subset of resources may include electronic articles related to the business of the entity pair, company a and company B. Referring to first content 118 of interface 104, event detector 212 may detect events related to company A in combination with company B and related to a Shifting merger event in the business industry. The event may be associated with or described in a particular resource in the subset of resources received from the relevance detector 212.
Event detector 212 may detect one or more events including pairs or sets of related entities based on existing associations between one or more entities in a subset of resources. In some implementations, the event detector 212 determines the occurrence of an event associated with a particular pair of entities based on the determined number of resources. For example, the event detector 212 may identify a plurality of candidate events associated with a particular pairing of entities based on a subset of resources and then determine an occurrence of an event from among the plurality of candidate events.
The event detector 212 may identify at least one event from among a plurality of candidate events, wherein identifying the event includes selecting one or more resources associated with the event. In some implementations, the selected resource is an electronic article that describes the event or includes text or image content about the event. As described below, the system 200 may provide one or more of the selected resources for output to the user device such that the resources may be viewed by the user via a display of the user device.
The filtering logic 220 may be used by the event detector 212 (or the relevance detector 210) to identify article resources or other media content that indicate events that match at least one interest or preference of a user. For example, referring to fig. 1, individual electronic articles of the first content 112 and the second content 114 may be included in a subset of the resources identified by the relevance detector 210 and received by the event detector 212. Thus, company a and company B may be respective entities that form a pair of entities identified by the relevance detector 210.
Further, as shown in FIG. 1, the article of first content 112 may relate to an event related to company A that relates to a business activity, i.e., acquisition to another company (or merger with another company). While the articles of the second content 114 may relate to events related to company B that are only loosely or slightly related to business. Thus, the resource-entity score of the article resources in the first content 112 may be slightly higher than the resource-entity score of the article resources in the second content 114 based on the user's preference or interest in the article about the commercial activity.
In some implementations, the event detector 212 identifies one or more entities associated with at least one article resource to be provided for output to a user. The event detector 212 (or the relevance detector 210) may use a collaborative filtering algorithm, such as filtering logic 220, to determine one or more interests of the first user based at least on the interests of the one or more second users. Event detector 212 may then utilize the determined interest(s) of the first user to filter or remove at least one event from among the candidate events.
In some implementations, when an event includes an entity that does not match the first user's interest(s) or involves other content or activity that does not match the first user's interest(s), the event may be filtered out or removed from the candidate event. In some examples, filtering the event from the candidate events includes removing at least one article resource from a subset of the resources, wherein the removed article resource is associated with the event.
The filtering logic 220 includes trending content 222 that identifies resource content associated with various trending topics. In some examples, trending content 222 may correspond to computational logic used to track, analyze, and identify various resources related to trending content/topics. As described above, the trending content 222 may be determined based on data associated with a plurality of user Search queries received and processed by an example Search system (e.g., google Search). In some implementations, trending content 222 is determined by analyzing a variety of digital news and social media content generated by one or more web-based information systems.
The event detector 212 may use the trending content 222 to identify or determine event and article resources that describe or include entities or other content corresponding to one or more trending topics. In some implementations, the event detector 212 uses the filtering logic 220 and the trending content 222 to determine event and article resources that correspond to trending topics that also match the interests or preferences of the user.
The event detector 212 may then utilize the determined events corresponding to the trending topics to filter out or remove at least one event from among the candidate events. In some implementations, events may be filtered or removed from candidate events when they include entities that are not identified within trend content 222 and/or do not match the user's interest(s) or involve other content that is not identified within trend content 222 and/or does not match the user's interest(s).
The event detector 212 may use the knowledge graph 214 to detect one or more events including related entities. In some implementations, knowledge graph 214 is used and/or analyzed to determine activities and other content that may indicate events. In some examples, the set or pairing of entities may be determined to have a particularly strong association or correlation based on additional correlation data available via knowledge graph 214.
Knowledge graph 214 may be used to select one or more events from among the candidates received at modules 204 and 206. For example, the event detector 212 may access the knowledge graph 214 to obtain data indicative of events involving at least two entities, wherein the events and entities match a particular interest of the user, such as business or engineering interests. In response to obtaining data from the knowledge graph 214, at least one article resource corresponding to a particular candidate event may be provided to the modules 204 and/or 206 based on a correlation between the obtained data and the particular candidate event.
Knowledge graph 214 may be represented by any of a number of convenient physical data structures. For example, knowledge graph 214 may be represented by triples, where each represents two entities in order and a relationship from a first entity to a second entity; for example, [ alpha, beta, is the father ] or [ alpha, is the father, beta ] is an alternative to representing the same fact. Each entity and each relationship may be included in and will typically be included in multiple triples.
Alternatively, each entity may be stored as a node once, as a record or object, and linked through a linked list data structure to all relationships that the entity has and all other entities related to the entity. More specifically, knowledge graph 214 may be stored as a adjacency list, wherein adjacency information includes relationship information. It is generally advantageous to represent each different entity and each different relationship with a unique identifier.
The entity represented by knowledge graph 214 need not be a tangible thing or a specific person. An entity may include a particular person, place, thing, work of art, concept, event, or other type of entity. Thus, knowledge graph 214 may include data defining relationships between people, such as a joint lead actor in a movie; data defining the relationship between people and things, such as a particular singer recorded a particular song; data defining relationships between places and things, such as that a particular type of wine comes from a particular geographic location; data defining relationships between persons and places, e.g. that a particular person is born in a particular city; and other kinds of relationships between entities.
In some implementations, each node has a type based on the kind of entity that the node represents; and each of these types may have a pattern indicating the kind of data that can be maintained with respect to the entity represented by the node of that type and how that data should be stored. Thus, for example, a node for representing a person's type may have a schema defining fields for information such as birthday, birth location, etc. Such information may be represented by fields in a type-specific data structure, or by triples that look like node-relationship-node triples, such as [ person identifier, occurrence, date ], or in any other convenient predefined manner. Alternatively, some or all of the information indicated by the type schema may be represented by links to nodes in knowledge graph 214; such as [ one person identifier, child, another person identifier ], wherein the other person identifier is a node in the graph.
The resource interest feed module 204 includes a narrative generator 224 and an interest feed populator 226. In some implementations, the functions/features of the narrative generator 224 and interest feed populator 226 described correspond to the computational process of the module 204 enabled by executable software instructions or computational logic. The resource output 228 generally corresponds to a graphical representation that is generated for display to a user via an example user device.
The system 200 may provide the resource output 228 as a resource representation for output to a user via a display of the user device 108. For example, as shown above, the event detector 212 selects at least one event from among a plurality of candidate events and the electronic article resource associated with the event. In some examples, the module 204 receives a plurality of selected events and article resources corresponding to each selected event. The system 200 causes data for accessing the article resources associated with each selected event to be included in the interest feed 116 or 124. The interest feeds 116 and 124 may include data representing the resource output 228, where the interest feeds are provided to the user device 108 for output at the device.
In some implementations, the system 200 generates a representation, such as a resource output 228, that includes a web link to the resource for each selected event and provides the representation for output at the user device 108. For example, the system 200 may generate the resource output 228 based on the resource in which each entity of the pair of entities is associated that describes the selected event. The system 200 can then populate the interest feeds 116 or 124 using the interest feed populator 226 to include the resource output 228 or data related to the content of the resource output 228.
The system 200 may use the narrative generator 224 to generate a narrative or abstract for each resource corresponding to a particular event. For example, the narrative generator 224 may include software instructions of an example data analyzer program for scanning or analyzing electronic text, images, or media content of a resource. In response to analyzing the content of the asset with the data analyzer, the narration generator 224 may generate a data structure including text, images, or media content that provides a narration or summary of the asset.
The system 200 can cause the web links for each resource summary and each resource of the event to be included in the resource output 228 or in the particular interest feed of FIG. 1. In some implementations, the narrative generator 224 may generate text, images, or other data indicating the particular event and the reason why the article resource for the particular event was selected for output to the user. In some examples, the narrative generator 224 may access the user interest profile 218 to generate data informing the user why particular event/resource content is being presented in the user's interest feed.
For example, the reason may be that the resources for a particular entity or event are provided for output to the user based on the user's interest in a particular business or the user's interest in a particular entity. In some implementations, the system 200 causes one or more of the following to be included in the resource output 228 or in the particular interest feed of FIG. 1: i) Article resources; ii) a resource digest; iii) A web link for accessing a resource of an event; and iv) the reason for providing a particular web link or a particular resource describing a particular event.
The inferred interest feed module 206 includes an event type identifier 230 and an inference generator 232. In some implementations, the described functions/features of the event type identifier 230 and the inference generator 232 correspond to the computational process of the module 206 enabled by executable software instructions or computational logic. Similar to the resource output 228, the inference output 234 generally corresponds to a graphical representation generated for display to a user via a display of the user device 108.
The system 200 may provide the inference output 234 as an inference representation for output to a user. In some implementations, the inference output 234 corresponds to a graphical representation of inference data related to a particular event, where the inference data is, for example, a web page, a URL for accessing a web page, or an electronic article. The inference output 234 can include data related to a particular user interest topic or a particular event selected from a group of candidate events identified by the event detector 212.
As indicated above, the system 200 can use the inference generator 232 to identify or predict events to be included in the inferred interest feed 124 based on inferences or predictions that match or relate to a particular interest or preference of a user. In some implementations, the system 200 uses the inference generator 232 to populate the interest feed 124 with additional resource data. The additional resource data may be a web link for accessing online content related to or detailing data about the article resources included in the resource output 228.
The system 200 may use the event type identifier 230 to identify the type of a particular event. For example, event type identifier 230 may include software instructions for analyzing electronic text, images, or media content describing the resources of the event. In response to analyzing the content of the resource, the event type identifier 230 may determine the type of event based on data/information about the event associated with the particular entity pairing. The system 200 may then use the event type identifier 230 to generate a representation indicating the type of event.
For example, the event type identifier 230 may analyze the data content of the resource describing the event. Based on the analyzed data content, the event type identifier 230 may determine that the type of event is a commercial type event, an engineering type event, a world news type event, an entertainment or social media type event, or any other type of event tag that generally describes an event.
Event type identifier 230 may then use the determined event type to generate an example digital banner, e.g., a representation, that includes text or image data indicating the event type. In response to event type identifier 230 determining the event type, system 200 can cause the event type to be included in inference output 234 and provided for output to the user via interest feed 124.
FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process for populating an interest feed. The process 300 may be implemented using the system 200 described above. Thus, the description of process 300 may refer to one or more of the foregoing modules or computing devices of system 200. In some implementations, the described acts of process 300 are enabled by computing logic or software instructions executable by a processor and memory of an example electronic device, such as server 109 or user device 108 described above.
At block 302 of process 300, system 200 receives a plurality of assets, each of which may include electronic media content, such as text data, image data, and other media data/content. For example, the system 200 may receive a plurality of electronic articles including written descriptions and digital pictures related to various topics. The received articles may correspond to article citations indicated via interfaces 102, 104, and 106.
At block 304, for each resource of the plurality of resources, the system 200 may identify an entity associated with the resource. For example, the article may describe entities such as company a and company B, and the system 200 may analyze the data content of the article to parse, copy, or extract entity names and other text content, such as person names and company names.
In some implementations, the system 200 analyzes user interest/preference data received in real-time, or stored interest data, to determine that a user is interested in engineering, physics, or other scientific topics. The system may then identify an entity associated with the resource based on the determined interests of the user. For example, the article may include a written description of a new comment on the Albert Einstein quantum mechanical equation interpreted by popular Engineer X about company Y. Thus, the identified entity may include "engineer X", "company Y", or "albert einstein".
At block 306 of process 300, for each pair of identified entities: the system 200 determines the number of resources in which each entity of the pair of entities is associated. The number of resources may form a subset of online articles that describe a variety of data items related to engineering or physics.
At block 308, the system 200 determines an occurrence of an event associated with the particular pair of entities based on the determined number of resources. Determining the occurrence of an event associated with an entity may include identifying or generating a subset of candidate events and selecting at least one article describing the event.
For example, the system 200 may determine a subset of online articles, e.g., 5-10 articles, that describe quantum mechanics, albert einstein, and/or company X. The system 200 may generate a subset of candidate events related to physics and/or these entities. The system may then use the filtering logic 220 to determine that the user has particular interest in generalized relativity rather than quantum mechanics.
The system 200 may then determine the occurrence of an event by selecting online article resources from a subset of new reviews describing Einstein's perspectives on generalized relatives. The selected articles may describe a physics meeting event about theory of relatedness and a topic discussion material for engineers of the event. Alternatively, another article of choice may describe a publication of a new physics paper that is about to be published about describing an entirely new comment by an engineer about relativistic theory.
At block 310 of process 300, system 200 generates a representation corresponding to the event. The representation may be generated based on an online article in which each entity of the pair of entities is associated. At block 312 of process 300, system 200 provides a representation corresponding to the event for output to user device 108.
The system 200 may use each of the modules 204 and 206 to provide example interest feeds configured as a clear interest feed that may include user favorite content topics and hobbies and include media content related to trending global and local news and other events. For example, the interest feed may include web links to articles and upcoming publications about physics meeting events.
In some implementations, the system 200 uses one or more of these modules to anticipate or predict content that is interesting and important to the user. For example, the system 200 may provide one or more web links to online resources describing scientific data about generalized relatedness based on predicted interests of the user. The system 200 uses the interest feeds to provide web links and other content with annotations indicating summaries of the data, types of content (e.g., physics/science), and reasons for providing the content.

In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and classes of memory. In addition, multiple computing devices 400 may be connected, with each device providing a portion of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server array, a set of blade servers, or a multiprocessor system).
Memory 404 stores information within computing device 400. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, the memory 404 is one or more volatile memory units. In another implementation, the memory 404 is one or more non-volatile memory units.
Storage device 406 is capable of providing mass storage for computing device 400. In one implementation, the storage device 406 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, storage device 406 may be a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configuration. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that when executed perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer-readable medium or machine-readable medium, such as memory 404, storage device 406, or memory on processor 402.
The high speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 400, while the low speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. This allocation of functions is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled to the memory 404, the display 416 (e.g., via a graphics processor or accelerator), and to the high-speed expansion port 410, which high-speed expansion port 910 may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In this implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled to storage device 406 and low-speed expansion port 414. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, bluetooth, ethernet, wireless ethernet), may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, pointing device, scanner, or networking device such as a switch or router (e.g., through a network adapter).
Computing device 400 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown. For example, it may be implemented as a standard server 420, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of a rack server system 424. Furthermore, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as laptop computer 422. Alternatively, components from computing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such as device 450. Each such device may contain one or more of the computing devices 400, 450, and the entire system may be made up of multiple computing devices 400, 450 in communication with each other.
Computing device 450 includes a processor 452, memory 464, input/output devices such as a display 454, a communication interface 466, and a transceiver 468, among other components. Device 450 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a miniature hard disk or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of the components 450, 452, 464, 454, 466, and 468 are interconnected using various buses, and several of the components may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate.
The processor 452 may process instructions for execution within the computing device 450, including instructions stored in the memory 464. The processor may also include separate analog and digital processors. The processor may support, for example, coordination of the other components of the device 450, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by the device 450, and wireless communication by the device 450.
The processor 452 may communicate with a user through a control interface 458 and a display interface 456 coupled to the display 454. The display 454 may be, for example, a TFT LCD display or an OLED display, or other suitable display technology. The display interface 456 may include suitable circuitry for driving the display 454 to present graphical and other information to a user. The control interface 458 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to the processor 452. In addition, an external interface 462 may be provided to communicate with processor 452 to enable near area communication of device 450 with other devices. External interface 462 may, for example, support wired communications (e.g., via a docking process) or support wireless communications (e.g., via bluetooth or other such technology).
Memory 464 stores information within computing device 450. In one implementation, the memory 464 is a computer-readable medium.
