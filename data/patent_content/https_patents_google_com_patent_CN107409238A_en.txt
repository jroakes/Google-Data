Group of family and royal stowage mechanism.Audio, video, the combination of Voice ＆ Video or static map can be included by quoting content
Picture.
Together with content is quoted, the metadata associated with each quoting content item can be stored by quoting repository 106：
Quote the title of content item, international standard record code (ISRC), the artist/director for quoting content item, quote content item
Label is recorded, diversity title/number of content item is quoted, quotes the season of content item, and quotes the performer in content item.One
In a little embodiments, quote content itself and stored by content hosting service 100.In other embodiments, such as people in the art
Member understood, in addition the index of storage content --- fingerprint for example associated with content.
Advocate the upload content that the identification of identification module 109 matches with quoting the reference content identified in repository 106
.The content item matched by opinion identification module 109 relative to reference content is in referred to herein as claim content item.One
In individual embodiment, in order to identify claim content item, advocate that identification module 109 is each for being stored in content repository 102
The each reference content item generation digital finger-print stored in content item and reference repository 106.Advocate identification module 109 with
Afterwards by quote content item digital finger-print with each content item compared with so as to identify including with reference content item at least
The content item for the content that a part matches.Advocate that identification module 109 can be configured to compare using other well known mechanism
Digital content.
If finding matching between quoting content and uploading content, advocate identification module 109 by claim content item
Index is stored in content matching repository 107.In various embodiments, the index of claim content item, which identifies, quotes content
Which partly matches with claim content.
Matched in response to being formed, content hosting service 100 takes action on the content that user is generated.In each implementation
The specific action taken in example is content hosting service 100, quoted set by all sides of content or this combination
The function of strategy, and can for example include allowing content in trust and supply, prevent content, or allow content to retain still
By generating income together with the content serving advertisements for website and all sides of content.
In some cases, third party content can be included by quoting content itself --- that is, quoting carrying for content
Supplier is directed to the content of itself and lack of competence.As a result, advocate that identification module 109 can identify the reference for carrying out self reference repository 106
The matching between content in content and content repository 102, but the matching is third party content while is present in reference
Result in the content generated with user, rather than knot of all policies of content to its actual content with authority be present
Fruit.And then this can result in the content that strategy is generated by mistake applied to user.If for example, content that user is generated
Including the segmentation in public domain, and public domain segmentation is also at and quoted in content, then advocates the energy of identification module 109
Enough find matching.If all sides for quoting content have indicated the content that claim content should be prevented from, and user is generated
Do not include to be prevented from the case that all policies of authority have it any content of authority really even in it.
In order to identify the reference content that may include third party content, reference validation module 110 is carried out as follows.Reference validation
Which of the reference content each matching that module 110 is made for opinion identification module 109 for reference content item determine
Individual (which) is partly responsible for the matching.We will quote and be included at least one user in content and generate in content item
Part be referred to as advocate part.Number of the reference validation module 110 then based on the claim content item including each opinion part
Classify to quoting content item.If advocating that the subset of part is included with the threshold percentage more than claim content item,
Reference validation module 110 is categorized as content item is quoted with the high likelihood for including third party content.The threshold percentage
Claim content item based on multiple average numbers including each opinion part is determined.If the on the contrary, master of claim content item
Open part and be denoted as overall reference content, then the reference content item is categorized as having and included by reference validation module 110
The relatively low possibility of third party content.
Then therefore reference validation module 110 show that quoting content item includes the possibility of third party content and including each main
Open the association between the difference between the number of the claim content item of part.The association is based on following observation：For situation typical
Speech, the only several parts for quoting content are substantially included in a large amount of content items and indicate that the fraction is third party content.It is described
It may be true in particular situations generally to observe, such as wherein only the video of particular game is included in largely by illegal
For the video of competitive sports in identified content item.In one embodiment, reference validation module 110 at it in reference
Hold in the classification of item and consider these outlier schemes.Alternatively, human supervision can identify such concrete condition, and entangle
Positive reference validation module 110 is to falling into the incorrect classification of the reference content within such situation.
Fig. 2 illustrates the reference validation module 110 according to one embodiment.As shown, reference validation module 110 is wrapped
Include sort module 204 and corrective action module 206.For the ease of discussing, following discussion provides for single reference content item
The details of operation of each in these modules.
Whether sort module 204 is confirmed as including third party content and reference content item is divided according to quoting content
Class.In operation, it is different piece that sort module 204, which will quote division of teaching contents,.It is described in the case of audio or video content
Division can make it that each part is corresponding with the unit of the reproduction time of the content based on chronomere.In other implementations
Example in, the division can be based on content, such as video content in it is specific, or based on advocate part distribution, such as
Advocate part wherein beginning and end.How frequently each part for quoting content, sort module 204 determine the part
A part (referred herein as " the part for quoting the matching between content item and uploaded content item as entirety is formed numerously
Matching frequency ").
In order to determine the part matching frequency of given part, sort module 204 determines to include at least one opinion portion first
The sum of the claim content item divided.The part matching frequency of given module then is defined as including in reference by sort module 204
The total percentage of the claim content item of the part held.As an example, table 1 illustrates the part pass for quoting content item A
In the part matching frequency that 100 upload content item C1-C100.Each in content item C1-C100 is claimed identification module
109 are identified as including quoting at least one portion of reference content included in content item A, but not necessarily identical
Part.
Table 1
Referenced items A | Content item including part | Part matching frequency |
Part 1 | C1-C95,C99 | 96% |
Part 2 | C96 | 1% |
Part 3 | C97 | 1% |
Part 4 | C98,C99 | 2% |
Part 5 | C100 | 1% |
According to illustrated example, for uploading what is matched in content item C1-C100 with quoting content A some parts
Each content item, 96% (C1-C95 and C99) in those match with content item A part 1.For example, only 1% item
(C100) matched with part 5.
As another example, table 2 illustrates the part for quoting content item B part for 100 content item C1-C100
Matching frequency.Each in content item C1-C100 is claimed representation module 109 and is identified as including quoting in content item B extremely
A few part, but not necessarily identical part.
Table 2
Item B | Content item including part | Part matching frequency |
Part 1 | C1-C54 | 42% |
Part 2 | C20-C65 | 41% |
Part 3 | C37-C68 | 32% |
Part 4 | C63-C85 | 23% |
Part 5 | C65-C100 | 36% |
Sort module 204 based on the relative mistake between the part matching frequency that is calculated of part for quoting content item come
It is determined that quoting content item includes the possibility of third party content.Especially, sort module 204 determine each part matching frequency and
Mean difference between remainder matching frequency.If the mean difference of at least one portion is higher than such as 50% threshold difference,
The reference content item is categorized as with the high likelihood for including third party content by sort module 204.If on the contrary, in quoting
Hold item various pieces mean difference all in given range within, then sort module 204 by it is described reference content item be categorized as
With the low possibility including third party content.High and low possibility is static measure word --- quotes content item or has
High likelihood including third party content or with the low possibility for including third party content.
In the example shown in table 1, the part matching frequency of part 1 is significantly greater than part 2-5 part matching frequency.Cause
This, quotes content item and is confirmed as with the high likelihood for including third party content.More specifically, part 1 is confirmed as having
High likelihood including third party content.On the contrary, in the example shown in table 2, not no significantly greater than remainder matching frequency
Part matching frequency.Therefore, content item is quoted to be confirmed as with the low possibility for including third party content.
Fig. 3 A are the claim content item numbers according to the opinion part quoted in content item A for including table 1 of one embodiment
The diagram of purpose distribution.As shown, part 1 has the part matching frequency higher than 90%.Remainder, which then has, to be less than
45% part matching frequency.Therefore, based on described obvious poor between part 1 and the part matching frequency of remainder, draw
It is confirmed as with content item A with the high likelihood for including third party content.
On the other hand, in the example shown in table 2, part 1-5 part matching frequency is in same range, that is, is not had
