- the present disclosure addresses the valuation of advertisements that are the subject of ad auctions for placement on a publisher's online website.
- the valuation of an advertisement enables an advertiser, particularly an advertiser bidding for placement of Cost-per-Action (“CPA”)-based advertising, to appropriately set their bids towards maximizing revenue realized from consumers taking action following exposure to their advertisements.
- CPA Cost-per-Action
- Existing CPA bidding products in the online advertisement industry require advertisers to provide a fixed CPA value (e.g., $5) in order for their ads to participate in online ad auctions. That is, in the foregoing example, advertisers pay a fixed $5 fee per qualifying consumer action.
- a qualifying consumer action is a straightforward online purchase, a consumer acquisition (such as a NETFLIX® account signup), a mobile application (“app”) download, or other activity likely to result in immediate and/or future revenue generation.
- the lifetime revenue from each consumer after that consumer is acquired can be variable. For example, a mobile user A that downloads a mobile gaming app may make more in-app purchases of virtual goods than does a mobile user B. Mobile user A therefore generates more revenue for the mobile app developer (the advertiser) than does mobile user B.
- the mobile app developer pays a single flat price (e.g., $5) as the cost for acquiring both mobile app user A and mobile app user B.
- CPA-based advertising is desirable to advertisers, because while the average cost to the advertiser may be higher than the costs associated with either CPM or CPC-based advertising, the risk and incidence of invalid clicks is lower, in that an advertiser is only charged when a definite sale to a consumer, or other qualifying action having a substantial likelihood of leading to a sale occurs.
- the cost that an advertiser pays for placement of an advertisement is fixed, while the revenue that is realized from the consumers that are acquired through qualifying actions is variable.
- AMS 106 can predict the lifetime revenue of the consumers for which AMS 106 bids for placement of advertisements, AMS 106 can bid more aggressively on behalf of the advertiser 102 to place advertisements to those users (consumers) 107 that offer the prospect of generating higher lifetime revenue. More aggressive bidding is anticipated to result in more successful bids to place ads with more lucrative consumers, as well as generally increasing the advertiser's consumer base.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example method 300 implemented using the advertising server system of FIGS. 1 and 2 for valuing an advertisement served to an online consumer.
- AMS 106 acquires and stores 302 in database 146 historical data regarding revenue generated by individual online users (consumers) 107 (shown in FIG. 1 ).
- AMS 106 identifies 304 a specific advertisement from an advertiser 102 to be the subject of a bid for placement with a specific item of online content from a specific publisher 104 , for presentation to a specific consumer 107 .
- AMS 106 identifies 304 the consumer 107 to whom the advertisement potentially may be placed.
- AMS 106 determines 306 the Expected Total Lifetime Revenue that specific consumer 107 may generate through interaction with the specific advertisement.
- “Expected Total Lifetime Revenue” is the sum of past revenue generated by consumer 107 arising directly from interaction with the specific advertisement and/or with similar advertisements, and the predicted total future revenue generated by consumer 107 .
- “similar” advertisements are advertisements having one or more characteristics in common, such as product class, price, etc., as defined by advertiser 102 .
- total future revenue from consumer 107 is calculated using any suitable technique sufficient to enable method 300 to be performed as described.
- a reasonable basis for prediction may be based on the assumption that the consumer's past spending or other activity history, with respect to the same or similar types of advertisements, is an indication of potential future revenue generating activity.
- AMS 106 may retrieve data regarding similarly-situated consumers having past revenue histories, and develop a prediction of future revenue generating activity from that data.
- AMS 106 applies a cutoff standard, so that revenue generated by online activity by consumer 107 may be properly attributed.
- revenue generated as a result of online activity by consumer 107 must be directly attributable to a specific original qualifying action. For example, consumer 107 clicks on an advertisement for a mobile app, and registers for or acquires the mobile app. The act of registration or acquisition is, in itself, a qualifying act for purposes of revenue attribution. If consumer 107 , while operating within the acquired app, makes a further registration, purchase or other qualifying action, any revenue generated during that subsequent qualifying action will be considered as arising from the specific original qualifying action mentioned above.
- AMS 106 retrieves 308 a stored profit threshold previously defined by advertiser 102 and determines 310 the CPA Price (maximum price advertiser 102 is willing to bid).
- profit threshold refers to a numerical value that reflects a minimum profit expectation on the part of advertiser 102 .
- advertiser 102 is permitted to define their profit threshold in one of at least two formats. In one format, the profit threshold is defined as a Lifetime Gross Profit amount specified by advertiser 102 . In another format, the profit threshold is defined as a percentage of the projected Lifetime Gross Revenue, as specified by advertiser 102 . The method by which AMS 106 determines 310 the CPA Price depends upon which format of profit threshold advertiser 102 selects.
- the CPA Price is determined as follows:
- the CPA Price is $1.
- the CPA Price is $10.
- the profit threshold is a percentage of Lifetime Gross Revenue, the percentage defined by advertiser 102 , then the CPA Price is determined as follows:
- AMS 106 determines 312 auction scores for each advertisement.
- an auction score is determined as follows:
- Ademption Probability is the probability that a consumer 107 will a qualifying action after having clicked on an advertisement
- Click Probability is the probability that a consumer 107 will “click” on an advertisement after having had the advertisement presented to them (“an impression”).
- Predicted Auction Discount is a predicted ratio between a final price or winning bid, charged for successful placement of the advertisement on a publisher's website, and the original maximum bid, representing the maximum possible amount each advertiser is willing to pay before the auction occurs.
- the “Predicted Auction Discount” should usually be 1.0 because the ratio between the final price and the maximum bid of each advertisement is always 1.0.
- the “Predicted Auction Discount” is typically between 0 and 1.0, because the auction winner is charged based on the pricing of the runner-up in the auction, and is charged with a final price that is less than the maximum bid.
- Probability, Click Probability and Predicted Auction Discount may be calculated using any suitable known technique that is sufficient to enable the steps of method 300 to be performed as described herein.
- AMS 106 generates auction scores for a predefined number of advertisements to develop 314 a pool of candidate advertisements for presentation to a publisher.
- the candidate advertisements are ranked according to auction score. Accordingly, because auction score is directly proportional to CPA price, the higher a price that advertiser 102 is willing to pay, the higher the auction score for the advertisement is likely to be.
- the methods described herein enable an advertiser 102 to value their advertisements in relation to their estimated lifetime revenues, relative to the specific consumers to whom the advertisements may be presented.

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure relates to online content, and, more particularly, to valuing online content for display to a user, wherein the valuing is based on an expected lifetime revenue of the user.
- Publishers of online content frequently permit the placement of other online content on the publisher's web pages, in exchange for payment. Frequently, this other online content is served to the publishers for placement on the publishers' web pages in a coordinated manner in response to an online user's selection of a publisher's web page. An online content serving system may use certain criteria, such as information relating to a user computer device to identify, select, and serve online content to the publisher.
- Publishers of online content typically require entities that want to display their online content on the publishers' web pages to bid for the opportunity to have their online content placed on the publishers' webpages. The bids take one of several different possible forms, relating to the basis on which a publisher is paid. In one form, a publisher is paid on a cost-per-impression (CPM) basis. Specifically, a publisher is paid a fixed amount for each instance that certain online content is shown to an online user. In another form, a publisher is paid on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis. Specifically, a publisher is paid a fixed amount for each instance that an online user selects or “clicks” on the online content. In still another form, a publisher is paid on a performance-based cost-per-action (“CPA”) basis. Specifically, the publisher is paid a fixed amount, for each instance that an online user takes one of a number of predefined qualifying actions after “clicking” on the online content.
- In an aspect, a computer-implemented method for valuing an advertisement served to an online publisher is provided. The method is implemented using a computer device coupled to a memory device. The method includes storing, within the memory device, past revenue data associated with presenting a plurality of types of advertisements to a selected user. The method includes determining, using the computer device, a total lifetime revenue amount associated with presenting each advertisement type of the plurality of advertisement types to the selected user. The method includes storing, within the memory device, a lifetime profit threshold received from an advertiser associated with serving one of the plurality of advertisement types associated with the advertiser for presentation to the selected user. The method includes determining a price to be charged to the advertiser for serving a first advertisement type of the plurality of advertisement types to the selected user, the price being a function of the determined total lifetime revenue amount and the lifetime profit threshold for the first advertisement type.
- In another aspect, computer-readable storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon are provided. When executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to store past revenue data associated with presenting a plurality of types of advertisements to a selected user. The computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to determine a total lifetime revenue amount associated with presenting each advertisement type of the plurality of advertisement types to the selected user. The computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to store a lifetime profit threshold received from an advertiser associated with serving one of the plurality of advertisement types associated with the advertiser for presentation to the selected user. The computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to determine a price to be charged to the advertiser for serving a first advertisement type of the plurality of advertisement types to the selected user, the price being a function of the determined total lifetime revenue amount and the lifetime profit threshold for the first advertisement type.
- In another aspect, a computer system is provided. The computer system includes a processor and a computer-readable storage device having encoded thereon computer-readable instructions that are executable by the processor. The computer-readable instructions cause the processor to store past revenue data associated with presenting a plurality of types of advertisements to a selected user. The computer-readable instructions further cause the processor to determine a total lifetime revenue amount associated with presenting each advertisement type of the plurality of advertisement types to the selected user. The computer-readable instructions further cause the processor to store a lifetime profit threshold received from an advertiser associated with serving one of the plurality of advertisement types associated with the advertiser for presentation to the selected user. The computer-readable instructions further cause the processor to determine a price to be charged to the advertiser for serving a first advertisement type of the plurality of advertisement types to the selected user, the price being a function of the determined total lifetime revenue amount and the lifetime profit threshold for the first advertisement type.

- The following description refers to the accompanying drawings, in which, in the absence of a contrary representation, the same numbers in different drawings represent similar elements.
- With reference to
FIG. 1 , anexample advertising environment 100 may include one ormore advertisers 102, one ormore publishers 104, an advertisement management system (AMS) 106, and one or more user access devices 108, employed byusers 107, which may be coupled to anetwork 110. Each of theelements FIG. 1 may be implemented or associated with hardware components, software components, or firmware components or any combination of such components. Theelements elements environment 100 can be suitable for distributing other forms of content including other forms of sponsored content. - The
advertisers 102 may include any entities that are associated with advertisements (“ads”). An advertisement or an “ad” refers to any form of communication in which one or more products, services, ideas, messages, people, organizations or other items are identified and promoted (or otherwise communicated). Ads are not limited to commercial promotions or other communications. An ad may be a public service announcement or any other type of notice, such as a public notice published in printed or electronic press or a broadcast. An ad may be referred to or include sponsored content. - Ads may be communicated via various mediums and in various forms. In some examples, ads may be communicated through an interactive medium, such as the Internet, and may include graphical ads (e.g., banner ads), textual ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, or any form of electronically delivered advertisement. Ads may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. Ads could also be communicated through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, radio channels, television channels, print media, and other media.
- The term “ad” can refer to both a single “creative” and an “ad group.” A creative refers to any entity that represents one ad impression. An ad impression refers to any form of presentation of an ad such that it is receivable and viewable by a user. In some examples, an ad impression may occur when an ad is displayed on a display device of a user access device. An ad group refers, for example, to an entity that represents a group of creatives that share a common characteristic, such as having the same ad selection and recommendation criteria. Ad groups can be used to create an ad campaign.
- The
advertisers 102 may provide (or be otherwise associated with) products and/or services related to ads. Theadvertisers 102 may include or be associated with, for example, retailers, wholesalers, warehouses, manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, educational establishments, financial establishments, technology providers, energy providers, utility providers, or any other product or service providers or distributors. - The

Theadvertisers 102 may include or maintain one or moredata processing systems 112, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. Theadvertisers 102 may include or maintain one or more processes that run on one or more data processing systems. - The
publishers 104 may include any entities that generate, maintain, provide, present and/or otherwise process content in theenvironment 100. “Publishers,” in particular, includes authors of online content, wherein authors may be individual persons, or, in the case of works made for hire, the proprietor(s) who hired the individual(s) responsible for creating the online content. The term “content” refers to various types of web-based and/or otherwise presented information, such as articles, discussion threads, reports, analyses, financial statements, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds (e.g., RSS feeds), television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, printed publications, etc. - In some implementations, the
publishers 104 may include content providers with an Internet presence, such as online publication and news providers (e.g., online newspapers, online magazines, television websites, etc.), online service providers (e.g., financial service providers, health service providers, etc.), and the like. Thepublishers 104 can include television broadcasters, radio broadcasters, satellite broadcasters, and other content providers. One or more of thepublishers 104 may represent a content network that is associated with theAMS 106. - The
publishers 104 may receive requests from the user access devices 108 (or other elements in the environment 100) and provide or present content to the requesting devices. The publishers may provide or present content via various mediums and in various forms, including web based and non-web based mediums and forms. Thepublishers 104 may generate and/or maintain such content and/or retrieve the content from other network resources. - In addition to content, the
publishers 104 may be configured to integrate or combine retrieved content with ads that are related or relevant to the retrieved content for display to users. As discussed further below, these relevant ads may be provided from theAMS 106 and be combined with content for display to users. In some examples, thepublishers 104 may retrieve content for display on a particular user access device 108 and then forward the content to the user access device 108 along with code that causes one or more ads from theAMS 106 to be displayed to the user. In other examples, thepublishers 104 may retrieve content, retrieve one or more relevant ads (e.g., from theAMS 106 or the advertisers 102), and then integrate the ads and the article to form a content page for display to the user. - As noted above, one or more of the
publishers 104 may represent a content network. In such an implementation, theadvertisers 102 may be able to present ads to users through this content network. - The
publishers 104 may include or maintain one or moredata processing systems 114, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. They may include or maintain one or more processes that run on data processing systems. In some examples, thepublishers 104 may include one ormore content repositories 124 for storing content and other information. - The
AMS 106 manages ads and provides various services to theadvertisers 102, thepublishers 104, and the user access devices 108. TheAMS 106 may store ads inad repository 136, and conversion data regarding actions inrepository 126, and facilitate the distribution or selective provision and recommendation of ads through theenvironment 100 to the user access devices 108. In some configurations, theAMS 106 may include or access functionality associated with an advertising serving system. - The
AMS 106 may include one or moredata processing systems 116, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. It can also include one or more processes, such as server processes. In some examples, theAMS 106 may include anad serving system 120 and one or morebackend processing systems 118. Thead serving system 120 may include one or moredata processing systems 116 and may perform functionality associated with delivering ads to publishers or user access devices. Thebackend processing systems 118 may include one or moredata processing systems 116 may perform functionality associated with identifying relevant ads to deliver, processing various rules, performing filtering processes, generating reports, maintaining accounts and usage information, and other backend system processing. TheAMS 106 can use thebackend processing systems 118 and thead serving system 120 to selectively recommend and provide relevant ads from theadvertisers 102 through thepublishers 104 to the user access devices 108. - The
AMS 106 may include or access one or more crawling, indexing and searching modules (not shown). These modules may browse accessible resources (e.g., the World Wide Web, publisher content, data feeds, etc.) to identify, index and store information. The modules may browse information and create copies of the browsed information for subsequent processing. The modules may also check links, validate code, harvest information, and/or perform other maintenance or other tasks. - Searching modules may search information from various resources, such as the World Wide Web, publisher content, intranets, newsgroups, databases, and/or directories. The search modules may employ one or more known search or other processes to search data. In some implementations, the search modules may index crawled content and/or content received from data feeds to build one or more search indices. The search indices may be used to facilitate rapid retrieval of information relevant to a search query.
- The
AMS 106 may include one or more interface or frontend modules for providing the various features to advertisers, publishers, and user access devices. For example, theAMS 106 may provide one or more publisher front-end interfaces (PFEs) for allowing publishers to interact with theAMS 106. TheAMS 106 may also provide one or more advertiser front-end interfaces (AFEs) for allowing advertisers to interact with theAMS 106. In some examples, the front-end interfaces may be configured as web applications that provide users with network access to features available in theAMS 106. - The
AMS 106 provides various advertising management features to theadvertisers 102. TheAMS 106 advertising features may allow users to set up user accounts, set account preferences, create ads, select keywords for ads, create campaigns or initiatives for multiple products or businesses, view reports associated with accounts, analyze costs and return on investment, selectively identify consumers in different regions, selectively recommend and provide ads to particular publishers, analyze financial information, analyze ad performance, estimate ad traffic, access keyword tools, add graphics and animations to ads, etc. - The
AMS 106 may allow theadvertisers 102 to create ads and input keywords for which those ads will appear. In some examples, theAMS 106 may provide ads to user access devices or publishers when keywords associated with those ads are included in a user request or requested content. TheAMS 106 may also allow theadvertisers 102 to set bids for ads. A bid may represent the maximum amount an advertiser is willing to pay for each ad impression, user click-through of an ad or other interaction with an ad. A click-through can include any action a user takes to select an ad. Theadvertisers 102 may also choose a currency and monthly budget. - The
AMS 106 may also allow theadvertisers 102 to view information about ad impressions, which may be maintained by theAMS 106. TheAMS 106 may be configured to determine and maintain the number of ad impressions relative to a particular website or keyword. TheAMS 106 may also determine and maintain the number of click-throughs for an ad as well as the ratio of click-throughs to impressions. - The
AMS 106 may also allow theadvertisers 102 to select and/or create conversion types for ads. A “conversion” may occur when a user consummates a transaction related to a given ad. A conversion could be defined to occur when a user clicks on an ad, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. In another example, a conversion could be defined as the display of an ad to a user and a corresponding purchase on the advertiser's web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days). TheAMS 106 may store conversion data and other information in aconversion data repository 136. - The
AMS 106 may allow theadvertisers 102 to input description information associated with ads. This information could be used to assist thepublishers 104 in determining ads to publish. Theadvertisers 102 may additionally input a cost/value associated with selected conversion types, such as a five dollar credit to thepublishers 104 for each product or service purchased. - The
AMS 106 may provide various features to thepublishers 104. TheAMS 106 may deliver ads (associated with the advertisers 102) to the user access devices 108 when users access content from thepublishers 104. TheAMS 106 can be configured to deliver ads that are relevant to publisher sites, site content and publisher audiences. - In some examples, the
AMS 106 may crawl content provided by thepublishers 104 and deliver ads that are relevant to publisher sites, site content and publisher audiences based on the crawled content. TheAMS 106 may also selectively recommend and/or provide ads based on user device information and user device usage, such as particular search queries performed on a search engine website, etc. TheAMS 106 may store user device information in ageneral database 146. In some examples, theAMS 106 can add search services (e.g., a search box) to a publisher site and deliver ads configured to provide appropriate and relevant content relative to search results generated by requests from visitors of the publisher site. A combination of these and other approaches can be used to deliver relevant ads. - The
AMS 106 may allow thepublishers 104 to search and select specific products and services as well as associated ads to be displayed with content provided by thepublishers 104. For example, thepublishers 104 may search through ads in thead repository 136 and select certain ads for display with their content. - The
AMS 106 may be configured to selectively recommend and provide ads created by theadvertisers 102 to the user access devices 108 directly or through thepublishers 104. TheAMS 106 may selectively recommend and provide ads to a particular publisher 104 (as described in further detail herein) or a requesting user access device 108 when a user requests search results or loads content from thepublisher 104. - In some implementations, the
AMS 106 may manage and process financial transactions among and between elements in theenvironment 100. For example, theAMS 106 may credit accounts associated with thepublishers 104 and debit accounts of theadvertisers 102. These and other transactions may be based on conversion data, impressions information and/or click-through rates received and maintained by theAMS 106. - The user access devices 108 may include any devices capable of receiving information from the
network 110. The user access devices 108 could include general computing components and/or embedded systems optimized with specific components for performing specific tasks. Examples of user access devices include personal computers (e.g., desktop computers), mobile computing devices, cell phones, smart phones, media players/recorders, music players, game consoles, media centers, media players, electronic tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs), television systems, audio systems, radio systems, removable storage devices, navigation systems, set top boxes, other electronic devices and the like. The user access devices 108 can also include various other elements, such as processes running on various machines. - The
network 110 may include any element or system that facilitates communications among and between various network nodes, such aselements network 110 may include one or more telecommunications networks, such as computer networks, telephone or other communications networks, the Internet, etc. Thenetwork 110 may include a shared, public, or private data network encompassing a wide area (e.g., WAN) or local area (e.g., LAN). In some implementations, thenetwork 110 may facilitate data exchange by way of packet switching using the Internet Protocol (IP). Thenetwork 110 may facilitate wired and/or wireless connectivity and communication. -
Environment 100 further includes awebsite 148 including one or more resources 149 (e.g., text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts) associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.Resources 149 can be relatively static (e.g., as in a publisher's webpage) or dynamically generated in response to user query (e.g., as in a search engine's result page). - User devices 108 can request
resources 149 from awebsite 148. In turn, build data representing theresource 149 can be provided to the user access device 108 for presentation by the user access device 108. The build data representing theresource 149 can also include data specifying an ad slot in which advertisements can be presented. - When a
resource 149 is requested by a user access device 108, theadvertisement management system 106 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with theresource 149. The request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots (e.g., size, web address of the resource, media type of the requested advertisement, etc.) that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to theadvertisement management system 106. - Based on data included in the request for advertisements, the
advertisement management system 106 can identify advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request. For example, eligible advertisements can have characteristics matching the characteristics of available advertisement slots and have ad serving keywords that match the specified resource keywords or search queries. - Each
advertiser 102 can create one or more advertising campaigns using various campaign parameters that are used to control distribution of the advertiser's advertisements. Each advertising campaign can include one or more ad groups that have modified campaign parameters that are specific to the ad group. Examples of campaign parameters can include ad serving keywords and corresponding bids, geographic or other factors used to facilitate ad serving, delivery period, content network, keyword match type, as well as other parameters corresponding to one or more advertisements. The campaign data can be stored in thecampaign data store 150. Theadvertisement management system 106 can retrieve the information in thecampaign data store 150 when preparing a response to an ad request. - Parameters related to an advertisement can include, for example, creative identifier, creative name, creative type, size, first line, web address of the landing page, display URL, media type, and so on. One of the creative types that an advertiser can specify for an ad is the dynamic ad type. The advertiser can provide an ad template as the creative, and the ad template can be selected (e.g., in the same manner as other types of creatives) to fulfill a received ad request for an available advertisement slot. When an ad template (or in other words, a dynamic ad creative) is selected to fulfill an ad request, a dynamic ad can be generated on-the-fly based on the ad template to fulfill the ad request.
- The ad template can specify the general appearance, such as an invariable portion of the content and some aspects of the appearance and format of the dynamic ad. The invariable portion of the content and aspects of the dynamic ad remains the same across multiple dynamic ads generated using the same ad template.
- In addition to specifying the invariable portion of the dynamic ad, the ad template also leaves some content or aspects of format and appearance of the dynamic ad unspecified. Instead, the ad template can specify one or more component slots which prescribe the requirements for data items (or components) that can be used to provide the unspecified content and aspects of format and appearance to complete the dynamic ad. Components having component characteristics (e.g., content, structural format, function, or other attributes) that satisfy the requirements of the component slots can be selected and inserted into the component slots to complete the dynamic ad. In some implementations, the ad templates can also specify how a selected component is applied to the component slot, such as the size, font, color, position, etc. of the selected component as the component appears in the dynamic ad.
- The advertisers can specify multiple dynamic ad creatives or ad templates for use in the advertiser's ad campaigns. The ad templates can be stored along with other creatives (e.g., static image ads, video ads, text ads, etc.) in the
campaign data store 150. In some implementations, the ad templates can be stored separately from the other types of creatives, for example, in an adtemplate data store 152. Individual ad templates can be retrieved by theadvertisement management system 106 by the templates' creative IDs. - The
advertisement management system 106 can have access to a large number of available components of various types, for example, through a component data feedstore 156. The components can have varying content. The component data feedstore 156 can be provided and updated by the advertiser from time to time. In some implementations, the component data feedstore 156 can be linked to the advertiser's product catalogs or other business data stores, such that real-time data can be made available to theadvertisement management system 106 without active intervention by the advertiser. - The
advertisement management system 106 can select components from among the large number of components available in the component data feedstore 156. Theadvertisement management system 106 can also apply the selected components to the component slots in a dynamic ad according to the specifications in an ad template selected from the adtemplate data store 152. Once the dynamic ad is constructed using the selected components, the dynamic ad can be provided by an advertisement management system to fulfill the received ad request. In some implementations, acomponent selection module 158 can be implemented to carry out actions related to component selection. Thecomponent selection module 158 can be part of theadvertisement management system 106 or a standalone module in communication with theadvertisement management system 106. - When the
advertisement management system 106 selects components for the selected ad template in response to a received ad request, theadvertisement management system 106 observes the business rules including the co-occurrence constraints specified for the selected ad template. The business rules can be specified by the advertiser through an interface provided by theadvertisement management system 106. The business rules can be stored in the campaign data store along with other campaign data. Alternatively, the business rules can be stored in a businessrule data store 154 apart from other types of campaign data. The business rules can be campaign specific, ad group specific, or ad template specific, for example. - For purposes of explanation only, certain aspects of this disclosure are described with reference to the discrete elements illustrated in
FIG. 1 . The number, identity and arrangement of elements in theenvironment 100 are not limited to what is shown. For example, theenvironment 100 can include any number of geographically-dispersedadvertisers 102,publishers 104 and/or user access devices 108, which may be discrete, integrated modules or distributed systems. Similarly, theenvironment 100 is not limited to asingle AMS 106 and may include any number of integrated or distributed AMS systems or elements. - Furthermore, additional and/or different elements not shown may be contained in or coupled to the elements shown in
FIG. 1 , and/or certain illustrated elements may be absent. In some examples, the functions provided by the illustrated elements could be performed by less than the illustrated number of components or even by a single element. The illustrated elements could be implemented as individual processes run on separate machines or a single process running on a single machine. - An advertiser can specify parameters of advertising campaigns and advertisements through an advertisement management system. The advertisement management system can receive ad requests from user devices and select ads according to information in the ad requests and the parameters of the advertising campaigns. The ads that are delivered can include dynamically generated ads as described above.
-
FIG. 2 illustrates anexample data flow 200 within theenvironment 100. Thedata flow 200 is an example only and not intended to be restrictive. Other data flows may therefore occur in theenvironment 100 and, even with thedata flow 200, the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. - In the
data flow 200, theAMS 106 stores ads from theadvertisers 102 and receivesad decisions 202 from aparticular publisher 104. Thead decisions 202 can include decisions to approve and/or disapprove certain ads and/or advertisers. These ad decisions can be based on aggregated ratings or scores, associated with ads/advertisers that are provided to thepublisher 104 by theAMS 106. Such aggregated scores can represent ratings of ads/advertisers received frommultiple publishers 104. - During the
data flow 200, thepublisher 104 may receive acontent request 204 from a particular user access device 108. Thecontent request 204 may, for example, include a request for a web document on a given topic (e.g., automobiles). In response to thecontent request 204, thepublisher 104 may retrieve relevant content (e.g., an automobile article) from thecontent repository 124 or some other source. - The
publisher 104 may respond to thecontent request 204 by sending acontent page 206 or other presentation to the requesting user access device 108. Thecontent page 206 may include the requested content 208 (e.g., the automobile article) as well as a code “snippet” 205 associated with an ad. A code “snippet” refers, for example, to a method used by one device (e.g., a server) to ask another device (e.g., a browser running on a client device) to perform actions after or while downloading information. In some examples, a code “snippet” may be implemented in JAVASCRIPT® code or may be part of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or other web page markup language or content. - The
AMS 106 may provide thecode snippet 205 to thepublisher 104 and/or the user access device 108. The code snippet can originate and/or be provided from other sources. As the requesting user access device 108 loads thecontent page 206, thecode snippet 205 causes the user access device 108 to contact theAMS 106 and receive additional code (e.g., JAVASCRIPT® or the like), which causes thecontent page 206 to load with anad portion 210. - The
ad portion 210 may include any element that allows information to be embedded within thecontent page 206. In some examples, thead portion 210 may be implemented as an HTML element, such an I-Frame (inline frame) or other type of frame. Thead portion 210 may be hosted by theAMS 106 or thepublisher 104 and may allow content (e.g., ads) from theAMS 106 or thepublisher 104 to be embedded inside thecontent page 206. Parameters associated with the ad portion 210 (e.g., its size and shape) can be specified in the content page 206 (e.g., in HTML), so that the user access device 108 can present thecontent page 206 while thead portion 210 is being loaded. Other implementations ofad portion 210 may also be used. - The
ad portion 210 may send theAMS 106 formatting andcontent information 212. Thisinformation 212 may include information describing the manner (e.g., how, when, and/or where) in which ads can be rendered by the user access devices 108. Theinformation 212 may also include ad attributes and parameters, such as size, shape, color, font, presentation style (e.g., audio, video, graphical, textual, etc.), etc. Theinformation 212 may also specify a quantity of ads desired. - The formatting and
content information 212 can include information associated with the requestedcontent 208 displayed incontent page 206. Such information may include a URL associated with the requestedcontent page 206. Theinformation 212 can include the requested content itself, a category corresponding to the requested content or the content request, part or all of thecontent request 204, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, and the like. - In response to the
information 212, theAMS 106 may provide the user access device 108 withad information 214. Thead information 214 may include one ormore ads 225 for placement in thead portion 210 of thecontent page 206. Thead information 214 may also include a signed or encoded specification of an ad. - The
ad information 214 may include ads that are relevant to user interest. TheAMS 106 may retrieve and provide relevant ads based on theinformation 212 received from the user access device 108. TheAMS 106 may retrieve thead information 214 from thead repository 136 using thebackend processing systems 118. TheAMS 106 may retrieve relevant ads using information from a crawling module, various keywords, various statistical associations between ads and content, and/or preference information associated with the publishers. - The
AMS 106 may decide whether to serve certain ads with publisher content based on thead decision 202 received from thepublisher 104. For example, theAMS 106 may identify a relevant ad from thead repository 136 based on keywords but may decide that the ad should not be served with the publisher content (e.g., the requested automobile document) because thepublisher 104 has indicated in the ad decisions 202 a disapproval of the identified ad. In some examples, these ad serving decisions may be based on rules maintained by thebackend processing systems 118. - The
ad portion 210 may populate with ads included in thead information 214, such asads 225. Thead portion 210 and the displayedads 225 may occupy a portion of thecontent page 206, which may be distinct from other content (e.g., the requested content 208) in thecontent page 206. - When a user clicks on the displayed
ad 225, an embedded code snippet may direct the user access device 108 to contact theAMS 106. During this event, the user access device 108 may receive an information parcel, such as a signed browser cookie, from theAMS 106. This information parcel can include information, such as an identifier of the selectedad 225, an identifier of thepublisher 104, and the date/time thead 225 was selected by the user. The information parcel may facilitate processing of conversion activities or other user transactions. - The user access device 108 may then be redirected to the
advertiser 102 associated with the selectedad 225. The user access device 108 may send arequest 216 to the associatedadvertiser 102 and then load alanding page 218 from theadvertiser 102. The user may then perform a conversion action at thelanding page 218, such as purchasing a product or service, registering, joining a mailing list, etc. Acode snippet 220, which may be provided by theAMS 106, may be included within a conversion confirmation page script, such as a script within a web page presented after the purchase. The user access device 108 may execute thecode snippet 220, which may then contact theAMS 106 andreport conversion data 222 to theAMS 106. Theconversion data 222 may include conversion types and numbers as well as information from cookies. Theconversion data 222 may be maintained in theconversion data repository 126. -
FIG. 2 is an example only and not intended to be restrictive. Other data flows may therefore occur in theenvironment 100 and, even with thedata flow 200, the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. Further, the illustrated events may overlap and/or may exist in fewer steps. Moreover, certain events may not be present and additional and/or different events may be included. - In alternative data flows, the
AMS 106 can allow advertisers to approve publishers in a manner similar to the manner in which publishers approve advertisers. In such data flows, theAMS 106 can receive publisher decisions (i.e., decisions about publishers) from one ormore advertisers 102. The publisher decisions made by advertisers can include approvals and disapprovals of certain publishers. These approval/disapproval decisions can be based on aggregated scores, associated with publishers that are provided to advertisers. The aggregated scores can represent ratings of publishers received frommultiple advertisers 102. When providing relevant ads to the user access devices 108, theAMS 106 may take into account these publisher approvals/disapprovals. For example, theAMS 106 may decide to not provide an otherwise relevant ad to a given publisher based on the advertiser's disapproval of that publisher. Not providing a relevant ad to a publisher can include not bidding in an auction for publisher ad space. - In alternative data flows, the
publisher 104 can send an ad request to theAMS 106 prior to sending a content page to the user access device 108. TheAMS 106 may respond by sending relevant ads to thepublisher 104. Thepublisher 104 may combine the received ads with requested content in the content page and then send the content page, including the ad portion, to the user access device 108 for display to a user. - In alternative data flows, the
AMS 106 may selectively recommend and provide ads to the user access devices 108 based on search terms provided by the user access devices 108. In these dataflows, theAMS 106 may provide searching services and receive search terms directly from the user access devices. TheAMS 106 can also receive search terms from a dedicated searching system that receives user search requests. TheAMS 106 may selectively recommend and provide ads to the user access devices based on the received search terms and ad keywords provided by the advertisers. Other modifications to thedata flow 200 are also possible. - In situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- As described herein, the present disclosure addresses the valuation of advertisements that are the subject of ad auctions for placement on a publisher's online website. The valuation of an advertisement enables an advertiser, particularly an advertiser bidding for placement of Cost-per-Action (“CPA”)-based advertising, to appropriately set their bids towards maximizing revenue realized from consumers taking action following exposure to their advertisements. Existing CPA bidding products in the online advertisement industry require advertisers to provide a fixed CPA value (e.g., $5) in order for their ads to participate in online ad auctions. That is, in the foregoing example, advertisers pay a fixed $5 fee per qualifying consumer action. In the example embodiment, a qualifying consumer action is a straightforward online purchase, a consumer acquisition (such as a NETFLIX® account signup), a mobile application (“app”) download, or other activity likely to result in immediate and/or future revenue generation. However, the lifetime revenue from each consumer after that consumer is acquired can be variable. For example, a mobile user A that downloads a mobile gaming app may make more in-app purchases of virtual goods than does a mobile user B. Mobile user A therefore generates more revenue for the mobile app developer (the advertiser) than does mobile user B. However, using current CPA advertising methods, the mobile app developer pays a single flat price (e.g., $5) as the cost for acquiring both mobile app user A and mobile app user B.
- CPA-based advertising is desirable to advertisers, because while the average cost to the advertiser may be higher than the costs associated with either CPM or CPC-based advertising, the risk and incidence of invalid clicks is lower, in that an advertiser is only charged when a definite sale to a consumer, or other qualifying action having a substantial likelihood of leading to a sale occurs. However, as previously stated, the cost that an advertiser pays for placement of an advertisement is fixed, while the revenue that is realized from the consumers that are acquired through qualifying actions is variable.
- However, if
AMS 106 can predict the lifetime revenue of the consumers for whichAMS 106 bids for placement of advertisements,AMS 106 can bid more aggressively on behalf of theadvertiser 102 to place advertisements to those users (consumers) 107 that offer the prospect of generating higher lifetime revenue. More aggressive bidding is anticipated to result in more successful bids to place ads with more lucrative consumers, as well as generally increasing the advertiser's consumer base. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample method 300 implemented using the advertising server system ofFIGS. 1 and 2 for valuing an advertisement served to an online consumer. In the example embodiment,AMS 106 acquires andstores 302 indatabase 146 historical data regarding revenue generated by individual online users (consumers) 107 (shown inFIG. 1 ). During an online advertisement placement auction,AMS 106 identifies 304 a specific advertisement from anadvertiser 102 to be the subject of a bid for placement with a specific item of online content from aspecific publisher 104, for presentation to aspecific consumer 107.AMS 106 identifies 304 theconsumer 107 to whom the advertisement potentially may be placed. -
AMS 106 then determines 306 the Expected Total Lifetime Revenue thatspecific consumer 107 may generate through interaction with the specific advertisement. As used herein, “Expected Total Lifetime Revenue” is the sum of past revenue generated byconsumer 107 arising directly from interaction with the specific advertisement and/or with similar advertisements, and the predicted total future revenue generated byconsumer 107. As used herein, “similar” advertisements are advertisements having one or more characteristics in common, such as product class, price, etc., as defined byadvertiser 102. In the example embodiment, total future revenue fromconsumer 107 is calculated using any suitable technique sufficient to enablemethod 300 to be performed as described. For example, presuming that thespecific consumer 107 in question has a past revenue history, a reasonable basis for prediction may be based on the assumption that the consumer's past spending or other activity history, with respect to the same or similar types of advertisements, is an indication of potential future revenue generating activity. Alternatively, if thespecific consumer 107 does not have a past revenue history with respect to the specific advertisement or type of advertisement,AMS 106 may retrieve data regarding similarly-situated consumers having past revenue histories, and develop a prediction of future revenue generating activity from that data. - In determining 306 Expected Total Lifetime Revenue,
AMS 106 applies a cutoff standard, so that revenue generated by online activity byconsumer 107 may be properly attributed. In one embodiment, revenue generated as a result of online activity byconsumer 107 must be directly attributable to a specific original qualifying action. For example,consumer 107 clicks on an advertisement for a mobile app, and registers for or acquires the mobile app. The act of registration or acquisition is, in itself, a qualifying act for purposes of revenue attribution. Ifconsumer 107, while operating within the acquired app, makes a further registration, purchase or other qualifying action, any revenue generated during that subsequent qualifying action will be considered as arising from the specific original qualifying action mentioned above. That is, actions taking place within an acquired application are not considered to be revenue generators in their own right; rather, revenue from such actions is attributed to the original qualifying action. This is one example of a possible cutoff standard. In alternative embodiments, other cutoff standards may be applied, provided that the cutoff standards are applied uniformly, so as to enable the methods and systems of the present disclosure to function as described herein. - After total lifetime revenue has been determined 306,
AMS 106 retrieves 308 a stored profit threshold previously defined byadvertiser 102 and determines 310 the CPA Price (maximum price advertiser 102 is willing to bid). As used herein, “profit threshold” refers to a numerical value that reflects a minimum profit expectation on the part ofadvertiser 102. In an example embodiment,advertiser 102 is permitted to define their profit threshold in one of at least two formats. In one format, the profit threshold is defined as a Lifetime Gross Profit amount specified byadvertiser 102. In another format, the profit threshold is defined as a percentage of the projected Lifetime Gross Revenue, as specified byadvertiser 102. The method by whichAMS 106 determines 310 the CPA Price depends upon which format ofprofit threshold advertiser 102 selects. - For example, if
advertiser 102 selects the profit threshold to be the minimum Lifetime Gross Profit amount thatadvertiser 102 requires, then the CPA Price is determined as follows: -
CPA Price=Expected Total Lifetime Revenue−Advertiser-Defined Lifetime Gross Profit - Assuming
advertiser 102 requires a minimum Lifetime Gross Profit of $10, for aconsumer 107 that generates $11 of Expected Total Lifetime Revenue, the CPA Price is $1. For aconsumer 107 that generates $20 of Expected Total Lifetime Revenue, the CPA Price is $10. - However, if
advertiser 102 selects the profit threshold to be a percentage of Lifetime Gross Revenue, the percentage defined byadvertiser 102, then the CPA Price is determined as follows: -
CPA Price=Expected Total Lifetime Revenue×(1−% of Lifetime Gross Revenue) - Assuming that
advertiser 102 sets the percentage of total Lifetime Gross Revenue to be 50%, then for aconsumer 107 expected to generate $11 of Expected Total Lifetime Revenue, the CPA Price is $5.5, while for aconsumer 107 expected to generate $20 of Expected Total Lifetime Revenue, the CPA Price is $10. - Once CPA Prices for one or more advertisements eligible for an auction have been determined 310,
AMS 106 determines 312 auction scores for each advertisement. In one embodiment, an auction score is determined as follows: -
- where “Action Probability” is the probability that a
consumer 107 will a qualifying action after having clicked on an advertisement; and “Click Probability” is the probability that aconsumer 107 will “click” on an advertisement after having had the advertisement presented to them (“an impression”). “Predicted Auction Discount” is a predicted ratio between a final price or winning bid, charged for successful placement of the advertisement on a publisher's website, and the original maximum bid, representing the maximum possible amount each advertiser is willing to pay before the auction occurs. For example, in a “first price” auction (which is one in which each bidder bids the maximum that they are willing to pay without regard or possibly even knowledge of other bidders' bids and the winning bidder pays the amount of their bid), the “Predicted Auction Discount” should usually be 1.0 because the ratio between the final price and the maximum bid of each advertisement is always 1.0. In a “second price” auction (which is one in which the winning bidder only pays based on the amount of the second-highest bid), the “Predicted Auction Discount” is typically between 0 and 1.0, because the auction winner is charged based on the pricing of the runner-up in the auction, and is charged with a final price that is less than the maximum bid. Action Probability, Click Probability and Predicted Auction Discount may be calculated using any suitable known technique that is sufficient to enable the steps ofmethod 300 to be performed as described herein. -
AMS 106 generates auction scores for a predefined number of advertisements to develop 314 a pool of candidate advertisements for presentation to a publisher. Typically, the candidate advertisements are ranked according to auction score. Accordingly, because auction score is directly proportional to CPA price, the higher a price thatadvertiser 102 is willing to pay, the higher the auction score for the advertisement is likely to be. The methods described herein enable anadvertiser 102 to value their advertisements in relation to their estimated lifetime revenues, relative to the specific consumers to whom the advertisements may be presented. -
FIG. 4 is a diagram of an example computing devices/systems FIG. 1 . More specifically,FIG. 4 shows an example of ageneric computing device 400 and a genericmobile computing device 450, which may be used with the techniques described here.Computing device 400 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 450 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smart phones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be for the purpose of example only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the disclosures described and/or claimed in this document. -
Computing device 400 includes aprocessor 402,memory 404, astorage device 406, a high-speed interface/controller 408 connecting tomemory 404 and high-speed expansion ports 410, and a low speed interface/controller 412 connecting tolow speed bus 414 andstorage device 406. Each of thecomponents processor 402 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 400, including instructions stored in thememory 404 or on thestorage device 406 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 416 coupled tohigh speed interface 408. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 400 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 404 stores information within thecomputing device 400. In one implementation, thememory 404 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 404 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Thememory 404 may also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk. - The
storage device 406 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 400. In one implementation, thestorage device 406 may be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product may also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 404, thestorage device 406, or memory onprocessor 402. - The
high speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 400, while thelow speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is for purposes of example only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled tomemory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled tostorage device 406 and low-speed buss 414. The low-speed expansion port, which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The
computing device 400 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as astandard server 420, or multiple times in a group of such servers. It may also be implemented as part of arack server system 424. In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 422. Alternatively, components fromcomputing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such ascomputing device 450. Each of such devices may contain one or more ofcomputing device multiple computing devices -
Computing device 450 includes aprocessor 452,memory 464, an input/output device such as adisplay 454, acommunication interface 466, and atransceiver 468, among other components. Thecomputing device 450 may also be provided with a storage device, such as a microdrive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of thecomponents - The
processor 452 can execute instructions within thecomputing device 450, including instructions stored in thememory 464. The processor may be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. The processor may provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of thecomputing device 450, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by computingdevice 450, and wireless communication bycomputing device 450. -
Processor 452 may communicate with a user throughcontrol interface 458 anddisplay interface 456 coupled to adisplay 454. Thedisplay 454 may be, for example, a TFT LCD (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 456 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 454 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 458 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 452. In addition, anexternal interface 462 may be provide in communication withprocessor 452, so as to enable near area communication ofcomputing device 450 with other devices.External interface 462 may provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces may also be used. - The
memory 464 stores information within thecomputing device 450. Thememory 464 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units.Expansion memory 474 may also be provided and connected tocomputing device 450 throughexpansion interface 472, which may include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface.Such expansion memory 474 may provide extra storage space forcomputing device 450, or may also store applications or other information forcomputing device 450. Specifically,expansion memory 474 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example,expansion memory 474 may be provide as a security module forcomputing device 450, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use ofcomputing device 450. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory may include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory, as discussed below. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the
memory 464,expansion memory 474, or memory onprocessor 452 that may be received, for example, overtransceiver 468 orexternal interface 462. -
Computing device 450 may communicate wirelessly throughcommunication interface 466, which may include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary.Communication interface 466 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 468. In addition, short-range communication may occur, such as using a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System)receiver module 470 may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data tocomputing device 450, which may be used as appropriate by applications running oncomputing device 450. -
Computing device 450 may also communicate audibly usingaudio codec 460, which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information.Audio codec 460 may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset ofcomputing device 450. Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating oncomputing device 450. - The
computing device 450 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 480. It may also be implemented as part of asmart phone 482, personal digital assistant, a computer tablet, or other similar mobile device. - Thus, various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” “computer-readable medium” refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The “machine-readable medium” and “computer-readable medium,” however, do not include transitory signals. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
- To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
