Definitions
- This description relates generally to communications delivered by computer messages.
- Messages such as emails, social media posts, online chat discussions, or other electronic communication may include a reference to external or attached content.
- External content may include, for example, a PDF, a link to a webpage, a document, a video, any multimedia content, or an attachment.
- US patent number US 8,185,448 B1 presents a fact checking system which verifies the correctness of information and/or characterizes the information by comparing the information with one or more sources.
- US patent application publication number US 2010/223341 A1 presents providing for electronic messaging tailored to contexts or interests of one or more participants of electronic communication.
- European patent application publication number EP 2 249 261 A1 presents recommendations for content generated based on social networking communities.
- US patent number US 8,060,463 B1 presents a matching service which matches users to other users, and/or to user communities, based at least in part on computer analysis of event data reflective of user behaviors.
- US patent application publication number US 2011/300884 A1 presents an apparatus including a messaging module configured to suggest a message segment in order to draft a message.
- the summarized content reflects the interests of the recipient.
- the summarized content may also reflect common interests of the sender and the recipient.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 102.
- the system 102 can be implemented on one or more computers that communicate, for example, through a network.
- the system receives messages 104 with a reference to external content from a client device 106 and generates revised messages 108 with summarized content that includes extracts from the external content.
- Each message 104 is an electronic communication such as an e-mail, post, text message, etc.
- the message 104 can be, for example, in text form or in other forms, for example, in audio form or in image form.
- the summarized content may be produced by an automatic process that reduces a document (e.g., the external content) using a computer program to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. Technologies that can make a coherent summary may take into account variables such as length, writing style, and syntax. Personalization technology described here may enable dynamic insertion, customization, or suggestion of summarized content in any format that is relevant to an individual user, for example based on one or more of the user's behavior, implied preferences, and based on explicitly given information.
- the personalization may include relevant concepts which may be referred to here as "entities" (an "entity" may be a person, place, thing, or concept). Such entities may be extracted from documents using concept mining, which may involve aspects of artificial intelligence, statistics, data mining, and text mining.
- the system 102 and the client device 106 can communicate through a network, for example, an intranet or the Internet. While the system 102 and the client device 106 are shown as two separate devices, in some implementations, the system 102 and the client device 106 can be the same device.
- the system 102 includes an indexing engine 110 and a ranking engine 112.
- the indexing engine 110 maintains an index 114 for use by the system 102.
- the indexing engine 110 processes documents and updates index entries in the index 114, for example, using conventional or other indexing techniques.
- the system 102 may maintain a user interest data store 120.
- the user interest data store 120 may include one or more entities, websites, text, search queries, demographic data, or other user interest information that may be used by system 102.
- the user interest data store 120 may classify search queries by user, by frequency, by location, and by date or time, where the user consents to the use of such data.
- the user interest data store 120 may be included as part of index 114.
- a user interest engine 130 may analyze message 104 to determine if one or more terms from the message are associated with a recipient's interest, using user interest data store 120, for example, and in the cases where the users consent to the use of such data.
- the user interest engine 130 may use the user interest data store 120 to identify interests in the message using techniques described herein, for example as discussed in more detail below with respect to FIGs. 2-4 .
- user interest engine 130 may analyze a message to locate one or more terms from the message 104 in common with an interest of a recipient of the message 104.
- a summary engine 140 may use the results of that analysis to generate a summarized content for a referenced external content (e.g., an attachment or a link) referenced by or associated with the message.
- the ranking engine 112 may use the index 114 to identify information, such as portions of documents or quick-links to parts of the document related to the message 104, for example, using conventional or other information retrieval techniques.
- the ranking engine 112 calculates scores for the entities in the documents, for example, using one or more ranking signals.
- Each signal provides information about the document itself or the relationship between the document and the message.
- One example signal is a measure of the overall quality of the document.
- Another example signal is a measure of the number of times the terms of the message occur in the document or in a portion of the document. Other signals can also be used.
- the ranking engine 112 ranks the responsive documents or portions of documents using the scores.
- user interest engine 130 and summary engine 140 are depicted as part of ranking engine 112, in various implementations, user interest engine 130 or summary engine 140 may be included as part of indexing engine 110, or as a separate, single engine within system 102.
- a sender of a message 104 might include the subject of the message 104 as "beach vacations" and attached external content (e.g., a document about Florida) to the message 104, without any detailed explanation of the document.
- the recipient may not want to review or scroll through the entire document to find relevant information, especially if the document is long.
- the summary engine 140 may therefore provide a summarized content for the document that refers to a "Florida beach vacation package for $1000" to be included as part of the message 104 (e.g., as message 108).
- the summarized content may be an extract of text from the document.
- Other examples of summaries generated by the system 102 are described in more detail below with respect to FIGs. 2-6 .
- FIG. 2 is an example user interface.
- a system such as system 102 may present a user interface 200 including a message 202.
- the message 202 is an e-mail message.
- the message could be a social media post, a text message, or other electronic communication.
- the message 202 includes a recipient name 204, a title 206, a greeting 207, text 208, a link 210, and an attachment 220.
- a sender is drafting an e-mail to a recipient 204 "Bob Jones" with the title 206 "Nuclear Physics Article You Might Like".
- the greeting 207 "Hi Bob,” and text 208 of the message may be entered and edited by the sender in any e-mail application, web-based email program, etc.
- the sender includes a link 210 to external content (a website entitled “Popular science Futurist Mitchio Kaku theories about technology.") and an attachment 220 "Physics-Article.pdf'.
- the system 102 In the instance where a user consents to the use of such data, the system 102 generates personalized summaries of each of the external contents-i.e., of the website from the link 210 and of the content of attachment 220.
- the personalized summaries include summarized content 212 and summarized content 222.
- the system may gather entities from the context of the message 202, and use the entities to emphasis content in the summarized content 212 or the summarized content 222. For example, in the message 202 the title 206 includes "Nuclear Physics".
- the system may use the entity "nuclear physics", which was gathered from the context, to emphasize content related to nuclear physics in the summarized content 212.
- the system 102 in the instance where a user consents to the use of such data, the system 102 generates the personalized summaries automatically as the sender types the message 202.
- the system creates the summarized content 212 and summarized content 222 after a sender requests such summary generation.
- the system generates the summaries after the sender hits the "send" button 230.
- the sender may not view the summarized content 212 and summarized content 222 before sending the message 202, but the recipient would see the summaries in the e-mail message 202 upon receiving the message 202.
- the sender may view the message 202 with the summarized content 212 and summarized content 222 in a sent message folder of an e-mail application after the e-mail is sent.
- summarized content can take various forms. For example summarized content 222 is shown in a pop-up style window which may appear if a user hovers a cursor over attachment 220, or may appear as text within message 202. Summarized content 212 appears as text below link 210.
- the sender may review and customize the summarized content (e.g., change or add to) or remove the summarized content 212 and summarized content 222 before sending the message 202 (e.g., before hitting the send button 230.) For example, a sender may wish to customize the text even more specifically for the recipient by adding to the text or by removing some of the summarized content.
- a user may select a graphical user interface element 250 to opt for a longer summarized content 212 than a default length, which may be set for example as one sentence.
- a user may opt to have the system automatically convert the summarized content 212 to another language, for example by selecting a graphical user interface element 260.
- the system may determine a scoring for some or all of the external content, and use the scoring in generating the summarized content 222.
- the scoring may be based on, for example, a political score, a technicality, or a spam score.
- the system may determine that link 210 is related to a webpage whose domain is associated with some spam, and will assign a spam score to the link 210.
- the system may include a spam score 240 or other warning in association with the summarized content 212 or elsewhere in the message 202.
- the system may determine that a link is related with an deemed scientific publication, and may reflect that in association with the summarized content 212.
- the system may adapt the summarized content to a vocabulary or style of the sender, with the consent of the users.
- the system may generate the language of the summarized content based on an age or skill level of the sender or recipient, with the consent of the users.
- the summarized content 212 may be personalized differently based on native language or reading level.
- a topicality score may change the summarized content.
- the system may use entities that have a high topicality in news sources to increase those entities in value in summary generation.
- the system may determine that an entity in the external content (e.g., in link 210 or attachment 220) is related to a topical news story.
- the system may determine that "nuclear physics" was an entity that appeared in many news stories (e.g., that day, or within the past week of message 202 being created), and may increase the entity "nuclear physics" when it generates summarized content.
- the system may boost terms (e.g., score terms higher when selecting what terms to include in a summary) if those terms are associated with the entity "nuclear physics" when the system generates summarized content 212 and summarized content 222.
- the system may emphasize terms (e.g., provide in bold, colored, underlined, or italicized formats) if those terms are associated with the entity "nuclear physics" when the system provides the summarized content 212 and the summarized content 222.
- the system may attempt to present summarized content in the same order as the content is presented in the external content.
- the system may access user interest models of interests of the sender and recipient from various sources, such as e-mail, social network groups, search history, education, age, gender, or other sources.
- the system may model interests of users using, for example, an entity-vector. Such models may be generated offline, for example, once a day, or once a week, etc.
- the system may determine common interests of multiple users, for example based on user interest models of both a sender and a recipient of message 202. Information in an individual user model is protected such that other users cannot determine its contents.
- the system may use a function of the entity-vectors from two user interest models to determine common interests of two people, e.g., a function that depends on multiplying the two entity-vectors. Such multiplication may be done for example when message 202 is created or drafted, or when the message 202 is sent to a recipient.
- the system may normalize an entity-vector for a group of users. It will be understood that there may, in some cases, be multiple senders and recipients of messages, for example in a chat discussion or social media forum.
- the system may gather entities from the entity-vectors and the system may use those entities to emphasis content in the summarized content of a message (such as the summarized content 212 shown in FIG. 2 ). In such a way, the system may generate summarized content that is of personal interest to the recipient.
- the message 202 is an example only, and in various implementations, the message 202 may include other elements, such as a sender, other recipients, an image, other attachments or links, a date, a time, other metadata, etc.
- FIG. 3 is an example user interface.
- a system such as system 102 may present a user interface 300 including a message 302.
- the message 302 is an e-mail message.
- the message 302 includes a recipient name 304, a title 306, a greeting 307, text 308, and a link 310.
- a sender is drafting an e-mail to a recipient 304 "Jennifer" with the title 306 "Malaria Article”.
- the greeting 307 "Dear Jennifer,” and text 308 of the message may be entered and edited by the sender in any e-mail application, web-based email program, etc.
- the sender includes a link 310 to external content, which in this example is a website with the title "The National Department of Health of Southern Africa".
- the recipient may be unaware of what the link 310 references or what the sender wants the recipient to look at in the link, and the recipient may have to access the external content and then scroll through irrelevant content before finding relevant information.
- the system may include one or more personalized summaries of the content, with quick-links (e.g., a modified version of a hyperlink) that bring the reader directly to a relevant place in the content.
- the system may gather entities from the context of the message 302 (e.g., title 306, greeting 307, text 308, or other information associated with the message 302) and emphasize the gathered entities in the generation of summarized content.
- the system may generate multiple summaries and multiple quick links. For example, as shown in FIG.
- the system may gather the entity "malaria” and use the entity to generate summarized content 312 "Eliminating Malaria May be Possible through effective vaccination yet to be developed " with quick link 314 " The National Department of Health of Southern Africa#Vaccines” .
- the system may gather the entity “medications” and use the entity to generate a summarized content 320 "Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travelers to malaria-endemic countries” and an associated quick link 322 " The National Department of Health of Southern Africa#Medications.
- the sender may edit the summaries and the quick link 314 or quick link 322, or add other summaries or quick links to the message 302.
- FIG. 4 a flow chart illustrating an example method of generating personalized summaries for content.
- the system can be, for example, system 102 described above with reference to FIG.1 , component 112 described above with reference to FIG. 1 , or other systems.
- the system detects a message from a sender to a recipient, the message including a reference to externals content (402).
- the message may be one of message 202 shown in FIG. 2 or message 302 shown in FIG. 3 .
- the reference to external content may be a link 210 (which refers to an web page) or an attachment 220 as shown in FIG. 2 , for example.
- the system accesses a user interest model comprising information about interests of the sender or the recipient (404). In instances where a user consents to the use of such data, the interests may be stored in the user interest data store 120 as shown in FIG. 1 , in the index 114, or in one or more other data stores accessible by the system.
- Interests may include, for example, entities, such as geographic locations associated with the user, terms from prior search queries of the user, demographic data, social media data (such as recent purchases or self-supplied interests of close friends), and other information, in cases where a user consents to the use of such data.
- entities such as geographic locations associated with the user, terms from prior search queries of the user, demographic data, social media data (such as recent purchases or self-supplied interests of close friends), and other information, in cases where a user consents to the use of such data.
- the system identifies interest content from the external content as relevant to an interest from the interest information (406).
- the interest content may include entities from an entity-vector associated with the user, for example, as described above with respect to FIG. 2 .
- the system generates a summarized content from the external content (408).
- the summarized content may be based on the interest content and containing only a subset of information in the external content.
- the system modifies the message to include the summarized content in the message (410) for example as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 .
- entities or interests that are identified in the external content are analyzed (e.g., using user interest engine 130) to determine whether the entities or interests relate to user-identified interests.
- the system may identify entities using, for example, a data graph such as a knowledge graph or other technology.
- the system may utilize a map or a graph to identify entities on a webpage that may interest a particular user. For example, any entity name in a header can be identified using a knowledge graph or similar data.
- a header of a webpage may partially or fully match an entity name and may match multiple entities.
- headers can be ranked by how well they match the entities, and how many of the entities are matched that are related to a user's interests.
- system scores potential summarized content e.g., in steps 408 by weighting the amount of overlap via either the message's context (e.g., text, subject, greeting) or the sender or recipient's interests.
- the system scores potential summarized content based on topicality or other factors.

FIG. 1 illustrates anexample system 102. Thesystem 102 can be implemented on one or more computers that communicate, for example, through a network. The system receivesmessages 104 with a reference to external content from a client device 106 and generates revisedmessages 108 with summarized content that includes extracts from the external content. Eachmessage 104 is an electronic communication such as an e-mail, post, text message, etc. Themessage 104 can be, for example, in text form or in other forms, for example, in audio form or in image form. - The summarized content may be produced by an automatic process that reduces a document (e.g., the external content) using a computer program to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. Technologies that can make a coherent summary may take into account variables such as length, writing style, and syntax. Personalization technology described here may enable dynamic insertion, customization, or suggestion of summarized content in any format that is relevant to an individual user, for example based on one or more of the user's behavior, implied preferences, and based on explicitly given information. The personalization may include relevant concepts which may be referred to here as "entities" (an "entity" may be a person, place, thing, or concept). Such entities may be extracted from documents using concept mining, which may involve aspects of artificial intelligence, statistics, data mining, and text mining.
- The
system 102 and the client device 106 can communicate through a network, for example, an intranet or the Internet. While thesystem 102 and the client device 106 are shown as two separate devices, in some implementations, thesystem 102 and the client device 106 can be the same device. - The
system 102 includes anindexing engine 110 and a rankingengine 112. Theindexing engine 110 maintains anindex 114 for use by thesystem 102. Theindexing engine 110 processes documents and updates index entries in theindex 114, for example, using conventional or other indexing techniques. - In some implementations, the
system 102 may maintain a user interest data store 120. In the instance where a user consents to the use of such data, the user interest data store 120 may include one or more entities, websites, text, search queries, demographic data, or other user interest information that may be used bysystem 102. In some implementations, the user interest data store 120 may classify search queries by user, by frequency, by location, and by date or time, where the user consents to the use of such data. In some implementations, the user interest data store 120 may be included as part ofindex 114. - A user interest engine 130 may analyze
message 104 to determine if one or more terms from the message are associated with a recipient's interest, using user interest data store 120, for example, and in the cases where the users consent to the use of such data. The user interest engine 130 may use the user interest data store 120 to identify interests in the message using techniques described herein, for example as discussed in more detail below with respect toFIGs. 2-4 . In some implementations, user interest engine 130 may analyze a message to locate one or more terms from themessage 104 in common with an interest of a recipient of themessage 104. Asummary engine 140 may use the results of that analysis to generate a summarized content for a referenced external content (e.g., an attachment or a link) referenced by or associated with the message. - The ranking engine 112 (e.g., the summary engine 140) may use the
index 114 to identify information, such as portions of documents or quick-links to parts of the document related to themessage 104, for example, using conventional or other information retrieval techniques. The rankingengine 112 calculates scores for the entities in the documents, for example, using one or more ranking signals. Each signal provides information about the document itself or the relationship between the document and the message. One example signal is a measure of the overall quality of the document. Another example signal is a measure of the number of times the terms of the message occur in the document or in a portion of the document. Other signals can also be used. The rankingengine 112 ranks the responsive documents or portions of documents using the scores. - Although user interest engine 130 and
summary engine 140 are depicted as part of rankingengine 112, in various implementations, user interest engine 130 orsummary engine 140 may be included as part ofindexing engine 110, or as a separate, single engine withinsystem 102. - As an example, a sender of a
message 104 might include the subject of themessage 104 as "beach vacations" and attached external content (e.g., a document about Florida) to themessage 104, without any detailed explanation of the document. The recipient may not want to review or scroll through the entire document to find relevant information, especially if the document is long. Thesummary engine 140 may therefore provide a summarized content for the document that refers to a "Florida beach vacation package for $1000" to be included as part of the message 104 (e.g., as message 108). The summarized content may be an extract of text from the document. Other examples of summaries generated by thesystem 102 are described in more detail below with respect toFIGs. 2-6 . -
FIG. 2 is an example user interface. As shown inFIG. 2 , a system such assystem 102 may present auser interface 200 including amessage 202. In this example, themessage 202 is an e-mail message. In various implementations, however, the message could be a social media post, a text message, or other electronic communication. Themessage 202 includes arecipient name 204, atitle 206, agreeting 207,text 208, alink 210, and anattachment 220. In the example shown inFIG. 2 , a sender is drafting an e-mail to arecipient 204 "Bob Jones" with thetitle 206 "Nuclear Physics Article You Might Like". Thegreeting 207 "Hi Bob," andtext 208 of the message may be entered and edited by the sender in any e-mail application, web-based email program, etc. The sender includes alink 210 to external content (a website entitled "Popular science Futurist Mitchio Kaku theories about technology....") and anattachment 220 "Physics-Article.pdf'. - In the instance where a user consents to the use of such data, the
system 102 generates personalized summaries of each of the external contents-i.e., of the website from thelink 210 and of the content ofattachment 220. The personalized summaries include summarizedcontent 212 and summarizedcontent 222. The system may gather entities from the context of themessage 202, and use the entities to emphasis content in the summarizedcontent 212 or the summarizedcontent 222. For example, in themessage 202 thetitle 206 includes "Nuclear Physics". The system may use the entity "nuclear physics", which was gathered from the context, to emphasize content related to nuclear physics in the summarizedcontent 212. - In some implementations, in the instance where a user consents to the use of such data, the
system 102 generates the personalized summaries automatically as the sender types themessage 202. In various implementations, the system creates the summarizedcontent 212 and summarizedcontent 222 after a sender requests such summary generation. Alternatively or additionally, in cases where users consent, the system generates the summaries after the sender hits the "send"button 230. In such an implementation, the sender may not view the summarizedcontent 212 and summarizedcontent 222 before sending themessage 202, but the recipient would see the summaries in thee-mail message 202 upon receiving themessage 202. In various implementations, the sender may view themessage 202 with the summarizedcontent 212 and summarizedcontent 222 in a sent message folder of an e-mail application after the e-mail is sent. - As shown in
message 202, summarized content can take various forms. For example summarizedcontent 222 is shown in a pop-up style window which may appear if a user hovers a cursor overattachment 220, or may appear as text withinmessage 202. Summarizedcontent 212 appears as text belowlink 210. - In some implementations, the sender may review and customize the summarized content (e.g., change or add to) or remove the summarized
content 212 and summarizedcontent 222 before sending the message 202 (e.g., before hitting thesend button 230.) For example, a sender may wish to customize the text even more specifically for the recipient by adding to the text or by removing some of the summarized content. In some implementations, a user may select a graphicaluser interface element 250 to opt for a longer summarizedcontent 212 than a default length, which may be set for example as one sentence. In some implementations, a user may opt to have the system automatically convert the summarizedcontent 212 to another language, for example by selecting a graphicaluser interface element 260. - In some implementations, the system may determine a scoring for some or all of the external content, and use the scoring in generating the summarized
content 222. The scoring may be based on, for example, a political score, a technicality, or a spam score. For example, the system may determine thatlink 210 is related to a webpage whose domain is associated with some spam, and will assign a spam score to thelink 210. As a result, the system may include aspam score 240 or other warning in association with the summarizedcontent 212 or elsewhere in themessage 202. As another example, the system may determine that a link is related with an acclaimed scientific publication, and may reflect that in association with the summarizedcontent 212. - In some implementations, the system may adapt the summarized content to a vocabulary or style of the sender, with the consent of the users. In some implementations, the system may generate the language of the summarized content based on an age or skill level of the sender or recipient, with the consent of the users. For example, the summarized
content 212 may be personalized differently based on native language or reading level. - In some implementations, a topicality score may change the summarized content. For example, the system may use entities that have a high topicality in news sources to increase those entities in value in summary generation. As an example, the system may determine that an entity in the external content (e.g., in
link 210 or attachment 220) is related to a topical news story. For example, the system may determine that "nuclear physics" was an entity that appeared in many news stories (e.g., that day, or within the past week ofmessage 202 being created), and may increase the entity "nuclear physics" when it generates summarized content. The system may boost terms (e.g., score terms higher when selecting what terms to include in a summary) if those terms are associated with the entity "nuclear physics" when the system generates summarizedcontent 212 and summarizedcontent 222. Alternatively or additionally, the system may emphasize terms (e.g., provide in bold, colored, underlined, or italicized formats) if those terms are associated with the entity "nuclear physics" when the system provides the summarizedcontent 212 and the summarizedcontent 222. In some implementations, the system may attempt to present summarized content in the same order as the content is presented in the external content. - In some implementations, in instances where the users have consented to the use of such data, the system may access user interest models of interests of the sender and recipient from various sources, such as e-mail, social network groups, search history, education, age, gender, or other sources. The system may model interests of users using, for example, an entity-vector. Such models may be generated offline, for example, once a day, or once a week, etc. The system may determine common interests of multiple users, for example based on user interest models of both a sender and a recipient of
message 202. Information in an individual user model is protected such that other users cannot determine its contents. - In some implementations, the system may use a function of the entity-vectors from two user interest models to determine common interests of two people, e.g., a function that depends on multiplying the two entity-vectors. Such multiplication may be done for example when
message 202 is created or drafted, or when themessage 202 is sent to a recipient. In some implementations, for example with group messages, the system may normalize an entity-vector for a group of users. It will be understood that there may, in some cases, be multiple senders and recipients of messages, for example in a chat discussion or social media forum. The system may gather entities from the entity-vectors and the system may use those entities to emphasis content in the summarized content of a message (such as the summarizedcontent 212 shown inFIG. 2 ). In such a way, the system may generate summarized content that is of personal interest to the recipient. - It will be understood that the
message 202 is an example only, and in various implementations, themessage 202 may include other elements, such as a sender, other recipients, an image, other attachments or links, a date, a time, other metadata, etc. -
FIG. 3 is an example user interface. As shown inFIG. 3 , a system such assystem 102 may present auser interface 300 including amessage 302. In this example, themessage 302 is an e-mail message. - The
message 302 includes arecipient name 304, atitle 306, agreeting 307,text 308, and alink 310. In the example shown inFIG. 3 , a sender is drafting an e-mail to arecipient 304 "Jennifer" with thetitle 306 "Malaria Article". Thegreeting 307 "Dear Jennifer," andtext 308 of the message may be entered and edited by the sender in any e-mail application, web-based email program, etc. The sender includes alink 310 to external content, which in this example is a website with the title "The National Department of Health of Southern Africa". The recipient may be unaware of what thelink 310 references or what the sender wants the recipient to look at in the link, and the recipient may have to access the external content and then scroll through irrelevant content before finding relevant information. - In the instance where the users consent to the use of such data, the system may include one or more personalized summaries of the content, with quick-links (e.g., a modified version of a hyperlink) that bring the reader directly to a relevant place in the content. The system may gather entities from the context of the message 302 (e.g.,
title 306, greeting 307,text 308, or other information associated with the message 302) and emphasize the gathered entities in the generation of summarized content. In various implementations, for example as shown inFIG. 3 , the system may generate multiple summaries and multiple quick links. For example, as shown inFIG. 3 , the system may gather the entity "malaria" and use the entity to generate summarizedcontent 312 "Eliminating Malaria May be Possible through effective vaccination yet to be developed " withquick link 314 "The National Department of Health of Southern Africa#Vaccines". As another example, the system may gather the entity "medications" and use the entity to generate a summarizedcontent 320 "Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travelers to malaria-endemic countries" and an associatedquick link 322 "The National Department of Health of Southern Africa#Medications." In some implementations, the sender may edit the summaries and thequick link 314 orquick link 322, or add other summaries or quick links to themessage 302. -
FIG. 4 a flow chart illustrating an example method of generating personalized summaries for content. For convenience, the steps of the flow chart are described with reference to a system that performs the steps. The system can be, for example,system 102 described above with reference toFIG.1 ,component 112 described above with reference toFIG. 1 , or other systems. - In the example of
FIG. 4 , the system detects a message from a sender to a recipient, the message including a reference to externals content (402). For example, the message may be one ofmessage 202 shown inFIG. 2 ormessage 302 shown inFIG. 3 . The reference to external content may be a link 210 (which refers to an web page) or anattachment 220 as shown inFIG. 2 , for example. The system accesses a user interest model comprising information about interests of the sender or the recipient (404). In instances where a user consents to the use of such data, the interests may be stored in the user interest data store 120 as shown inFIG. 1 , in theindex 114, or in one or more other data stores accessible by the system. Interests may include, for example, entities, such as geographic locations associated with the user, terms from prior search queries of the user, demographic data, social media data (such as recent purchases or self-supplied interests of close friends), and other information, in cases where a user consents to the use of such data. - The system (e.g., user interest engine 130 shown in
FIG. 1 ) identifies interest content from the external content as relevant to an interest from the interest information (406). The interest content may include entities from an entity-vector associated with the user, for example, as described above with respect toFIG. 2 . The system generates a summarized content from the external content (408). The summarized content may be based on the interest content and containing only a subset of information in the external content. The system modifies the message to include the summarized content in the message (410) for example as shown inFIG. 2 andFIG. 3 . - In some implementations, entities or interests that are identified in the external content are analyzed (e.g., using user interest engine 130) to determine whether the entities or interests relate to user-identified interests. The system may identify entities using, for example, a data graph such as a knowledge graph or other technology. In some implementations, the system may utilize a map or a graph to identify entities on a webpage that may interest a particular user. For example, any entity name in a header can be identified using a knowledge graph or similar data. A header of a webpage may partially or fully match an entity name and may match multiple entities. In various implementations, headers can be ranked by how well they match the entities, and how many of the entities are matched that are related to a user's interests.
- In some implementations, the system scores potential summarized content (e.g., in
steps 408 by weighting the amount of overlap via either the message's context (e.g., text, subject, greeting) or the sender or recipient's interests. In some implementations, the system scores potential summarized content based on topicality or other factors. -
