Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to generating presentations of images, and more particularly to creating presentations of images by arranging and rotating the images within a virtual presentation space and scoring the presentations according to conformity with categorical rules.
- a recommendation engine may show a set of recommended items based on the user selection. Advertisers may desire that the images of the recommended items be displayed in a visually appealing manner, for example, in a collage format.
- a computer-implemented method to create and display a virtual presentation space comprising recommended items in response to a user selection is provided.
- the user accesses a recommendation website and the user selects an item from the website.
- the recommendation application searches for associated items, selects a set of items, and transmits the set of items to the layout application, which receives the set of items.
- the layout application identifies the images by category, creates a virtual presentation space, and positions the images within component sections of the virtual presentation space.
- the layout application modifies the position of the component sections based on categorical constraints.

For example, a collage of recommended items could be made more visually appealing by presenting the recommended item images in the collage such that the position of the item images are determined according to categorical rules. Particularly in apparel recommendations, a collage of recommended items appears more attractive and coherent if, for example, an image of shoes is positioned below an image of pants.
- a layout application receives a set of images from a recommendation application and categorizes the images.
- the layout application places the images within component sections of a virtual presentation space and alters the positioning and sizing of the component sections according to rules based at least in part on the categorization of the images.
- the layout application detects any leading edges of images within pairs of neighboring component sections.
- a leading edge for example, is a line segment comprising the perimeter of an image or a line segment that passes through multiple points of the perimeter of an image. If the leading edges of images within neighboring component sections are not parallel, the sections are rotated until the leading edges of the images within the component sections are parallel, in conformance to categorical rules. The pair of component sections are rotated together until a desired orientation is reached.
- Categorical rules may be considered in determining how the grouped component sections should be aligned. Any overlapping space of the component sections is occluded. For example, overlapping space is a section of the virtual presentation space that is occupied by more than one component section.
- the layout application stores the virtual presentation space comprising the set of images and scores the stored virtual presentation space based on conformity to the categorical rules. The process is repeated and the stored virtual presentation space that conforms most to the categorical rules is selected for presentation to the user.
- the user accesses a recommendation system website.
- the user begins a web browsing session on a user device and enters the recommendation system website address.
- the user may also access the website through opening an application on the user device which communicates with the recommendation system.
- the recommendation system distributes the application for download to the user device.
- the recommendation website is a shopping website.

Abstract
A user accesses a recommendation website and selects an item from the website. A recommendation application searches for associated items, selects a set of items, and transmits the set to the layout application. A layout application identifies the images by category, creates a virtual presentation space, and positions the images within component sections of the virtual presentation space. The layout application modifies the position of, proportionally resizes, and rotates the component sections based on categorical constraints. To rotate each component section, neighboring component sections are detected, the component sections are grouped, the leading edges are detected between images, the neighboring component sections are positioned so that leading edges of the images are parallel, overlapping empty space is occluded, and the component section pair is jointly rotated. The virtual presentation space is scored and subsequent virtual presentation spaces are created. The best-scored virtual presentation space is displayed on the website.
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to generating presentations of images, and more particularly to creating presentations of images by arranging and rotating the images within a virtual presentation space and scoring the presentations according to conformity with categorical rules.
- When a user selects an item for purchase from an online merchant via a user device, a recommendation engine may show a set of recommended items based on the user selection. Advertisers may desire that the images of the recommended items be displayed in a visually appealing manner, for example, in a collage format.
- Conventional technology does not provide for the detection of leading edges of objects within images and the alignment of the leading edges through rotation according to categorical rules.
- In certain example aspects described herein, a computer-implemented method to create and display a virtual presentation space comprising recommended items in response to a user selection is provided. The user accesses a recommendation website and the user selects an item from the website. The recommendation application searches for associated items, selects a set of items, and transmits the set of items to the layout application, which receives the set of items. The layout application identifies the images by category, creates a virtual presentation space, and positions the images within component sections of the virtual presentation space. The layout application modifies the position of the component sections based on categorical constraints. The layout application proportionally resizes the component sections based on categorical constraints.
- The layout application rotates the component sections: each component section comprising an image is selected, neighboring component sections comprising images are detected, the component section is grouped with the neighboring component section, the leading edges are detected between images in the neighboring component sections, the neighboring component sections are positioned so that leading edges of the images within the component sections are parallel, overlapping empty space is occluded, and the component section pair is jointly rotated based on categorical rules. The virtual presentation space is scored based on conformity with categorical constraints and subsequent virtual presentation spaces are created, scored, and stored. The virtual presentation space with the best score is displayed on the website for the user.
- In certain other example aspects described herein, a system and a computer program product to create and display a virtual presentation space comprising recommended items in response to a user selection are provided.
- These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the example embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated example embodiments.

FIG. 8 is an illustration of an example virtual presentation space comprising two example component sections that are grouped and jointly rotated according to a categorical rule, in accordance with certain example embodiments. -
FIG. 9 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and module, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - The example embodiments described herein provide methods and systems for pre-authorizing an online merchant to conduct transactions. The example embodiments described herein provide computer-implemented techniques for creating and displaying a collage of recommended items based on a user search. For example, a collage of recommended items could be made more visually appealing by presenting the recommended item images in the collage such that the position of the item images are determined according to categorical rules. Particularly in apparel recommendations, a collage of recommended items appears more attractive and coherent if, for example, an image of shoes is positioned below an image of pants.
- A layout application receives a set of images from a recommendation application and categorizes the images. The layout application places the images within component sections of a virtual presentation space and alters the positioning and sizing of the component sections according to rules based at least in part on the categorization of the images. The layout application detects any leading edges of images within pairs of neighboring component sections. A leading edge, for example, is a line segment comprising the perimeter of an image or a line segment that passes through multiple points of the perimeter of an image. If the leading edges of images within neighboring component sections are not parallel, the sections are rotated until the leading edges of the images within the component sections are parallel, in conformance to categorical rules. The pair of component sections are rotated together until a desired orientation is reached. Categorical rules may be considered in determining how the grouped component sections should be aligned. Any overlapping space of the component sections is occluded. For example, overlapping space is a section of the virtual presentation space that is occupied by more than one component section. The layout application stores the virtual presentation space comprising the set of images and scores the stored virtual presentation space based on conformity to the categorical rules. The process is repeated and the stored virtual presentation space that conforms most to the categorical rules is selected for presentation to the user.
- In an example embodiment, the user accesses a recommendation system website. The user begins a web browsing session on a user device and enters the recommendation system website address. The user may also access the website through opening an application on the user device which communicates with the recommendation system. In this example, the recommendation system distributes the application for download to the user device. In an example embodiment, the recommendation website is a shopping website.
- The user selects an item from the website. In an example embodiment, the user selects a category on the recommendation system website, finds an item under that category, and then selects the item using the user interface on the user device. In another example embodiment, the user conducts a keyword search on the recommendation system website and chooses an item from the listed results using the user interface on the user device. For example, the user desires to buy a hat from the recommendation website, conducts a keyword search for “ladies' fancy purple hat,” views several options of hat from which to choose, and selects the desired hat by indicating the preferred hat on the user interface.
- The recommendation application searches for associated items. In an example embodiment, all possible items are given ratings and graphed in a virtual recommendation space based on these ratings. In this example embodiment, the recommendation application searches in the virtual recommendation space for the associated items that are the closest to the item selected by the user.
- The recommendation application selects a set of items. In an example embodiment, the recommendation application selects a predetermined number of items. For example, the recommendation application selects five items. In another example embodiment, the recommendation application selects a predetermined set of items based on item type. For example, the user selects a ladies' hat, and the recommendation application finds and selects a set of associated items comprising one skirt, one blouse, one pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, one pocketbook, and one decorative walking cane. The recommendation application transmits a set of images to the layout application. The set of images correspond to the selected set of items.
- The layout application receives the set of images. In an example embodiment, the set of images comprises both the user-selected image and the images selected by the recommendation application. In an example embodiment, the layout application identifies the images by category. For example, the layout application receives a set of images and uses a shape-recognizing algorithm to determine to which category the image belongs. For example, the layout application receives the set of images selected by the recommendation application in response to the user selection and identifies the images as comprising a skirt, a blouse, a pair of gloves, a pair of shoes, a pocketbook, and a walking cane. In another example, the layout application identifies features of the image comprising color, pattern, gradients, size, and/or shape in order to identify the image by category. For example, the layout application identifies the hat within the image as a formal hat based on the shape, pattern, and color of the image of the hat.
- The layout application creates a virtual presentation space. In an example embodiment, this virtual presentation space is a space wherein images are placed and can be displayed to the user via the user interface of a user computing device. The layout application positions item images within component sections of the virtual presentation. In an example embodiment, the layout application uses a block recursive image composition algorithm to divide the virtual presentation space into component sections and place the images within the component sections. In an example embodiment, empty space may exist within each component section that the image does not occupy.
- The layout application modifies the position of the component sections based on categorical constraints. Categorical constraints may prescribe relative positions, absolute positions, and/or orientations of the component sections comprising the images in the virtual space. For example, for a component section comprising the image of a hat, there may be an absolute constraint to position the component section comprising the hat at the top of the virtual space and a relative constraint to position the component section comprising the image of the hat above any shirt or dress. In this same example, there may exist a constraint to orient the component section comprising the image of the hat with the brim aligned with the principal horizontal axis of the virtual presentation space or within a certain degree range clockwise or counterclockwise from this axis. The layout application proportionally resizes the component sections comprising the images within the virtual presentation space based on categorical constraints. For example a categorical constraint may exist that an image of a purse is a certain proportion smaller than an image of a dress within the virtual presentation space. In this example, the image of the dress is smaller than the image of the purse and therefore the component section comprising the image of the purse must be reduced until it complies with the categorical size constraint.
- The layout application rotates the component sections. In an example embodiment, a component section comprising an image is selected. Neighboring component sections comprising images are detected. For example, a component section in the virtual presentation space comprising an image of a walking cane is neighboring another component section in the virtual presentation space comprising an image of a pair of pants. The layout application groups the two neighboring component sections.
- Any leading edges between the images within the neighboring component sections are detected. A leading edge is a line segment comprising the perimeter of an image or a line segment that passes through multiple points of the perimeter of an image. For example, the image comprising the pants is oriented vertically and the image comprising the walking cane is oriented ten degrees clockwise from the vertical axis. In this example, the edge of the walking cane within the image of the walking cane and the edge of the pants within the image of the pants comprise leading edges. The two neighboring component sections are positioned so that the images within the component sections are positioned with the leading edges parallel. Continuing with the previous example, the component section comprising the image of the walking cane oriented at ten degrees is rotated ten degrees counterclockwise so that the leading edge is in alignment with the leading edge of the image of the pants. In an example embodiment, any overlapping empty space is occluded. For example, part of an image within a first component section occupies a region of space of a neighboring component section wherein there is no image. In this example, this region of space in the neighboring component section is occluded by the image within the first component section and would not be visible to a user when the virtual presentation space is displayed via the user interface of a user device.
- The component section pair is jointly rotated based on categorical rules. For example, the neighboring component sections aligned according to the leading edges of the images are rotated as one object in the virtual presentation space. For example, a walking cane with a leading edge ten degrees clockwise from the vertical axis and a pair of pants with a vertical leading edge are placed together with the leading edges parallel along the 80-degree axis. In this example, there is a categorical rule that images of pants be aligned parallel with the principal vertical axis of the virtual presentation space. Therefore, both component sections are rotated as one object until the image of the pants is aligned parallel with the vertical axis. In this same example, the image of the walking cane is finally oriented vertically as a result of the rotation.
- If subsequent component sections neighbor the selected component section, the component sections are rotated if leading edges are detected between the images within the pair of component sections. In an example embodiment, each neighboring component section to the selected component section is detected and the component sections are rotated according to the method described herein. For each of the remaining component sections, neighboring component sections are detected and the component sections are rotated if leading edges between the images within neighboring component sections are detected. In an example embodiment, the rotation of the component sections is conducting using the method described herein.
- The virtual presentation space is scored based on conformity with categorical constraints. In an example embodiment, not all categorical constraints are satisfied perfectly. For example, a component section comprising an image cannot be resized to satisfy a categorical constraint because there is not enough virtual space to do so. In another example, two component sections comprising images are absolutely constrained to be located at the top of the virtual presentation space but one of the two component sections must be placed under or beside the other. In example embodiment, the categorical constraints comprise that the maximum amount of virtual presentation space be conserved. In an example embodiment, the virtual presentation space is scored with a numerical value. The virtual presentation space and the score are stored.
- In an example embodiment, subsequent virtual presentation spaces are created, scored, and stored according to the aforementioned method. In an example embodiment, subsequent virtual presentation spaces are created and scored until a desired score is reached. In another example embodiment, a predetermined number of virtual presentation spaces are created, scored, and stored. The virtual presentation space with the best score is displayed on the website for the user, which views the virtual presentation via the user interface of a user computing device. In an example embodiment, the user may select an item image within the virtual presentation space. If the user selects an item image within the virtual presentation space, the recommendation application and layout application find recommended items and display the items in a virtual presentation space format according to the method described herein.
- Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments are described in detail.

web browser 117 can enable the user 101 to interact with web pages using the user computing device 110. In an example embodiment, theweb browser 117 enables the user 101 to view the recommendation system's 130web site 137 and to navigate theweb site 137 to select products. - An
example recommendation system 120 comprises arecommendation application 131, alayout application 133, aserver 135, aweb site 137, and adata storage unit 139. - In an example embodiment, the
recommendation application 131 communicates with thelayout application 133, theweb site 137, and thedata storage unit 139. In an example embodiment, therecommendation application 131 receives an item selected by the user 101 on theweb site 137 and compiles a set of recommended items that correspond to the user 101 selected item. In an example embodiment, therecommendation application 131 accesses thedata storage unit 139 to find and compile the set of recommended items. In an example embodiment, therecommendation application 131 transmits the set of recommended items to thelayout application 133, which creates a virtual presentation of the set of items. - In an example embodiment, the
layout application 133 communicates with therecommendation application 131, theweb site 137, and thedata storage unit 139. In an example embodiment, thelayout application 133 receives a set of recommended items from therecommendation application 131. In an example embodiment, thelayout application 133 takes this set of recommended items and arranges them in a virtual presentation space and saves the virtual presentation space in thedata storage unit 139. In an example embodiment, thelayout application 133 creates several virtual presentation spaces, determines a score based on compliance with categorical rules, and saves the virtual presentation spaces in thedata storage unit 139. In an example embodiment, thelayout application 133 selects, from thedata storage unit 139, the virtual presentation space with the best score and transmits it to theweb site 137 for display to the user 101 over thenetwork 120. - In an example embodiment, the
web server 135 provides the content that the user 101 accesses through theapplication 113 and/or theweb browser 117 on the user computing device 110, including but not limited to html documents, images, style sheets, and scripts. In an example embodiment, the web server 121 supports the recommendation system's 120web site 137 which enables the user 101 to select an item and receive a set of recommended items arranged in a virtual presentation space. - In an example embodiment, the
recommendation system 130web site 137 communicates with therecommendation application 131, thelayout application 133, theserver 135, and thedata storage unit 139. In an example embodiment, theweb site 137 displays items for the user 101 to view and select via the communication application 112 web browser 114 of the user computing device 110 and transmits the user 101 selection to therecommendation application 131, which compiles a set of recommended items. In an example embodiment, theweb site 137 displays a virtual presentation space from thedata storage unit 139 selected by thelayout application 133 to display to the user 101 over thenetwork 120. In an example embodiment, theweb site 137 is supported by themerchant server 135. - It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are example and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers and devices can be used. Moreover, those having ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that the user computing device 110 and the
recommendation system 130 illustrated inFIG. 1 can have any of several other suitable computer system configurations. For example, a user computing device 110 embodied as a mobile phone or handheld computer may or may not include all the components described above. - The example methods illustrated in
FIGS. 2-4 are described hereinafter with respect to the components of theexample operating environment 100. The example methods ofFIGS. 2-4 may also be performed with other systems and in other environments. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting amethod 200 for creating and displaying a virtual presentation space of recommended images based on a user search, in accordance with certain example embodiments. Themethod 200 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In
block 210, the user 101 accesses therecommendation system 130website 137. In an example embodiment, the user 101 begins a web browsing session on a user device 110 and enters therecommendation system 130website 137 address. In another example embodiment, the user 101 accesses thewebsite 137 through opening anapplication 113 on the user device 110 which communicates with therecommendation system 130 over thenetwork 120. In this example, therecommendation system 130 distributes theapplication 113 for download to the user device 110. In an example embodiment, therecommendation website 137 is a shopping website. - In
block 220, the user 101 selects an item from thewebsite 137. In an example embodiment, the user 101 selects a category on therecommendation system 130website 137, finds an item under that category, and then selects the item using the user interface 111 on the user device 110. For example, the user 101 desires to buy a hat from therecommendation website 137, actuates a user interface 110 object to select the category “hats”, then browses the hat-related items under that category to select a hat. In another example embodiment, the user 101 conducts a keyword search on therecommendation system 130website 137 and chooses an item from the listed results using the user interface on the user device. For example, the user 101 desires to buy a hat from therecommendation website 137, conducts a keyword search for “ladies' fancy purple hat”, views several options of hat from which to choose, and selects the desired hat by indicating the preferred hat on the user interface 110. - In
block 230, therecommendation application 131 searches for associated items. In an example embodiment, all possible items are given ratings and graphed in a virtual recommendation space based on these ratings. In this example embodiment, therecommendation application 131 searches in the virtual recommendation space for the associated items that are the closest to the item selected by the user 101. In an example embodiment, the searchable items are graphed using an embedding approach such that every item has a specific coordinate in the virtual recommendation space that is correlated with characteristics of the item over dimensions of evaluation. - In
block 240, therecommendation application 131 selects a set of items. In an example embodiment, therecommendation application 131 selects a predetermined number of items. For example, therecommendation application 131 selects five related items regardless of the item that the user 101 selects. In another example embodiment, therecommendation application 131 selects a predetermined set of items based on item type. For example, the user 101 selects a ladies' hat, and therecommendation application 131 finds and selects a set of associated items comprising one skirt, one blouse, one pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, one pocketbook, and one decorative walking cane. - In
block 250, therecommendation application 131 transmits a set of images to alayout application 133. In an example embodiment, the set of images correspond to and are representations of the selected set of items. - In
block 260, thelayout application 133 receives the set of images. In an example embodiment, the set of images comprises both the image selected by the user 101 and the images selected by therecommendation application 131. - In
block 270, thelayout application 133 creates virtual presentation spaces. In an example embodiment, a virtual presentation space is a virtual space wherein images are placed and can be displayed to the user 101 via the user interface 111 of a user computing device 110. Themethod 270 for creating the virtual presentation spaces is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the methods described inFIG. 3 . -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram depicting amethod 270 for creating and scoring virtual presentation spaces based on categorical and space-conservation constraints, in accordance with certain example embodiments. Themethod 270 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In
block 310, thelayout application 133 identifies images by category. For example, thelayout application 133 receives a set of images and uses a shape-recognizing algorithm to determine to which category the image belongs. For example, thelayout application 133 receives the set of images selected by therecommendation application 131 in response to the user 101 selection and identifies the images as comprising a skirt, a blouse, a pair of gloves, a pair of shoes, a pocketbook, and a walking cane. In another example, thelayout application 133 identifies features of the image comprising color, pattern, gradients, size, and/or shape in order to identify the image by category. For example, the layout application identifies the hat within the image as a formal hat based on the shape, pattern, and color of the image of the hat. - In
block 320, thelayout application 133 creates a virtual presentation space. In an example embodiment, this virtual presentation space is a virtual space wherein images are placed and can be displayed to the user 101 via the user interface 111 of a user computing device 110. - In
block 330, thelayout application 133 positions the images within component sections of the virtual presentation space. In an example embodiment, the virtual space is divided into rectangular component sections. In another example embodiment, the virtual presentation space is divided into component sections comprising any combination of one or more shapes or forms. In an example embodiment, thelayout application 133 uses a block recursive image composition algorithm to divide the virtual presentation space into rectangular component sections and place the images within the rectangular component sections. In an example embodiment, empty space may exist within each component section that the image does not occupy. - In
block 340, thelayout application 133 modifies the position of the component sections based on categorical constraints. In an example embodiment, categorical constraints prescribe relative positions, absolute positions, and/or orientations of the component sections comprising the images in the virtual space. For example, in a virtual apparel presentation, for a component section comprising the image of a hat, there may be an absolute constraint that the component section comprising the hat be positioned at the top of the virtual space and a relative constraint that the component section comprising the image of the hat be positioned above any shirt or dress. In this same example, there may be a constraint that the component section comprising the image of the hat be oriented so that the brim of the hat is aligned with the principal horizontal axis of the virtual presentation space or within a certain degree range clockwise or counterclockwise from this axis. - In
block 350, thelayout application 133 proportionally resizes the component sections based on categorical constraints. For example, for a virtual apparel presentation, there is a categorical constraint that an image of a purse be a certain proportion smaller than an image of a dress within the virtual presentation space. In this example, the image of the dress is smaller than the image of the purse and therefore the component section comprising the image of the purse must be enlarged until it complies with the categorical size constraint. In an example embodiment, thelayout application 113 positions the component sections of the virtual space, modifies the position of the component sections, and proportionally resizes the component sections to create a virtual space comprising all of the component sections. - In
block 360, thelayout application 133 rotates the component sections. Themethod 360 for rotating the component sections is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the methods described inFIG. 4 . -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting amethod 360 for rotating images to align leading edges, in accordance with certain example embodiments. Themethod 360 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In
block 410, a component section comprising an image is selected. In an example embodiment, a certain component section comprising an image is selected. For example, a virtual presentation space comprises five component sections comprising images from the set of images received by thelayout application 133 from therecommendation application 131. In this same example, thelayout application 133 selects the component section comprising the first image in the set of images received from therecommendation application 131. In another example embodiment, a component section comprising an image is selected randomly. - In
block 420, neighboring component sections comprising images are detected. In an example embodiment, thelayout application 133 analyzes the selected component section for adjacent component sections comprising images. For example, a component section in the virtual presentation space comprising an image of a walking cane is neighboring another component section in the virtual presentation space comprising an image of a pair of pants. The layout application groups the two neighboring component sections. - In
block 430, a component section is grouped with a neighboring component section. For example, thelayout application 133 focuses on the group of two neighboring component sections to complete several processing steps. The component sections may each be paired with a neighbor until all component sections are paired. The grouping step and the related processing of component section pairs may be repeated multiple times as the virtual presentation space is processed. - In
block 440, leading edges are detected between images in the neighboring component sections. A leading edge is a line segment comprising the perimeter of an image or a line segment that passes through multiple points of the perimeter of an image. For example, in a virtual apparel presentation, an image comprising pants is oriented vertically and the image comprising a walking cane is oriented ten degrees clockwise from the vertical axis. In this example, the edge of the walking cane within the image of the walking cane and the edge of the pants within the image of the pants comprise leading edges. In an example embodiment, an image detection algorithm can be used to detect leading edges between images within neighboring component sections of the virtual space. - In
block 450, the neighboring component sections are positioned so that the leading edges of the images within the component sections are parallel. Continuing with the previous example, the component section comprising the image of the walking cane oriented at ten degrees is rotated ten degrees counterclockwise so that the leading edge is in alignment with the leading edge of the image of the pants in the adjacent component section. -
FIG. 5 is an illustration of a samplevirtual presentation space 510 divided into two examplerectangular component sections component section 520 has a vertical leading edge whereas an image of a cane within thecomponent section 520 has a leading edge that is ten degrees clockwise from vertical. -
FIG. 6 is an illustration of a samplevirtual presentation space 510, continuing with the previous illustration shown inFIG. 5 , after acomponent section 520 is rotated to align the leading edge of the image within thecomponent section 520 with the leading edge of the image within neighboringcomponent section 530 so that the two leading edges are parallel, in accordance with certain example embodiments. In this same illustration, thecomponent section 520 has been rotated ten degrees clockwise such that the leading edge of the image of the pants within thecomponent section 520 is parallel with the leading edge of the image of the cane within the component section 530 (both are at ten degrees clockwise from vertical orientation). - Returning to
FIG. 4 , inblock 460, overlapping empty space is occluded. For example, part of an image within a first component section occupies a region of space of a neighboring component section wherein an image is not present. In this example, this region of space in the neighboring component section is occluded by the image within the first component section and would not be visible to a user 101 were the virtual presentation space displayed via the user interface 111 of a user device 110. In an example embodiment, to occlude overlapping empty space, the component sections are moved toward one another until a configurable amount of space exists between the images within the component sections. - In
block 470, the component section pair is jointly rotated based on categorical rules. For example, the neighboring component sections aligned according to the leading edges of the images are rotated as one object in the virtual presentation space. Continuing with the previous example, a walking cane with a leading edge ten degrees clockwise from the vertical axis and a pair of pants with a vertical leading edge are placed together with the leading edges parallel along the 80-degree axis. In this example, there is a categorical rule to align images of pants parallel with the principal vertical axis of the virtual presentation space—therefore both component sections are rotated as one object until the image of the pants is aligned parallel with the vertical axis. In this same example, the image of the walking cane is finally oriented vertically as a result of the rotation. Continuing with this example, the grouped and aligned component sections are adjacent to a third component section comprising an image of shoes with a leading edge. In this example, there is a categorical rule to align the opening of the shoes parallel with the cuff of the pants. In this example, the third component section comprising the image of the shoes is aligned with the grouped and aligned component sections comprising the images of the pants and cane according to the categorical rule. In this example, the three aligned component sections may be rotated as one object according to any applicable categorical rules. -
FIG. 7 is an illustration of a samplevirtual presentation space 510, continuing with the previous illustration shown inFIG. 6 , shown after thecomponent sections component sections -
FIG. 8 is an illustration of a samplevirtual presentation space 510, continuing with the previous illustration shown inFIG. 7 , shown after thecomponent sections virtual presentation space 510. - Returning to
FIG. 4 , inblock 480, thelayout application 133 determines whether there is a subsequent neighboring component section to the selected component section. - If the
layout application 133 determines that that there is a subsequent neighboring component section to the selected component section, themethod 360 proceeds to block 430 inFIG. 4 . In an example embodiment, the selected component section is grouped with the subsequent neighboring component section, the leading edges are detected between images in the neighboring component sections, the neighboring component sections are positioned so that the leading edges of the images within the component sections are parallel, overlapping empty space is occluded, and the component section pair is jointly rotated based on categorical rules. In an example embodiment, this subsequent neighboring component section is repeated until there are no remaining subsequent neighboring component sections adjacent to the selected component section. - Returning to block 480, if the
layout application 133 determines that there is not a neighboring component section to the selected component section, themethod 360 proceeds to block 490. - In
block 490, thelayout application 133 determines whether there is a subsequent component section. - If the
layout application 133 determines that there is a subsequent component section, themethod 360 proceeds to block 410 inFIG. 4 . For example, thelayout application 133 previously selected the component section comprising the first image of a set of five item images received from therecommendation system 131. Continuing with this same example, thelayout application 133 selects the component section comprising the second image of the set. - Returning to block 490, if the
layout application 133 determines that there is a not a subsequent component section, themethod 360 proceeds to block 370 inFIG. 3 . - Returning to
FIG. 3 , inblock 370, the virtual presentation space is scored based on conformity with categorical constraints. In an example embodiment, not all categorical constraints are satisfied perfectly. For example, a component section comprising an image cannot be resized to satisfy a categorical constraint because there is not enough space. In another example, two component sections comprising images are absolutely constrained to be located at the top of the virtual presentation space but one of the two component sections must be placed under or beside the other. In an example embodiment, the categorical constraints comprise that the maximum amount of virtual presentation space be conserved. - In an example embodiment, the virtual presentation space score can be calculated based on a percentage of the total number of applicable categorical constraints met by the virtual presentation space. In another example embodiment, the virtual presentation space score can be the sum of the number of applicable categorical constraints obeyed by the virtual presentation space. In some example embodiments, certain categorical constraints are more important than others and have a greater impact than other categorical constraints on the virtual presentation space score. For example, when the position, size, or rotation of a component section make it impossible to conform to all applicable categorical rules, conformity to a categorical rule mandating an absolute position within the virtual presentation space may have more of an effect on the score than a categorical rule mandating a relative position to an adjacent component section.
- In
block 380, the virtual presentation space and the score are stored. In an example embodiment, the virtual presentation space is scored with a numerical value. In an example embodiment, the virtual presentation space and score are stored on thedata storage unit 139. - In
block 390, thelayout application 133 determines if a subsequent virtual presentation space is possible or required. In an example embodiment, subsequent virtual presentation spaces are created, scored, and stored according to the aforementioned method. In an example embodiment, subsequent virtual presentation spaces are created and scored until a desired score is reached. In another example embodiment, a predetermined number of virtual presentation spaces are created, scored, and stored. - If the
layout application 133 determines that a subsequent virtual presentation space is possible or required, themethod 270 proceeds to block 320 inFIG. 3 . In an example embodiment, thelayout application 133 creates the virtual presentation space, positions images within component sections of the virtual presentation space, modifies the position of and proportionally resizes the component sections based on categorical constraints, rotates the component sections, and scores and stores the virtual presentation space based on conformity with the categorical constraints - Returning to block 390 in
FIG. 3 , if thelayout application 133 determines that a subsequent virtual presentation space is not required, themethod 270 proceeds to block 280 inFIG. 2 . - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 280, the virtual presentation space with the best score is displayed on thewebsite 137 for the user 101. In an example embodiment, the virtual presentation space with the highest score is displayed on thewebsite 137. In this example embodiment, a virtual presentation space receives a higher score the more it conforms to applicable categorical rules. In another example embodiment, multiple virtual presentation spaces are displayed. For example, thelayout application 113 orrecommendation system 120 determines a threshold score and multiple virtual presentation spaces may be presented that meet the threshold score. In an example embodiment, thelayout application 133 saves the virtual presentation space to thedata storage unit 139. In this example embodiment, theweb server 135 accesses thedata storage unit 139 to retrieve the virtual presentation space or receives the virtual presentation space directly from thelayout application 133. In this example embodiment, thewebsite 137 displays the virtual presentation space content from theweb server 135 and the user 101 access thewebsite 137 to view the virtual presentation space via theapplication 113 or theweb browser 117 resident on the user computing device 110. In this example embodiment, the virtual presentation space is displayed on the user interface 111 of the user computing device 110. -
