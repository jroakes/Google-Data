- the information in the entry may be used by search component 420 to identify whether the document is relevant to a search query.
- Search component 420 may receive a search query and perform a search of index 410 based on the search query to identify documents, as search results that are relevant to the search query. Additionally, or alternatively, search component 420 may receive search results, relevant to the search query, from one or more other search systems. Additionally, or alternatively, search component 420 may perform a search of index 410 based on the search query to identify content associated with another corpus, such as images and/or videos, as image results that are relevant to the search query. In some implementations, search component 420 may automatically perform the search to identify the content associated with the other corpus, e.g., before, during, or after performing the search for the documents. In some implementations, search component 420 may perform the search to identify the content, associated with the other corpus, upon the occurrence of some event, such as in response to an instruction received from classifier component 440 .
- Search component 420 may generate scores for the search results.
- each search result may correspond to a document that has been identified as relevant to the search query.
- the score, for a search result may reflect a measure of relevance of the corresponding document to the term(s) of the search query.
- the score, for a search result may reflect a measure of quality of the corresponding document.
- the search query may be used to identify a relevant document, which is scored based on the document's measure of quality.
- the score, for a search result may reflect a combination of a measure of relevance of the corresponding document to a search query and a measure of quality of the corresponding document.
- the score, for a search result may reflect a weighted combination of a measure of relevance of the corresponding document to a search query and a measure of quality of the corresponding document, where the measure of relevance may be weighted differently from the measure of quality.
- the score, for a search result may be determined in another manner.
- Search component 420 may rank the search results based on the scores. For example, search component 420 may create a list of search results and sort the search results, in the list, based on the scores of the search results. Search component 420 may provide the list of search results to analyzer component 430 .
- Analyzer component 430 may analyze documents associated with search results received from search component 420 to identify image attributes associated with the documents. For example, analyzer component 430 may obtain, from one or more memories associated with server 220 , 230 , and/or 240 , documents that are indexed within index 410 based on addresses—e.g., URLs, URIs, IP addresses, etc.—associated with the search results.
- addresses e.g., URLs, URIs, IP addresses, etc.
- Analyzer component 430 may analyze image and/or video content included within the documents to identify image attributes associated with the documents.
- Analyzer component 430 may, for example, analyze text within a document to identify a quantity of keywords—e.g., “image,” “picture,” “photograph,” “movie,” “video,” “camera,” “glamour,” etc.—relating to an image and/or video, that correspond to a high probability of image intent—e.g., a measure of image intent that satisfies a threshold.
- Analyzer component 430 may also, or alternatively, identify a keyword density associated with the document based on the quantity of keywords relative to a quantity of text within the document—e.g., a quantity of words, lines of text, pages of text, etc.
- analyzer component 430 may analyze the document to identify a quantity of images and/or videos within the document—e.g., images, videos, image tags, video tags, etc.
- Analyzer component 430 may also, or alternatively, identify an image ratio, associated with the document, based on the quantity of images and/or videos relative to the quantity of text.
- Analyzer component 430 may also, or alternatively, determine an image density associated with the document based on proportions of the images—e.g., in square inches, centimeters, etc.—relative to proportions of the text within the document and/or proportions of the non-image portions of the document.
- Analyzer component 430 may transmit the image attributes—e.g., the quantities of keywords, keyword densities, quantities of images and/or videos, image densities, image ratios, etc.—associated with the documents, to classifier component 440 .
- Analyzer component 430 may also, or alternatively, analyze documents in an offline manner. For example, analyzer component 430 may analyze each document, identified in index 410 , to identify image attributes associated with each of the documents. Analyzer component 430 may associate, within index 410 , respective image attributes with each document stored within index 410 . Analyzer component 430 may transmit the image attributes, associated with the indexed documents, to classifier component 440 .
- Analyzer component 430 may in another offline operation, analyze predetermined documents during an operation to train a classifier, such as classifier component 440 .
- the identification of the predetermined documents and performing the operation to train the classifier will be described in greater detail below.
- the predetermined documents may include a first set of predetermined documents that have been previously determined to be associated with a high probability of image intent—e.g., measures of image intent that satisfy a probability threshold.
- the predetermined documents may also, or alternatively, include a second set of predetermined documents that have been previously determined to be associated with a low probability of image intent—e.g., measures of intent that do not satisfy the probability threshold and/or that do not satisfy another probability threshold, where the other probability threshold is less than the probability threshold.
- Analyzer component 430 may transmit first image attributes associated with the first set of predetermined documents and second image attributes associated with the second set of predetermined documents to classifier component 440 that enables classifier component 440 to generate, as classification metrics, one or more probability thresholds, based on the image attributes, used to classify documents associated with search results.
- Classifier component 440 may determine a level of image intent associated with a document. Classifier component 440 may, for example, assign a document, associated with a search result, to one of a set of categories, such as a high probability of image intent category, hereinafter referred to as “high image intent category;” a low probability of image intent category, hereinafter referred to as “low image intent category;” and/or some other image intent category. The category may be based on an image intent score that is generated by, and/or assigned to the document, by classifier component 440 .
- classifier component 440 may assign the document to an image intent category by looking up an entry for the document within an index, e.g., within index 410 , and determining whether the high image intent category, the low image intent category, or some other image intent category is associated with the document.
- classifier component 440 may determine the image intent, associated with a document, based on the image intent score, without assigning the image intent category. Additionally, or alternatively, classifier component 440 may assign the image intent score to the document by looking up an entry, within the index, that stores the image intent score, associated with the document, that was previously determined by classifier component 440 .
- Classifier component 440 may determine the image intent scores in a number of ways. For example, a keyword score may be assigned to the document that identifies a quantity of keywords, within the document, that matches keywords, hereinafter referred to as “matching keywords,” associated with classification metrics. A keyword density score may be assigned to the document that represents a quantity of matching keywords relative to a size of the document or a quantity of text associated with the document. An image score may be assigned to the document based on a quantity of images and/or videos associated with the document. An image ratio score may be assigned to the document based on a quantity of images relative to a size of the document and/or a quantity of text associated with the document. Thus, the level of image intent of the document may be based on one or a combination of the scores and/or some other score associated with image intent. Each of the scores will be described in greater detail below.
- Classifier component 440 may, in some implementations, use one or more classification techniques to determine a level of image intent of a document based on image attributes associated with the documents and classification metrics stored within index 410 .
- classifier component 440 may act as a discriminative classifier, such as a support vector machine (SVM), when classifying the document based on comparing keywords within the document to keywords associated with the first set of predetermined documents associated with a high probability of image intent, e.g., “image,” “picture,” “photograph,” “movie,” “video,” “camera,” “glamour,” etc., and/or to keywords associated with the second set of predetermined documents associated with a low probability of image intent, e.g., “text,” “article,” “novel,” “story,” “literature,” etc.
- SVM support vector machine
- the sets of predetermined documents may be previously identified, by search system 225 , based on whether clients 210 obtained image results or search results as a result of particular search queries received from clients 210 .
- Documents associated with the search results may be assigned to the first set of predetermined documents when the image results were obtained by client 210 .
- Documents associated with the search results may be assigned to the second set of predetermined documents when the search results were obtained by the client 210 .
- classifier component 440 may assign the document to a first category (e.g., the high image intent category). If, however, classifier component 440 determines that the quantity of matching keywords does not satisfy another keyword threshold identified by the classification metrics, then classifier component 440 may assign the document to a second category (e.g., the low image intent category). Classifier component 440 may, alternatively, assign the document to a third category (e.g., a neutral image intent category or some other category) based on a determination that the quantity of matching keywords does not satisfy the keyword threshold and satisfies the other keyword threshold.
- a first category e.g., the high image intent category
- classifier component 440 may assign the document to a second category (e.g., the low image intent category).
- Classifier component 440 may, alternatively, assign the document to a third category (e.g., a neutral image intent category or some other category) based on a determination that the quantity of matching keywords does not satisfy the keyword threshold and satisfies the other
- classifier component 440 may assign a keyword score, e.g., KW, to the document based on the quantity of matching keywords associated with the document.
- the keyword score may increase as the quantity of matching keywords increases and may decrease as the quantity of matching keywords decreases. Assigning the document to the categories and/or assigning the keyword scores may enable search system 225 to determine whether to expend processing resources to retrieve image results that are relevant to the search query.
- classifier component 440 may assign the keyword score based on a probability model—e.g., a Bayes probability model or some other model.
- the keyword score may represent a measure of image intent based on a first probability and a second probability.
- the keyword score may be based on a first probability, e.g., p(ii), where ii stands for image intent.
- the first probability may correspond to a likelihood that one or more keywords within the document corresponds to one or more keywords within a second set of predetermined documents associated with search queries with high image intent.
- the keywords in this example, may correspond to characters, phonemes, syllables, terms, phrases, etc. associated with a language model, e.g., an n-gram model and/or some other language model.
- the keyword score may also be based on a second probability, e.g., p(D) where D represents keywords identified in the first and/or second sets of the predetermined documents.
- the second probability may represent a likelihood that the document corresponds to the first set of predetermined documents associated with search queries with low image intent and the second set of predetermined documents.
- the probability that represents the keyword score may be given by: p(ii
- the second probability may be based on a probability that each keyword, on which the classification metrics are based, occur within the sets of predetermined documents, e.g., p(D) ⁇ p(f1, f2, . . . , fn) where n ⁇ 1 and where f1, f2, etc. represent keyword occurrences within the sets of predetermined documents.
- p(f1, f2, fn) for p(D) yields equation (2) below: p ( ii
- p H (ii) may be set to a particular value based on the predetermined sets of documents, e.g., 0.5 based on equal probability between the low and high image intent categories.
- D ) KW ⁇ p H ( ii )*( p ( f 1
- the denominator of equation (3) may represent a constant that is based on the predetermined sets of documents. Therefore, a quantity of times that a particular keyword (f1) occurs within the document, may determine a value associated with a particular quantity, e.g., p(f1
- the probability e.g., p(ii
- the probability that the document corresponds to search queries with high image intent increases.
- the probability that the document corresponds to search queries with high image intent decreases.
- the keyword score may, thus, correspond to a probability of image intent given a quantity of occurrences of keywords within the document.
- Other techniques may include determining whether a keyword density, associated with a document, satisfies a keyword density threshold identified by the classification metrics. Based on a determination that the keyword density satisfies the keyword density threshold, classifier component 440 may assign the document to the first category. If, however, classifier component 440 determines that the keyword density does not satisfy another keyword density threshold, then classifier component 440 may assign the document to the second category. Classifier component 440 may, alternatively, assign the document to a third image intent category or some other image intent category based on a determination that the keyword density does not satisfy the keyword density threshold and satisfies the other keyword density threshold.
- classifier component 440 may, in a manner described above, assign a keyword density score, e.g., KD, to the document based on the keyword density.
- a keyword density score e.g., KD
- the keyword density score may increase as the keyword density increases and may decrease as the keyword density decreases.
- Assigning the document to the categories and/or determining the image intent scores based on a determination of keyword density may enable search system 225 to determine whether to expend processing resources to retrieve, process, and/or provide image results that are relevant to the search query.
- the keyword density score may be represented by a probability, e.g., p(ii
- the probability may be based on a respective keyword density, e.g., fd1, fd2, . . . , fdn where n ⁇ 1, for each keyword identified in the document as provided in equation (4) below: p ( ii
- the probability that the document corresponds to search queries with high image intent increases. Additionally, or alternatively, as the respective keyword density decreases, the probability that the document corresponds to search queries with high image intent, decreases.
- the keyword score may, thus, correspond to a probability of image intent given the respective keyword density within the document.
- Classification component 440 may, in a manner described above, assign a document to one of the image intent categories, e.g., high image intent category, a low image intent category, and/or some other image intent category, based on a quantity of images and/or videos, an image ratio, and/or an image density associated with the document relative to one or more thresholds, associated with the quantity of images and/or videos, the image ratio, and/or the image density identified by the classification metrics.
- the image intent categories e.g., high image intent category, a low image intent category, and/or some other image intent category
- classification component 440 may, in a manner described above, assign other scores to the document, such as an image score, e.g., I, based on the quantity of images and/or videos associated with the documents, an image ratio score, e.g., IR, based on the quantity of images relative the text within the document, and/or an image density score, e.g., ID, based on proportions of the images to proportions of the text within the document. Assigning the document to the image intent categories and/or determining image intent scores, based on a determination of the quantity of images, image ratio, and/or image density, may enable search system 225 to determine whether to expend processing resources to retrieve, process, and/or provide image results that are relevant to the search query.
- image score e.g., I
- image ratio score e.g., IR
- image density score e.g., ID
- the image score, the image ratio score, and/or the image density score may be represented by probabilities, e.g., based on p(ii
- the probabilities may be based on a respective quantity of images, e.g., fi, a respective image ratio, e.g., fir, and/or a respective image density, e.g., fid, associated with the document as provided in equations (5), (6), and (7) below:
- the probability that the document corresponds to search queries with high image intent increases. Additionally, or alternatively, as the quantity of images and/or the image ratio decreases, the probability that the document corresponds to search queries with high image intent, decreases.
- the image score and/or the image ratio score may, thus, correspond to a probability of image intent given the quantity of images and/or the image ratio, respectively, associated with the document.
- the image density score may, thus, correspond to a probability of image intent given the image density associated with the document.
- Classification component 440 may also, or alternatively, generate an image intent score based on a total score, e.g., TS, for a document based on a combination of scores assigned to the documents, and/or a weighted total score, e.g., WTS, when each of the scores do not contribute equally to the combined score based on a respective weighting factor.
- the total score may be based on a sum of the scores, e.g., where TS ⁇ KW+KD+I+IR+ID.
- the weighted total score may be based on the scores and weighting factors, e.g., W1, W2, W3, W4, etc., associated with each of the scores.
- each of the weighting factors may represent a respective contribution of each of the scores, e.g., where W1+W2+W3+W4, etc. ⁇ 1.
- the weighted total score may, thus, be determined based on the weighted contributions of each of the scores, e.g., where WTS ⁇ W1*KW+W2*KD+W3*I+W3*IR+W4*ID.
- Classifier component 440 may determine whether to provide the search results without image results, the search results with the image results, or the image results without the search results based on the image intent score. For example, classification component 440 may determine that all or a portion of the image results, e.g., top 10, top 20, top 50, etc., are to be provided without the search results when a quantity of documents, with an image intent score, e.g., based on the total score and/or the weighted score, that satisfies the high image intent threshold, is greater than a quantity of documents with an image intent score that does not satisfy the high image intent threshold. Classification component 440 may transmit an instruction to search component 420 to provide the image results, if the image results have not already been obtained by search component 420 .
- Search component 420 may receive the instruction and may obtain the image results, using one or more techniques described above, based on a measure of relevance of the image results to the search query and/or a measure of quality of the image results. Search component 420 may also, or alternatively, obtain one or more types of results at the same time and/or in a manner that is not dependent on the instruction, received from classification component 440 , to provide the image results or a different type of results.
- Classification component 440 may also, or alternatively, determine that the search results are to be provided without the image results when a quantity of documents, with an image intent score that does not satisfy the low image intent threshold, is greater than a quantity of documents with an image intent score that satisfies the low image intent threshold. Classification component 440 may also, or alternatively, determine that the search results and the image results are to be provided when a quantity of documents with an image intent score that does not satisfy the high image intent threshold and satisfies the low image intent threshold, is greater than a quantity of documents with an image intent score that satisfies the high image intent threshold or does not satisfy the low image intent threshold.
- Classifier component 440 may generate a search results document, such as a hypertext markup language (HTML) document, that includes the search results, the image results, or a combination of the search results and the image results. Classifier component 440 may provide, to client 210 , the search results document in response to the search query.

Abstract
Description
p(ii|D)≅(p(ii)*p(D|ii))/p(D) (1)
p(ii|D)KW≅(p H(ii)*p(f1, . . . fn|ii))/p(f1, . . . ,fn) (2)
where pH(ii) may be set to a particular value based on the predetermined sets of documents, e.g., 0.5 based on equal probability between the low and high image intent categories. Thus,
p(ii|D)KW ≅p H(ii)*(p(f1|ii)*p(f2|ii), . . . ,*p(fn|ii))/(p(f1)*p(f2), . . . ,*p(fn)) (3)
In the example above, the denominator of equation (3) may represent a constant that is based on the predetermined sets of documents. Therefore, a quantity of times that a particular keyword (f1) occurs within the document, may determine a value associated with a particular quantity, e.g., p(f1|ii). Additionally, or alternatively, the particular quantity may increase as the quantity of occurrences, of the particular keyword, increases and may decrease as the quantity of occurrences, of the particular keyword, decreases.
p(ii|D)KD ≅p H(ii)*(p(fd1|ii)*p(fd2|ii), . . . ,*p(fdn|ii))/(p(fd1)*p(fd2), . . . ,*p(fdn)) (4)
p(ii|D)I ≅p H(ii)*(p(fi|ii)/p(fi) (5)
p(ii|D)IR ≅p H(ii)*(p(fir|ii)/p(fir) (6)
p(ii|D)ID ≅p H(ii)*(p(fid|ii)/p(fid) (7)
