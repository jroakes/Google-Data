Definitions
- This disclosure generally relates to ranking fans of media content and/or content creators potentially based on publicly available data.
- Video or other content hosting sites or services enable content creators to upload content that can be accessed by content consumers. As with other types of media or other forms of expression, content creators can attract a following.
- An examination component can be configured to examine transactions facilitated by a set of content consumers in connection with content managed by a content creator.
- a scoring component can be configured to determine a score for a content consumer from the set of content consumers based on the transactions. The score can be specific to the content creator and can reflect an affinity, fondness, or favor the content consumer has for content managed by the content creator.
- a fan component can be configured to determine a set of top fans for the content creator, wherein the set of top fans can be a subset of content consumers and can be based upon the score.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example system that can identify top fans from among a larger set of content consumers in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram that depicts numerous examples of transactions and related data or information in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of additional aspects or features of the scoring component that can determine the score for a content consumer in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure

- FIG. 8 illustrates an example methodology that can provide for identifying a set of top fans for a content creator in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 9 illustrates an example methodology that can provide for additional features or aspects in connection with identifying a set of top fans in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure
- FIG. 10 illustrates an example schematic block diagram for a computing environment in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure.
- FIG. 11 illustrates an example block diagram of a computer operable to execute certain embodiments of this disclosure.
- the term “content creator” is intended to refer to an entity associated with the creator, owner, curator, distributor, or manager of content.
- content consumer is intended to refer to an entity that presents or consumes that content. These entities are generally thought of as individuals, but as used herein, such can be devices, accounts, or other data associated with those individuals invoked or referred to by proxy.
- fan is used herein synonymously with content consumer. In some embodiments, a fan can be a special type of content consumer such as one that is highly engaged or particularly fond of the content of a particular content creator.
- video or other content hosting sites or services enable content creators to upload content that can be accessed by content consumers.
- content creators can attract a following. When a content consuming fan feels connected to the content creator, experiences can be improved for all parties involved, including the fan, the creator, and the hosting entity. Therefore, hosting sites or services can increase appeal with both content consumers and content creators by further encouraging relationships that can be created between the content consumer and the content creator.
- the content consumers tend to engage more frequently with content on a hosting site or service such as, e.g., sharing more favored videos with friends or followers.
- a hosting site or service such as, e.g., sharing more favored videos with friends or followers.
- One way to form such relationships is to provide mechanisms by which the content creator can reach out to associated fans. For instance, content creators might reply to a comment left by a particular fan, in which case the fan might experience additional gratification.
- the content creator might publish additional content (e.g., videos) in response to requests, or post content to community-based or social circle-based sites that are linked to the content hosting site.
- Providing a feature to enable content creators to accurately and easily identify (and rank) a top set of fans can provide a number of advantages. Content creators can engage more directly with the top fans and content consumers might be encouraged to interact more to increase one's rank. In response, the content creator might obtain more “buzz” or promotion in connection with the content (or channel), which can increase view counts, subscribers, and shares. Such can lead to increased consumption and in some cases increased advertising impressions, which can result in additional revenue for the content creator as well as the hosting site or service.
- the set of top fans can be identified based on one or more scoring algorithms or mechanisms. For example, an engagement score can be determined that describes a level of engagement a content consumer has with the content creator or content of the creator. Such can be determined based on transactions of the content consumers with respect to the content of the creator. Such transactions can include, for example, leaving a comment, indicating the content is “liked” or a favorite, adding the content to a playlist, subscribing to a channel or other similar following of the content creator, a duration in which the channel has been subscribed, and so on. The various transactions can be weighted based on a variety of metrics. For example, a comment transaction can be assigned a different weight than a subscribe transaction based on policy or various other factors.
- a comment transaction with thirty likes or other indications of approval might garner more weight or value than a comment transaction with only one like or other indication of approval from other content consumers.
- certain transactions can result in a negative score, such as indicating the content is disliked, unsubscribing to a channel, removing the content from a playlist, and so forth.
- a time decay function can be implemented such that the engagement score for a particular content consumer is slowly reduced over time unless overcome by new transactions.
- a maximum score cap can be applied, generally by time. For example, the engagement score for a particular content consumer can be limited for a given time period (e.g., per week).
- time period e.g., per week.
- content consumer activity that is consistent and enduring can be more highly scored than activity that is intense, but possibly spurious (e.g., spam or fad).
- transactions of the content consumer that are examined can be identified based on publicly available data, and such scoring might be based exclusively on publicly available data. By using public data to determine a content consumer's level of engagement certain privacy concerns can be avoided.
- an influence score can be calculated that can describe level of influence associated with the content consumer.
- content creators prefer that fans of their content be both engaged (e.g., reflected by the engagement score) and influential (e.g., reflected by the influence score).
- the former can indicate that the content consumer is active and involved, and the latter can indicate that the content consumer's activities in that regard have a broader impact.
- the influence score can be determined based on number of subscribers or followers associated with the content consumer or the reaction to input from the content consumer by other content consumers. In many cases, such data can be public and therefore not require unnecessary or contentious data mining practices.
- transactions can be filtered prior to scoring. For example, comments that are abusive or negative can be filtered or might be assigned a negative scoring weight. Hence, content consumers that post many comments that are not supportive or in the spirit of a fan are unlikely to be ranked highly simply based on the fact that many comments were posted. Such can be identified based on a number or proportion of times the content consumer's input has been marked as spam, disliked or voted down, a number or proportion of times the content consumer's account or profile has been blocked or similarly flagged, a number or proportion of private message from the content consumer that have been flagged as spam or undesired, word analysis mechanisms, “troll” identifying mechanisms, or the like.
- Such behavior can also result in many transactions that might otherwise imply a high fan score, but in this case can be filtered.
- Such can be determined by identifying several copies of the same data, potentially including links, input to comments or elsewhere, by identifying high levels of engagement with numerous content creators since it is unlikely a particular content consumer can be a legitimate fan of a large number of content creators, or the like.
- N can be substantially any positive integer.
- N will be less than about 1000, and in some cases N can be determined as a function of a number of subscribers of the content creator or a number of total content consumers.
- the presented table can be sorted based on engagement score, influence score, or other metrics.
- the table can also include a feature to quickly add a fan to or remove a fan from a social circle that relates to the content creator.
- real-time activity from the top fans can be presented or referenced, with prompts to respond as well as insights about the top fans as a group (e.g., what is trending or resonating with the group).
- Content creators can also leverage these features and data to collaborate with top fans, to share special messages or content exclusively with the top fans, or to ensure that top fans are responded to, even in cases where responses to all content consumers might be too overwhelming.
- users can consent to providing data in connection with data gathering aspects.
- the data may be used in an authorized manner.
- one or more implementations described herein can provide for anonymization of identifiers (e.g., for devices or for data collected, received, or transmitted) as well as transparency and user controls that can include functionality to enable users to modify or delete data relating to the user's use of a product or service.
- System 100 can, inter alia, identify top fans from among a larger set of content consumers. Embodiments disclosed herein can, for example, rank the content consumers (or top fans). Such can enable features for understanding and engaging with (potentially exclusively) a set of fans that are likely to be more receptive and appreciative and in a manner that can be more productive.
- System 100 can include a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes computer executable components stored in the memory, examples of which can be found with reference to FIG. 10 . It is to be appreciated that the computer 1002 can be used in connection with implementing one or more of the systems or components shown and described in connection with FIG. 1 and other figures disclosed herein. As depicted, system 100 can include an examination component 102 , a scoring component 114 , and a fan component 118 .
- Examination component 102 can be configured to examine transactions 104 facilitated by a set 106 of content consumers 106 1 - 106 N in connection with content 108 managed by content creator 110 .
- Set 106 of content consumers 106 1 - 106 N can include substantially any number, N, of individual content consumers 106 1 - 106 N , which are hereinafter referred to, either individually or collectively, as content consumer(s) 106 , with appropriate subscripts generally employed only when instructive or convenient to highlight various distinctions or to better impart the disclosed concepts.
- content 108 can be stored on a server device (not shown) associated with a content hosting site or service 112 . The content 108 can be uploaded to the content hosting site or service 112 by content creator 110 and available for access by all or a portion of the set of content consumers 106 .
- Transactions 104 that are examined by examination component 102 can relate to substantially any input or exchange between a content consumer 106 (e.g., a device, account, etc.) and content hosting site or service 112 , non-limiting examples of which are provided in connection with FIG. 2 .
- a content consumer 106 e.g., a device, account, etc.
- content hosting site or service 112 non-limiting examples of which are provided in connection with FIG. 2 .
- transactions 104 can be limited to only transactions that are advertised publicly and/or associated data is publicly viewable or available.
- Illustration 200 depicts numerous examples of transactions 104 and related data or information.
- transactions 104 can be those for which associated information or description is publicly available (e.g., publicly available transaction 202 ).
- Such example transactions 104 can be a comment transaction 204 .
- Comment transaction 204 can relate to information, often text-based, that is posted in relation to content 108 . For instance, content consumer 106 might post a comment that expresses, “Great video! I love your ideas and the way you express them,” and such data can be included, e.g., in a comments section (that can be publicly accessible) associated with content 108 .
- Example transaction 104 can be a like transaction 206 in which content consumer 106 indicates a favorable experience in connection with content 110 . Conversely, such can also include a dislike or unlike transaction, but generally such transactions will negatively impact the score or status of a content consumer 106 as a fan of content 108 provided or managed by content creator 110 , which is further discussed infra.
- Additional example transactions 104 can be a favorite transaction 208 in which content consumer 106 selects content 108 for inclusion in a list of favored content (or, negatively, removal from the list); an add to playlist transaction 210 in which content consumer 106 includes content 108 in a playlist (or, negatively, removal from the playlist); or a subscribe to content transaction 212 in which content consumer 106 subscribes to a channel or other broadcast mechanism associated with content creator 110 (or, negatively, unsubscribes).
- the examples provided herein are intended to represent concrete examples, but are not intended to be exhaustive, as other examples of transactions 104 can exist.
- system 100 can include scoring component 114 .
- Scoring component 114 can be configured to determine score 116 for a particular content consumer 106 from the set 106 based on transaction 104 , in some embodiments exclusively from transactions 104 for which associated data is public. Scoring component 114 can determine a respective score 116 for all or a portion of content consumer 106 based on the transactions 104 that are particular to a give content consumer 106 . It is understood that while score 106 applies to a particular content consumer 106 , score 116 can be specific to content creator 110 . Score 116 can reflect fondness or affinity of the content consumer 106 for the content 108 managed by the content creator 110 .
- a particular content consumer 106 can have many scores 116 , one for each suitable content creator 110 .
- Scoring component 114 can determine score 116 in a variety of ways, potentially determining many sub-scores that can be weighted in various ways, which is further detailed with reference to FIG. 3 .
- System 300 depicts additional aspects or features of the scoring component 114 that can determine score 116 for content consumer 106 .
- scoring component 114 can determine a number of sub-scores such as engagement score 302 , influence score 306 , and/or candidate score 312 .
- Score 116 can be determined as a function of one or more of the sub-scores.
- Engagement score 302 can relate to a determined level of engagement content consumer 106 has with respect to content 108 managed by content creator 110 .
- the level of engagement can be determined based on a weighted aggregation of transactions 104 associated with content consumer 106 that relate to content 108 managed by content creator 110 .
- scoring component 114 can determine engagement score 302 based on a specific set of suitable transactions 104 and engagement data 304 .
- Engagement data 304 can be based on a policy or based on preferences or settings, and can include score weights for various types of transactions 104 (e.g., +10 for a positive comment transaction 204 , +100 for a positive subscribe transaction 212 , ⁇ 10 for a negative comment transaction 204 or one determined to be spam, etc.), as well as other suitable information.
- types of transactions 104 e.g., +10 for a positive comment transaction 204 , +100 for a positive subscribe transaction 212 , ⁇ 10 for a negative comment transaction 204 or one determined to be spam, etc.
- Influence score 306 can relate to a determined level of influence associated with content consumer 106 . This level of influence can be determined based on a number of subscribers to a content channel (or other broadcast mechanism) associated with content consumer 106 . Hence, content consumers 106 with a large following or a large social networking circle or structure can be assigned a higher influence score 306 than content consumer 106 with small followings. Such can be determined by scoring component 114 based on other transactions 308 (e.g., subscribing to the content consumer's channel) and influence data 310 that can relate to the value or weights to apply to other transactions 308 .
- other transactions 308 e.g., subscribing to the content consumer's channel
- influence data 310 can relate to the value or weights to apply to other transactions 308 .
- Candidate score 312 can relate to a determined level of fan value associated with content consumer 106 .
- the level of fan value can be determined based on a function of engagement score 302 and influence score 306 .
- the combination of those two scores can be described by policy, default, or preferences, which can be provided by candidate data 314 .
- candidate score 312 can be score 116 .
- score 116 can represent candidate score 312 further refined with addition data or functions, which can be various other combinations with engagement score 302 (or components thereof), influence score 306 (or components thereof), or aggregate data 316 , which can be substantially any other suitable data employed to determine score 116 .
- system 100 can include fan component 118 .
- Fan component 118 can be configured to determine a set of top fans 120 for content creator 110 , where the set of top fans 120 is a subset of the set of content consumers 106 .
- the set of top fans 120 can be determined by fan component 118 based on score 116 associated with respective content consumers 106 .
- the set of top fans 120 can be scaled based on the size of the audience or popularity of a particular content creator 110 . For example, set 120 might include 1,000 top fans when content creator 110 has 100,000 or more subscribers (or another suitable metric), but only include 25 top fans when content creator 110 has only about 1,000 subscribers, or 10 top fans if content creator 110 has fewer than 100 subscribers.
- System 400 provides for identifying transactions 104 that are not fan-oriented.
- System 400 can include all or portions of system 100 or other system or components detailed herein.
- system 400 can receive or examine data associated with transactions 104 , as detailed in connection with examination component 102 of FIG. 1 .
- transactions 104 can be filtered or otherwise tagged for other processing.
- system 400 can include filter component 402 that can be configured to filter transactions 104 according to a defined policy 404 .
- Filter component 402 can thus provide filtered set of transactions 406 (based on policy 404 ) to scoring component 114 of FIG. 1 .
- score 116 and set of top fans 120 can be determined based on filtered set 406 rather than on unfiltered transactions 104 .
- filter component 402 can provide score adjustment data (detailed with reference to FIG. 5 ) for transactions 104 that meet certain filter criterion described by policy 404 .
- those transactions 104 can instead be deemed to reflect a score penalty (e.g., a negative score).
- a score penalty e.g., a negative score.
- System 500 can provide for additional features or aspects associated with filtering and scoring transactions and presenting results.
- System 500 can includes filter component 402 as described herein.
- Filter component 402 can receive data associated with transactions 104 as well as a policy 404 that can be employed to affect the operation of filter component 402 .
- filter component 402 can be configured to filter or flag for alternative scoring transactions 104 that are determined to be negative or abusive, which can be accomplished by abuse filter component 502 .
- Abuse filter component 502 can examine sentence structure associated with comments or other input or examine data that often implies abusive or “trolling” behavior such as, e.g., user selection of spam indicators, dislikes, down voting, profile blocks, or the like.
- Filter component 402 can be configured to filter or flag for alternative scoring transactions 104 that are determined to be focused on promoting other content, which can be accomplished by spam filter component 504 .
- Spam filter component 504 can examine similar data sets as those detailed above to determine “spamming” behavior.
- Transactions 104 so identified by abuse filter component 502 or spam filter component 504 can be filtered prior to scoring (e.g., removed from filtered set 406 ) or flagged for alternative scoring (e.g., score adjustment 506 ) such that a comment might penalize a particular content consumer 106 score 116 by ⁇ 10 points instead of adding +10 points to the score 116 .
- scoring component 114 can determine score 116 based on the filtered set 406 and/or based on score adjustment 506 .
- fan component 118 can determine sortable table date 508 , which can include set of top fans 120 as well as other relevant data.
- Sortable table data 508 can be provided to a sortable table 510 that can be included in and/or presented by device 512 associated with content creator 110 .
- a presentation of sortable table 510 can include one or more of the following: a fan channel name, a feature to add, delete, or update the fan channel name, a link to the fan channel that facilitates exclusive communication with the set of top fans 120 , a count of the set of top fans 120 , a table feature that, upon selection, sorts the table by score 116 , a table feature that, upon selection, sorts the table by an engagement score 302 , a table feature that, upon selection, sorts the table by an influence score 306 , a table feature that, upon selection, sorts the table by a candidate score 312 , a chart or graph that depicts the score 116 , the engagement score 302 , the influence score 306 , or the candidate score 312 for a portion of the set of top fans 120 .
- a non-limiting example of sortable table 510 is provided in connection with FIG. 7 .
- FIG. 6 depicts an example user interface 600 .
- User interface (UI) 600 relates to a promotion that invites a content creator to process and/or identify associated top fans. For example, in connection with uploading content 108 or reviewing data associated with content 108 , content creator 110 can be introduced to features or benefits detailed herein. Content creator 110 can provide input indicating whether or not the identification of top fans is of interest.
- User interface 700 can provide for an example presentation of sortable table 510 .
- the presentation of sortable table 510 e.g., UI 700
- UI 700 can include a link 704 to the fan channel that can facilitate exclusive communication with the top fans.
- UI 700 can include a UI feature 706 for searching data associated with the top fans and/or a UI feature 708 for uploading data to one or more of the top fans or a channel or social circle associated with the top fans.
- UI 700 can include a UI feature 710 for sorting the top fans. Such sorting can be, e.g., based on engagement score 302 (or components thereof), influence score 306 (or components thereof), candidate score 312 (or components thereof), recent activity, or the like.
- UI 700 can include data associated with various components of engagement score 302 , influence score 306 , or candidate score 312 such as a number of subscribers 712 for a top fan, an level of engagement 714 , a date or time 716 associated with a top fan's interest in content 106 of content creator 110 , and so on.
- UI 700 can include a UI feature 718 for communicating with a top fan.
- UI 700 can also include UI features 720 and 722 .
- UI feature 720 can relate to selecting the top fan for inclusion in a particular social circle (e.g., in addition to being a top fan), and UI feature 722 can relate to managing various social circles. It is understood that UI 700 is to provide a concrete example of a presentation of sortable table 510 , but is not intended to be limiting. Many other features can be included in other embodiments.
- FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate various methodologies in accordance with certain embodiments of this disclosure. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts within the context of various flowcharts, it is to be understood and appreciated that embodiments of the disclosure are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology can alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 8 illustrates exemplary method 800 .
- Method 800 can provide for identifying a set of top fans for a content creator. For example, at reference numeral 802 , transactions that relate to content managed by a content creator and that are facilitated by a set of content consumers can be examined. In some embodiments, these transactions or associated data for the transactions can be publicly available.
- a score for a content consumer from the set of content consumers can be determined based on the transactions.
- the score can relate to a degree of fondness for the content managed by the content creator.
- a set of top fans can be determined for the content creator from among the set of content consumers.
- the set of top fans can be determined based on the score and the number of fans include in the set of top fans can be determined based on size of the content consumer population or another metric associated with the audience of the content creator.
- data relating to the set of top fans can be presented to the content creator.
- Method 900 can provide for additional features or aspects in connection with identifying a set of top fans.
- Method 900 can begin at the start of insert A, which relates to examining transactions detailed in connection with reference numeral 802 of FIG. 8 .
- the transactions can be filtered for removing a subset of the transactions that exhibit defined characteristics. Additionally or alternatively, the transactions that exhibit defined characteristics can be tagged for alternative or negative scoring. The filtering or tagging can occur prior to the determining the score discussed in connection with reference numeral 804 of FIG. 8 .

Abstract
Both content creators and content consumers can benefit by improving communication mechanisms that currently exist. For example, content creators can increase the appeal of content by leveraging the energy of fans, but it is often difficult to identify which content consumers are the best or top fans. However, such can be identified based on various metrics, for example, based on engagement and/or influence of the content consumer. Once the set of top fans is identified, content creators can interact, potentially exclusively, with the set of top fans, which can enhance the experience for all parties involved.
Description
This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/084,239, filed Nov. 19, 2013, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/860,768, filed Jul. 31, 2013, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
This disclosure generally relates to ranking fans of media content and/or content creators potentially based on publicly available data.
Video or other content hosting sites or services enable content creators to upload content that can be accessed by content consumers. As with other types of media or other forms of expression, content creators can attract a following.
The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate the scope of any particular embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented in this disclosure.
Systems disclosed herein relate to identifying a set of top fans of content created and/or managed by a particular content creator. An examination component can be configured to examine transactions facilitated by a set of content consumers in connection with content managed by a content creator. A scoring component can be configured to determine a score for a content consumer from the set of content consumers based on the transactions. The score can be specific to the content creator and can reflect an affinity, fondness, or favor the content consumer has for content managed by the content creator. A fan component can be configured to determine a set of top fans for the content creator, wherein the set of top fans can be a subset of content consumers and can be based upon the score.
The following description and the drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects of the specification. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the specification may be employed. Other advantages and novel features of the specification will become apparent from the following detailed description of the specification when considered in conjunction with the drawings.
Numerous aspects, embodiments, objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:
As used herein, the term “content creator” is intended to refer to an entity associated with the creator, owner, curator, distributor, or manager of content. The term “content consumer” is intended to refer to an entity that presents or consumes that content. These entities are generally thought of as individuals, but as used herein, such can be devices, accounts, or other data associated with those individuals invoked or referred to by proxy. The term “fan” is used herein synonymously with content consumer. In some embodiments, a fan can be a special type of content consumer such as one that is highly engaged or particularly fond of the content of a particular content creator.
As noted previously, video or other content hosting sites or services enable content creators to upload content that can be accessed by content consumers. As with other types of media or other forms of expression, content creators can attract a following. When a content consuming fan feels connected to the content creator, experiences can be improved for all parties involved, including the fan, the creator, and the hosting entity. Therefore, hosting sites or services can increase appeal with both content consumers and content creators by further encouraging relationships that can be created between the content consumer and the content creator.
For example, when content consumers experience such relationships with favored content creators, the content consumers tend to engage more frequently with content on a hosting site or service such as, e.g., sharing more favored videos with friends or followers. One way to form such relationships is to provide mechanisms by which the content creator can reach out to associated fans. For instance, content creators might reply to a comment left by a particular fan, in which case the fan might experience additional gratification. As other examples, the content creator might publish additional content (e.g., videos) in response to requests, or post content to community-based or social circle-based sites that are linked to the content hosting site.
While several mechanisms exist for content consumers to reach associated content consumers, one shortcoming of existing methods is the content creator is generally not able to determine who are the most engaged fans (e.g., relative to other fans, such as fans with an average level of engagement). Providing such a feature can enable the content creator to substantially optimize impact of fan-based communications or transactions since the most engaged fans typically will have more powerful responses to actions of the content creator and typically will appreciate more efforts of the content creator in reaching out to them in a more targeted and/or personal manner. The most engaged fans typically will be more likely to share favorite videos with their own followers, write more interesting or insightful comments or responses, or otherwise provide input that benefits the media content ecosystem.
Providing a feature to enable content creators to accurately and easily identify (and rank) a top set of fans can provide a number of advantages. Content creators can engage more directly with the top fans and content consumers might be encouraged to interact more to increase one's rank. In response, the content creator might obtain more “buzz” or promotion in connection with the content (or channel), which can increase view counts, subscribers, and shares. Such can lead to increased consumption and in some cases increased advertising impressions, which can result in additional revenue for the content creator as well as the hosting site or service.
In some embodiments, the set of top fans can be identified based on one or more scoring algorithms or mechanisms. For example, an engagement score can be determined that describes a level of engagement a content consumer has with the content creator or content of the creator. Such can be determined based on transactions of the content consumers with respect to the content of the creator. Such transactions can include, for example, leaving a comment, indicating the content is “liked” or a favorite, adding the content to a playlist, subscribing to a channel or other similar following of the content creator, a duration in which the channel has been subscribed, and so on. The various transactions can be weighted based on a variety of metrics. For example, a comment transaction can be assigned a different weight than a subscribe transaction based on policy or various other factors. As another example, a comment transaction with thirty likes or other indications of approval might garner more weight or value than a comment transaction with only one like or other indication of approval from other content consumers. In some embodiments, certain transactions can result in a negative score, such as indicating the content is disliked, unsubscribing to a channel, removing the content from a playlist, and so forth.
In some embodiments, a time decay function can be implemented such that the engagement score for a particular content consumer is slowly reduced over time unless overcome by new transactions. In some embodiments, a maximum score cap can be applied, generally by time. For example, the engagement score for a particular content consumer can be limited for a given time period (e.g., per week). Thus, depending on the policy, content consumer activity that is consistent and enduring can be more highly scored than activity that is intense, but possibly spurious (e.g., spam or fad). It is underscored that in some embodiments, transactions of the content consumer that are examined can be identified based on publicly available data, and such scoring might be based exclusively on publicly available data. By using public data to determine a content consumer's level of engagement certain privacy concerns can be avoided.
In addition, an influence score can be calculated that can describe level of influence associated with the content consumer. In general, content creators prefer that fans of their content be both engaged (e.g., reflected by the engagement score) and influential (e.g., reflected by the influence score). The former can indicate that the content consumer is active and involved, and the latter can indicate that the content consumer's activities in that regard have a broader impact. The influence score can be determined based on number of subscribers or followers associated with the content consumer or the reaction to input from the content consumer by other content consumers. In many cases, such data can be public and therefore not require unnecessary or contentious data mining practices.
A candidate score can be determined as a function of the engagement score and the influence score. This candidate score can be the score employed to determine fan ranking or combined with other data or scores to derive an aggregate score for a given fan. As one example, the candidate score can be the engagement score multiplied by a log of the influence score divided by a log of a defined base.
In some embodiments, transactions can be filtered prior to scoring. For example, comments that are abusive or negative can be filtered or might be assigned a negative scoring weight. Hence, content consumers that post many comments that are not supportive or in the spirit of a fan are unlikely to be ranked highly simply based on the fact that many comments were posted. Such can be identified based on a number or proportion of times the content consumer's input has been marked as spam, disliked or voted down, a number or proportion of times the content consumer's account or profile has been blocked or similarly flagged, a number or proportion of private message from the content consumer that have been flagged as spam or undesired, word analysis mechanisms, “troll” identifying mechanisms, or the like.
As another example of filtering or negatively weighting transactions prior to scoring, such can be applied to spam as well. For instance, content consumers that are determined to be more focused on promoting content not related to the content creator, typically by leveraging the content creator's success or platform to do so. Such behavior can also result in many transactions that might otherwise imply a high fan score, but in this case can be filtered. Such can be determined by identifying several copies of the same data, potentially including links, input to comments or elsewhere, by identifying high levels of engagement with numerous content creators since it is unlikely a particular content consumer can be a legitimate fan of a large number of content creators, or the like.
Once the set of top fans are identified, such can be provided to the content creator along with other interesting or relevant information. In some embodiments, such can be provided as a sortable table of the top N fans, where N can be substantially any positive integer. Typically, N will be less than about 1000, and in some cases N can be determined as a function of a number of subscribers of the content creator or a number of total content consumers.
As a result, content creators can be better able to find, understand, and engage with top fans. The presented table can be sorted based on engagement score, influence score, or other metrics. The table can also include a feature to quickly add a fan to or remove a fan from a social circle that relates to the content creator. In addition, real-time activity from the top fans can be presented or referenced, with prompts to respond as well as insights about the top fans as a group (e.g., what is trending or resonating with the group). Content creators can also leverage these features and data to collaborate with top fans, to share special messages or content exclusively with the top fans, or to ensure that top fans are responded to, even in cases where responses to all content consumers might be too overwhelming.
Example System that Identifies Top Fans
Various aspects or features of this disclosure are described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In this specification, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. It should be understood, however, that certain aspects of disclosure may be practiced without these specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to facilitate describing the subject disclosure.
It is to be appreciated that in accordance with one or more implementations described in this disclosure, users can consent to providing data in connection with data gathering aspects. In instances where a user consents to the use of such data, the data may be used in an authorized manner. Moreover, one or more implementations described herein can provide for anonymization of identifiers (e.g., for devices or for data collected, received, or transmitted) as well as transparency and user controls that can include functionality to enable users to modify or delete data relating to the user's use of a product or service.
Referring now to FIG. 1 , a system 100 is depicted. System 100 can, inter alia, identify top fans from among a larger set of content consumers. Embodiments disclosed herein can, for example, rank the content consumers (or top fans). Such can enable features for understanding and engaging with (potentially exclusively) a set of fans that are likely to be more receptive and appreciative and in a manner that can be more productive. System 100 can include a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes computer executable components stored in the memory, examples of which can be found with reference to FIG. 10 . It is to be appreciated that the computer 1002 can be used in connection with implementing one or more of the systems or components shown and described in connection with FIG. 1 and other figures disclosed herein. As depicted, system 100 can include an examination component 102, a scoring component 114, and a fan component 118.
While still referring to FIG. 1 , but referring also to FIG. 2 , illustration 200 is provided. Illustration 200 depicts numerous examples of transactions 104 and related data or information. As noted, in some embodiments, transactions 104 can be those for which associated information or description is publicly available (e.g., publicly available transaction 202). Such example transactions 104 can be a comment transaction 204. Comment transaction 204 can relate to information, often text-based, that is posted in relation to content 108. For instance, content consumer 106 might post a comment that expresses, “Great video! I love your ideas and the way you express them,” and such data can be included, e.g., in a comments section (that can be publicly accessible) associated with content 108.
Still referring to FIG. 1 , system 100 can include scoring component 114. Scoring component 114 can be configured to determine score 116 for a particular content consumer 106 from the set 106 based on transaction 104, in some embodiments exclusively from transactions 104 for which associated data is public. Scoring component 114 can determine a respective score 116 for all or a portion of content consumer 106 based on the transactions 104 that are particular to a give content consumer 106. It is understood that while score 106 applies to a particular content consumer 106, score 116 can be specific to content creator 110. Score 116 can reflect fondness or affinity of the content consumer 106 for the content 108 managed by the content creator 110. Hence, a particular content consumer 106 can have many scores 116, one for each suitable content creator 110. Scoring component 114 can determine score 116 in a variety of ways, potentially determining many sub-scores that can be weighted in various ways, which is further detailed with reference to FIG. 3 .
Still referring to FIG. 1 , but turning also to FIG. 3 , system 300 is provided. System 300 depicts additional aspects or features of the scoring component 114 that can determine score 116 for content consumer 106. In some embodiments, scoring component 114 can determine a number of sub-scores such as engagement score 302, influence score 306, and/or candidate score 312. Score 116 can be determined as a function of one or more of the sub-scores.
Candidate Score=Engagement score*log(Influence score)/log(X), where X is some base.
In some embodiments, candidate score 312 can be score 116. In other embodiments, score 116 can represent candidate score 312 further refined with addition data or functions, which can be various other combinations with engagement score 302 (or components thereof), influence score 306 (or components thereof), or aggregate data 316, which can be substantially any other suitable data employed to determine score 116.
Continuing the discussion of FIG. 1 , system 100 can include fan component 118. Fan component 118 can be configured to determine a set of top fans 120 for content creator 110, where the set of top fans 120 is a subset of the set of content consumers 106. The set of top fans 120 can be determined by fan component 118 based on score 116 associated with respective content consumers 106. In some embodiments, the set of top fans 120 can be scaled based on the size of the audience or popularity of a particular content creator 110. For example, set 120 might include 1,000 top fans when content creator 110 has 100,000 or more subscribers (or another suitable metric), but only include 25 top fans when content creator 110 has only about 1,000 subscribers, or 10 top fans if content creator 110 has fewer than 100 subscribers.
With reference now to FIG. 4 , system 400 is provided. System 400 provides for identifying transactions 104 that are not fan-oriented. System 400 can include all or portions of system 100 or other system or components detailed herein. For example, system 400 can receive or examine data associated with transactions 104, as detailed in connection with examination component 102 of FIG. 1 . However, prior to determining score 116 and/or set of top fans 120, transactions 104 can be filtered or otherwise tagged for other processing.
For example, system 400 can include filter component 402 that can be configured to filter transactions 104 according to a defined policy 404. Filter component 402 can thus provide filtered set of transactions 406 (based on policy 404) to scoring component 114 of FIG. 1 . Thus, score 116 and set of top fans 120 can be determined based on filtered set 406 rather than on unfiltered transactions 104. In some embodiments, filter component 402 can provide score adjustment data (detailed with reference to FIG. 5 ) for transactions 104 that meet certain filter criterion described by policy 404. Hence, rather than filtering some transactions 104, which would equate to assigning no score value to those filtered transactions 104, those transactions 104 (or some portion thereof) can instead be deemed to reflect a score penalty (e.g., a negative score). How filter component 402 treats any given transaction 104 can be based on policy 404, which can be determined by content creator 110, content hosting site or service 112, or another authorized entity or device.
Referring now to FIG. 5 , system 500 is illustrated. System 500 can provide for additional features or aspects associated with filtering and scoring transactions and presenting results. System 500 can includes filter component 402 as described herein. Filter component 402 can receive data associated with transactions 104 as well as a policy 404 that can be employed to affect the operation of filter component 402.
For example, filter component 402 can be configured to filter or flag for alternative scoring transactions 104 that are determined to be negative or abusive, which can be accomplished by abuse filter component 502.

Example Methods for Identifying Top Fans
At reference numeral 804, a score for a content consumer from the set of content consumers can be determined based on the transactions. The score can relate to a degree of fondness for the content managed by the content creator. At reference numeral 806, a set of top fans can be determined for the content creator from among the set of content consumers. The set of top fans can be determined based on the score and the number of fans include in the set of top fans can be determined based on size of the content consumer population or another metric associated with the audience of the content creator. At reference numeral 808, data relating to the set of top fans can be presented to the content creator.
Turning now to FIG. 9 , exemplary method 900 is depicted. Method 900 can provide for additional features or aspects in connection with identifying a set of top fans. Method 900 can begin at the start of insert A, which relates to examining transactions detailed in connection with reference numeral 802 of FIG. 8 . At reference numeral 902, the transactions can be filtered for removing a subset of the transactions that exhibit defined characteristics. Additionally or alternatively, the transactions that exhibit defined characteristics can be tagged for alternative or negative scoring. The filtering or tagging can occur prior to the determining the score discussed in connection with reference numeral 804 of FIG. 8 .
At reference numeral 906, an influence score can be determined relating to a determined level of influence associated with the content consumer. The level of influence can relate to a size or weight of a following of the content consumer.
At reference numeral 908, a candidate score can be determined relating to a determined level of fan value the content consumer has with respect to the content or the content creator. The candidate score can be a function of the engagement score and the influence score. The score determined at reference numeral 804 can be the candidate score or a function of one or more of the engagement score, the influence score, the candidate score, or other data.
