- As disclosed herein, a system and method are provided for achieving timing synchronization during acquisition of a signal and for achieving frequency synchronization after acquisition of the signal. The system and method are particularly useful for systems that undergo frequency drift during a message. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the system and method are implemented in a mode in which mobile devices communicate directly with one another, without the use of a network. In some instances, while the mobile devices may be capable of communicating over a network, the network may become unavailable. This lack of availability may occur due to busy cells or lack of coverage within a given area. A mode in which mobile devices communicate directly is commonly referred to as “Talkaround” or “Direct Mode”. This mode allows wireless devices to communicate directly with one another and is similar to ordinary two-way radios.
- FIG. 1 is a simple block diagram of a mobile device or
remote user equipment 100 for use in an embodiment of the invention. As explained above, theremote user equipment 100 may communicate directly with other remote user equipment. Eachremote user equipment 100 may include atransmitter 160 and areceiver 110. The transmitter includes an antenna 162 for transmission of a signal and thereceiver 110 includes anantenna 10 for reception of a signal. - In another embodiment, the system and method of the invention may operate in a network environment. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a digital communication system in which the
remote user equipment 100 may be used. Theremote user equipment 100 communicates with a fixedportion 200 including one ormore base stations 210. The fixedportion 200 may be coupled to anetwork 300 such as public switch telephone networks (PSTN) a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet or any other type of network. Theremote user equipment 100 generally communicates with other remote user equipment with the assistance of the fixedportion 200 and thenetwork 300. - FIG. 3 shows a receiver architecture contained within
remote user equipment 100. The signal is received by anRF unit 2 and is filtered by anRF filter 12 and then amplified by anRF amplifier 13. The amplified RF signal is then translated to an IF frequency by a mixer including amultiplier 14 and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 15. The IF signal frommultiplier 14 is sent to an IFunit 4 and is filtered by anIF filter 16 and then translated to baseband by a quadrature down-mixer including multipliers phase shifter 23, andbaseband filters baseband unit 40. The baseband in-phase and quadrature signals, I and Q, are then sampled bydata converters data converters unit 42. The frequency offset estimate fromDSP unit 42 is converted into a control signal, which modifies the divide modulus of a Frac-N synthesizer 28. In response, Frac-N synthesizer 28 modifies the oscillating frequency ofVCO 15 in accordance to the frequency offset estimate. - The
DSP unit 42 may include acorrelator 220,peak detector 230, acombiner 240, athreshold detector 250, a frequency offsetestimator 260, asymbol timing estimator 270, and aquality estimator 280. Each of these components is described in greater detail below in conjunction with the method of the invention. These components may be software components programmed into an appropriate processor or alternatively may be accomplished with circuitry arranged to accomplish the operations of these components as set forth below in conjunction with the method of the invention. - FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating the main procedures of the synchronization technique of the invention. In procedure A, the
correlator 220 forms N sync symbol correlations according toequation 6. In procedure B, thecombiner 240 gathers the correlations, and combines them at 2L+1 offset frequencies according toequations peak detector 230 finds a correlation peak among the 2L+1 candidate offset frequencies, according toequation 14. In procedure D, the received signal energy is computed over a moving window associated with the current sync interval under observation according toequation 10. In procedure E, thethreshold detector 250 compares the ratio of peak-to-energy to a predetermined threshold. If the threshold test is met, thesymbol timing estimator 270 performs symbol timing estimation procedure F, followed by the frequency offsetestimator 260 associated withequations quality estimator 280 associated with equation 17, marked by procedures G and H, respectively. In procedure I, if the quality exceeds a second predetermined threshold, thesynthesizer 28 is adjusted accordingly in procedure J. If, in procedure E, the ratio of peak-to-energy does not exceed the first predetermined threshold, procedure K checks to see if the sync search window has timed out. If not, a new sample is gathered in procedure L, and the entire process repeats from the beginning. If a timeout has occurred, in synchronous mode, the relative symbol timing from the previous slot is used, and the frequency offset estimation procedure G is invoked for the current data slot. If the current mode of operation is asynchronous, the time out causes the procedure to end. - As illustrated in FIG. 5, in a slotted FSK system, a
sync word 310 may be transmitted at the beginning of anFSK data slot 312 to provide a receiver such asreceiver 110 with a mechanism for tracking a transmitter's symbol timing. Thesync word 310 should exhibit good autocorrelation properties, so that it can provide reliable symbol timing information to thereceiver 110. For example, atransmitter 160 sends async word 310 at the beginning of eachslot 312. For eachslot 312, thereceiver 110 correlates against thesync word 310 within a narrowsync search window 314. The position of thesync search window 314 is based on timing established from previous slots, and should be fairly well aligned with the receivedsync word 310, as illustrated in FIG. 5. A remainder of theslot 312 may containdata 316. -
- where N is the number of symbols in the
sync word 310, Ns is the number of samples per symbol, {r(n)} is the complex-valued, received sample sequence, and {s(n)} is an undistorted template of the complex-valued, transmitted sync signal. Once c(n) exceeds a threshold, a sync “hit” has occurred. Upon finding a sync hit, thereceiver 110 performs a search for a peak correlation so that symbol timing can be estimated. - To illustrate the need for a robust sync word correlator in the presence of small frequency errors, assume that the received signal is a noiseless and distortionless version of the transmitted signal, with the exception of a small frequency offset “ω0” from the transmitted signal. Also, for FSK signals, the constant envelope property |s(n)|=A, where A is constant, applies. Finally, assume that the correlation is applied at a time n0, which happens to align exactly with the
sync word 310, in which case, the sync correlation becomes: -
- where k is any non-zero integer.
- As an example, for a digital communication system with a-baud rate of 3200 symbols/sec, and with N=8 symbols per sync word, a frequency error as small as 400 Hz will result in zero energy out of the sync correlator. In fact, errors as small as 200 Hz will cause significant signal loss, and will severely degrade a receiver's ability to detect a
sync word 310. Accordingly, a solution is needed for dealing with the sync word detection problem in the presence of small frequency errors. - For M-ary FSK signals, let the sync word symbol sequence be represented by the length-N vector {right arrow over (u)}, where each vector element is contained in the set
- umε[1−M,3−M, . . . ,M−3,M−1] (Equation 4)
-
- These equations illustrate a “divide-and-conquer” strategy, which is significantly less complex than a brute-force correlation. In the divide and conquer strategy, the correlation is divided into N smaller correlations, represented by
equation 6. - As can be seen in
equation 6, at each time n, the smaller correlations essentially correlate the received signal with a sinusoid of an expected frequency, with said expected frequency being determined by the known sync symbol u of interest, for each respective sync symbol interval. Thecombiner 240 gathers and combines the correlations according toequation 5, which accounts for the expected starting phase, given byequation 7, of each sync symbol. - FIG. 6 illustrates the correlation procedure for a sync word of length N=8 symbols. At a time n,eight correlator outputs from the
correlator 220 start with λ(n−7Ns,u0) and finish with λ(n,u7). Thesync correlator 220 then passes its outputs to thecombiner 240 that performs the operation ofEquation 5. The symbol correlations ofequation 6 can be computed efficiently using the recursive form of the Goertzel algorithm: - It can be appreciated, by those well versed in the art, that other recursive forms can be used to compute the correlator outputs of
equation 6. Different formats may be more appropriate, depending on the method of quantization used in a particulardigital signal processor 42. -
- We will use this assumption, leading to Equation 9, for many of the examples that follow.
- The
sync word correlator 220 andcombiner 240 perform the iteration ofequation 8 at each expected sync word frequency, and then, for h=1, simply add or subtract appropriate outputs. This method is approximately 5 to 10 times less complex than the brute force approach. - In order to detect the presence of the
sync word 310 at thereceiver 110, the sync correlation output is compared to a threshold. If the sync correlation ofequation 5 exceeds the threshold, the sync word is detected, and the ensuing peak of the sync correlation signal is located in order to establish symbol timing for a givenFSK data slot 312. Instead of comparing the sync correlation against a fixed threshold, it is desirable to normalize the sync correlation signal by the received signal energy, prior to threshold detection, where the energy is computed within the same time window as the sync correlation ofequation 5. Equivalently, the threshold may be scaled by the energy, and compared directly to the sync correlation signal c(n). This energy, denoted by e(n), is computed recursively also: - Upon detecting the sync word, a search is performed in a small time window following the first sync “hit”. Within this window, a peak search over the unnormalized c(n) may be performed in order to locate the symbol boundary and accurately establish symbol timing within the
receiver 110 for a givenFSK data slot 312. - The above-identified process can also be altered to account for small frequency errors. The illustration below assumes a symbol rate of 3200 baud, a modulation index of h=1 and a sync word length of 8 symbols. Referring back to
equations 5 and 9, the sync word correlator forms the following vector, at each time instant n: - If there is zero frequency error in the received signal and the received signal is time aligned with the sync word, the vector {right arrow over (x)} of equation 11 takes the form of a complex phasor with arbitrary phase. If the received signal is off in frequency, this vector should rotate in phase according to the offset, i.e., the vector looks like a complex sinusoid with a frequency equal to the offset. Distortion may exist due to timing error and energy leakage in the individual correlator outputs. However, these distortions are secondary, provided that the offset is small compared to the symbol rate.
-
- which is simply the energy in the vector {right arrow over (x)}(n) at frequencies {fk}. For the example under consideration, the frequencies may be set to:
- f k=200·k Hz (Equation 13)
- The sync correlator output for this modified algorithm is then
- c(n)=maxk [c k(n)] (Equation 14)
- For L=1, the frequency set is {−200, 0, +200} Hz, which would tolerate up to ±300 Hz of error with only a small degradation.
- FIG. 7 shows the sync hit rate (SHR) on the y-axis vs. static Es/N0 on the x-axis, where Es represents symbol energy, and N0 represents noise density, for several scenarios. The benchmark is 0 Hz error with L=0 (frequency set {0} Hz), which has the best performance as represented by
solid curve 702 in FIG. 7. For 300 Hz error with L=0, the SHR degrades severely as the sync correlator produces very little energy at its output as shown bycurve 708 in FIG. 7. When the frequency set {−200, 0, +200} Hz (L=1) is incorporated as shown bycurve 704 in FIG. 7, the SHR comes to within about 0.5 dB from the benchmark. To handle 500 Hz error, the frequency set {−400, −200, 0, +200, +400} Hz (L=2) must be used as shown bycurve 706 in FIG. 7. As long as the frequency set is appropriately selected, more frequency error can be handled and little loss will be suffered from secondary distortions, provided that the offset is small compared to the symbol rate. - The
sync symbol correlator 220 andcombiner 240 of the invention are robust in the presence of small frequency errors. The algorithms utilized by thesync symbol correlator 220 andcombiner 240 are efficient and build on the Goertzel-based symbol correlator. In addition to detecting thesync word 310 when frequency error is present, it is desirable to define a way to estimate frequency offset from the received signal in order to track out the error. The frequency offsetestimator 260 builds on the same basic idea. The symbol correlator outputs, when synchronized in time, and after phase correction, rotate in phase according to the frequency offset of the received signal. Thus, for the frequency offsetestimator 260, the following vector {right arrow over (x)} applies: - where we assume 128 symbols in the
FSK data slot 312, for example. In this case, the time no represents the end of the 128th symbol within the slot. The first eight symbols U0U1 . . . U7 are the known Sync symbols, and the remaining symbols û8û9 . . . û127 are estimates of the transmitted data symbols. The symbol estimates are based on either the raw received symbols or the error-corrected symbols. The raw symbol method is generally much simpler to implement. FIG. 7 8 shows a block diagram of how this vector is formed for the raw received symbol approach, during thedata portion 316 of theFSK slot 312. For M-ary FSK, a bank ofM symbol correlators 226 operate once per synchronized symbol interval, thus producing M complex correlations per symbol interval, where each complex correlation corresponds to a particular frequency in the M-ary FSK alphabet. Note that these correlations are the same as those described byequation 6. However, for thedata portion 316 of the slot, since symbol timing has already been established, it is only necessary to compute these once per symbol interval, so the recursive computation ofequation 8 need not be used. For each symbol interval, apeak magnitude search 262 is performed over the M correlations, and the peak indices are stored in the raw receivedsymbol buffer 232. The complex correlation associated with the raw received symbol index is stored in afrequency estimation buffer 222. Upon receiving the last data symbol within the slot, thefrequency estimation buffer 222 is phase-corrected, thus forming the vector {right arrow over (x)} ofequation 15. -
- The
frequency estimator 260 estimates the frequency offset according to a fractional argument that maximizes Px(l) over the region corresponding to, for example, [−500, 500] Hz. In this example, the frequency resolution of this FFT is 25 Hz per bin. -
- where L1 defines a region ±200 Hz, or ±8 bins, about the point l0. This l0 is computed as the frequency bin index, confined to the region [−500, 500] Hz, which maximizes Px(l). Instead of taking only the maximum frequency component, the system sums up the signal in a narrow bandwidth about the peak. This technique maintains a good SNR in the fast fading case, where energy is spread out about the nominal offset.
- In order to pass a frequency offset estimate, a sync word hit must occur during the specified slot, and SNR must be greater than a predetermined threshold, for example, 0.3. This SNR measurement is a simple and effective method for detecting bad measurements and discarding them.
- FIG. 9 summarizes the performance of the frequency offset
estimator 260 andquality estimator 280. Each table entry encapsulates the results of 500 simulated data slots. The measurements are extremely accurate, even though non-error-corrected symbols are used. - While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
