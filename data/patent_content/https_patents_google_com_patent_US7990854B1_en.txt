Definitions
- This document relates to information presentation.
- the performance of a content provisioning system is influenced by a variety of factors, including for example targeting quality, page views by user per day, economic conditions, average ad campaign quality, advertiser budget constraints, and types of publishers in the network.
- providers of a content provisioning system may change one or more quality performance requirements, such as quality measures, bid requirements, etc. Such changes, however, are predicated on expected performance increases; the true effect of these changes are verified after they are implemented by measuring system performance over a performance monitoring period. If after a performance monitoring period the changes are determined to increase performance, the changes can be permanently implemented. However, if the changes are determined to unexpectedly decrease performance, they can be removed to restore the system performance to the pre-change levels.
- Performance of a content provisioning system also depends on traffic composition factors, i.e., the percentage of traffic directed to particular web sites, domains, an other identifiable publishing providers. These traffic composition factors can be independent of other performance metrics. For example, on any given day, the relative traffic between two different websites can vary significantly. Conversely, the performance of each web site may be highly dependent on the performance requirements of the content provisioning system. Thus, if the traffic composition factors of the content provisioning system before a performance monitoring period are different from during the performance monitoring period, the effects of the changes of the performance requirements may be highly influenced by the traffic composition change in the network. This traffic influence can make it very difficult to measure the true effect imparted by the changes in the performance requirements.
- traffic composition factors i.e., the percentage of traffic directed to particular web sites, domains, an other identifiable publishing providers.
- These traffic composition factors can be independent of other performance metrics. For example, on any given day, the relative traffic between two different websites can vary significantly. Conversely, the performance of each web site may be highly dependent on the performance requirements of the content
- one aspect of the subject matter disclosed in this specification can be embodied in a method for isolation of traffic composition change in performance metrics.
- the method includes determining an overall change in a performance metric of a content provisioning system that provides content to a plurality of content publishers, the overall change in the performance metric quantifying a change in performance from a first time period to a second time period; for each of the content publishers, determining a reference traffic value common to both the first time period and the second time period; determining a reference traffic change in the performance metric of the content provisioning system based on the reference traffic values for each of the publishers, the reference traffic change quantifying a traffic-independent change in performance from the first time period to the second time period; and determining a traffic related change in the performance metric of the content provisioning system based on the reference traffic change and the overall change.
- another method for isolation of traffic composition change in performance metrics includes determining a first performance metric value for a first time period, the first performance metric value quantifying an attribute during the first time period; determining a second performance metric value for a second time period, the second performance metric value quantifying the attribute for the second time period; determining a performance change for the attribute based on the difference between the first performance metric value and the second performance metric value; determining a first weighted performance metric value for the first time period; determining a second weighted performance metric value for the second time period; determining a weighted performance change for the attribute based on the difference between the first weighted performance metric value and the second weighted performance metric value; and determining a traffic related change on the attribute based on the performance change and the weighted performance change.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online environment.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for isolation of traffic composition change.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of another example process for isolation of traffic composition change.
- FIG. 4 is block diagram of an example computer system.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online environment 100 .
- the online environment 100 can facilitate the identification and serving of content items, e.g., web pages, advertisements, etc., to users.
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects advertisers 102 a and 102 b , a content provisioning system 104 , publishers 106 a and 106 b , user devices 108 a and 108 b , and a search engine 112 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- search engine 112 a search engine
- the online environment 100 may include many any number (e.g., thousands) of advertisers, publishers and user devices.
- the example content provisioning system 104 of FIG. 1 is an advertising provisioning system. While the examples described in this specification relate to advertisements, the isolation of traffic composition effects can also be facilitated for other types of content provisioning systems, such as user-contributed video provisioning systems, audio/music provisioning systems, general document provisioning systems (e.g., blogs, news, entertainment related documents), and the like.
- one or more advertisers 102 a and/or 102 b can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement information in the content provisioning system 104 .
- the advertisements can be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisement gadgets with or without interactive features, advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, etc., or any other type of electronic advertisement document 120 .
- the advertisements may also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions, such as HTML or JavaScriptTM.
- An advertisement can be submitted, for example, as a single ad creative, in a group of related advertisements as an ad group, or in multiple ad groups that form an ad campaign.
- a user device such as user device 108 a , can submit a page content request 109 to a publisher or the search engine 112 .
- the page content 111 can be provided to the user device 108 a in response to the request 109 .
- the page content can include advertisements provided by the content provisioning system 104 , or can include executable instructions, e.g., JavaScriptTM instructions, that can be executed at the user device 108 a to request advertisements from the content provisioning system 104 .
- Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, television set-top boxes, etc.
- Advertisements can also be provided for the publishers 106 .
- one or more publishers 106 a and/or 106 b can submit advertisement requests for one or more advertisements to the content provisioning system 104 .
- the content provisioning system 104 responds by sending the advertisements to the requesting publisher 106 a or 106 b for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content).
- the content provisioning system 104 responds by sending the advertisement directly to the user device 108 a in response to a user device request for page content 111 from the one or more publishers 106 a and/or 106 b , typically via instructions embedded in the page content 111 received by the user device 108 a from the publishers 106 a and/or 106 b.
- the advertisements can include embedded links to landing pages, e.g., pages on the advertisers' 102 websites, that a user is directed to when the user clicks an ad presented on a publisher website.
- the advertisement requests can also include content request information. This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- a publisher 106 can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 .
- This combined page content 109 and advertisements can be sent to the user device 108 that requested the content (e.g., user device 108 a ) as page content 111 for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a web browser or other content display system).
- the publisher 106 can transmit information about the advertisements back to the content provisioning system 104 , including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- Publishers 106 a and 106 b can include general content servers that receive requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, audio, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, games, software, information feeds, etc.), and retrieve the requested content in response to the request.
- content servers related to news content providers, retailers, independent blogs, social network sites, or any other entity that provides content over the network 110 can be a publisher.
- Advertisements can also be provided through the use of the search engine 112 .
- the search engine 112 can receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine 112 can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- An exemplary search engine 112 is described in S. Brim and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia (1998) and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999.
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine 112 can also submit a request for advertisements to the system 104 .
- the request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the advertisements, etc.
- the request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered, parsed, or expanded), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the search engine 112 can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the user device 108 that requested the content as the page content 111 .
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and search results.
- the advertisers 102 , user devices 108 , and/or the search engine 112 can also provide usage information to the content provisioning system 104 .
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or a selection related to an advertisement has occurred.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- Such usage information can also be processed to measure performance metrics, such as a click-through rate (“CTR”), conversion rate, revenue per thousand impressions (“RPM”), etc.
- CTR click-through rate
- RPM revenue per thousand impressions
- a click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or “clicks” on a link to a content item returned by the publisher or the advertising management system.
- the CTR is a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the content item, e.g., a link to a landing page, an advertisement, or a search result, by the number of times the content item was delivered. For example, if a link to a content item is delivered 100 times, and three persons click on the content item, then the CTR for that content item is 3%. Other usage information and/or performance metrics can also be used.
- a “conversion” can occur when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, registering on a Website, etc. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the RPM can be used to measure the revenue created when a conversion occurs, or other action on a content item results in a revenue generation.
- the RPM measures the revenue generated from one thousand impressions of an advertisement. For example, if an advertisement that is served 2,000 times generates $2 in revenue, the advertisement has an RPM of $1.00.
- the RPM is a metric that can be used to measure the effectiveness of the advertisement. Other metrics that measure the performance of an advertisement can also be used, such as the CTR or the conversion rate, for example.
- Performance metrics such as CTR, conversion rate and RPM are used to evaluate performance of content served by a content provisioning system, e.g. system 104 . These metrics can be aggregated over a time period to measure the performance of the system 104 . Various factors influence these performance metrics, including targeting quality, page view per user day, economic conditions, average ad campaign quality, advertiser budget constraints, types of publishers in the network, etc.
- the performance metric RPM can measures the revenues generated per thousand impressions served by the content provisioning system 104 during a time period.
- the RPM can change from time period to time period; however, it is not apparent how much of the RPM change from one period to the next period can be attributed to changes in traffic patterns of the publishers, and how much of the RPM can be attributed to effects not directly related to traffic patterns, such as performance requirement changes related to quality thresholds and bid parameters for the content provisioning system 104 .
- These non-traffic related changes can be generally categorized as quality related changes (“traffic-independent changes”).
- Quality related changes are typically the result of changes in system quality requirements, but also include all changes not due to traffic, e.g., changes in advertiser budgets, page views per user day, external economical conditions, etc.
- a traffic composition isolator 114 can monitor changes in the performance metrics that are used to evaluate the content provisioning system 104 . When a performance change in a metric is identified, the isolator 114 can consider the quality related changes and traffic related changes experienced by the content provisioning system 104 and identify the basis of the performance change in the metric. If needed, the quality requirements and/or traffic mix parameters of the content provisioning system 104 can be adjusted to address the change in the performance metric.
- various quality improvement efforts can be applied to the content provisioning system 104 to improve the performance of the content provisioning system 104 . While these quality improvements may actually increase the overall system performance, a change in the traffic mix can also result in a performance decrease that masks the increase gained by quality improvements. Alternatively, the opposite situation may also result in which the quality improvements decrease the overall system performance but the change in the traffic mix results in a performance increase that masks the decrease caused by the quality improvements.
- the isolator 114 can thus be used to determine whether the change was caused by the quality improvement efforts, or whether the quality improvement efforts did not have a significant impact and/or whether the changes were caused by traffic related changes. In response to these determinations, the isolator 114 can adjust one or more performance requirements, such as rolling back quality changes that decrease system performance, and/or imposing traffic mix requirements if traffic is contributing to a significant performance degradation, to adjust the performance of the system.
- traffic components in the system can be attributed on a publisher basis.
- the isolator 114 can determine the factors that have an effect on the performance metrics by quantifying the effect of any publisher related change (i.e., the amount of traffic change to a publisher) on the performance metric, and the effect of any quality related changes on the performance metric. For example, the isolator 114 can determine the overall change in a performance metric measuring the performance of different publishers during a time period, a reference traffic value for each of the publishers, and a reference traffic change in the performance metric based on the reference traffic values. Using these metrics, the isolator 114 can then determine a traffic related change in the performance metric.
- Table 1 below illustrates the scenario in which changes are attributed entirely to traffic changes.
- two publishers Publishers A and B, can publish various advertisements provided by the content provisioning system 104 .
- the metric of revenue per thousand impressions can measure the amount of revenue generated by advertisements provided by content provisioning system 104 for publication on Publishers A and B. Because the content provisioning system 104 serves advertisements for each page view, each page view can be considered an impression.
- Table 1 shows the sample revenue generated from the content provisioning system 104 by publisher, by day.
- the performance of the content provisioning system 104 for each day can be identified by using the aggregate RPM for the content provisioning system 104 for that day.
- the RPM for Publisher A for Day 1 is 1, because the $1 in revenue was generated for 1000 page views.
- the RPM for Publisher B for Day 1 is 10, because advertisements served by Publisher B generated $10 in revenue for 1000 page views.
- the RPM for Day 2 for Publisher A and Day 2 for Publisher B are calculated in an identical manner and listed in Table 1 above, respectively $1 and $10.
- the isolator 114 first identifies an overall performance change in the performance of the content provisioning system 104 .
- the aggregate RPM for a time period can be determined by calculating the total revenue generated during that day, and dividing it by the number of impressions during that day (where Pub. X is the replaced with Publisher A, and then Publisher B):
- the difference between the aggregate of the performance metric at two different points in the time period identify the performance change of the content provisioning system 104 .
- This performance change can be used to monitor the performance of the content provisioning system 104 over time.
- the overall change in the performance of the content provisioning system 104 as measured by RPM is the difference between the Day 1 RPM and the Day 2 RPM, as a percentage of the initial RPM:
- the performance change in a performance metric of the content provisioning system 104 over time can be due to quality and traffic factors.
- the change due to quality can be determined by calculating a weighted performance metric for each of the time periods.
- a weighted performance metric is determined by using a reference traffic value that is, in some implementations, a constant level of traffic over multiple time periods.
- the reference traffic value can be a volume of traffic for each publisher that is common to each of the monitored time periods.
- the minimum value for traffic for a publisher in any of the subject time periods is used as the reference traffic value for that publisher.
- the minimum traffic value for Publisher A during either Day 1 or Day 2 is 1000 (the number of page views for Publisher A on Day 1 or Day 2, as both values are equal).
- the minimum traffic value for Publisher B during either Day 1 or Day 2 is 500 (the number of page views for Publisher B on Day 2).
- the reference traffic value for Publisher A is 1000
- the reference traffic value of Publisher B is 500.
- the minimum traffic level is used in this example, other reference traffic volumes can also be used, e.g., maximum traffic level, average traffic level, etc.
- the reference traffic value is used to determine a weighted value for the performance metric.
- the weighted value for the performance metric is calculated by determining the performance metric of the content provisioning system 104 using the constant reference traffic level in place of the actual traffic level:
- the difference between the weighted performance metric values at two points in time during the time period is the reference traffic change.
- the reference traffic change is the change expected in the performance of the content provisioning system 104 if the traffic remained constant over time.
- the reference traffic change provides a traffic adjusted value to compare with the overall performance change. For example, where the weighted Day 1 RPM value is 4.0 and the weighted Day 2 RPM value is 4.0, the reference traffic change is 0:
- the reference traffic change is indicative of the change in the performance due to quality
- no change in the performance metric is due to the quality of the content. Rather, any change in the performance metric over the time periods is due to traffic. ⁇ 3.3 Determining the Traffic and Quality Related Changes
- the reference traffic change indicates if there is a quality and/or traffic related change to the performance metric values during the time period.
- Quality related changes are changes in the performance metric value during the time period that are caused by changes in the quality of the content served by the content provisioning system.
- the quality related change are changes in the performance metric that are not caused by a change in the traffic to the publishers, or equivalently the quality related change is the same as the reference traffic change. For example, reference traffic change for the content provisioning system 104 is 0, thus the quality related change is also 0.
- the reference traffic change also indicates if there is a traffic related change.
- the overall performance change over time is a product of the traffic related change and the quality related change. Accordingly, the quality related change in the performance metric value is used to determine the traffic related change in the performance metric value during the time period:
- the reference traffic change of 0 indicates that the quality related change from Day 1 to Day 2 was also 0.
- the overall RPM change during that time period was ⁇ 0.491, as calculated above. Because the overall RPM change is a product of the traffic related changes and the quality related changes, the traffic related changes can be calculated:
- the sign of the change values indicate the effect that the traffic and quality related factors had on the performance metric.
- a negative value means that the performance metric was decreased over the time period, while a positive value means the performance was increased over the time period.
- a traffic related change of ⁇ 0.491 means that traffic related changes contributed to a 49.1% decrease in the RPM.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for isolation of traffic composition change 200 .
- the example process 200 is described in the context of the scenario in which changes are attributed entirely to quality changes.
- the process 200 can be used in the isolator 114 of FIG. 1 , or in some other data processing apparatus that can perform the operations described below.
- Stage 202 determines an overall change in a performance metric.
- the overall change in the performance metric quantifies a change in the performance of a content provisioning from a first time period to a second time period.
- the isolator 114 can identify a change in the RPM of the content provisioning system 104 from Day 1 to Day 2 based on the data shown in Table 2.
- Stage 204 determines a reference traffic value for each of the content publishers.
- the reference traffic value is a value that is common to both the first time period and the second time period. For example, the isolator 114 can determine the minimum traffic value for Publisher A during either Day 1 or Day 2 is 2000. Similarly, the minimum traffic value for Publisher B during either Day 1 or Day 2 is 1000.
- Stage 206 determines a reference traffic change in the performance metric.
- the reference traffic change quantifies a traffic-independent change in the performance of the content provisioning system from the first time period to the second time period.
- the reference traffic change is based on the reference traffic values provided for each of the publishers. For example, the isolator 114 can determine weighted RPM values for each of the time periods:
- Stage 208 determines a traffic related change in the performance metric.
- the traffic related change indicates the effect that changes in traffic had on the performance of the content provisioning system.
- the isolator 114 can use the reference traffic change to determine the traffic independent change on the performance metric.
- the reference traffic change for the system 114 is ⁇ 0.143, thus the quality related change is also ⁇ 0.143.
- the traffic related change can be calculated from the overall performance change and the traffic independent change:
- the isolator 114 determines that there is no traffic related change. This means that traffic related factors did not affect the RPM in the time period, but the quality related changes decreased the RPM by 0.143 in the time period. This result is expected because, as Table 2 illustrates, the traffic for both publishers remained the same for both days. The only variable that changed is the RPM of the publishers.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of another example process for isolation of traffic composition change 300 .
- the example process 300 is described in the context of the scenario in which changes are attributed both to traffic and quality changes.
- the process 300 can be used in the isolator 114 of FIG. 1 , or in some other data processing apparatus that can perform the operations described below.
- Stage 302 determines a first performance metric value for a first time period and a second performance metric value for a second time period.
- the first performance metric value can quantify an attribute for the first time period
- the second performance metric value can quantify the attribute for the second time period.
- the isolator 114 can determine that the first performance metric value for Day 1 as 4.67, and the second performance metric value for Day 2 as 6.4.
- Stage 304 determines a performance change for the attribute.
- the performance change can be the difference between the first performance metric value and the second performance metric value.
- the isolator 114 can determine that the performance change in the RPM is 1.73. As a percentage change, the overall change is 0.371:
- Stage 306 determines a first weighted performance metric value for the first time period and a second weighted performance metric value for the second time period.
- the first weighted performance metric value for the first time and the second weighted performance metric value for the second time period can be determined by the isolator 114 using the minimum traffic value for each publisher.
- Stage 308 determines a weighted performance change for the attribute.
- the weighted performance change can be the difference between the first weighted performance metric value and the second weighted performance metric value.
- the weighted performance change can be used as the reference traffic change.
- the isolator 114 can determine the weighted performance change for the attribute to be ⁇ 0.143.
- Stage 310 determines a traffic related change on the attribute.
- the traffic related change can be determined based on the performance change and the weighted performance change.
- the isolator 114 can determine the weighted performance change for the system 104 to be ⁇ 0.143.
- This weighted performance change also can be the non-traffic related change.
- the traffic related change can be calculated from the overall performance change and the non-traffic related change:
- the traffic related change on the RPM is 0.600. This means that traffic related change increased the RPM in the time period by 0.60, and the non-traffic related change decreased the RPM in the time period by ⁇ 0.143.
- the traffic related change and the non traffic related change values both contribute to a change in RPM during the time period, as defined by the following ratio:
- the performance metric can be a click through rate. For example, a positive traffic related change would indicate that traffic increased the click-through rate, or a negative quality related change would indicate that quality decreased the click-through rate.
- the performance metrics can be measured over a weekly period. For example, traffic related change would indicate that the performance metric changed from one week to the next.
- this method can be used to isolate the effect of each of the different quality factors to the extent that the non-traffic change can be isolated. For example, after the traffic related change was identified in this example as 0.60, this method can be used to determine the effect of the country in which the traffic originates from.

For example, the RPM and Page Views for Publisher A and Publisher B are used to generate a Day 1 RPM of 5.5, and a Day 2 RPM of 2.8:
This aggregate RPM can be calculated for each time period to evaluate the performance of the
Thus, where the time periods evaluated are the days shown in Table 1, the RPM change from Day 1 to Day 2 was −0.491. This decrease in RPM indicates that the performance of the
§3.2 Determining a Reference Traffic Change in the Performance
For example, the weighted RPM value for Day 1 is 4.0 and the weighted RPM value for Day 2 is 4.0:
In this example, there is no difference between the traffic adjusted values of the two time periods, e.g., the weighted RPM. Thus, there is no reference traffic change. Because the reference traffic change is indicative of the change in the performance due to quality, in this example no change in the performance metric is due to the quality of the content. Rather, any change in the performance metric over the time periods is due to traffic.
§3.3 Determining the Traffic and Quality Related Changes
The RPM change from Day 1 to Day 2 was −0.491, and the traffic related change was also −0.491. The traffic related change (−0.491) is the same as the overall change, and there is no quality related change. This result is expected because, as Table 1 illustrates, the RPM for both publishers remained the same for both days, and also because the reference traffic change, a measure of performance change if the traffic remained constant, is 0. The only variable that changed is the traffic mix of the publishers.

Publisher A | Day 1 | 2000 | 4 | 2 | ||
Day 2 | 2000 | 2 | 1 | |||
Publisher B | Day 1 | 1000 | 10 | 10 | ||
Day 2 | 1000 | 10 | 10 | |||
The RPM for Publisher A for Day 1 is 2 and the RPM for Publisher B for Day 1 is 1. Thus, the RPM for Day 1 is 4.67:
The RPM for Day 2 for Publisher A and Day 2 for Publisher B are calculated in an identical manner and listed in Table 2 above, respectively $10 and $10. Thus, the RPM for Day 2 is 4:
Based on these values, the overall change in the performance metric is 0.67. As a fraction of the whole, the overall change is −0.1429:
The weighted RPM values can be used to determine the reference traffic change.

For example, the
The traffic related change on the RPM is 0.600. This means that traffic related change increased the RPM in the time period by 0.60, and the non-traffic related change decreased the RPM in the time period by −0.143. For example, the traffic related change and the non traffic related change values both contribute to a change in RPM during the time period, as defined by the following ratio:
By analysis of the magnitude of the values, the relative effect of the traffic and non-traffic factors can be identified. Thus, increasing the RPM of Day 1 by 0.60 to account for the traffic related change would bring the RPM to 7.47. If that value is decreased by 0.143 to account for the non-traffic related change, the Day 2 RPM is 6.40, which was the value of the RPM on Day 2.
