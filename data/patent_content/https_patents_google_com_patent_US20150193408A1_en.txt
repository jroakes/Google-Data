-
Document view 410 is typically used to receive and display user inputs. For example, cursor 430-A is displayed indocument view 410, and when the user types characters on keyboard 303 (FIG. 3 ), the typed characters are inserted to a location in the displayed document corresponding to a location of the cursor. In addition, the typed characters are displayed at a location that corresponds to a location of cursor 430-A. As illustrated,document view 410 includes text provided by a user. -
Information item view 412 includes a plurality of information items. The plurality of information items are typically grouped into categories. As illustrated,information item view 412 includes Web Results 420-1, News Search 420-2, and Book Search 420-3 categories. A respective category generally includes one or more information items. However, in some cases, some categories may not include any information item (when there is no matching information item in that category). Typically, category heading 420 for a category that does not include any information item is not displayed. In some embodiments, respective category heading 420 is a user interface object that when activated initiates displaying additional information items in a corresponding category. For example, in some embodiments, when a user activates Web Results 420-1 (e.g., positioning a mouse cursor on Web Results 420-1 and clicking on it),information item view 412 displays additional information items in the web results category. In some embodiments, activating the “See more Web results” user interface object generates the same result. Alternatively, activating Web Results 420-1 may open a new web page (in a new window or a new tab of the current window) with additional web results. - In some embodiments, a respective information item in
information item view 412 includes subject/title 422, focus region 424, and source 426. Subject/title 422 is typically a subject or title specified in a corresponding document. For example, when the information item corresponds to a web page, subject/title 422 is typically a title of the corresponding web page. In some embodiments, subject/title 422 is determined in accordance with the content of the document (e.g., the first sentence of the document or the most frequently used phrases, etc.). - In some embodiments, focus region 424 is a region in the corresponding document that includes some key words identified from the displayed document. As illustrated, the displayed document includes the phrase “healthcare debate” in multiple locations, and a respective information item corresponds to a respective document that includes the phrase “healthcare debate.” The portion of the respective document that includes the phrase “healthcare debate” is displayed as a focus region. When the respective document includes the identified key words (or key phrase(s)) in multiple regions, one of the multiple regions is selected as a representative focus region. In some embodiments, a region that best matches the identified key words is selected (e.g., the selected region includes the key words exactly, or the identified key words appear in the selected region with the least number of words among the identified key words). For example, in the respective document, a first paragraph, a title, or a last paragraph that includes the key words is selected. Alternatively, focus region 424 is a representative region of the corresponding document, often pre-selected by the author or the publisher of the corresponding document.
- In some embodiments, source 426 indicates where the corresponding document is located. For example, source 426 may include a URL of the corresponding document (e.g., “www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/ . . . ”), or the name of the source of the corresponding document (e.g., “CBS News (blog)”). In some embodiments, activating source 426 initiates displaying a corresponding document (in a new window or a new tab of the current window).
- In some embodiments, activating a respective source (e.g., 426-1) initiates inserting a citation to a corresponding information item (e.g., 422-1). In addition or instead, activating a respective focus region (e.g., 424-1) initiates inserting the citation to the corresponding information item (e.g., 422-1). Optionally, activating a title (e.g., 422-1) also initiates inserting the citation to the corresponding information item (e.g., 422-1).
- In some embodiments,
information item view 412 is scrollable.FIG. 4B illustrates an example of user interface 402-B after scrollinginformation item view 412. After scrolling,information item view 412 displays an additional category, Scholar Search Results 420-4, and an information item with title 422-4, focus region 424-4, and additional information (e.g., a number of times a corresponding article has been cited, such as “Cited by 62”) about this information item. -
FIG. 4C illustrates an example of user interface 402-C after selection of an information item (e.g., by activating the title, focus region, or source of the information item). In response to the selection of the information item,citation 440 to the selected information item is inserted into the document displayed indocument view 410 at a previous location of cursor 430-B (FIG. 4B ). Aftercitation 440 is inserted, the cursor moves to new location 430-C. -
FIG. 4D illustrates an example of user interface 402-D in accordance with some embodiments. User interface 402-D inFIG. 4D includes a web page that corresponds toURL 454. The web page includes the following, or a subset or superset thereof: -
- subject 456 that includes a subject of the displayed document;
-
document editor menu 408; -
document view 410 that includes at least a subset of a document; and -
document information view 452 that includes information associated with a plurality of identified documents.

Document information view 452 includes information associated with a plurality of identified documents. The plurality of identified documents is identified in accordance with one or more words in a document displayed indocument view 410. The plurality of identified documents is typically grouped into categories. As illustrated,document information view 452 includes local documents (“Local”) and online documents (“Docs”) categories. A respective category generally includes information associated with one or more documents. However, in some cases, some categories may not include document information corresponding to any document (when there is no matching document in that category). In some embodiments, a respective category is a user interface object that when activated initiates displaying information corresponding to additional documents in the respective category. For example, in some embodiments, when a user activates the “Local” text (e.g., by positioning a mouse cursor on the “Local” text and clicking on it), thedocument information view 452 displays additional documents in the local documents category. In some embodiments, activating the “See more Local results” user interface object generates the same result. Alternatively, activating the “Local” text may open a new web page (in a new window or a new tab of the current window) with information corresponding to additional local documents. - In some embodiments, document information corresponding to a respective document in
document information view 452 includes subject ortitle 440, focus region 442, and source 444 corresponding to the respective document. Subject ortitle 440 is typically specified by a user as a subject or title of the corresponding document. Alternatively,title 440 is determined in accordance with the content of the corresponding document (e.g., the first sentence of the document, the most frequently used phrase, or a predefined number of words in the beginning of the document). - In some embodiments, focus region 442 is a region in the corresponding document that includes some key words identified from the displayed document. As illustrated, the displayed document includes the terms “positive effect” and “Internet,” and
related document view 452 includes respective documents that include the terms “positive effect” and/or “Internet.” In addition, a respective portion of the respective document that includes the terms “positive effect” and/or “Internet” is displayed as a focus region (e.g., 442-1, 442-2, and 442-3). - In some embodiments, when the respective document includes the identified key words in multiple regions, one of the multiple regions is selected as a representative focus region. In some embodiments, a region that best matches the identified key words is selected (e.g., the selected region includes the key words exactly, or the identified key words appear in the selected region with the least number of words among the identified key words). In some embodiments, a first paragraph, a title, or a last paragraph that includes the key words is selected.
- In some embodiments, source 444 indicates a location of the corresponding document. In some embodiments, activating source 444 initiates displaying the document (in a new window or a new tab of the current window). In some embodiments, activating source 444 initiates displaying information that corresponds to documents in the source (e.g., documents in the same folder or directory with the corresponding document).
- In some embodiments, activating a respective focus region (e.g., 442-1) initiates inserting the focus specification of the corresponding document (e.g., 442-1) in the document displayed in
document view 410, in some embodiments. In some embodiments, activating a respective source (e.g., 444-1) initiates inserting the focus specification of the corresponding document (e.g., 442-1) in the document displayed indocument view 410. Optionally, activating a subject (e.g., 440-1) also initiates inserting the focus specification (e.g., 442-1) of the corresponding document in the document displayed in thedocument view 410. -
FIG. 4E illustrates an example of user interface 402-E after selection of a document information corresponding to a respective document (e.g., by activating the title, focus region, or source of the respective document). In response to the selection of the respective document, a focus region corresponding to the respective document is inserted into the document displayed indocument view 410. -
FIGS. 5A-5E are flowcharts representing a method performed at a server system for inserting a citation to a document, in accordance with some embodiments. The method is performed at a server system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs executed by the one or more processors (e.g.,document system 108,FIG. 1 ). - The server system receives (502) from a respective client system a subset of a document displayed at the respective client system (e.g., a portion of a document displayed in
document view 410 inFIG. 4B ). In some embodiments, the subset includes an entire document. In some embodiments, the subset includes all words in the document. In some embodiments, the subset includes a predefined number of most recent words (or most recently typed or edited words) in the document. In some embodiments, the subset includes a most recent sentence (or a most recently typed or edited sentence) in the document. In some embodiments, the subset includes a predefined number of most recent sentences (or most recently typed or edited sentences) in the document. In some embodiments, the subset includes a most recent paragraph (or a most recently typed or edited paragraph) in the document. In some embodiments, the subset includes a predefined number of most recent paragraphs (or most recently typed or edited paragraphs) in the document. - In some embodiments, the server system receives from the respective client system the subset of the document that corresponds to the cursor location on the document displayed on the respective client system.
- In some embodiments, the subset of the document corresponds (504) to a cursor location on the document.
- In some embodiments, the document includes (506) a plurality of sections, and a first section of the plurality of sections corresponds to the cursor location. Receiving the subset of the document includes receiving one or more section titles corresponding to the first section (e.g., in
FIG. 4A , the term “Background” is a section title for the paragraph starting with “Healthcare is an important topic . . . ”). In some embodiments, a respective section title is explicitly designated as a section title (e.g., based on a property (or style) of a term, phrase, or sentence). - In some embodiments, the server system receives (508) from the respective client system the cursor location on the document, and identifies the one or more words in the received subset of the document in accordance with the cursor location on the document. For example, the server system receives from the respective client system a character count that represents the cursor location on the document (e.g., the cursor is located after an N-number of characters from the beginning of the document). The server system determines the cursor location in accordance with the character count, and identifies one or more words adjacent to the cursor location. Alternatively, the server system may receive a word count, a sentence count, or a paragraph count from the respective client system.
- In some embodiments, the subset of the document includes (510) a plurality of consecutive words at locations corresponding to the cursor location. In some embodiments, the consecutive words include a word positioned at a location that corresponds to the cursor location (e.g., the cursor is co-located with the included word).
- In some embodiments, the subset of the document corresponding to the cursor location on the document includes (512) a first predefined number of words before the cursor position and a second predefined number of words after the cursor position. In some embodiments, the first predefined number and the second predefined number are identical. In some embodiments, the first predefined number and the second predefined number are distinct. In some embodiments, the first predefined number is zero and the second predefined number is non-zero. In some embodiments, the first predefined number is non-zero and the second predefined number is zero. In some embodiments, the first and second predefined numbers are defined by first and second rules. For example, the first predefined number is the number of words in a predefined portion of the document (e.g., a sentence, paragraph, section, document) positioned before the cursor, but not exceeding a first threshold (e.g., the first word of the document), and the second predefined number is the number of words in the same predefined portion of the document positioned after the cursor position, but not exceeding a second threshold (e.g., the last word of the document).
- In some embodiments, the subset of the document is received (514) automatically, when any of a set of predefined client system conditions is satisfied. For example, the predefined client system conditions for sending a subset of the document to the server include: a change in cursor position to a new section (paragraph, etc.) of the document, entry of at least a threshold amount of new text or revised text (e.g., at least one new word, or revision of at least one word), and a change in text formatting (e.g., highlighting text, underlining text). The subset of the document is typically received without a user request to send the subset of the document from the respective client system.
- The server system identifies (516,
FIG. 5B ) one or more words in the received subset of the document (e.g., “Healthcare Debate” inFIG. 4A ). In some embodiments, the one or more words include all words in the received subset of the document. In some embodiments, the one or more words include a predefined number of most recent words in the received subset of the document. In some embodiments, the one or more words include a most recent sentence in the received subset of the document. In some embodiments, the one or more words include a predefined number of most recent sentences in the received subset of the document. In some embodiments, the one or more words include a most recent paragraph in the received subset of the document. - In some embodiments, the one or more words in the received subset of the document correspond (518) to high ranking words among words in the document ranked in accordance with inverse document frequency values. In some embodiments, the one or more words in the received subset of the document correspond to a predefined number of high ranking words among the ranked words.
- In some embodiments, the one or more words in the received subset of the document correspond (520) to high ranking words among words in a most recently edited paragraph ranked in accordance with inverse document frequency values. In some embodiments, the one or more words in the received subset of the document correspond to high ranking words among words in a predefined number of most recently edited paragraphs.
- In some embodiments, the server system identifies (522) a most recently edited portion of the document, and a remainder portion of the document that excludes the most recently edited portion. The one or more words in the received subset of the document correspond to a difference set of words. The difference set of words comprises words included in a first set of words other than words included in a second set of words. The first set of words includes high ranking words among words in the most recently edited paragraph ranked in accordance with inverse document frequency values, and the second set of words includes high ranking words among words in the remainder portion of the document ranked in accordance with inverse document frequency values. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the first set of words is called a paragraph set of words, and the second set of words is called a remainder set of words. In one example, the first set includes “Clinton,” and “Healthcare,” and the second set includes “Healthcare” and “Obama.” Then the difference set includes “Clinton,” and not “Healthcare.” In some embodiments, the identified one or more words in the received subset include the difference set of words.
- In some embodiments, the one or more words in the received subset of the document include one or more words highlighted by a user associated with the respective client system (e.g., by changing font color or background color, underlining, italicizing, or changing to bold fonts, etc.).
- The server system sends (524,
FIG. 5C ) to the respective client system one or more information items corresponding to the one or more words (e.g.,operation 914,FIG. 9 ). In some embodiments, the one or more information items are web search results that are obtained using the one or more words as search key words. In some embodiments, in addition, or alternatively, the one or more information items are obtained from a news search, a book search, and/or an academic publication search. - In some embodiments, the one or more information items are selected (526) from a set of search results comprising web search results, news search results, book search results, and academic publication search results (e.g.,
FIGS. 4A-4B ). - In some embodiments, sending to the respective client system one or more information items corresponding to the one or more words includes (528) sending to the respective client system respective citations to the one or more information items. In some embodiments, the server system simultaneously sends the information items and the citations. In some embodiments, the citations are formatted in accordance with a predefined format. For example, the predefined format may be one of: the Chicago format, the Modern Language Association (MLA) format, and the American Psychological Association (APA) format. In some embodiments, the predefined format includes a set of attributes and values so that a citation sent by the server system is configured for conversion into any other format (e.g., the Chicago format, the MLA format, the APA format, etc.).
- In some embodiments, the server system performs (530) a search to obtain a set of search results. The search is defined in accordance with the one or more words (e.g., a search is performed using the one or more words as query terms), and the one or more information items are selected from the set of search results. In some embodiments, the server system internally performs a search (e.g., without using other search engines). Alternatively or additionally, the server system performs a search by using one or more search engines (e.g.,
search engine system 104,FIG. 1 ). For example, the server system sends a query to the one or more search engines using the search engine interface (220,FIG. 2 ), and receives one or more search results from the one or more search engines (104,FIG. 1 ). In some embodiments, the one or more information items sent (524) to the respective client system include at least a subset of the search results. - In some embodiments, the set of search results comprises (532) web search results, news search results, book search results, and academic publication search results. In some embodiments, the set of search results includes any subset or superset of such search results (e.g., the search results may include, additionally or alternatively, document search results). In some embodiments, the one or more search engines include a web search engine, a news search engine, a book search engine, and an academic publication search engine. In some embodiments, the one or more search engines include a subset or superset of such search engines (e.g., the search results may include, additionally or alternatively, a document search engine.
- In some embodiments, the one or more information items include respective links (e.g., a universal resource locator (URL)) to corresponding information. In some embodiments, the respective client system receiving the one or more information items retrieves the corresponding information using the respective links. In some embodiments, the server system retrieves the corresponding information using the respective links (e.g., the server system retrieves the corresponding information from another online server). In some embodiments, the one or more information items include (534) respective links to corresponding information on the server system.
- In some embodiments, the server system retrieves (536) a user profile of the user associated with the respective client system, and sends to the respective client system one or more information items corresponding to the user profile and the one or more words. In some embodiments, the user profile includes filtering criteria. Typically, the filtering criteria includes a list of sources (e.g., selection of search engines or types of search engines), categories of information (e.g., web page, academic publication, etc.), timing criteria (e.g., results published after a predefined year), or any subset or superset thereof. In some embodiments, the filtering criteria, additionally or alternatively, includes banned keywords (for excluding search results that include the banned keywords) and/or required keywords (for identifying exclusively search results that include the required keywords).
- The server system receives (538,
FIG. 5D ) a selection of an information item in the one or more information items. The selection is made by a user associated with the respective client system. For example, the user selects the information item usinguser interface 300, such as keyboard/mouse 303 (FIG. 3 ). - The server system modifies (540) the document by inserting a citation to the selected information item. For example, the user interface in
FIG. 4C illustrates that the document displayed indocument view 410 is modified to includecitation 440 that corresponds to the information item with focus region 424-4. In some embodiments, the server system sends to the respective client system at least a subset of the modified document. - In some embodiments, instead of directly modifying the document (e.g.,
operation 540,FIG. 5D ), the server system sends to a respective client system a set of instructions for modifying the document in accordance with the selection of an information item. In such embodiments, the server system receives (502,FIG. 5A ) from a respective client system a subset of a document displayed at the respective client system, identifies (516,FIG. 5B ) one or more words in the received subset of the document, and sends (524,FIG. 5C ) to the respective client system one or more information items corresponding to the one or more words. In addition, the server system sends (542,FIG. 5E ) to the respective client system instructions for receiving a selection of an information item in the one or more information items and modifying the displayed document by inserting a citation to the selected information item. The selection is made by a user associated with the respective client system. In some embodiments, the server system sends the instructions before or without receiving the subset of the document displayed at the respective client system. In some embodiments, the server system sends a web page that includes the instructions. When the respective client system executes the instructions, the respective client system modifies the displayed document in accordance with the instructions. In some embodiments, the respective client system sends the modified document to the server system, and the server system receives and stores the modified document. - In some embodiments, the server system sends (544) to the respective client system one or more instructions for formatting the citation to the selected information item in accordance with a predefined formatting rule. In some embodiments, the respective client system formats the citation in accordance with the predefined formatting rule by executing the received instructions. Similar to the instructions described above with reference to
operation 542, in some embodiments, the server system sends the instructions before or without receiving the subset of the document displayed at the respective client system. In some embodiments, the server system sends a web page that includes the instructions. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart representing a method performed at a client system for modifying a displayed document, in accordance with some embodiments. The method is performed at a client system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs executed by the one or more processors (e.g.,client 102,FIG. 1 ). - The client system identifies (602) one or more words in a first document displayed at the client system. In some embodiments, the one or more words include all words in the first document. In some embodiments, the one or more words include a predefined number of most recent words in the first document. In some embodiments, the one or more words include a most recent sentence in the first document. In some embodiments, the one or more words include a predefined number of most recent sentences in the first document. In some embodiments, the one or more words include a most recent paragraph in the first document.
- The client system initiates (604) a search to identify one or more documents. Each identified document includes a respective focus region corresponding to at least some of the one or more words. In some embodiments, the respective focus region is one of: a plurality of consecutive words, a sentence, a plurality of consecutive sentences, a paragraph, a plurality of consecutive paragraphs, a title, and a heading. In some embodiments, at least one of the identified one or more documents includes a sentence that contains the one or more words. In another example, at least one of the identified one or more documents includes a paragraph that contains the one or more words. In some embodiments, the respective focus region is the entire document. In some embodiments, the respective focus region includes an image or a video associated with a caption corresponding to at least some of the one or more words. In some embodiments, the respective focus region includes an image or video in the document, for which a text paragraph preceding or subsequent to the image or video corresponds to at least some of the one or more words.
- In some embodiments, the initiating comprises (606) performing the search at the client system. In some embodiments, at least one of the one or more documents is stored at the client system (e.g., 332,
FIG. 3 ). Thus, in some embodiments, the one or more identified documents include at least one document stored at the client system. - Alternatively or additionally, the initiated search is performed by a document server or other search system that has access to documents for which the user has the right to copy content. For example, in some embodiments, the client system sends a search query to one or more search engines (e.g.,
search engine system 104,FIG. 1 ). In such embodiments, in response to initiating the search, the client system typically receives one or more search results from the one or more search engines. Alternatively, the client system sends the search query to documentsystem 108, anddocument system 108 either performs the search internally, or performs the search using one or more search engines (e.g., 104,FIG. 1 ). In some embodiments, the one or more identified documents include at least one online document that is not stored at the client system (e.g., a web page stored at a remote web server). - In some embodiments, the respective focus region includes (608) one or more consecutive sentences that collectively contain at least some of the one or more words. In some embodiments, the one or more consecutive sentences collectively contain the one or more words.
- In some embodiments, the respective focus region includes (610) up to a predefined number of sentences. Each sentence includes at least one of the one or more words. In some embodiments, the predefined number of sentences collectively contains the one or more words.
- The client system displays (612) document information corresponding to a subset of the identified documents. For example, the document information includes a title, an author, and/or a date of last change or access (e.g., a title and a date in heading 440-1,
FIG. 4D ). In some embodiments, the client system displays one or more images and/or screenshots of one or more videos corresponding to the subset of the identified documents (e.g., one or more images and/or one or more screenshots of one or more videos included in the subset of the identified documents). - In some embodiments, displaying document information includes (614) displaying respective focus regions corresponding to the subset of the identified documents (e.g., 442-1,
FIG. 4D ). In some embodiments, the respective focus regions include one or more images and/or one or more screenshots of one or more videos corresponding to the subset of the identified documents. - In some embodiments, the document information includes (616) respective locations of corresponding documents. In some embodiments, the document information includes respective locations of corresponding documents on the client system. In some cases, a respective location of a corresponding document is a file path of the corresponding document (e.g., 444-1,
FIG. 4D ). In some embodiments, the document information includes respective locations of corresponding documents at remote servers. In some cases, a respective location of a corresponding document is a uniform resource locator of the corresponding document. - The client system detects (618) a selection of a second document in the subset of the identified documents. For example, a user selects the second document using the
user interface 300, such as the keyboard/mouse 303 (FIG. 3 ). - In some embodiments, the client system responds (620) to the selection of the second document by removing the second document from the subset of the identified documents. For example, document information concerning the history of the Internet (e.g., 440-3,
FIG. 4D ) may cease to be displayed after a focus region corresponding to the second document is inserted into the displayed document. In such embodiments, information concerning one or more other identified documents is displayed in place of the removed second document. - The client system modifies (622) the first document by inserting the respective focus region of the second document. For example, in
FIG. 4E , the focus region corresponding to the selected document (e.g., “the beginning of the Internet is . . . ”) is inserted in the displayed document. In some embodiments, the client system inserts a respective image or a screenshot of a video of the second document into the first document. In some embodiments, the client system inserts (e.g., embeds) a video of the second document into the first document. - In some embodiments, the identifying (602), initiating (604), displaying (612), detecting (618), and modifying (622) are performed (624) while displaying the first document at the client system. In some embodiments, the client system performs a real-time search to identify corresponding documents. In some embodiments, the client system automatically performs the identifying (602), initiating (604), and displaying (612) operations, without any explicit user request for such operations. In other words, the user does not need to click on any “search” icon or a similar user interface object to initiate the identifying (602), initiating (604), and displaying (612) operations.
