The historical query information that information classification device 136 depends in the inquiry log database 140 makes up and maintenance information taxonomy database 134.As described below with reference to Fig. 3 C, information classification device 136 also is configured to generate subscriber profile information with the grouped data in the information classification database 134 and historical query information.
Fig. 2 A illustrates the data structure 200 that storage relates to the historical query information of user's set that is used for according to some embodiment.Data structure 200 comprises multiple queries record 202-1-202-N, and the information server system 130 that each record is submitted to from the relevant position in the corresponding time corresponding to relative users is safeguarded the inquiry of query-related information for it.In certain embodiments, query note 202 can comprise with lower one or more: user ID (identification is submitted to and the user who records 202 corresponding inquiries) and session id 204; The query terms 206 of inquiry; And a plurality of URL ID (for example, the query history information 208 210-1...210-Q), and about the additional information (212-1...212-Q) of the URL ID in the Search Results that comprises the Search Results that represents described inquiry.In certain embodiments, the information of Q (for example, 40 or 50) Search Results before the query note 202 of respective queries is only stored is even inquiry may generate number much larger than this Search Results.
In certain embodiments, the additional information of corresponding URL ID comprises the data of flashing (for example, IR (information retrieval) score value, it is the measuring of the degree of correlation of URL and inquiry, and the position of URL in Search Results) of URL in the query history information; The navigation rate of URL (user selection of URL and submit to such as inquiry before the special time period in a week or month in for the ratio between the user selection of all URL in the Search Results of same queries); And the click data whether selected in all URL by the user of indication URL.Note, the navigation rate of URL is indicated its popularity about other URL between the user who submits same queries to.Alternatively, the additional information identification that is associated with URL comprises the item of information of this URL, such as other webpage, image, video, books etc.In certain embodiments, query note 202 also comprises geography and the demographic information of inquiry, such as the country /region of submit Query and the language of inquiry.For example, for from different countries or the same queries set of words submitted at different time, Search Results may be different.Will explain as following, the information in the inquiry log database can be used to a large amount of URL are generated accurately grouped data.
User ID 204 is the unique identifiers for user's (being client sometimes) of identification submit Query.In many examples, for protection system user's privacy, user ID 204 is identified user or client uniquely, but can not be used to identify user's name or other identifying information.This is applied to the user ID 244 of the following user profile record 242 of discussing about Fig. 2 D equally.In certain embodiments, when the user signs in to information server system for the first time or again sign in to system after session expiration before, between client 104 and information server system 130, set up network communication session.In any situation, all be the unique session id of conversation establishing 204, and it become the part of query note 202.Query terms 206 can be Original submission those words of user or those words that are normalized the form that adopts for server system.
For each inquiry, information server system 130 identifications are corresponding to the last set result of this inquiry.Typically, Search Results comprise URL (or IP address), the text extract of the webpage identified from URL and other auxiliary.The set of Search Results is sorted according to their corresponding degrees of correlation for inquiry, so that relevant result showed before more incoherent result more.For example, if exist every page of demonstration to be no more than 10 results' restriction, then the set of 45 Search Results is divided into 5 results page.The result that first page shows be considered to second page on the result therefore compare and inquire about more relevant and be displayed first.In certain embodiments, shown result of page searching also is known as flashing of Search Results.In a results page or Search Results one flashed, near the position that is in browser window top or the top was reserved for more relevant result, and this is usually to receive more manying concern than other place in the window because of it.
In client 104, client assistant 108 monitors that the user is for the activity of shown Search Results, such as the flashing of user access, user effort time quantum (for example, by the position of track user cursor on Search Results) and the URL link clicked of user on different Search Results.Other data that this customer interaction information and sign Search Results use are sent back to information server system 130 and are stored in (in query history information 208) in the data structure 200 together with corresponding URL ID 210.
Fig. 2 B has described the block diagram according to the example data structure 220 that is used for the storing queries profile of some embodiment.Similar with the data structure of Fig. 2 A, data structure 220 comprises multiple queries profile record 214-1 to 214-P, the inquiry that wherein each is submitted to corresponding to a user.When many users have submitted identical inquiry to, the profile information of single query profile 214 these inquiries of storage.In certain embodiments, each query profiles record 214 comprises inquiry ID 215, the respective queries set of words 216 in the inquiry of identifying ad hoc inquiry and is used for inquiring about the list of categories 217 of classification.Alternatively, query profiles 214 can be assigned with whole inquiry weight 221, it not only reflects the summation of classification weight in the list of categories 217, but also reflection indication query profiles has many reliable or query profiles how strong one or more additive factors related with the profile of Query Result or measures.This discusses in more detail following.
In certain embodiments, list of categories 217 comprises one or more pairings (category IDs 218, weight 219).Category IDs 218 can be corresponding to the information of particular type, such as news, physical culture, travelling, finance etc., and weight 219 is to weigh the numeral of the correlativity between inquiry and the corresponding information type.For example, query terms " golf (golf) " may have for the classification of physical culture and movement value relative high weight, then has low weight for the classification of infotech (IT).In certain embodiments, category IDs 218 is corresponding to " concept cluster ", and it can produce by colonization process, for example, its can or can be not by mark easily with item name.As further describing below with reference to Fig. 3 A, information classification device 136 from inquiry log database 140 historical query information and make up query profiles from the grouped data of information classification seed database 138.
In following more described embodiment, generate, use and then process independent query profiles 214 and storing queries profile in database or other collection property data structure 220 not.
Fig. 2 C is the block diagram according to the example data structure 240 of the grouped data that is used for the storage collection of information items of some embodiment.A grouped data that example can be used to store information classification seed database 138 of data structure 240, and the grouped data that another example of this data structure 240 can be used to store information classification database 134.
Fig. 2 D is the block diagram according to the example data structure 260 of the user profiles that is used for storage user set of some embodiment.Data structure 260 comprises a plurality of user profile record 242-1 to 242-P, wherein each specific user corresponding to information server system 130 (perhaps the user organizes as described above).In certain embodiments, each user profile record 242 comprises user ID 244 and list of categories 248, and described list of categories 248 comprises the pairing of one or more (category IDs 249, the weights 250) of expression user search interest.Alternatively, user profile record 242 comprises one or more customized preferences 246 (for example, the preference ordering of hobby title, Search Results), and it can be specified by hand by the user (for example, using the web list that configures for this).In addition, user profile record 242 can comprise the user profiles of other type of user's search interest being classified from different aspects alternatively.These user profiles can generate to replenish when needed or alternative class tabulation 248 by profile manager 128.
Note, what webpage or inquiry or user's list of categories may be from another is different.For example, a webpage can have Sport Class and corresponding weight, and another webpage may have nothing to do fully with physical culture and therefore may have diverse classification set in each list of categories.In certain embodiments, different web pages, inquiry and user's grouped data is standardized so that the identical category that occurs in the list of categories for different entities, and their weights separately are comparable.Therefore, when the profile of first user had higher weight for respective classes than the second user's profile, this indication first user was higher to the interest level of this respective classes than the second user.
Usually, the item of information such as website or webpage or user may classify by a plurality of profiles (230,252) and/or list of categories (228,248).Different profiles can characterize identical theme from different perspectives with list of categories, and therefore has different purposes.For concise and to the point and explanation, embodiments of the invention hypothesis item of information is corresponding to the webpage by the unique identification of URL.Run through this instructions, be used interchangeably such as the term of " grouped data ", " profile ", " list of categories ", " cluster " etc., wherein each can be expressed as sparse vector mathematics.The classification of webpage means and is that this webpage generates list of categories.But as pointed in the background technology part, many webpages are unfiled or mis-classification.Therefore, one aspect of the present invention is that how will the classify grouped data (for example, be stored in the information classification seed database 138 data) " propagation " of webpage thinks that described non-classified webpage or website generate accurately grouped data on those non-classified webpages or website.Note, the process of this Category of Communication data do not require unfiled webpage content priori and be efficient calculating therefore.
In certain embodiments, the process from the classification webpage to unfiled webpage Category of Communication data relates to two steps: (i) from the classification webpage to the inquiry Category of Communication data relevant with unfiled webpage with classification; (ii) from inquiry to unfiled webpage Category of Communication data.Note, term " propagation " is described this process from grouped data supplier's angle, and described grouped data supplier is the item of information of primary classification.But the angle from the grouped data recipient, namely from the angle of initial non-classified item of information, this process is the aggregation operator of two steps: (i) will gather the inquiry identical with the grouped data of this inquiry from the weighted contributions of the grouped data of different classification webpages; (ii) will gather the unfiled webpage identical with the grouped data of this webpage from the weighted contributions of the grouped data of difference inquiry.Fig. 3 A and 3B are the process flow diagrams that illustrates more in detail two step process.
Particularly, Fig. 3 A is that diagram is according to the process flow diagram of the illustrative methods 300 that is used for structure query profiles database 142 of some embodiment.The method is used from the historical query information of inquiry log database 140 and from the grouped data of seed database 138 query set that a plurality of users submitted within a time period (for example, past six months) is set up profile.Every kind of method as described herein can manage by instruction, and described instruction is stored in the computer-readable recording medium and by one or more processors of one or more servers or client and carries out.In addition, each operation shown in Fig. 3 A-3C can be corresponding to the instruction of storing in computer memory or the computer-readable recording medium.
In certain embodiments, historical query information comprises query terms, corresponding to the mutual information (such as click data) of the Search Results of query terms, the data of flashing of Search Results (for example, score value, position data) and track user and Search Results.The taxonomic species subdata comprises a plurality of sparse vectors, and wherein each provides the cluster information of particular webpage (or website).These sparse vectors are initial estimations of the degree of correlation of webpage and various theme, title or concept cluster.Can use many known methods (for example, the analysis of web page contents, key words and/or link) of this area to generate these sparse vectors.As initial estimation, these sparse vectors can not be entirely accurates or complete.As will be described, two step process of generation grouped data can be iterative process in certain embodiments.It not only can be that non-classified webpage generates grouped data that the iteration of grouped data is propagated, but also can upgrade comprising the grouped data of webpage of previous classification of webpage that its data have been used as those primary classifications of seed data.
Gather the historical query information of the inquiry log database 140 that generates grouped data corresponding to the historical query from the user group from being utilized for URL.Described user group can be all users of the search engine that is associated with inquiry log database 140, perhaps it can be all users' of this search engine subset, such as the user with the language-specific submit Query, user from specific jurisdiction or geographic area, from the user of particular ip address scope submit Query, perhaps any appropriate combination of these standards.
Use from the inquiry log information of inquiry log database 140 retrieval (302) and from the grouped data of seed database 138 retrievals (304) as input, query generation (306) query profiles that information classification device 136 is submitted to for the user.In order to illustrate, this paper describes that grouped data in the seed database 138 wherein is the embodiment for the grouped data of a plurality of URL.Yet in other embodiments, the seed grouped data is not limited to the grouped data for URL.For example, the seed grouped data in the database 138 can comprise the grouped data (compare with other grouped data of URL level, it can be known as other grouped data of website level) for the website.As long as the seed grouped data reasonably accurately and the inquiry log data of sufficient amount are arranged, thereby information classification device 136 just can be accurately and is propagated widely the seed grouped data and be a large amount of URL generation grouped datas of also accurately not setting up profile by classic method.
At first, information classification device 136 is selected (have query terms set) inquiry log record in inquiry log database 140.For respective queries, information classification device identification (308-1) Search Results and corresponding to the URL of Search Results.If identical inquires in the multiple queries log recording of present expression from the different searching request of different user and different time, then between corresponding Search Results, may there are differences.In certain embodiments, by Search Results being grouped into together and corresponding inquiry log being analyzed, the information classification device selects its webpage that is associated to be considered to URL set associated with the query.Note, owing to man-to-man mapping between three terms, term " URL ", " webpage " and " Search Results " often run through instructions to be used interchangeably.
Identifying URL set (308-1) afterwards, classification application (308-2) weighting standard of 136 couples of URL that identify of information classification device for handled inquiry log record.Described weighting table is taken over for use in the degree of correlation of estimating each URL and inquiry.In certain embodiments, described weighting standard comprise URL IR score value, navigation rate, flash, position and click data.These weighting standards are used to determine corresponding to the weight of the degree of correlation of URL and inquiry (or score value).For example, appearing at the Search Results top corresponding with ad hoc inquiry or near the URL the top is considered to compare more relevant with described inquiry with other Search Results that appears at the Search Results lower position.Similarly, URL with high navigation rate, namely in history with the URL of the user selection of the submitted same queries of height ratio, when considering it with the degree of correlation of inquiry, be given and have the URL that hangs down the navigation rate with (in the similar position of Search Results) and compare larger weight.Therefore therefore, the seed grouped data of URL is considered to and inquires about height correlation and be given larger weight when the generated query profile.In certain embodiments, the URL that minority is correlated with the most (for example, first page the first two of Search Results, three or four URL) be given complete weight 1, the weight of those more incoherent URL is then as its corresponding search result location, IR score value, navigation rate, click data and also have potential other specific to the function of the parameter of URL and reduce gradually.
As the above mentioned, can revise the weight of distributing to URL based on search result location with click data.For example, the Search Results of having been watched by user selection can be assigned with the highest possible weight (for example, the weight identical with the Search Results of the highest rank).The weight of the Search Results of having been watched by user selection alternatively, can be given predetermined lifting (for example, increasing or number percent increases as fixing); Alternatively, can use the upper limit and limit the weight that produces so that it is no more than predefined weight limit.
Next, the information classification device is assembled (308-3) for inquiring about the grouped data of oneself with the weighting grouped data of URL, i.e. the profile of inquiry.Because previous weighting step, the profile of inquiry should be similar with the grouped data of those URL with higher weight.Note, (in the Search Results) do not exist the URL of its seed grouped data for the not impact of profile of inquiry.Although this process that grouped data is propagated into inquiry from URL may not take explicitly into account the degree of correlation of the content of the webpage that URL identifies and it and inquiry, but should be noted that, comprised the impact of web page contents such as the historical query information of the data of flashing (for example, IR score value, position data) of Search Results and click data.
As discussed above, when the generated query profile, aggregation operator 308-3 has only used the classification from the URL that has been classified, and therefore has grouped data in seed database 138.Yet in certain embodiments, in the successive iterations of query profiles assorting process 300, " seed data " of inquiry assorting process can be the grouped data (in following description) of the URL that classifies during the early iteration of URL assorting process 320.In other words, during the successive iterations of inquiry assorting process 300, seed database 138 can be substituted by the information classification database 134 (the perhaps subset of this database) that is generated during the early iteration of URL assorting process 320.
At last, in certain embodiments, the information classification device is stored (310) in query profiles database 142 with the query profiles that generates.In these embodiments, as above described in conjunction with Fig. 3 A, communication process is at first from the grouped data generated query profile of classification URL, and then generates the grouped data of unfiled URL from described query profiles, as described below in conjunction with Fig. 3 B.
In other embodiments, after generating each query profiles, the weighting copy of this query profiles (for example, corresponding to the weighting copy of each listed in the inquiry log of described query profiles record Search Results) be written into the intermediate result table (720, the clauses and subclauses in Fig. 7).Alternatively, when no longer needing to diffuse information to the URL that is associated with the respective queries log recording, query profiles is not stored in the query profiles database.In these embodiments, after all inquiry log record was all processed, the clauses and subclauses of each URL were assembled to produce the respective profiles that its sufficient classified information is write each URL of described intermediate result table in the described intermediate result table.The control flow of these embodiment is illustrated in the table 1 and provides.Particularly, in the phase one, query profiles processed to produce in each inquiry log record, and then by to each listed in inquiry log record URL (perhaps alternatively, the institute of listed URL identify each URL in the theme in the inquiry log record) next " propagation " described query profiles of generation clauses and subclauses in the intermediate result table.(being used for processed inquiry log record) at the specific URL of each clauses and subclauses that the intermediate result table is stored listed Search Results in corresponding to query note, and comprises the weighted version of described query profiles.Such as above more detailed explanation, in the clauses and subclauses corresponding to specific URL and ad hoc inquiry, the weight that gives described query profiles is based on the degree of correlation of URL and inquiry.In subordinate phase, after the intermediate result table had been filled clauses and subclauses from the inquiry log recording processing, the clauses and subclauses of each URL were assembled to produce the grouped data of this URL, and the grouped data that each URL is produced is stored in the taxonomy database.Such as in addition more detailed explanations, if for the number of the clauses and subclauses of URL less than threshold value, perhaps other quality standard is not met, then the grouped data for URL is not generated or is not stored in taxonomy database.

For each inquiry log record
Assemble to generate query profiles (seeing the description of Fig. 3 A) by the seed grouped data to the URL that lists in the inquiry log record;
Alternatively, query profiles is not stored in the query profiles database;
For each URL that lists in the inquiry log record (alternatively: each URL that concentrates for the recognin of the URL that lists in the inquiry log record)
Generate clauses and subclauses (take URL as key) in the intermediate result table, it is for the weighted version of the query profiles of inquiry log record (seeing the description of operation 328-5, Fig. 3 B);

// subordinate phase //
For each the different URL{ in the intermediate result table
Assemble the grouped data (seeing the description of operation 328-6, Fig. 3 B) that is used for URL for the weighting query profiles of this URL with generation;
To be stored in for the grouped data of URL information classification database (seeing the description of operation 330, Fig. 3 B)
}
In any these embodiment, the process that generates grouped data for URL can be carried out all URL that list in the inquiry log record, comprise classification and non-classified URL, perhaps alternatively, this process can only generate grouped data (under these circumstances, the seed grouped data for classification URL still is the grouped data of those URL) to unfiled URL.Alternatively, can generate grouped data to other subset of the URL that lists in the inquiry log record based on various choice criteria.
Referring now to Fig. 3 B,, at least part of based on from the inquiry log information of inquiry log database 140 retrieval (322) and from the query profiles of query profiles database 142 retrievals (324), information classification device 136 generates/upgrades the grouped data of the page of (326) identifying by the URL that finds in the Search Results.At first, information classification device 136 is from inquiry log database 140 identification (328-1) query sets and corresponding query history.Note, this query set can be the 136 previous same queries set of identifying of information classification device, and each inquiry has the query profiles that is associated in query profiles database 142.Each inquiry is associated with a plurality of Search Results, and some of them are classified (for example, having grouped data in seed database 138), and some then do not have.
Reciprocally, the grouped data of URL can be at least in part draws as the profile of the inquiry of Search Results from wherein listing URL.In certain embodiments, these query profiles depend on search result location data and the indicated URL of click data and the degree of correlation of each inquiry such as inquiry for the contribution of the grouped data of URL.For example, suppose that URL appears in the Search Results corresponding to two different inquiry A and B.For inquiry A, URL appears at the top of Search Results and by user selection; For inquiry B, identical URL is positioned at the 5th page of Search Results and never by user selection with watch.Such weighted information is identified (328-3) or is drawn from corresponding inquiry log information.When determining two query profiles for the contribution of the grouped data of URL, suppose that any other weighted factor that is associated with two inquiries is basic identical, then information classification device 136 is used (328-4) weighting standard to them so that the profile of inquiry A is given the weight that is higher than the profile of inquiring about B.
In certain embodiments, information classification device 136 is stored (328-5) in the intermediate result table with the query profiles of weighting.For given URL, each clauses and subclauses in the intermediate result table represent that the query profiles of a weighting is for the contribution of the grouped data of this URL.There is the mapping of multi-to-multi between inquiry ID in this table and the URL ID.For given inquiry ID, can in table, find one group of URL ID, each URL ID is corresponding to the weighted version of query profiles.For given URLID, can in table, find one group of clauses and subclauses, each inquiry that URL ID appears in its Search Results has clauses and subclauses.In another way, operation 328-5 is by with executions of getting off: inquire about in the daily record each, the clauses and subclauses of each URL in the Search Results are stored in the intermediate result table; Described clauses and subclauses comprise the weighted version of the list of categories in the query profiles of described inquiry.Repeat this operation for each inquiry in the inquiry log, in the intermediate result table, generate thus very a large amount of clauses and subclauses.Then, by following execution aggregation operator 328-6: for each the different URL in the intermediate result table, assemble all clauses and subclauses in the intermediate result table.
In certain embodiments, the gathering grouped data of URL is standardized, so that 1) identical category that occurs in the list of categories for different URL, their weights separately are comparable; And 2) URL appears at the very little or not impact for the intensity effect of the classification weight in the grouped data (list of categories) of this URL of the sum of the inquiry in the Search Results.For example, as normalized result, the classification weight summation that appears at the URL among the result of 100 inquiries in the inquiry log is not less than the classification weight summation of the URL among the result who appears at 500 inquiries in the inquiry log.In certain embodiments, be lower than predetermined threshold if the sum of the inquiry of URL wherein occurs, then do not produce the profile of this URL owing to there not being enough data to produce fully reliable URL.Note, inquiry weight or weighted factor are associated with each clauses and subclauses in the intermediate result table, and it is based on the URL of total weight of query profiles and clauses and subclauses with the link strength between inquiring about.When the grouped data to corresponding URL is assembled (328-6), during the final weight 229 (Fig. 2 C) of the classification in determining URL profile 222, corresponding to the inquiry weight summation of the table clause of the URL factor (for example, as divisor) that is used as standardizing.
In addition, in certain embodiments, when the tabulation of the classification 228 (Fig. 2 C) of the corresponding URL that produces by aggregation operator 328-6 comprises more than predetermined quantity different classes of, thereby this tabulation is kept the category IDs of highest weighting of at least predetermined percentage (for example, 90%) of the total weight with the classification in the list of categories of not filtering when excluding the category IDs of lowest weightings by brachymemma or filtration.
When aggregation operator 328-6 finished, the grouped data that is used for each URL was stored (330) at information classification database 134.
As explained above (see Table 1 and table 1 shown in the description of control flow), in certain embodiments, carry out above mentioned grouped data to be propagated into the process of unfiled URL from classification URL take query note one by one as the basis, and do not produce the query profiles database.
In the Search Results that also be included into the number of the query terms that is associated with query note in certain embodiments, weighting and grouped data record from the query profiles to the respective queries among the factor of the propagation of listed URL.Usually, the word that inquiry has is more, and inquiry is just more specific, and Search Results is about thematic just more concentrated.On the contrary, the word that inquiry has is fewer, and this inquiry just fuzzyyer and Search Results just may comprise the result about different themes more.For example, Search Results corresponding to the inquiry of the single word of " jaguar (jaguar) " comprises http://www.jaguar.com/global/default.htm, this is the official website of the luxury car of Jaguar brand, and comprise http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar, this is the wikipedia webpage relevant with the big cat that is known as jaguar.By comparison, the official website that still comprises Jaguar brand luxury car corresponding to the Search Results of the inquiry " jaguar car " of two words.But these Search Results will not comprise the webpage relevant with the big cat that is known as jaguar, but can comprise on the contrary other Search Results relevant with the Jaguar brand of automobile, such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Cars, this is the history-sensitive wikipedia webpage with the Jaguar automobile brand.
In certain embodiments, the contribution of the grouped data of listed URL is carried out weight according to the number of the query terms in this inquiry in the Search Results of the grouped data of inquiry (also being known as query profiles) for inquiry.For example, the interim grouped data of the inquiry of a word character of some Asian languages (perhaps with) is given lowest weightings.Word or character that inquiry has are more, and the weight that its grouped data is distributed is just higher.Therefore, about ad hoc inquiry, when this inquiry comprises a plurality of word, the clauses and subclauses that are used for specific URL in the intermediate result table will have the copy of higher weights of the grouped data of this inquiry, and the copy that hangs down weight that will have the grouped data of this inquiry when this inquiry only comprises single word.According to language-specific, query length is becoming more inessential to the role in the grouped data weighting when it reaches minimum threshold (for example, two or three words in English and some other language).
Other of the ambiguity of inquiry or specificity measured the distribution that comprises corresponding grouped data.For for example ad hoc inquiry of " jaguar car ", the major part of Search Results (if not all) should be restricted to a theme, i.e. luxury car brand.As a result, the interim grouped data from this drawn inquiry of the grouped data of corresponding Search Results will concentrate on identical theme.By comparison, should see that such as more specifically not inquiring about of " jaguar " grouped data is distributed on two themes at least, i.e. luxury car brand and big cat.The ambiguity of another kind of tolerance inquiry or the mode of specificity are the associations that checks the grouped data of the URL in the Search Results, for example are averaging by the paired cosine similarity to URL.In another way, the mean cosine similarity of Search Results is corresponding to the specificity level (perhaps measuring as it) of search inquiry.For example, the mean cosine similarity of Search Results (for example, most of results relate to single primary and want theme) when Search Results is closely similar each other is height, and this indication search inquiry has the specificity of height.Search Results is more diversified, and the mean cosine similarity is just less, and this indication search inquiry has low specificity.
Similar user's browsing histories, user's search history (inquiry of submitting to such as the user and user-selected Search Results) also is the good source of user's search interest being set up profile.Fig. 3 C is diagram makes up the example process 340 of user profiles based on the grouped data of user-selected Search Results URL process flow diagram.
At least part of based on retrieving the inquiry log information of (342) and the grouped data of retrieving (344) from information classification database 134 from inquiry log database 140, query set and corresponding query history that information classification device 136 is submitted to from inquiry log database 140 identification (348-1) relative users.From described query history, the Search Results that 136 identifications (348-2) of information classification device are user-selected and corresponding URL.For each URL, the information classification device is from database 134 identification (348-4) its grouped datas.
In certain embodiments, information classification device 136 is assembled (348-5) in user profiles with the user-selected grouped data of searching plain as a result URL.Note, when the grouped data of URL is assembled, can use different weightings or filter criteria.For example, in certain embodiments, URL is included into the factor of weight of the grouped data of URL by the frequency of user selection.In certain embodiments, when two URL have similar user's clicks, the user (has for example confirmed lasting interest to it, approximately on average having propagated N user in one month clicks) the grouped data of URL when determining user profiles, be given the larger weight of URL that concentrates on (for example, one or two hour) in the short time period than similar user's clicks.In certain embodiments, also consider the new recency of time (recency) of inquiry, so that the grouped data of the URL that is associated with comparatively recently inquiry is given the weight higher than the grouped data of the URL that is associated with inquiry more remote.In certain embodiments, when being set up profile, the user also considers the importance of specified cluster or classification.For example, comprise that user's the common cluster of group of individuals or classification are less and should be given than more different clusters or the lower weight of classification for the help of determining user interest.
The user profiles that produces then is used for providing personalized service for the user by information server system 130.For example, in response to the inquiry from the user, search engine 126 identification search result set and described Search Results sort by its degree of correlation with inquiry at first.Before returning Search Results to the user who asks, query processor 124 can be resequenced to Search Results by the grouped data of each Search Results is compared with user profiles.If all be expressed as sparse vector, then can determine described comparison by the cosine or the dot product that calculate two vectors.Search Results is followed at least part of dot product based on them and is reordered, and then is sent to request user's client device 104, in order to show to the request user at client device 104.
In certain embodiments, information classification device 136 is also identified the query profiles of the inquiry that (348-3) user submits to, and the grouped data of query profiles and user-selected URL assembled (348-5) in user profiles and with the user profiles storage (350) that produces in database 132.
Note, above with reference in figure 3A, 3B and the described three kinds of methods of 3C any can be iterative process.The information classification device with the grouped data of a limited number of URL in the seed database 138 as beginning and described grouped data is propagated in the grouped data and user profiles set of query profiles set, those unfiled URL.Shown in Fig. 3 A-3C, historical query information is played an important role when inquiry, URL or user are set up profile.The process of Category of Communication data is ongoing processes, repeats in time or renewal, and reason is that the inquiry log database continues the new inquiry log information of accumulation.New query history not only provides the more data point grouped data of URL of refining, and has kept the tracking to the dynamic aspect of many users' search interest.
In certain embodiments, information classification device 136 repeats process described above to upgrade one or more in query profiles database 142, information classification database 134 and the user profiles database 132.In certain embodiments, select the subset of information classification database 134 to come the Category of Communication data as new seed database 138.In certain embodiments, information classification seed database 138 is generated by another kind of cluster method.
In certain embodiments, before beginning to propagate the grouped data of a new round, information classification device 136 can refresh query profiles database 142, information classification database 134 or user profiles database 142, so that do not preserve the grouped data of leaving over.In some other embodiment, still reliable and useful if these data recording are regarded as, then information classification device 136 can keep at least subset of the data recording in query profiles database 142, information classification database 134 or the user profiles database 132.
In certain embodiments, if the grouped data of at least subset of the webpage that is associated with the website is known, then above mentioned method can be used to profile is set up in the website.This can be by different web pages the direct gathering of grouped data realize.Alternatively or in addition, the grouped data of different web pages is carried out weight according to their relevant position and corresponding web page popularity or user's usage datas during special time period in the level of website.In another way, when the Web page classifying data are assembled to produce the profile of website, can give weight according to following classification to the webpage in the website: 1) the user's clicks on the webpage of website, perhaps 2) number of indicator (director) level between webpage and the site home page, perhaps its two.
In certain embodiments, be given than the cluster that is associated with the fraction webpage of website or the relative higher weight of classification with cluster or the classification that most of webpage of website is associated.In some other embodiment, the website (for example, lacks at least one common cluster between the webpage of minimum number in en.wikipedia.com) or classification can prevent that this website is classified at least.
The block diagram of Fig. 3 D example that to be diagram classify to item of information according to the grouped data of the use out of Memory item of some embodiment.
For purposes of illustration, historical query information 350 comprises inquiry Q1 and the Q2 that two users submit to.But in reality, a large amount of inquiry log clauses and subclauses are stored in the inquiry log database 140 inquiry that each inquiry log clauses and subclauses is submitted to during special session corresponding to the user.The inquiry that comprises one or more query terms has corresponding Query Result set and user's usage data.
For briefly, each among two inquiry Q1 and the Q2 are associated with three webpage A, B and C, and each webpage has the weight factor W of the degree of correlation of indicating this webpage and respective queries.As explained above, described weight factor can be subject to corresponding web page content, its on the internet popularity and such as flash, the associated user usage data impact advancing of position and point.In this example, suppose two A in described three webpages and B has been classified and its corresponding grouped data can find in seed grouped data 360.Although as the part of Search Results, the grouped data that webpage C is not associated in seed grouped data 360.But webpage C appears at the grouped data that the fact in the Search Results with Q1 and Q2 has advised predicting based on the seed grouped data of webpage A and B at least webpage C with webpage A and B.
In certain embodiments, the first step of this prediction is to be Q1 and Q2 structure grouped data or profile, and it is known as the propagation of seed grouped data sometimes at this.Shown in Fig. 3 D, two query profiles 370 QP_1 and QP_2 are defined as the function of the classification that described two webpages adjust through the respective weights factor.The second step of this prediction is by making up grouped data for non-classified webpage C in the territory of the grouped data that two query profiles is projected to webpage C.Because two weighting factor W1 (C) and W2 (C) indicate the degree of correlation of webpage C and described two inquiries at least in some respects, so these weight factors are used to determine that the respective queries profile is for the contribution of the grouped data of webpage C.The mathematic(al) representation that should be noted in the discussion above that among the figure and run through any place of instructions only is for illustrative purposes.As above described in conjunction with Fig. 3 A, also exist alternate manner that the grouped data of webpage A and B is assembled and weighting the contribution aspect the formation of query profiles separately at it, and the mode that also also has other is assembled and weighting separately aspect the contribution of the grouped data of webpage C at it to the grouped data of query profiles QP_1 and QP_2.
The Search Results that should be noted in the discussion above that typical query corresponding to hundreds of or even thousands of webpage, and submitted to by different user or even by same subscriber when different time is submitted to, identical inquiry can have slightly different search result set.By identical sign, identical webpage can appear in the different search result set of the inquiry of submitting to corresponding to different user and can obtain different user's responses.Example shown in Fig. 3 D, namely each in two query profiles generates and the grouped data of webpage C generates from two query profiles from grouped datas of two webpages, only is for explanation.
In certain embodiments, the attribute of many-to-many relationship between given inquiry and the webpage, information classification device only make up query profiles or next so that a subset has precedence over another subset with weighting factor with the grouped data of webpage subset.For example, if webpage is lower than preset limit for the number that it appears at the inquiry in the corresponding Search Results, then this webpage can be skipped when the Category of Communication data.Similarly, the information classification device can only consider that the profile of subset of queries estimates the grouped data of unfiled webpage, perhaps can be according to predetermined heuritic approach so that the weight of a subset is higher than another subset.For example, the propagation of grouped data from the classification webpage to unfiled webpage can be restricted to ad hoc inquiry.In some other embodiment, the scope of propagation can be expanded to cover the difference inquiry in the same session for example, the perhaps same subscriber different sessions of carrying out, the perhaps difference inquiry carried out of same subscriber group.
What Fig. 4 was diagram according to some embodiment is used for that user's profile and grouped data are processed inquiry and the block diagram of example process 400 that the respective queries result is sorted.Web portal server 402 receives inquiry by inquiry ingress interface or process 404, and sends object information (it for example can be formatted as webpage by results page anabolic process or module 406) in order to show in client 104 to the client 104 of asking.The request that receives is processed to produce and is inquired about 420 and be complementary or otherwise satisfy the set 422 of the Search Results of inquiry 420 by search engine 405.Search engine 405 can comprise one or more query processing module or process 408, its control or supervision to the Set-search document of search index subregion 412 or with inquiry 420 other Search Results that are complementary.The searched engine of the tabulation of Search Results returns 422, and the Search Results in this tabulation then sorts 410 according to the user's who asks relative users profile (from user profiles database 132) and the grouped data (from information classification database 134) of Search Results.The object information that comprises the Search Results that sorts is forwarded to results page composite module 406 in order to be converted to the form (for example, webpage or XML document) that is suitable for sending to the client of asking.In certain embodiments, search engine 405 comprises all system components for implementation 400.
Fig. 5 A is diagram being used for the generation grouped data and using described grouped data that the process flow diagram of the example process 500 of customize services is provided according to some embodiment.With regard to certain degree, this process 500 be above in conjunction with Fig. 3 A-3C the summary of three processes describing separately.
At the server system place, process is accessed the historical query information of (502) inquiry and the Search Results that they are associated.For example, described historical query information can be corresponding to the query history of storing in the inquiry log database.Some Search Results corresponding to the item of information that is classified at first other corresponding to initial non-classified item of information.For the sake of simplicity, the item of information that is classified at first is known as " first information item ", and initial non-classified item of information is known as " the second item of information ".From the information classification seed database, the grouped data of this process access first information item.Use described historical query information and seed grouped data, this process generate the grouped data of (504) second items of information and with the grouped data storage (506) that generates in the server system such as the information classification database 134 of Fig. 1.
In certain embodiments, for initial non-classified item of information is generated grouped data, this process generates the query set in identification (504-1) historical query information.At least each has the Search Results that is associated corresponding to initial non-classified item of information the subset of inquiry.This process is each query generation (504-2) grouped data or query profiles based on the grouped data of first information item and the historical query information of query set then.
In certain embodiments, for each inquiry, the identification of described process is corresponding to the search result set of inquiry and corresponding to the set (for example, the 308-1 of Fig. 3 A) of the first information item of search result set.Next, this process is according to such as their corresponding predefine information retrieval score, their corresponding Search Results position and the mutual information of expression user and corresponding Search Results in search result set the grouped data of the first information item identified being weighted (for example, the 308-2 of Fig. 3 A).At last, this process is assembled grouped data with generated query to the weighting grouped data of the first information item identified, also is known as its query profiles (for example, the 308-3 of Fig. 3 A).
Use the query profiles of the inquiry of identifying and the historical query information of inquiry, this process generates (504-3) grouped data to initial non-classified item of information.In certain embodiments, this comprises identification query set (for example, the 328-1 of Fig. 3 B) and from the corresponding query profiles of query profiles database retrieval (for example, the 328-2 of Fig. 3 B).For each inquiry, this process identification is corresponding to the search result set (for example, the 328-3 of Fig. 3 B) of inquiry.Described search result set comprises the Search Results that at least one is corresponding with initial non-classified item of information.Next, this process is according to the information retrieval score such as (being generated when processing inquiry with the generation Search Results such as search engine 126) initial unfiled item of information, the information of mutual (if any) of the search result location that it is corresponding in search result set and user and corresponding Search Results and so on is weighted (for example, the 328-4 of Fig. 3 B) to grouped data or the query profiles of inquiry.At last, this process assembles that to the weighting grouped data of inquiry initial non-classified (second) item of information is generated grouped data (sometimes being called the URL profile) (for example, the 328-6 of Fig. 3 B).Can also carry out identical process and come to be the new classified information of at first classified (first) item of information generation.
Be after the first and second items of information make up grouped data, the customize services that this process can use the corresponding grouped data of storing in the server system to provide (508) to be associated with the first and/or second item of information to a plurality of client devices.
In certain embodiments, this process uses the grouped data of the first and second items of information to generate (508-1) user profiles.In response to from the user of the client device request for service, the service that this process user's profile and corresponding grouped data customization (508-2) are asked.For generating user profile, this process query set (for example, the 348-1 of Fig. 3 C, 348-2) that at first the identification user submits in historical query information and corresponding Search Results.One or more corresponding in the first and second items of information of described Search Results.This process is then identified the grouped data of user-selected item of information and the grouped data of user-selected item of information is assembled (for example, the 348-4 of Fig. 3 C, 348-5).
In certain embodiments, this process is carried out the service that is independent of the user in response to services request.This service creation that is independent of the user comprises the one or more initial results in the first and second items of information.For each item of information in this initial results, this process is by comparing to determine score value with the grouped data of item of information with user profiles, and then according to their score values separately the item of information in the initial results being resequenced, thereby generating custom result.Customizable exemplary services comprises personalized search, the individuality coupling in the advertisement of orientation or activity and the online social networks etc., but is not limited to this.
Fig. 5 B is diagram provides the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure of personalized search results according to the user profiles that is used for the user of some embodiment and grouped data for (with the information server system long range positioning) user of remote client devices.After the user from relative client equipment receives inquiry (532), this process is at first identified the search result set (534) corresponding to described inquiry.One at least one Search Results and the second item of information is associated.This process visit information taxonomy database is to obtain to be used for the grouped data (536) of Search Results.The grouped data identification one or more classifications (536-1) relevant with corresponding Search Results that are used for corresponding Search Results.Next, this process determine the score value (538-1) of Search Results by its grouped data is compared with user profiles and according to determined score value with described Search Results about other Search Results sort (538).At last, this process shows (540) to client device transmission expression through the information of at least subset of rank search result so that at client device.
