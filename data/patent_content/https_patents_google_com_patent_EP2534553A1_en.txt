Definitions
- This document generally describes techniques, methods, systems, and mechanisms for posting real-time messages about a venue or user location.
- a mobile device user may find restaurants in the user's current immediate area that serve a certain type of food, and may also review comments posted by other users about the various restaurants.
- Mobile computing devices such as cell phones, can use location- identification systems (e.g., global positioning system, GPS) to determine an estimated geographic location of such devices.
- location- identification systems e.g., global positioning system, GPS
- a system may be able to identify venues (e.g., commercial businesses) that are located near the estimated geographic location of the device.
- This document describes techniques, methods, systems, and mechanisms for managing comments that are submitted to a subscription-based messaging service (e.g., Twitter, Inc. of San Francisco, California) that are layered on a map based on a location or venue to which each comment is tied (e.g., a GPS location of the phone or a user-selected business).
- the user can view comments related to multiple locations on the map.
- the map can be two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D) (e.g., augmented reality). Selection of a business, company, or a venue/location can enable a user to view comments that are specific to the business, for example.
- a user of an application telephone may use a micro- blogging application to submit short textual posts to a micro-blogging service.
- the posts may be transmitted from the mobile computing device to a central server where the posts are disseminated to computing devices of other people, including other people who have previously indicated an interest in "following" the posting user, and who thus receive notices of new posts, such as in a stream presented to them on their computing devices.
- These other people may view the posts by using the same micro-blogging application or logging into a website that displays a stream of posts by other people that use the micro-blogging service.
- some people may "follow" or subscribe to the user, so that these other people receive the user's posts.
- Some aspects of this disclosure feature a computer-implemented method for real-time messages associated with a user location.
- the method involves determining, by a mobile computing device, an estimated geographic location of the mobile computing device, and receiving, at the mobile computing device, one or more messages associated with an area around the estimated geographic location.
- the one or more messages involve messages posted by users of a system that associates messages that those users posted about the area around the estimated geographic location.
- the method also includes providing, on a display of the mobile computing device, one or more posted message icons that are presented together in a layer over a map, where the one or more posted message icons represent the one or more posted messages.
- the area can include a venue, a business, a street, or an address, among others.
- the computer-implemented method can involve receiving a user input of a selection of one of the posted message icons to present information associated with the posted message associated with the posted message icon, and obtaining information about the posted message from a server system.
- the computer-implemented method can involve, in response to receiving the user input of the selection of the posted message icon, presenting information for the posted message.
- the information for the posted message can include a user text message, a user identification (ID), and at least one of a time of the posting of the message or a day of the posting of the message.
- ID user identification
- the information for the posted message can include a picture corresponding to the user identification (ID).
- the information for the posted message can include a user-provided picture.
- the one or more posted message icons that are presented in the layer over the map can be one or more posted messages that were posted within a predetermined time period of their respective postings. The predetermined time period can be 24 hours, and the one or more posted message icons can be removed from the layer over the map after the
- the computer-implemented method can include presenting a selectable icon that, when selected, presents a selectable list of the one or more posted messages.
- the computer-implemented method may involve receiving a user input, at the mobile computing device, for composing a message to post to at least one other user, as well as receiving, at the mobile computing device, the composed message to post, and posting, from the mobile computing device, the composed message to a server system.
- a computer-implemented method for managing real-time messages associated with a user location involves receiving, at a mobile computing device, one or more messages associated with an area within a geographic location, where the one or more messages involve messages posted by users of a system that associates messages that those users posted about an area within a geographic location.
- the method involves providing, on a display of the mobile computing device, one or more posted message icons that are presented in a layer over another layer in the display, where the one or more posted message icons represent the one or more posted messages.
- the method also involves receiving, at the mobile computing device, a user input of a selection of one of the posted message icons to present information associated with the posted message associated with the posted message icon, and presenting, on the mobile computing device, the information associated with the posted message on the display of the mobile computing device.
- the other layer can include a venue layer, a satellite layer, a map, a two-dimensional rendering of the area, a three- dimensional rendering of the area, a street view layer, or an augmented reality layer.
- At least one of the other layers can be configured to be overlaid on top of at least one of the other layers, and one or more of the other layers can be configured to be toggled on or off by a user selection on the mobile computing device.
- the computer-implemented method can also involve receiving user input on the mobile computing device to subscribe to compose a message for posting.
- the computer-implemented method can involve receiving user input on the mobile computing device to present a list of venues; and based upon the receiving user input for the list of venues, presenting a list of venues on the mobile computing device.
- the computer-implemented method may also involve receiving user input on the mobile computing device to present information associated with one or more posted messages of a selected venue in the list of venues, and based upon receiving the user input for the venue selection, presenting the information associated with the one or more posted messages of the selected venue.
- the information associated with the posted message on the display of the mobile computing device can include venue information.
- the method can include receiving a user input, at the mobile computing device, regarding the venue information, and presenting the venue information in an interface on the mobile computing device.
- the presented venue information can include a list of posted messages associated with the venue.
- One or more of the posted messages in the list of posted messages can be deleted from the list if the posted message has been listed over a predetermined amount of time.
- a new posted message can appear in the list of posted messages when a subscriber of the system posts the new posted message.
- the system includes a mobile computing device configured to receive one or more messages associated with an area within an estimated geographic location, where the one or more messages include messages posted by users of the system to associate messages that those users posted about the area within the estimated geographic location.
- the mobile computing device is also configured to provide one or more posted message icons that are presented in a layer over a map, where the one or more posted message icons represent the one or more posted messages.
- the system includes a location-identification unit to determine the estimated geographic location of the mobile computing device, and a server to receive the estimated geographic location and forward the one or more posted messages associated with the area to the mobile computing device.

- FIG. 1 A is a diagram of a system 10 for presenting layered communication information on a mobile computing device.
- the figure shows an example display 12 of a mobile computing device that shows a map of an area around a user of the device, or an area to which the user intends to travel.
- the map is overlaid with different information that may be provided in discrete information layers, and a user can select certain icons on one of those layers to see information about geo-located posts that other users have made to the system 10.
- the display 12 shows an icon of a building 16 on the map, where the building is a restaurant that I registered with he system, so that it has its own profile page 22 that the system 10 can display to the public.
- the restaurant is displayed, along with icons for two other restaurants, because the user of the device has turned on a restaurants layer on their device, e.g., using control 26.
- the display 12 also shows a number of round dot icons, such as icon 18. These icons each represent a geo-located post that has been made by another user of the system. Both of the types of icons are relatively small and do not convey much information, so as to minimize the amount of clutter on the display 12, since a large number of such icons may need to be displayed.
- the figure further shows mechanisms by which users can obtain more information about the restaurant 16 or posts associated with the restaurant.
- Such posts may have been initially associated directly with the restaurant by the system using location information generated by the posting devices (e.g., GPS data) and then asking the users of such devices to conform the venues from which they were posting.
- location information generated by the posting devices (e.g., GPS data) and then asking the users of such devices to conform the venues from which they were posting.
- a user make click on the restaurant 16 to raise a pop-up bubble 20 that shows general information about the restaurant, such as its name and telephone number. If the user is interested (e.g., the name looks good to the user), the user may select one of the elements in the buddle 20 to be presented with the profile page 22 for the restaurant.
- the profile page may include general information about the restaurant, such as photos of the interior of the restaurant and its dishes, the telephone number, address, and directions to the restaurant, and reviews of the restaurant. Also, the profile page 22 may present various posts (and related streams) that have been associated with the restaurant, such as by users identifying the restaurant as their current venue when they post messages to a service.
- the restaurants profile page may also be reached in this example by an alternative route.
- a user can select icon 18 to raise a pop-up bubble 14 that display some or all of the text of a posting that was made from a user who identified their venue as being the restaurant.
- Other similar pop-up bubbles may be raised by dragging a pointer over other similar icons on the display 12.
- Selection of certain items in the pop-up bubble may in turn raise a page (which may be overlaid on the map) that shows the entire stream corresponding to the initial post.
- a page which may be overlaid on the map
- two friends of the original posting user have commented on the post.
- Further selections by a user may then lead to the restaurant's profile page 22.
- a name of the restaurant may be displayed on the intermediate page (not shown), and the name may be a hyperlink that leads to the profile page 22.
- the information that is presented on the map may be affected in ways in addition to user activation of various layers.
- the posts that are displayed may also be filtered by a user in various manners.
- a user may wish to see only posts from other users that the first user has affirmatively elected to "follow.”
- the user may also see time-filtered posts, such as by selecting a graphical slider that can be displayed on their device, so that they see only posts in the last x hours or y days.
- the user can also choose to see icons only for posts that have been ranked higher than a desired level by other users (e.g., 3 stars or above on a scale of 5).
- a user of a computing device may be presented with geo-coded messages posted by other users (e.g. to whom the first user has subscribed), in an overlay layer on a geographic map.
- the user of the computing device may also conveniently access the text of the messages, and may then obtain even more additional information about the subjects of the messages (such as venues).
- FIG. 1 B is a schematic diagram of a system 100 within which the various features described in this document may be implemented.
- the system 100 permits various users to post, review, and comment on various activity streams of information, within a social networking framework. For example, a user may make a micro-blogging post about a recent happening in the user's life or about a news article the user recently read. That post may be forwarded to other users who have chosen to follow or are otherwise linked to the first user (who may be an individual or an organization). Those other users may see the post using a stream reader, or the post may be displayed in their email applications (e.g. either in line with their regular email messages or under a separate tab).
- Those users may choose to comment on the post, and other users may also comment on the post or comment on the comments of other users. Such comments may be included and shown in the various user email applications even if they were made after the post was originally connected to the email application. Thus, the various types of feedback may be made available to each user conveniently in one place. Users may also see posts related to other users by visiting profile pages for those other users, and may also go to their own profile pages or to their stream pages to see all of the posts and comments for posts to which they are subscribed. In some embodiments, users do not need or require a subscription but can access the posts of various users for areas where those users have made a post.
- the activity streams are characterized by activities, which are the subjects of posts (e.g., micro-blog posts) that users submit to the system 100, and various comments directed toward those activities.
- activities are the subjects of posts (e.g., micro-blog posts) that users submit to the system 100, and various comments directed toward those activities.
- a user may post an activity regarding a web page they are currently viewing by pasting a URL of the page into a posting page.
- Such action may cause the system 100 to gather important information from the URL, including images displayed on the page, headings, labels for images, or topical terms that describe a topic of the page (e.g., as previously determined by analysis of the words on the page, such as using ADSENSE analysis of the page).
- the system 100 may also obtain location information, such as the current location of the user, and/or a venue with which the user is most currently associated (e.g., that the user checked into recently or identified as a venue in which the user is located).
- the activity streams back end 102 also implements logic for determining what users are to receive posts, comments on posts, and other portions of streams in the system 100.
- users who have subscribed to receive posts from other users may be provided with posts when they log into the system 100, users may nominate other users to receive copies of streams when those other users would not ordinarily be included in the streams (e.g., by typing in identifiers for those other users when reviewing a post), and users may send streams directly to each other, among other things.
- the feed reader back end 104 manages storage of posts and related data for the system 100.
- the feed reader back end 104 may rely on various levels of activity storage 146 to store posts, comments on posts, and other information needed to construct streams for users when they request information from system 100.
- the feed reader back end 104 though shown as a single block, can be implemented using a number of different servers or server sub-systems.
- the activity storage 146 can be implemented across a number of databases and database types and across a variety of servers and server subsystems.
- the update pump 108 is responsible for providing notices about newly-posted information to various services that may need such information. It can act, in effect, as a router and distributor of information relating to the system 100.
- a mail server 114 may include functionality for integrating the display of streams, and may thus need to know about new posts so that users of a mail client can be shown immediately when new information is posted.
- a search engine 130 may provide search results to users that include real-time updating information from various posts that users are supplying to the system, and can receive such updated information by interacting with the update pump 108 via understood application programming interfaces (APIs) and remote procedure calls (RPCs) where the two components are sub-components of a larger organization-wide system.
- APIs application programming interfaces
- RPCs remote procedure calls
- Various web front-ends are provided to permit the system 100 communicate over a network 106, such as the internet (and adjacent supporting networks).
- the mail server 114 may provide typical web-based electronic mail functionality, though with the integration of posts and comments into users' inboxes, via a mail client 120.
- streams may show up as discrete messages in a user's inbox, and may be updated in real time to include the latest comments on the streams and originating posts for the streams.
- Such content may be active, in that a user may be allowed to interact with it substantially to a level that they could if they were reviewing the streams in a dedicated stream reader.
- selectable controls may be provided with a stream that is displayed by the mail client 120, and a user may choose one in order to post a comment to be added to a stream, without having to leave the context of the message within the mail client 120.
- a profile server 110 generates code for representing user profiles such as profile 122 of user Joe Blow.
- the profile page may take the form of a standard feed page from a social networking site, arranged with a list of posts and comments from other users in reverse chronological order.
- an activities front end 112 can generate a similar feed for a user's feed page 124, here for a user named Susie User.
- the profile page 122 and the feed page 124 may be very similar to each other, and can present content similar to that presented as part of a posting or micro-blogging section of mail client 120.
- the profile page 122 is what third parties see when they look at the user's account, while the feed page 124 is what the user himself or herself sees.
- a search engine 130 and associated search front end 118 may provide a different sort of functionality for the system 100.
- the search front end 118 may allow users to provide posts or comments from non-traditional sources, such as search boxes, e.g., on a search web page or in a search box on a toolbar installed on their machines an operating in concert with their web browsers. Such posts or comments may be submitted by users and may be received by the search front end in a standard manner, just as search requests are.
- the intent of a user to submit a post rather than a search query (or in addition to a search query) may be determined by syntactical analysis of the submission.
- a query is preceded by the letter "z", with a space after it (see screen 128) - a construct that is seldom submitted as a real search query - the system may parse the submission apart and assume, from the syntax, that the user intends to post the remainder of the submitted query as a post to their social network.
- Such a post may be made immediately or after confirming with the submitting user that they would like to make a posting.
- a search results page 126 may be generated that contains actual search results for the submitted query (whether with or without the preceding "z") generated by the search engine 130 using data from index 138 in a conventional manner, and may be displayed below an area that shows the user the form of a proposed post and selectable controls by which the user can edit the post and can then confirm an intent to post the information to friends, followers, or others.
- the post may then be forwarded by the search front end 118 to the activity streams backend 102, along with identifying information for the user (e.g., a user ID identified from a cookie on the user's computing device when the user is logged onto a broader service that implements the system 100).
- identifying information for the user e.g., a user ID identified from a cookie on the user's computing device when the user is logged onto a broader service that implements the system 100.
- the system may identify that syntax as indicating an intent to send the remaining text of the submission as an email message to the user at the provided email address. Likewise, if the user starts a submission with a control character followed by a communication mode identifier, the remainder of the submission may be submitted for posting in that communication mode, either with or without first presenting the proposed action to the user and confirm that the user intends such a communication to occur.
- the syntax may indicate to the system 100 that the user would like to post the submitted phrase "I'm having a good time" to the user's blog (where the identity of the blog may be determined by the system 100 using a user ID stored as a cookie on the user's computing device, and which can be correlated to an account for the user that is in turn correlated to the blog).
- the search results and other information may be accompanied by targeted advertisements directed to the search query or other similar information, such as profile information, the text of posts or comments by a user, the text of posts or comments of users who have a relationship with a user (e.g., as friends, followers, or users that the first user follows).
- targeted advertisements may be served, through the search front end 118, or the other front ends 110, 112, 114 to users of the system 100 and may be targeted using techniques like those employed in GOOGLE ADWORDS OR ADSENSE.
- Such serving of advertisements may depend on ad data in database 134, which may include information about advertisers, the text and other content for the advertisements, bid prices submitted by the various advertisers, and other relevant information needed to serve advertisements that are directed to users and/or streams of information directed from or to the users.
- Various location-based services may be integrated with posts or comments, such as by identifying the locations (e.g., lat/long coordinates) or venues (e.g., stores, arenas, bars, or restaurants) from which posts or comments are made.
- locations e.g., lat/long coordinates
- venues e.g., stores, arenas, bars, or restaurants
- the location server 142 generally provides information about venues or other landmarks in response to receiving location information about a user of system 100. For example, when a user submits a post, geo-coordinates for the user may be provided with the post (e.g., via GPS functionality on the user's mobile computing device) or may be determined for the user by the system 100 (e.g., via cell tower or access point identification or triangulation).
- the geo-location information may be an estimated latitude and longitude of the mobile computing device and information identifying an accuracy of the estimation.
- the location server 142 may be made available through an API to various other components of the system 100. [0045] The location server 142 may use such geo-location information to identify one or more venues (e.g., stores, restaurants, or bars) in the general location of the user, may use proximity of the user to each venue and other signals (e.g., popularity of each venue as determined from search queries submitted with the venue name, check-ins at the venue by users of the system 100, a volume of activity associated with posts from the venue, a reputation of a post's author, for example, through number of subscribers, a volume of comments on posts, or a similarly determined reputation of the subscribers) to provide a ranked list of venues in the geographic area that the user may be located.
- venues e.g., stores, restaurants, or bars
- signals e.g., popularity of each venue as determined from search queries submitted with the venue name, check-ins
- the user may be presented with a single suggestion for a venue or several suggested venues. The user may then select one such venue, and that venue may be associated with the post when other users review it.
- the post may be accompanied by meta data indicating that the post was "Posted from Dive Bar," and other users may select the name "Dive Bar" to see additional information about the venue, including other posts from the venue, ratings of the venue, streams that belong to the venue (e.g., if a manager of the venue has made the venue a user of the system 100) and other similar information.
- the location server 142 may obtain information that it needs to provide such functionality from various external services, such as geo service 144.
- Geo service 144 may be a service that communicates via standard APIs to receive location information (e.g., lat/long coordinates) and to provide more advanced information in response.
- the more advanced information may include a street address that is determined to be associated with the lat/long coordinates (e.g., a street address that is nearest to a particular location represented by the lat/long coordinates).
- the more advance information may also include a list of venue names that are geographically near the particular location, street addresses for the venues, descriptive information for the venues, map tiles that are associated with the particular location, and a relevance score for each venue.
- the relevance score for each venue may identify how relevant the particular venue is based on any combination of (i) the received location information, (ii) an accuracy of the received location information, and (iii) a distance between the venue and a location identified by the received location information.
- a crawler 150 may crawl various posts and comments for the purpose of indexing the content in the system 100, so that, for example, search engine 130 may readily deliver search results that include the latest postings by users to the system 100.
- spam server 148 may communicate with the activity streams backend 102 and/or the update pump 108 to identify posts or comments that may be inappropriate (e.g., offensive, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate), duplicative, deceptive (e.g., in which one user poses as another user), and to act
- a recommendation server 140 may be provided with any new activity or post that is submitted to the system 100 (e.g., via the activity streams back end 102).
- the recommendation server 140 may write back to the activity streams backend 102 about the number of people who should receive the activity. Such information may be saved so that the next time a message is sent out about the activity (e.g., a comment on the activity) the new recommended users also get the activity.
- a quality score can be computed when determining what users should receive an activity and the score can be determined by factors such as the distance of relationship between a user and other users who have posted to or recommended an activity interests of a user as identified in the user's profile (e.g., the user is a member of a classic cars group in a social network, and thus is more likely to receive notices about activities relating to classic cars), or interests as identified by posts or other submissions that the user makes, users or activities that the user follows, and the like.
- a quality threshold may be set by the recommendation server 140 in order to maintain an adequate level of recommendations (e.g., not too many and not too few).
- the system 100 may provided for integration of various modes of posting and receiving content that is provided in streams, such as micro-blog posts and comments on such posts.
- Users may post in various ways, including directly into search boxes on search pages or toolbars, so that such users may be more tightly integrated into systems provided by the providers of the pages or toolbars, and may provide posts in contexts with which they are already very familiar.
- the users may review posts and other content in their email client, also in a manner that is already familiar to them and does not require them to leave a familiar application in order to review such posts.
- the content may be rich for the users, such that it may include information about locations and venues at those locations (from which a reader of the content may obtain additional information, such as from hyperlinks provided in posts), and the users may respond to posts in-line, such as from their email applications.
- the system 100 may provide a communication facility that allows a user simpler and more complete interaction with friends and with other users, and may increase the level of knowledge that is made available to the users of the system 100.
- Some aspects of this disclosure generally describes providing a realtime post related to a venue of user location, receiving user verification of the suggested venue, and switching between location contexts.
- the venue may represent a particular map point, boundary, landmark, business, event, geocache site, city, country, or other area of interest to one or more users.
- the venue can be determined by a mobile device in communication with a server system and verified by a user of the mobile device to ensure the venue is properly associated with the user's preferred location.
- the user's preferred location may pertain to a location from which the user wishes to author and upload
- the user may wish to provide a meaningful or a preferred "upload venue" to, for example, indicate to content readers that he is blogging, texting, or otherwise uploading communication content from his mobile device at a current location.
- the current location may relate to an actual geographic location or a user-influenced selected location.
- a user of a mobile device can open an application program, such as a web browser, a chatting application, a blogging application, a micro-blogging application, etc., to upload communication content.
- the mobile device may suggest or comment about a venue by determining any or all of the user's actual geographic location, a user's approximate geographic location, a previous user-selected location, a popular location, or an online user-voted location, just to name a few examples.
- a location-aware application on the mobile device can detect specific user location information and deduce a possible preferred upload venue from the user's actual location.
- the mobile device can, in effect, recommend to the user a single venue as a selectable upload venue within the graphical user interface (GUI) of the open micro-blogging application, for example.
- GUI graphical user interface
- the mobile device may prompt the user to confirm the location. For example, the mobile device may determine an approximate geographic location of the user and determine, in cooperation with a computerized server system, a suggested venue at which the user (and the mobile device) may be located. The user can confirm the recommended venue, and any post or uploaded communication content associated with the confirmed venue may provide the venue (e.g., data identifying the venue) in the communication content when posted.
- the mobile device may determine an approximate geographic location of the user and determine, in cooperation with a computerized server system, a suggested venue at which the user (and the mobile device) may be located.
- the user can confirm the recommended venue, and any post or uploaded communication content associated with the confirmed venue may provide the venue (e.g., data identifying the venue) in the communication content when posted.
- the mobile device can additionally provide the user with the capability of seeing posts related to particular preferred locations, which can modify device location information pertaining to any or all location-aware applications within the mobile device, regardless of the actual geographic location of the mobile device. For example, the user may identify either (i) a preferred location, or (ii) the user's current geographic location for posting content for other users to view.
- the mobile device can allow the user to set a home venue location or another venue location that will be location-stamped on each post corresponding to the user selected location or venue.
- the mobile device can also use the selected location to retrieve location or venue data for places around the selected location.
- the user may wish to "phantom blog" from a different venue or location than the user's current geographic location. For example, the user may be sitting in a coffee shop near a park and may prefer to attach the park venue rather than the coffee shop venue to any content posted.
- the mobile device may allow the user to select a location for stamping a communication in a blog posting or micro-blog posting, for example.
- applications on the mobile device may use the selected location as a basis for suggesting or providing user comments about other location based information to the mobile device user. For example, if the user is operating the mobile device in Burbank, California, and has recently returned from a vacation in New York City, NY, the mobile device can provide the user the option to toggle between CA and NY locations when both posting information and searching for other information related to either location. More particularly, if the user is uploading pictures from the NY vacation and discussing venues in the pictures, the mobile device can "guess" that the user wishes to post vacation- related communication and pictures as if the user were still traveling in NY to ensure, for example, the content looks "real time" to readers of the content.
- FIGS. 1 C-1 D illustrate a presentation and selection of a suggested location of a mobile device 100A running a micro-blogging application.
- the mobile device 100A may require a user to register the micro-blogging application with a micro- blogging service. Once registered, the user can begin posting content using the micro-blogging application on the mobile device 100A.
- One example registration process may include establishing a user ID and password such that secure access to the micro-blogging application can be provided.
- the application may enable the user to log into an online blogging account and begin posting content for other users who may read and respond to the content.
- the user ID and password may pertain to a previously established email account, which may allow the user to begin using the micro- blogging application without direct registration if, for example, an email program were to integrate the micro-blogging application.
- the user may use the mobile device 100A to submit content to a micro-blogging service or other web service.
- the submitted content can be posted to a website, sent in email, a text message, a voice message, a video message, or otherwise provided in an online manner to one or more users.
- a user can open a micro-blogging program such as a "Buzz" application 102A shown in FIG. 1 C, or another blogging or micro-blogging application and enter content for online submission.
- the application 102A may include input fields and controls for a user to enter textual posts and access other online and offline information.
- the application 102A includes a text area 104A, a prompt area 106A, and a post configuration area 108A.
- the text area 104A provides a text editor that users can access to post content about ideas, news, events, conversation, opinions, or other musings.
- a post entered in area 104A may be associated with a location of the user's mobile device at the time of post creation. For example, the user may opt to associate a location with their post including a latitude and longitude, current city or geographic region, commercial business, or venue and display the associated location as a venue of posting.
- the prompt area 106A may represent a toolbar with a single location.
- the location may represent a venue selected by the mobile device 100A using a GPS secured location, a cellular service secured location, a triangulated location, a nearby location, a previously entered location, a popular location within a particular range of the user, or any combination of the above, for example.
- the prompt area 106A may provide the user with a prompt 1 10A for selecting displayed location information.
- the prompt area 106A includes an address, "1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA” and a prompt 1 10A "At Apple Inc? Tap here" that the user can select.
- the prompt 1 10A may provide an estimated guess of a user's location with directions or prompting for the user to select an associated location or name of the address. For example, if the user's geographic location is near "1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA," the mobile device 100A may use location data to infer that the user wishes to provide a posting from the venue "Apple, Inc.” and may prompt the user to select Apple, Inc. using the question mark and the "Tap here" language.
- the prompt area 106A is a floating toolbar where the user can select a location for posting user-entered content.
- the prompt area 106A may be a toolbar which appears from a corner panel, a side panel, or a menu pop-up screen.
- the prompt area 106A may simply display a single location until a user hovers over the area 106A, at which point the prompt 1 10A may appear.
- the prompt area 106A may be a docked tool bar or a menu item.
- the prompt area 106A may be provided as a single toolbar or graphic element within the micro-blogging application. This can provide a user of the micro-blogging application with a non-intrusive element in the micro-blogging user interface.
- the toolbar may be provided upon hover over a graphic, a link, a menu item, a post, or other element within the micro-blogging application.
- the prompt area 106A also includes a scroll control 1 12A to enable a user to scroll multiple selectable locations for posting. For example, if a user selects the scroll control 1 12A, another single location may be provided to the user in place of the Apple, Inc. location.
- the next location may be another "guessed" location of a venue, according to known user location or user entered data. For example, the next location may be a popular venue close to Apple, Inc, such as a coffee shop, a park, a mall, or other venue.
- the prompt area 106A may provide a single suggested venue and may not display other selectable venue options.
- the prompt area 106A may provide multiple address options, but only provide the prompt 1 10A on the first option.
- Any number of locations may be scrollable using scroll control 1 12A.
- Providing a single location within prompt area 106A may provide the advantage of displaying a small or shrunken control for selecting locations since the user may be accessing the micro-blogging application on a portable device with a small display window.
- the user may close prompt area 106A by selecting a close control 1 14A.
- Other mechanisms may be available to close the area 106A. For example, the user may swipe (e.g., side-to-side or top-to-bottom motion) the prompt area 106A off of the screen using a fingertip or stylus to do so.
- the post configuration area 108A may include configuration options for the user to configure post content and post attributes.
- area 108A provides the user an option to make a post public or private by selecting either a public control 1 16A or a private control 1 18A, respectively.
- users can open application 102A, enter content in text area 104A, and select a presented location from prompt area 106A.
- the user can then select a post control 120A to submit the entered content as a post entered from the user-selected location of posting.
- the posts may be transmitted from the mobile device to a central server where the content is disseminated to computing devices of other people.
- These other people may view the posts by using the same micro-blogging application, using email, or using another application, or by logging into a website that displays a stream of posts by other people that use the micro-blogging service.
- the micro-blogging application may display a selected location 122A in the toolbar 106A, as shown in FIG. 1 D.
- the prompt 1 10A and the address may disappear.
- the selected location 122A may be associated with user content that the user enters as a post. If the user desires to change the location after selecting a location in prompt area 106A, the user can select the scroll control 1 12A to view other location options one at a time within area 106A.
- the user can close the toolbar 106A and continue posting without a location.
- the application defaults to a user's GPS triangulated location upon the closing of toolbar 106A.
- FIGS. 2A-2E illustrate a selection of a location of the mobile device 100.
- the content shown in FIGS. 2A-2E may be presented on a touch screen enabled device or other device capable of displaying content and receiving user input.
- FIG. 2A shows an example display of an environment in which a user can access a micro-blogging application 202.
- the depicted application screen details one of several possible screens within micro-blogging application 202 and users can switch seamlessly between screens by selecting interface elements using any combination of taps, slides, menu selections, etc.
- several users have posted content for a user to view. For example, user "Shailu Chauhan” posted “On my way to work” from a venue named, "Collins Elementary School.”
- the user accessing the application 202 is shown a map 204 with his current geographic location and a list of venues in toolbar 206 near his current geographic location.
- the user is near the street address "1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA," which the mobile device may have retrieved from the device location system, for example, in conjunction with communication with a server system.
- the venue may be noted as “Apple, Inc.” instead of the full address.
- the user can click on the toolbar 206 to view more information about the venues and/or locations in the list.
- the user can select a control 208 to view the user's current location combined with other nearby location information, as shown in FIG. 2B.
- FIG. 2B shows the micro-blogging application 202 with an overlaid extended toolbar 210.
- the toolbar 210 shows the user's current geographic location 212, an optional user-selected location 214, and other locations near the user's geographic location.
- a mobile device running application 202 can receive location data by initiating a webpage of a mapping site.
- the running application 202 can initiate another application to determine location data. If the application 202 initiates a mapping application, messages can be sent between the application 202 and the mapping application to, for example, narrow down a list of locations to a single location. In this fashion, the mapping application can send GPS coordinates or latitude and longitude coordinates to the application 202. The application can use the received coordinates as a basis for finding other venues. Other data can be sent between applications to determine an appropriate location suggestion for application 202.
- FIG. 2C shows the micro-blogging application 202 with the toolbar 210.
- the toolbar 210 can be used to allow the user to jump between two location contexts in the same interface.
- the user is provided with even more locations around the user's current geographic location.
- the user can select any of the locations in FIGS. 2B or 2C to set a selected location 216.
- the selected location 216 is "none," as shown in field 218.
- the user can select a "view buzz on a map" tool 220 to pan and zoom to find a location from which to post content.
- a map can be presented and the user can use the map to select a location.
- the user can search for a nearby place using search tool 222.
- the map or search tool 222 can be used to select a location. For example, the user can select a location on the map, and the application will return to the toolbar 210 with the selected location. The toolbar 210 may then display the user's selected location in field 218.
- the context of the location is changed and accordingly, searches or content entered into the application 202 may be performed in the context of the newly selected location.
- other locations listed with the selected location may be associated with the new context.
- the application 202 can repopulate other locations with locations that are near or within a specific range of the newly selected location. For example, all the locations that are displayed between the user's current geographic location interface element 212 and the user's selected location interface element 218 may be associated with one of the locations 218 or 212, depending on which location context is invoked.
- FIG. 2D shows a user selected location 224 at a top of the toolbar 210 (e.g., indicating that a current context of the application program is associated with the user selected location 224).
- the other locations are now shown as having the location context of the user-selected location 224.
- the user can select another location in the list to view information about that location. In some implementations, the user can choose to promote one of the locations in the list to his selected location.
- the user can switch between a selected location and a geographic location which can, for example, change the context that the mobile device uses to associate location information to application content, such as micro-blogging posts. If the user wishes to switch from the selected location to a geographic location, the user can simply select the geographic location from the list of locations. Similarly, if the user would prefer to use another location, the user can select any other location in the list to set his selected location 224. In some implementations, the user can open the map tool to find other locations to set as a selected location.
- the application 202 enables the user to store two distinct location contexts with which to associate to particular applications.
- the micro-blogging application 202 may be associated with a selected location while a browser window may be associated with a geographic location.
- the location associated and possibly displayed with the posts may be his selected location.
- the geographic location may be used.
- FIG. 2E shows the toolbar with the user's current geographic location 226 is unselected.
- the user's selected location is used by the application 202 as a present location context rather than the geographic location 226. If the user prefers using the geographic location, the user can select the geographic location 226 to do so. In this case, the geographic location 226 may move to the top of the list of locations, while the selected location (e.g., location 224) moves to the bottom of the list. Accordingly, at any point when a user modifies a preferred location, the list of locations in-between a geographic location and a selected location may automatically change to accommodate the new location context. Namely, the new locations provided are nearby or associated with the preferred location, where the preferred location changes according to user input.
- a user can be surfing the web and/or posting content as if the user were actually in Waterloo, ON at the time of surfing and posting.
- the user can find nearby venues from the new location (e.g., Waterloo, ON) without having to be at the selected location.
- the user can open a map, select Waterloo, ON, and provide a post as if the user were already in Waterloo, ON.
- Users can select any location based on interest and modify what the micro-blogging application 202 perceives to be its current location. Therefore, it is possible to phantom post content from a location based on easily selectable locations within an application.
- users can post a message from one location and post the next message from a second location without exiting the application or opening another application on the mobile device 100.
- the user can close the toolbar 210 and continue posting and reading posts within application 202.
- the application 202 stores two location contexts, each of which can be selected by the application 202 to suggest nearby venues. Any number of venues may be displayed to the user. Each venue may be ranked and provided to the user in a ranked order.
- FIG. 3A is an illustration of posted comments (e.g., buzzes) about one or more locations presented on the mobile device.
- a mobile device such as mobile device 100A can be used to present multiple posts for multiple locations on a map.
- a map 302 showing venues to the mobile device user.

- the comment bubble icon 310 can be presented as a selectable icon on the mobile device 100A.
- Users can publish short messages, with text and optional photographs, and affix these messages to a location on the map 302.
- the mobile device 100A also shows posted message information 304 (e.g., an "infobubble") from a user 308, who can post their picture 306, which may be on their user profile.
- the mobile device 100A also shows a picture 314 of a location or venue, such as a scene of an accident near an intersection of two streets.
- the user identification (ID) 308 can be presented, as well as the date of the message 316.
- the time of the posting is also presented to the user.
- the postings can be made in real time, and new comment bubble icons 310 may appear on the map 302 in real time.
- the mobile device 100A may also show a composite icon 319 (presented here as a "+" zoom-in icon) that, when selected, takes the user to another screen that may be a full-screen view of a list of the currently-posted messages in that "zoomed" area of the map 302.
- the non-composite icon 321 (presented here as a "-" zoom out icon) is presented so that the current view in the map can be zoomed out to a larger area when the non-composite icon 321 is selected.
- the posted message content presented on the map 302 may be presented according to the recency of the message, where older messages (e.g., messages older than 24 hours or another predetermined time period) will not be presented.
- the posted message content presented on the map 302 may depend upon other factors and signals.
- the message content that is posted may be determined on the server side. There is also a "nearby tab" 318 to present to the user messages that were posted nearby to the user's location.
- the location can be encoded as either a reverse geocode of the latitude and longitude of the user's location when the user is posting the message.
- the location may be an actual physical place or venue associated with the user's location if the user chooses to specify it. For example, the user may specify that they are located at a particular restaurant or coffee shop, where the name of the venue can be presented.
- a user can also be presented with a list of venues in their geographic area, and the user can select a particular venue from that list as their location for the posting.
- the comment bubble icons 310 may be presented in a layer over the map 302 (e.g., a "Buzz" layer over the map 302).
- the layer may refer to metadata that can be overlaid (sometimes selectively overlaid) on one or more graphical representations, such as the map 302.
- comment bubble icons 310 may come into view and other locations with comment bubble icons 310 may go out of view.
- new comment bubble icons 310 may appear when the user becomes physically located near a post office, a coffee shop, a city hall, a river park, or a parking ramp.
- the mobile device 100A also can track the user and modify the surroundings and viewpoints on the map 302. The user has the option to turn off or turn on (e.g., toggle) the layer showing the comment bubble icons 310.
- Comment bubble icons 310 can also appear and disappear on the map 302 as the user moves or pans the map 302.
- some comments bubbles such as comment bubble icon 31 1
- the posted message information 304 may show textual content, an optional photo 314, a user ID 308 and (thumbnail) picture 306, a date stamp and a location of the posting, in which information presented in the posted message information 304 may be selectable, and may reveal more information when selected. For example, by selecting the posted message information 304, the user can be taken to a full-screen conversation view of the message where any other comments may be presented.
- the posted message information 304 may be snapped or attached to a particular venue on the map 302 if a user manually moves the posted message information 304 close to that venue on the map 302.
- multiple users may present posted messages at the same venue and multiple comment bubble icons may be stacked on top of one another to correspond with those multiple postings.
- information for a single posted message can be presented, and if a user selects that single posted message information then the user can be shown another page that lists all of the multiple postings.
- the user can view a list of posted messages around an area of the map or the posted messages may be indexed by venues. The list of posted messages or index of venues may have links to other messages or further detail on the venues, such as location and hours of operation.
- users may be able to see posted messages on a venue by selecting a venue on the map or on another page, such as an email page or associated application.
- the mobile device 100A may be a computer laptop instead of only a handheld-type mobile device.
- a user may be able to search for specific posted messages at a venue. For example, if a user is at a concert venue and if there are hundreds of users there posting messages about the concert, then the users may be able to search for certain postings. For example, a user may be able to search for recent postings on the best places to park at the concert venue.
- a user may be able to select an area on the map 302 to see if there is any posted message information 304 in that area of the map 302, and if so, can view all available posted messages in that area. The user can then optionally subscribe to forward or respond to the posted messages, or to compose new messages for posting to other mobile device users on the system.
- FIGS. 3B-3C show illustrations involving posted comments associated with the venue.
- FIG. 3B shows an example where the mobile device 100A presents a "venue" page, which provides a selectable list of one or more venues to the user.
- One or more of the venues may have a selectable list of posted message information associated with the venue to show recent message postings for the selected venue.
- a user can submit a post that is tied to the particular venue.
- a user of the mobile device 100A can scroll down on the venue page and select an input box 371 for posting a message (e.g., a buzz) that would automatically be snapped to the location of the venue in the map.
- a message e.g., a buzz
- FIG. 3C shows a layer page 360 on that the mobile device 100A, where the layer page 360 includes a traffic layer 361 , a satellite layer 362, a buzz layer 363 (e.g., a posted comment layer) and a latitude layer 364.
