Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to coding in information and data processing systems and, more particularly, to a method for correcting a bust of errors plus random errors in data.
- errors may, for example, originate from reading data from a disk drive storing the data.
- Reed-Solomon codes are designed to correct random errors. If the code has t syndromes then the minimum distance between two code words is t+1 so at most t/2 random errors can be corrected. If some of the errors are erasure errors (i.e., their location is known) then f erasure errors and e random errors can be corrected as long as 2 e+f does not exceed t. Methods for correcting those errors are known, and are not a part of this invention.

- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of the initialization process performed prior to the process for correcting a bust of errors plus random errors
- FIGS. 3A and 3B taken together, is a flow diagram of the process implemented by the method according to the invention for correcting a burst of errors plus a generalized number of random errors;
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of the process implemented by the method according to the invention for correcting a burst of errors and no random errors;
- FIGS. 5A and 5B taken together, is a flow diagram of the process implemented by the method according to the invention for correcting a burst of errors plus one random error;
- FIGS. 6A and 6B taken together, is a flow diagram of the process implemented by the method according to the invention for correcting a burst of errors plus two random errors.
- FIG. 1 there is shown a block diagram of an apparatus on which the present invention may be implemented.
- a magnetic disk drive 10 having one or more magnetic recording media disks on which data are recorded provides an analog output signal as recorded data is read.
- This analog signal is input to a signal detection circuit 12 which produces a digital signal output.
- This digital signal output is a series of bits (i.e., “0s” and “0s”) which may have a burst of errors plus random errors.
- 0s bits
- There errors are, mainly, the result of noise and minute defects in the disk which cause a distortion of the analog signal. This, in turn, causes the interpretation of the signal by the signal detection circuitry to produce wrong bits.
- the digital output signal is input to an error correction circuit 14 which implements the method of correcting a burst of errors plus random errors according to the present invention.
- the output of the error correction circuit 14 is the corrected digital signal.
- R(x) is zero. If so, the algorithm is terminated since, in this case no burst errors have occurred.
- the degree of R(x) may be large because of “spurious” roots, so the next stages of the method are aimed at reducing its degree, and thus resulting in fewer candidate for 1 .
- G(x) R(x)/ged (R(x), R(ax)).
- function block 315 we compute the magnitudes of ⁇ 0 , ⁇ 1 , . . .
- ⁇ k of the random errors that is, we define the k ⁇ k matrix W(L) as having (y j ) i as its (ij) th element (i and j range from 0 to k ⁇ 1).
- function block 45 we find all the roots of F(x).
- I is indexed by “1” in function block 47 before the process loops back to decision block 46 .
- decision block 503 a determination is made as to whether R(x) is zero.
- function block 505 we remove all roots which are also roots of S 0 (x) or S 1 (x), thus ensuring that we will not have to consider those roots, L, of F(x) for which S 1 (L)/S 0 )L) is either zero or not defined.
- I is incremented by “1” before the process loops back to decision block 508 .
- H k (x) by F k (x).
Abstract
Description
G(x)=R(x)/ged (R(x), R(ax)).
(Alternatively, G(x)=R(x)/ged (R(x), R(a−1x)) may be computed.) This is useful when the size of the actual burst was smaller than b—in which case several roots of R(x) identify the same burst—and has the effect of removing this redundancy.
G′(x)=G(x)/ged (G(x), Δ0(x)), and
G″(x)=G′(x)/ged (G′(x), Δk(x)).
Of course, we are interested only in the roots of G″(x) which lie in the field, and remove all the roots which lie in a larger field. This is done in
c=V b −1 ×L×σ,
where Vb−1 is as computed in block 23 (
G(x)=R(x)/ged®(x),R(ax)),
and in
G′(x)=G(x)/ged(G(x),S0(x)), and
G″(x)=G′(x)/ged(G′(x), S1(x)).
G′(x)=G(x)/ged(G(x), Δ0(x)),
G″(x)=G′(x)/ged(G′(x), Δ1(x)), and
G′″(x)=G″(x)/ged(G″(x), Δ2(x)).
