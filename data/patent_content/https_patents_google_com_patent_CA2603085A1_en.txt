TECHNICAL FIELD
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0006] The disclosed embodiments relate generally to queries for facts, and more particularly, to a user interface for a factual query engine and snippets of sources with query terms and answer terms.
BACKGROUND
BACKGROUND
[0007] The World Wide Web (also knowri as the "Web") and the web pages within the Web are a vast source of factual information. Users may look to web pages to get answers to factual questions, such as "what is the capital of Poland" or "what is the birth date of George Washington." Web search engines, however, may be unhelpful to users in this regard, as they generally do not provide a simple, succinct answer to factual queries such as the ones described above. Rather, Web search engines provide a list of Web pages that are determined to match the query to the user, and the user has to sort through the matching Web pages to find the answer.
[0008] Attempts that have been made to build search engines that can provide quick answers to factual questions have their own shortcomings. For example, some search engines draw their facts from a single source, such as a particular encyclopedia. This limits the types of questions that these engines can answer. For instance, a search engine based on an encyclopedia is unlikely to be able to answer many questions concerning popular culture, such as questions about movies, songs or the like, and is also unlikely to be able to answer many questions about products, services, retail and wholesale businesses and so on. If the set of sources used by such a search engine were to be expanded, however, such expansion might introduce the possibility of multiple possible answers to a factual query, some of which might be contradictory or ambiguous. Furthermore, as the universe of sources expands, information may be drawn from untrustworthy sources or sources of unlcnown reliability.
SUMMARY
SUMMARY
[0009] According to an aspect of the invention, a method for displaying sources of a fact includes receiving a factual query that includes one or more terms, identifying an answer to the factual query that includes one or more terms, identifying one or more source documents that include one or more terms of the query and one or more terms of the answer, generating a snippet of at least one source document, with the snippet including one or more terms of the query and one or more terms of the answer, and generating a response that includes the snippet.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0019] A query engine can store factual information gathered from many disparate sources and return answers in response to queries for factual inforination (or "factual queries") from a user. Gathering information from many sources expands the scope of available factual information for the query engine, but also introduces the possibility of multiple possible answers. The query engine may identify possible answers and select a best answer from the possible answers to present to the user, or it may determine that none of the possible answers are presentable to the user. The query engine may also provide a list of sources of the answer, including portions of text from each source. The portion or portions of text is called a snippet and may include terms of the factual query and terms of the answer.
While a snippet shows the answer identified or selected by the search engine, the list of sources provide the user with the basis for the answer and may aid the user in evaluating the veracity of the answer.
While a snippet shows the answer identified or selected by the search engine, the list of sources provide the user with the basis for the answer and may aid the user in evaluating the veracity of the answer.
[0020] Figure 1 illustrates a network 100, according to some embodiments of the invention. Network 100 includes a one or more clients 102 and a query engine 106. A client 102 may include a client application (not shown). The network 100 also includes one or more communication networks 104 that couple these components.
[0021] The client application provides a user (not shown) of client 102 an interface to the query engine 106. Using a client application that runs on client 102, the user can submit searches for documents (for example, Web searches) and factual queries to the query engine 106 and view responses from the query engine 106. The client application may include web browsers. Examples of web browsers include FIREFOX, INTERNET EXPLORER, and OPERA.
[0022] The query engine 106 provides a platform for storing factual information and responding to factual queries, as well as handling other types of searches.
The query engine 106 can handle searches for documents, such as Web searches, and queries for factual information. The query engine 106 includes a query server 108. The query server 108 provides a front-end to the query engine 106. The query server 108 receives queries from the client 102, directs queries to coinponents of the query engine 106 that handle factual queries and other searches, generates responses, and transmits responses to the client 102. The query server 108 may be distributed over multiple computers. In other embodiments, more or fewer functions may be handled by the query engine. For instance, in other enlbodiments response generation may be handled elsewhere in the query engine 106.

The query server 108 receives queries from the client 102, directs queries to coinponents of the query engine 106 that handle factual queries and other searches, generates responses, and transmits responses to the client 102. The query server 108 may be distributed over multiple computers. In other embodiments, more or fewer functions may be handled by the query engine. For instance, in other enlbodiments response generation may be handled elsewhere in the query engine 106.
[0023] The query engine 106 includes a first search controller 110, a first cache 112, a document index 114, and a document database 116 for handling document searches. In some embodiments, these components may be deployed over multiple computers in order to provide fast access to a large number of documents. For example, the document database 116 may be deployed over N servers, with a mapping function such as the "modulo N"
function being used to determine which documents are stored in each of the N servers. N
may be an integer greater than 1, for instance an integer between 2 and 8196. Similarly, the docuinent index 114 may be distributed over multiple servers, and the first cache 112 may also be distributed over multiple servers. Furthermore, the first search controller 110 may also be distributed over multiple computers.

may be an integer greater than 1, for instance an integer between 2 and 8196. Similarly, the docuinent index 114 may be distributed over multiple servers, and the first cache 112 may also be distributed over multiple servers. Furthermore, the first search controller 110 may also be distributed over multiple computers.
[0024] The first search controller 110 is coupled to the query server 108. The first search controller 110 is also coupled to the first cache 112, the document index 114 and the document database 116. The first search controller 110 may be configured to receive document search queries from the query server 108 and transmit the queries to the first cache 112, the document index 114, and the document database 116. The first cache 112 may be used to increase search efficiency by temporarily storing previously located search results.
[0025] The first search controller 110 receives the document search results from the first cache 112 and/or the document index 114 and constructs an ordered search result list.
The first search controller 110 then returns a list of located documents back to the query server 108 for onward transmittal to the client 102. The document search results received by the first search controller 110 from the first cache 112 and/or the document index 114 may be accompanied by snippets of the located documents in the search results.

The document search results received by the first search controller 110 from the first cache 112 and/or the document index 114 may be accompanied by snippets of the located documents in the search results.
[0026] The query engine 106 also includes a second search controller 118, a second cache 120, a fact index 122, and a fact repository 124. In some embodinlents, these components may be deployed over inultiple computers in order to provider faster access to a large number of facts. For example, the fact repository 124 may be deployed over N servers, with a mapping function such as the "modulo N" function being used to detennine which facts are stored in each of the N servers. N may be an integer greater than 1, for instance an integer between 2 and 8196. Similarly, the fact index 122 may be distributed over multiple servers, and the second cache 120 may also be distributed over multiple servers. Furthennore, the second search controller 118 may also be distributed over multiple computers.
[0027] The second search controller 118 is coupled to the query server 108.
The second search controller 118 is also coupled to the second cache 120, the fact index 122 and the fact repository 124. The second search controller 118 may be configured to receive queries for answers to factual questions from the query server 108 and transmit the queries to the second cache 120 and to the fact repository 124 (via the fact index 122).
The second cache 120 may be used to increase fact retrieval efficiency by teinporarily storing previously located search results.
The second search controller 118 is also coupled to the second cache 120, the fact index 122 and the fact repository 124. The second search controller 118 may be configured to receive queries for answers to factual questions from the query server 108 and transmit the queries to the second cache 120 and to the fact repository 124 (via the fact index 122).
The second cache 120 may be used to increase fact retrieval efficiency by teinporarily storing previously located search results.
[0028] The second search controller 118 receives facts that are possible answers to a factual query from the second cache 120 and/or the fact repository 124. The second search controller 118 selects an answer from the possible answers as the best answer to present to the user. That answer is transmitted to the query server 108, where a response including that answer is generated and transmitted to the client 102 for presentation to the user. In response to user selection of an icon displayed at or next to an answer to a factual query, the query server 108 may identify a list of sources associated with the answer and transmit the list of sources to the first search controller 110. The first search controller 110 accesses documents that correspond to the sources and snippets for at least a subset of the source documents. In some embodiments, the snippets include terms from the query and terms from the answer.
[0029] The fact repository 124 stores factual information extracted from a plurality of documents. A document from which a particular fact may be extracted is a source document (or "source") of that fact. In other words, a source of a fact includes that fact within its contents. Sources documents may include, without limitation, Web pages. Within the fact repository 124, entities, concepts, and the like for which the fact repository 124 may have factual information stored are represented by objects. An object may have one or more facts associated with it. Each object is a collection of facts; an object that has no facts associated with it (an empty object) may be viewed as a non-existent object within the fact repository 124. Within each object, each fact associated with the object is stored as an attribute-value pair. Each fact also includes a list of source documents that include the fact within their contents and from which the fact was extracted. Further details about objects and facts in the fact repository are described below, in relation to Figure 2.
[0030] To lookup infonnation in the fact repository 124, the second search controller 118 searches the fact index 122 for the terms in the search query. This results in lists of fact repository locations (i.e., which correspond to facts or objects) that match the various terms in the search query. Using the logical structure of the search query (which may be considered to be a Boolean expression or tree), the second search controller 118 then forms logical combinations of these location lists to identify possible facts, if any, that match the search query.
[0031] The fact index 122 provides an index to the fact repository 124 and facilitates efficient lookup of information in the fact repository 124. The fact index 122 may index the fact repository 124 based on one or more parameters. For example, the fact index 122 may have an index (which may be called a main index or term index) that indexes unique terms to locations within the fact repository 124. Further details about the fact index 122 are described below, in relation to Figure 3.
[0032] It should be appreciated that while any of the components of the query engine 106 may be distributed over multiple computers, for convenience of explanation, we will discuss the components of the query engine 106 as though they were implemented on a single computer.
[0033] Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary data structure for an object within the fact repository 124, according to some embodiments of the invention. As described above, the fact repository includes objects, each of which may include one or more facts.
Each object 200 includes a unique identifier, such as the object ID 202. The object 200 includes one or more facts 204. Each fact 204 includes a unique identifier for that fact, such as a Fact ID
210. Each fact 204 includes an attribute 212 and a value 214. For example, facts included in an object representing George Washington may include facts having attributes of "date of birth" and "date of death," and the values of these facts would be the actual date of birth and date of death, respectively. A fact 204 may include a link 216 to another object, which is the object identifier, such as the object ID 202 of another object within the fact repository 124.
The link 216 allows objects to have facts whose values are other objects. For example, for an object "United States," there may be a fact with the attribute "president"
whose value is "George W. Bush,", with "George W. Bush" being another object in the fact repository 124.
In some embodiments, the value field 214 store the naine of the linked object and the link 216 stores the object identifier of the linked object. In some other embodiments, facts 204 do not include a linlc field 216 because the value 214 of a fact 204 may store a link to another object.
Each object 200 includes a unique identifier, such as the object ID 202. The object 200 includes one or more facts 204. Each fact 204 includes a unique identifier for that fact, such as a Fact ID
210. Each fact 204 includes an attribute 212 and a value 214. For example, facts included in an object representing George Washington may include facts having attributes of "date of birth" and "date of death," and the values of these facts would be the actual date of birth and date of death, respectively. A fact 204 may include a link 216 to another object, which is the object identifier, such as the object ID 202 of another object within the fact repository 124.
The link 216 allows objects to have facts whose values are other objects. For example, for an object "United States," there may be a fact with the attribute "president"
whose value is "George W. Bush,", with "George W. Bush" being another object in the fact repository 124.
In some embodiments, the value field 214 store the naine of the linked object and the link 216 stores the object identifier of the linked object. In some other embodiments, facts 204 do not include a linlc field 216 because the value 214 of a fact 204 may store a link to another object.
[0034] Each fact 204 also may include one or more metrics 218. The metrics may provide indications of the quality of the fact. In some einbodiments, the metrics include a confidence level and an importance level. The confidence level indicates the likelihood that the fact is correct. The iinportance level indicates the relevance of the fact to the object, compared to other facts for the same object. In other words, the importance level measures how vital a fact is to an understanding of the entity or concept represented by the object.
[0035] Each fact 204 include a list of sources 220 that include the fact and from which the fact was extracted. Each source may be identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or Web address.
[0036] In some embodiments, some facts may include an agent field 222 that identifies the module that extracted the fact. For example, the agent may be a specialized module that extracts facts from a specific source, or a module that extracts facts from free text in documents throughout the Web, and so forth.
[0037] In some embodiments, an object 200 may have one or more specialized facts, such as a name fact 206 and a property fact 208. A name fact 206 is a fact that conveys a naine for the entity or concept represented by the object 200. For example, for an object representing the country Spain, there may be a fact conveying the name of the object as "Spain." A name fact 206, being a special instance of a general fact 204, includes the same parameters as any other fact 204; it has an attribute, a value, a fact ID, metrics, sources, etc.
The attribute 224 of a name fact 206 indicates that the fact is a name fact, and the value is the actual name. The name may be a string of text. An object 200 may have one or more name facts, as many entities or concepts can have more than one name. For example, an object representing Spain may have name facts conveying the country's common name "Spain" and the official name "Kingdom of Spain." As another example, an object representing the U.S.
Patent and Trademarlc Office may have name facts conveying the agency's acronyms "PTO"
and "USPTO" and the official name "United States Patent and Trademark Office."
The attribute 224 of a name fact 206 indicates that the fact is a name fact, and the value is the actual name. The name may be a string of text. An object 200 may have one or more name facts, as many entities or concepts can have more than one name. For example, an object representing Spain may have name facts conveying the country's common name "Spain" and the official name "Kingdom of Spain." As another example, an object representing the U.S.
Patent and Trademarlc Office may have name facts conveying the agency's acronyms "PTO"
and "USPTO" and the official name "United States Patent and Trademark Office."
[0038] A property fact 208 is a fact that conveys a statement about the entity or concept represented by the object 200 that may be of interest. For example, for the object representing Spain, a property fact may convey that Spain is a country in Europe. A property fact 208, being a special instance of a general fact 204, also includes the same parameters (such as attribute, value, fact ID, metrics, sources, etc.) as other facts 204. The attribute field 226 of a property fact 208 indicates that the fact is a property fact, and the value field is a string of text that conveys the statement of interest. For example, for the object representing Spain, the value of a property fact may be the text string "is a country in Europe." An object 200 may have zero or more property facts.
[0039] It should be appreciated that the data structure illustrated in Figure 2 and described above is merely exemplary. The data structure of the fact repository 124 may take on other forms. Other fields may be included in facts and some of the fields described above may be omitted. Additionally, each object may have additional special facts aside from name facts and property facts, such as facts conveying a type or category (for example, person, place, movie, actor, etc.) for categorizing the entity or concept represented by the object. In some embodiments, an object's name(s) andlor properties are represented by special records that have a different format than the facts records 204 associated with the attribute-value pairs of an object.
[0040] Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary fact index, according to some embodiments of the invention. As described above, the fact index 122 may index the fact repository based on one or more parameters. In some embodiments, fact index 300 may be that index. The fact index 300 maps unique temis to facts, or to locations of information within the fact repository 124. As used herein, a tenn is a word (such as "Spain" or "George") or number (such as "123" or "-9"). In some embodiments, terms may also in include terms that contain two or more words, such as "United States" or "birth date." The fact index 300 includes multiple sets 303 of terms and associated term location records, and may optionally include an index header 302 with information about the index 300 (e.g., information about the size of the index, information about a mapping fiuiction used to locate the sets, etc.). Within each set 303 is a term 304 and one or more term location records 306 that identify the locations of each appearance of the term within the fact repository 124. Each tenn location record has an object identifier 308 (identifying the object where the term appears), a fact identifier 310 (identifying the fact within the object), a fact field identifier 312 (identifying the field within the fact), and a token identifier 314 (identifying the token within the field). These four fields map a term to a location in the fact repository 124. However, it should be appreciated that the fact index 300 is merely exemplary and other forms of the fact index 300 and other fact indexes are possible. In some einbodiments, when a term location record 306 points to an object as a whole (e.g., the term is the name of the object), the fact identifier 310, field identifier 312 and token identifier 314 may have predefined or null values.
[0041] Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary list of possible answers to a factual query, according to some embodiments of the invention. The second search controller 118 receives a list of one or more possible answers to a factual query from the second cache 120 or from a search of the fact repository 124, selects the best answer from the list of possible answers, and transmits the best answer to the query server 108 for further processing, further details of wllich are described below, in relation to Figures 5A - 5C. Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary list of possible answers 400. The list 400 includes one or more possible answers 403. Each possible answer 403 has one or more fields. The object ID 404 identifies the object which included the fact that is a possible answer. The object name 406 identifies the name of the entity or concept represented by the object identified by the object ID 404.
The object naine 406 may be the value of a name fact included in the object (see above discussion of object data structure). The fact attribute 408 identifies the attribute of the fact that is a possible answer. The fact value 410 identifies the value of the fact that is a possible answer. The answer field 412 identifies which of three fields - object name 406, fact attribute 408, or fact value 410 - has the actual answer that is responsive to the factual query (that is, the kind of answer the user is looking for). The QA type 414 identifies the type of question that is posed by the factual query (tliat is, the kind of question the user is asking and, by implication, the answer that is responsive to the kind of question being asked). The score 416 indicates a score for the possible answer. The score is a metric that attempts to measure the quality of the possible answer as an accurate and responsive answer. The fact query 418 is the internal query generated by the second search controller 118 that led to the identification of the possible answer as such. The fact query 418 is generated based on the user query (that is, the query as entered by the user at client 102). Further details about the QA type 414, the score 416, and the fact query 418 are described below, in relation to Figures 5A -5C. In some embodiments, possible answers 403 may be represented by more or fewer fields of information. In some embodiments, the list 400 includes a list header 402 that contains information applicable to the entire list 400. For instance, the header 402 may include a copy of the user query, a pointer to the top entry of the list 400, or other data structures for facilitating access to the items or records in the list 400.
The object naine 406 may be the value of a name fact included in the object (see above discussion of object data structure). The fact attribute 408 identifies the attribute of the fact that is a possible answer. The fact value 410 identifies the value of the fact that is a possible answer. The answer field 412 identifies which of three fields - object name 406, fact attribute 408, or fact value 410 - has the actual answer that is responsive to the factual query (that is, the kind of answer the user is looking for). The QA type 414 identifies the type of question that is posed by the factual query (tliat is, the kind of question the user is asking and, by implication, the answer that is responsive to the kind of question being asked). The score 416 indicates a score for the possible answer. The score is a metric that attempts to measure the quality of the possible answer as an accurate and responsive answer. The fact query 418 is the internal query generated by the second search controller 118 that led to the identification of the possible answer as such. The fact query 418 is generated based on the user query (that is, the query as entered by the user at client 102). Further details about the QA type 414, the score 416, and the fact query 418 are described below, in relation to Figures 5A -5C. In some embodiments, possible answers 403 may be represented by more or fewer fields of information. In some embodiments, the list 400 includes a list header 402 that contains information applicable to the entire list 400. For instance, the header 402 may include a copy of the user query, a pointer to the top entry of the list 400, or other data structures for facilitating access to the items or records in the list 400.
[0042] Figures 5A - 5C illustrates an exemplary process for selecting a best answer to a factual query and presenting that answer, according to some embodiments of the invention.
The answer to a factual query is the fact in the fact repository 124 that is identified as the best response to the factual query. Upon receiving a factual query, the query engine 106 processes the query, identifies possible answers, selects the best answer, and generates a response that includes the answer. The query engine 106 may also generate a response that includes a list of sources of the answer.

Upon receiving a factual query, the query engine 106 processes the query, identifies possible answers, selects the best answer, and generates a response that includes the answer. The query engine 106 may also generate a response that includes a list of sources of the answer.
[0043] A query is received by the query engine 106 (502). The query was entered at the client 102 by the user and transmitted by the client 102 to the query engine 106. The query includes one or more terms. The query as entered by the user is the user query.
[0044] The user query is processed (504). The user query is transmitted to both the first search controller 110 and the second search controller 118. Because the user query includes one or more terms, it may be treated as a search query for documents, such as a Web search, and transmitted to system coniponents that handle such searches, such as the first search controller 110. Searches for documents, such as Web searches, are well known in the art and need not be further described.
[0045] The user query is also transmitted to the second search controller 118.
The user query is pre-processed and analyzed to determine if the user query fits into any of one or more QA types. The pre-processing may include dropping "stopwords" (such as definite and indefinite articles and prepositions) and expanding words and/or phrases within the user query to include their respective synonyms or equivalents. For example, a phrase "birth date"
may be expanded to include its synonyms "date birth" (without the stopword "of') and "birthday." The analysis may include parsing the user query and analyzing the text of the user query. If the user query is determined to fit into any one of the QA
types, a fact query corresponding to the respective QA type may be generated for the user query.
The fact query is a query internal to the query engine 106 and used to access the second cache 120, and the fact repository 124 (via the fact index 122) for possible answers. If the user query is determined to not fit into any QA type, further processing by the second search controller 118 on the user query may be aborted, as the user query is, in the view the second search controller 118, not a factual query. It should be appreciated that a user query may be determined to fit into more than one QA type, and as a result, more than one fact query may be generated for a single user query. Each of these fact queries may be used to access the fact repository 124, second cache 120, and the fact index 122 for possible answers.

The fact query is a query internal to the query engine 106 and used to access the second cache 120, and the fact repository 124 (via the fact index 122) for possible answers. If the user query is determined to not fit into any QA type, further processing by the second search controller 118 on the user query may be aborted, as the user query is, in the view the second search controller 118, not a factual query.

Each of these fact queries may be used to access the fact repository 124, second cache 120, and the fact index 122 for possible answers.
[0046] A user query may fit into one or more QA types. A QA type is a question-to-answer mapping that indicates what factual question is being asked by the user query and the kind of answer that is responsive to factual query. In some embodiments, there are three general QA types: name and attribute to value ("NA-V"); attribute and value, or property, to name ("AV-N"), and name to property, type, or name ("N-PTN"). In some embodiments, there may be additional specialized QA types to handle specific types of questions. In some embodiments, these specialized QA types may be specialized instances of the general QA
types.
types.
[0047] In the NA-V type, the user (by entry of a user query) provides an object name and an attribute and wants to know the value of the corresponding attribute for the object with the given name. An example of a NA-V type query may be "what is the capital of Poland,"
in which "Poland" is the object name and "capital" is the attribute of "Poland" for which the value is desired. The answer for this query would be the value of a fact, associated witlz the object with the name "Poland," and having the attribute "capital." In this case, the value of the fact witll the "capital" attribute may be the string "Warsaw." The value may also be the object identifier for an object with name "Warsaw," in which case the name "Warsaw" may be substituted for the object identifier and returned as a possible answer.
in which "Poland" is the object name and "capital" is the attribute of "Poland" for which the value is desired. The answer for this query would be the value of a fact, associated witlz the object with the name "Poland," and having the attribute "capital." In this case, the value of the fact witll the "capital" attribute may be the string "Warsaw." The value may also be the object identifier for an object with name "Warsaw," in which case the name "Warsaw" may be substituted for the object identifier and returned as a possible answer.
[0048] In the AV-N type, the user provides an attribute and a value (or a property, since properties are merely specialized attribute-value pairs, as described above) and wants a name that has the given value for the given attribute. In a sense, this is a "reverse lookup."
An example of an AV-N type query may be "which country has Warsaw as its capital," in which case "capital" is the attribute and "Warsaw" is the value. A possible answer may be the name of the object with this attribute-value pair, namely "Poland."
An example of an AV-N type query may be "which country has Warsaw as its capital," in which case "capital" is the attribute and "Warsaw" is the value. A possible answer may be the name of the object with this attribute-value pair, namely "Poland."
[0049] In the N-PTN type, the user provides a name and wants a property or type or alternate name of the object associated with the given name. One exainple of the N-PTN
type query may be "what is the NRA." "NRA" is the naine of the object for which the user wants a property, type or alternate naine. One possible property answer for "NRA" is "a Second Amendment rights advocacy group." A type answer, which conveys a categorization of the entity or concept represented by an object, for "NRA" may be "organization,"
indicating that the NRA is an organization, as opposed to other types such as a person, book, movie, etc. An alternate name for "NRA" may be "National Rifle Association,"
which is the official name of the entity represented by the object with an (acronym) name "NRA."

which is the official name of the entity represented by the object with an (acronym) name "NRA."
[0050] In some embodiments, the fact query may include additional constraints.
For example, the fact query may specify that a certain term may only match in a particular field and not other fields. Another constraint may be that any possible answer inust match a specific type (such as person, book, etc.). Such constraints are generated by the second search controller 118 during analysis and processing of the user query.

Another constraint may be that any possible answer inust match a specific type (such as person, book, etc.). Such constraints are generated by the second search controller 118 during analysis and processing of the user query.
[0051] After the user query is processed and one or more fact queries are generated, the fact queries are used to access the fact repository 124 (via the fact index 122) and second cache 120 for possible answers (506). The possible answers are the facts that match the fact query or queries. The possible answers are scored (508). The score for a possible answer provides an indication of the quality of the possible answer as an accurate and responsive answer.
[0052] In some embodiments, the score of a possible answer is a multiplicative product of a plurality of factor values. In some embodiments, one or more of the factor values may be normalized values between 0 and 1, inclusive. The factors that are actually used in determining the score may vary by the QA type of the fact query that matched the possible answer. In some embodiments, because the score, being the product of factors that are between 0 and 1, inclusive, can remain the same or decrease towards 0 but never increase, the scoring for any particular possible answer may be aborted if the score for that particular answer decreases below a predefined threshold. This may be an indication that the possible answer is of such poor quality that further scoring would be wasteful.
[0053] In some embodiments, the factors may be based on the QA type, metrics of the fact that matched the fact query (such as a confidence metric and an importance metric), the agent that extracted the matching fact, the degree to which a field in the fact was matched by the fact query, the degree to which particular fields in the fact match the fact query completely, and so forth. It should be appreciated that the factors described above are merely exemplary and that other factors may be included in addition to the ones described above and some of the factors described above may be omitted.
[0054] After each possible answer is scored, the possible answers are gathered into a possible answer list, such as the possible answers list 400 described above, in relation to Figure 4. In some embodiments, only a predefined number of top scoring answers are gathered into the possible answers list 400. For example, the possible answers list may include only the 100 highest scoring possible answers. In some embodiments, further processing of the possible answers list 400 is handled by the second search controller 118.
[0055] Continuing in Figure 5B, a number of the highest scoring possible answers are identified from the possible answers list 400 (510). The number may be a predefined number that specifies how many top scoring answers will be further processed. As long as there are still identified top scoring possible answers to be processed (512 - no), a next top scoring answer is processed. The processing involves identifying supporting answers for the respective top scoring answer (514) and determining a supported score for the respective top scoring answer based on the score of the respective top scoring answer and the scores of its supporting answers (516). The identification of supporting answers is discussed in more detail below.
[0056] In some embodiments, the supported score is determined by converting each of the scores of the top scoring answer and its supporting answers to odds space values. A
score s is converted to an odds space value x.
s x=
1-s The converted values (i.e., the odds space conversions of the scores) are summed to generate to a value X, and that sum X is converted back to a probability space value to get the supported score S for the top scoring answer.
_ 1X

S
score s is converted to an odds space value x.
s x=
1-s The converted values (i.e., the odds space conversions of the scores) are summed to generate to a value X, and that sum X is converted back to a probability space value to get the supported score S for the top scoring answer.
_ 1X
+X
S
[0057] After the supported scores are determined for the identified top scoring answers (512 - yes), the top scoring answer with the highest supported score (hereinafter "best supported answer") is identified (518). For the best supported answer, the top scoring answer within the list of possible answers that is contradictory to the best supported answer is identified (520). For that contradictory answer, a contradicting score C, which is the supported score for that contradictory answer, is determined (522). In addition, in some embodiments, the top scoring answer within the list of possible answers that is unrelated to the best supported answer is identified (524). For that unrelated answer, a unrelated score U, which is the supported score for that unrelated answer, is determined (526).
It should be appreciated that the process for determining contradicting score C and unrelated score U are similar to the process for determining S: supporting answers are identified, the scores are converted to odds space values, the odds space values are summed, and the sum is converted back to a probability space value. The determination of contradictory and unrelated answers are described below.
It should be appreciated that the process for determining contradicting score C and unrelated score U are similar to the process for determining S: supporting answers are identified, the scores are converted to odds space values, the odds space values are summed, and the sum is converted back to a probability space value. The determination of contradictory and unrelated answers are described below.
[0058] Whether two possible answers are supporting, contradictory, or unrelated are based on comparisons of the fields of the two answers. Each answer's fields of interest, namely the naine, attribute, and value, are grouped into an input and output.
For example, in some embodiments, for a NA-V type query, the inputs are the name and the attribute and the output is the value. For an AV-N type query, the inputs are the attribute and the value and the output is the name. Two possible answers are compared by doing pair-wise comparisons of their input fields and their output fields. The comparison talces into account the type of data in the fields, that is, whether the data in the field is a string of words, a date, a number, and so forth. The source of the answer may also considered.
For example, in some embodiments, for a NA-V type query, the inputs are the name and the attribute and the output is the value. For an AV-N type query, the inputs are the attribute and the value and the output is the name. Two possible answers are compared by doing pair-wise comparisons of their input fields and their output fields. The comparison talces into account the type of data in the fields, that is, whether the data in the field is a string of words, a date, a number, and so forth. The source of the answer may also considered.
[0059] In some embodiments, the result of a pair-wise field comparison is one of five classifications. They are:
= not comparable: the fields have different data types (for example, strings of words vs.
a date) and thus cannot be compared;
= not similar: the fields are of the same data type, but are not the same at all;
= somewhat similar: the fields have some similarity, but it is difficult to conclude if they may mean the same thing;
= very similar: the fields are nearly the same; and = identical: the fields are exactly the same.
= not comparable: the fields have different data types (for example, strings of words vs.
a date) and thus cannot be compared;
= not similar: the fields are of the same data type, but are not the same at all;
= somewhat similar: the fields have some similarity, but it is difficult to conclude if they may mean the same thing;
= very similar: the fields are nearly the same; and = identical: the fields are exactly the same.
[0060] The actual determination of whether the fields are the same or not may differ by data type. For example, for numbers, if the numbers are small integers, then they must be exactly equal in order to be treated as the same. If the numbers are very large integers or floating point numbers, then they may be treated the same if they are within a certain percentage of each other.
[0061] Based on the pairwise field comparisons, the relationship between the two answers are classified:
= Two answers are classified as "complementary" if the answers came from the same source. Answers that are complementary to an answer A are ignored;
= Two answers are classified as "may support" (i.e., an answer A "may support"
an answer B), if the answers have the identical or very similar inputs but the outputs are only somewhat similar. An answer A that "may support" an answer B is also ignored;
= Two answers are classified as "supporting" if the answers have identical or very similar inputs and identical or very similar outputs, unless the two answers came from the same source. The scores of "supporting" answers are part of the determination of the supported score;
= Two answers are "contradictory" if the inputs are identical or very similar but the outputs are not similar or are not comparable; and = two ainswers are "unrelated" if the inputs are not similar or are not comparable.
= Two answers are classified as "complementary" if the answers came from the same source. Answers that are complementary to an answer A are ignored;
= Two answers are classified as "may support" (i.e., an answer A "may support"
an answer B), if the answers have the identical or very similar inputs but the outputs are only somewhat similar. An answer A that "may support" an answer B is also ignored;
= Two answers are classified as "supporting" if the answers have identical or very similar inputs and identical or very similar outputs, unless the two answers came from the same source. The scores of "supporting" answers are part of the determination of the supported score;
= Two answers are "contradictory" if the inputs are identical or very similar but the outputs are not similar or are not comparable; and = two ainswers are "unrelated" if the inputs are not similar or are not comparable.
[0062] The supported score S of the best supported answer is compared to a predefined threshold T (528). The threshold T is a minimum score that the supported score S
must reach if the best supported answer is to be considered further. If S is less than or equal to T (528 - no), then the processor(s) performing the processing shown in Figure 5B (e.g., the second search controller 118 or the query engine 106) may generate a response indicating that the query engine 106 is unable to provide an answer (534). For example, the second search controller 118 may transmit a response to the query server 108 indicating that an answer is unavailable, and the query server 108 may generate and transmit a response to that effect to the client 102 for presentation to the user.
must reach if the best supported answer is to be considered further. If S is less than or equal to T (528 - no), then the processor(s) performing the processing shown in Figure 5B (e.g., the second search controller 118 or the query engine 106) may generate a response indicating that the query engine 106 is unable to provide an answer (534). For example, the second search controller 118 may transmit a response to the query server 108 indicating that an answer is unavailable, and the query server 108 may generate and transmit a response to that effect to the client 102 for presentation to the user.
[0063] If S is greater than T (528 - yes), then a check is made to see whether the supported score S of the best supported answer exceeds the best supported score C of a contracting answer by at least a first predefined margin. In one einbodiment, this check is made by comparing S to the contradicting score C multiplied by a constant a (530). The constant a represents the minimum S to C ratio that must be achieved in order for the best supported answer to be selected as the best answer to the factual query. In other words, S has to be at least a times the contradicting score C. If S is less than aC (530 -no), then the processor(s) performing the processing shown in Figure 5B (e.g., the second search controller 118 or the query engine 106) may generate a response indicating that the query engine 106 is unable to provide an answer (534).
[0064] If S is equal to or greater than aC (530 - yes), then another a check is made to see whether the supported score S of the best supported answer exceeds the best supported score U of an unrelated answer by at least a second predefined margin. In one embodiment, this check is made by comparing to the unrelated score U multiplied by a constant P (532).
The constant (3 represents the minimum S to U ratio that must be achieve before the best supported answer may be selected as the best answer to the factual query. In other words, S
has to be at least (3 times the unrelated score U. If S is less than (3U (532 -no), then the processor(s) performing the processing shown in Figure 5B (e.g., the second search controller 118 or the query engine 106) may generate a response indicating that the query engine 106 is unable to provide an answer (534). If S is equal to or greater than (3U (532 -yes), then the best supported answer is selected as the answer to the factual query and further processed, further details of which are described below in relation to Figure 5C.

If S is equal to or greater than (3U (532 -yes), then the best supported answer is selected as the answer to the factual query and further processed, further details of which are described below in relation to Figure 5C.
[0065] Continuing in Figure 5C, after the best supported answer is selected as the best answer to the factual query, the query server 108 generates a response (536).
The response may include the best supported answer. The response may include an identifier and/or a hyperlink (e.g., to a URL), for a source of the best supported answer. In some embodiments, the response may also include a link that, when clicked upon by a user at client 102, can generate a request for a list of the sources of the best supported answer. In some embodiments, the response may also include the results of a document search, such as a Web search, based on the user query. The document search results may be transmitted to the query server 108 from components of the query engine 106 that handle such searches, such as the first search controller 110. The response is transmitted to the client 102 for presentation to the user (538). An exemplary response including the answer and results of a document search using the user query is described in further detail below, in relation to Figure 6.
The response may include the best supported answer. The response may include an identifier and/or a hyperlink (e.g., to a URL), for a source of the best supported answer. In some embodiments, the response may also include a link that, when clicked upon by a user at client 102, can generate a request for a list of the sources of the best supported answer.

The document search results may be transmitted to the query server 108 from components of the query engine 106 that handle such searches, such as the first search controller 110. The response is transmitted to the client 102 for presentation to the user (538). An exemplary response including the answer and results of a document search using the user query is described in further detail below, in relation to Figure 6.
[0066] The user, seeing the presented response at the client 102, may request a listing of the sources of the answer. In some embodiments, the user may malce that request by clicking on a link included in the response (as described above) that generates the request for the sources listing upon being clicked.
[0067] The query engine 106 receives the request to list the sources of the answer (540). The sources of the answer are identified (542). In some embodiments, the sources of the answer may be identified by looking up the sources 220 (Figure 2) of the answer fact in the fact repository 124. A snippet generation request is sent to the first search controller, along with the list of sources, the user query, the fact query 418 that matched the answer, and the answer. The snippet generation request is submitted to the first cache 112, the document index 114, and/or the document database 116. In some embodiments, if the list of sources is longer than a predefined limit, a subset of the list of sources may be selected by the first search controller 110 and submitted to the first cache 112, the document index 114, and/or the document database 116. The first cache 112, the document index 114, and/or the document database 116, or one or more processors to which the snippet generation request is submitted, generates a snippet for each of the listed sources (544). Each snippet may include one contiguous portion of text or a plurality of non-contiguous portions of text from the respective source. For a particular snippet, if the text portions chosen for inclusion in the snippet are not contiguous within the source, the portions may be separated by ellipses.
[0068] Each snippet is generated such that it includes as many terms of the user query and/or the fact query and as many terms of the answer as possible. The source may be analyzed for the scatter of query and answer terms (that is, how scattered the query terms and answer terms are in the source document) to assist in the generation of the snippet. The text portion or portions that yield the least query term and answer term scatter are selected for inclusion in the snippet.
[0069] A response that includes the snippets is generated (546). The response includes a list of sources and snippets of each source that includes the user/fact query terms and answer terms. The response may also include the answer, the user query, and hyperlinks to each source. The response is transmitted to the client 102 for presentation to the user (548).
[0070] In some einbodiments, the user/fact query terms and answer terms in each snippet are highlighted to make them more prominent when the response is presented to the user. As used herein, highlighting of terms within the snippets refers to any manner of malcing the terms more prominent when presented to the user including, but not limited to, inalcing the terms bold, underlining the terms, italicizing the terms, changing the font color of the terms, and/or adding background color to the local area of the terms. An exemplary response that includes the list of sources and the snippets is described in further detail below, in relation to Figure 7.
[0071] In some embodiments, queries submitted to the query engine 106 may be represented by a URL that includes the user query temzs and one or more other parameters.
For example, a query for the terms "britney spears parents" may be represented by the URL
"http://www.google.com/search?h1=en&q=britney+spears+parents". In some embodiments, a request to display a list of sources for the answer may be made by adding an additional parameter, such as "&fsrc=l" to the query URL. Thus, for the above URL, if the sources list for the answer to the query "britney spears parents" is desired, the query URL
may look like "http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=britney+spears+parents&fsrc=l ". In some embodiments, the link in the response including the answer, that triggers a request for the sources list of the answer wlien clicked on by the user, is the query URL for the user query with the addition of the additional parameter.
For example, a query for the terms "britney spears parents" may be represented by the URL
"http://www.google.com/search?h1=en&q=britney+spears+parents". In some embodiments, a request to display a list of sources for the answer may be made by adding an additional parameter, such as "&fsrc=l" to the query URL. Thus, for the above URL, if the sources list for the answer to the query "britney spears parents" is desired, the query URL
may look like "http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=britney+spears+parents&fsrc=l ". In some embodiments, the link in the response including the answer, that triggers a request for the sources list of the answer wlien clicked on by the user, is the query URL for the user query with the addition of the additional parameter.
[0072] In some other embodiments, the query engine 106 may accept, along with a factual query, a predefined special operator that instructs the query engine 106 to find an answer to the factual query and return the answer and a list of sources of the answer, without first returning a list of documents found using the query as input to a document search. For example, a user may enter "Z:X of Y," with "Z:" being the special operator, to instruct the query engine 106 to find answers to the factual query "X of Y" and list the sources of the answer. In a sense, use of the operator along with the query merges the query with a request for a list of sources of whatever answer may be found for the query. In some embodiments, the link in a response that generates a request to list the sources of the answer, as described above, adds the special operator to the original query and submits the query with the special operator to the query engine 106 when that linlc is selected (e.g., clicked) by the user.
[0073] Figure 6 illustrates an exemplary response, as presented to the user at client 102, to a factual query that includes the answer and results of a document search using the factual query as input, according to some embodiments of the invention. The response 600 may show a search box 602 with the original user query.
