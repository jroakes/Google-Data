Division explanation
The application belongs to the Chinese invention patent application No.201380042904.4's that the applying date is on June 20th, 2013
Divisional application.
Cross reference to related applications
This application claims to by reference by disclosure be fully incorporated in this, entitled MOBILE APPLICATION
MANAGEMENT, be filed on June 21st, 2012 No. 13/529,077 U. S. application priority.
Technical field
Present disclosure generally relates to the management to mobile application.
Background technology
Portable computing equipment (for example, smart phone, tablet computer etc.) is becoming increased popularity, powerful and complicated.
For example, multiple and different applications can be downloaded and be executed to modern smart phone, including smart phone user from online marketplace
Purchase or the specific application otherwise received.
In many instances, their particular device is used for personal and enterprise objective two by the user of portable computing equipment
Person.For example, user can access social networking application when leaving work, but it can use and specifically be guided into user
Employer at account email client.
Invention content
Present document relates to the groups that can be used for specifically defining via application on site market for making certain computer apply
System and technology.Typical application market can make thousands of applications can be used for downloading, and it is special that user can be allowed to search for
Calibration topic either button for seeing popular or new application of classification, selection or provide other such mechanism with
The application to their device downloads is may wish in reduction user.As described below, the system for operating application market
Certain user can be allowed to arrange one or more application in groups and be associated with the application of those groups and certain types of use
Family.
For example, the account for the entity can be established to application market with the associated cura specialis person of business entity.Pipe
Then reason person can determine which application should be possessed by the particular job person in business entity.For example, the IT at tissue
The committee can evaluate it is all possible apply offer, and determine sales department member should have a certain group
Using and the member of engineering department should have not same group of application.Certain applications in can be only in the expense of payment
It can use, and administrator can be with the account of associated entity and payments mechanism (for example, e-payment account or letter for entity
With card number), and can agree to that the employee of business entity will be by the bill payment of entity to the download of such application.It market can
It can for example be identified by the UI and API with providing user interface (UI) and Application Programming Interface (API), administrator to administrator
Group (for example, engineering and marketing), and the icon drag of specific application can will be represented to that in the representative business entity of UI
In the region of a little specific roles.Administrator can also optionally identify the specific user for undertaking such role, for example pass through mark
Know the e-mail address of each other users for the application for checking grouping for Entity Authorization and represents business entity's acquisition
It is paid using and by business entity.
In certain other situations, any member that administrator can simply generate by becoming available for and to the public shows
The group of the application gone out.For example, technology columnist can be and corresponding by his or his likes application packet into single group
The group can be then looked to the visit person in market.For example, the reader of columnist David Pogue can key in " Pogue "
As the search terms of the submission to market, and search result may include for playing the music from band Rogues
Using and can also include link, this is linked at when being selected by user and takes user to the page, which enumerates David
Pogue had previously been selected and the application of mark.User may then pass through the batch that is used to trigger that selection is shown on the page and download
The control of application executes such action.Any application in the application needs in the degree paid, and market can be to user
Display request, so that user confirms that he or she agreement allows the total value of payment (for example, the application of all payments is combined into
This) it charges to the personal account of user.If user not yet recently provides login certificate, system may also require that user carries
For such certificate.
Delivered for the administrator of business entity at business entity employee or other people it is online can under
In the example for carrying the group of application, such user can initially log in that (or they can previously have logged on, and then
The then region for being exclusively used in business entity in visit market).It is accessed in this way using their equipment in user
When line application market, the list of mobile application can be presented to user based on being associated with for user and business entity.They and enterprise
What the association of industry entity for example can be provided previously with their associated e-mail address of account with administrator by mark
E-mail address is matched and is identified.The association can also by mark for user Email (can by with
Act on to be formed and the certificate of the account in market) domain match and be determined for the domain that entity provides with administrator.Therefore, example
Such as, it is believed that anyone with "@company.com " e-mail address is the employee of " company ", and can recognize
For this, anyone is authorized to related application on site, these application on site previously the person of being managed be identified as by
The application that the employee of " company " provides.
It can also be filtered and be grouped with the application that ad hoc fashion opposite direction user is presented.For example, user can identify him
Either she role (such as by work title or user job in department or branch), and system can identify
Administrator had previously been selected as and the relevant application of the role.Discretely, administrator can be associated with when setting up account often
A user and role, once so that user accesses the role that application region is assured that user.It can be from user circle
The other parts in face visually detach the application for showing such based role in the region of (for example, via frame) to user, and
And optional control can be provided, the equipment currently logged in which will make all applications in group be downloaded to user.It can
To show other application in another area.For example, the role that can be determined with user can be shown in the region of separation
Relevant be normally applied (is answered for example, system determines to have with the similar characteristic of characteristic that is selected for the role by administrator
With) with indicate they can be related but it is the portion of the standard for the application supported by business entity " package " to also indicate that them not
Divide (and possible user needs oneself to be paid for them).Certain other applications can be the peculiar application of tissue.Therefore, although
First group of application can be that any user can be by the application specifically selected that visited market obtains, but can be with
The peculiar application of tissue is set to can only be used to the user with the certificate for specific business entity.Such application may include tissue
The certain applications developed for employee rather than for the people other than tissue of inside IT departments.Such application can be with
Market is uploaded to via administrator, just like uploading to public application, but administrator makes them be privately owned for business entity.
Another region can simply show other application in the market, for example, current most popular enterprise's application (can be different from by
To login market but it is not identified as the current most popular game shown in the associated other users of specific business entity).
Will be downloaded for using be used together certain data (from application detach) can also be by Admin Administration.Example
Such as, administrator can select to apply some contact management downloaded for each marketing employees in company.Discretely, it manages
Reason person can upload data file, which includes for the employee in sales department and the key client for company
With the contact data of customer contact.Administrator can be with the application in associated data and market, so that making connection in market
When being that people's application is downloaded to the equipment of user, it also makes contact data to show to contact to user when user starts application
The mode of personal data is downloaded.Other contents can also be provided the third to be downloaded by the member of the tissue of administrator by administrator
Fang Yingyong is used, such as the peculiar template of tissue for rendering and other such contents and other information.
Such technology can provide one or more advantage in some implementations.For example, tissue can be easy
Ground manages the application that its employee has downloaded from application on site market to their computing device, and can be easily pair
It needs the download of the application paid and pays and maintain that whom can be downloaded the safety of application.Tissue can also be controlled and be applied
The data downloaded together, or even when those applications are provided by third party (such as by commercial software development company).In addition, tissue
Such access without the market of master control and management own either other distribution mechanisms or website can be provided.Meanwhile
The employee of tissue can be allowed freely to add " non-tissue " application that they may wish to (although which can also be limited is other for tissue
Using can be downloaded when equipment possesses for tissue, for example, by prevent the game in the equipment that tissue possesses download or
All following applications are prevented, these applications, which are sought to access, may cause the device memory of safety worries or other particular devices
Assets).
Additionally, market can provide UI and/or API, and the UI and/or API allow administrator remotely to manage application, such as
For example allow Remote Installation/unloading application, such as Remote configuration application.In addition, UI and/or API can allow long range acquisition to collapse
It bursts and reports and other statistical data.The privately owned application execution that such action can be issued by administrator's opposite direction market, and market
It can remotely be interacted with non-private application in the market with limitation management person.

Example.
In the accompanying drawings, the full piece of similar label refers to similar elements.
Specific implementation mode
Fig. 1 shows the concept map of the example system 100 for implementing mobile application recommendation.In general, system 100 permits
Perhaps tissue easily to should tissue member using logging in online marketplace (example with the certificate of the weave connection of registration
Such as, either organized using the free email domain for tissue previously have identified as with its associated free email domain or completely
E-mail address logs in) when to can be used for the application of these members and (and be potentially served as the incidence number of these applications
According to) be identified and be grouped.
In the example of fig. 1, system 100 includes user equipment 102, application market server 104 and manager device
106.User equipment 102 is that the hand-held calculating used by the employee of specific business entity or other tissues (for example, company) is set
Standby (for example, smart phone).In general, user equipment 102 is multiduty, being used for serving personal and profession by employee needs
Both ask.In contrast, application market server 104 is the business system for including at least one server computing device, this is extremely
A few server computing device implements online software shop, which allows consumer to browse and to compatible meter
It calculates equipment (such as user equipment 102) and downloads mobile application and other operations.
Manager device 106 is also computing device, and provides interface 108 in the example present, which makes and spy
At least one tactful 110 can be defined (for example, being shown as currently stored by determining the individual (for example, IT administrators) of weave connection
In on application market server 104), which specifies at least one shifting for being installed on user equipment 102
Dynamic application is as the recommendation or requirement to employee.Such frame generally allows for specific organization's management in user equipment 102
The application of upper installation and employee without any configuration or sets up.Although referring to cura specialis person in this example, group
The multiple individuals knitted can be acted together to be accessed as foundation.It will be caught can be used for example, enterprise individual can identify
In the application of the member of tissue, and IT personnel can upload will when such member downloads and applies with application together to these at
The content that member provides.
For example, IT administrators can as " policy definition stage " part and optionally from general in interface 108
The multiple applications enumerated in pane 114 select specific mobile application 112 to arrive public window for placement (for example, via " drag and drop ")
One of lattice 116, privately owned pane 118 and filter pane 120.In the example present, mobile application 112 is placed into filter window
Lattice 120 effectively " pipe off mobile application 112 ", and in some implementations as discussed in further detail below
Temporarily, at least prevent the employee of tissue that mobile application 112 is such as downloaded to user equipment 102 like that.Administrator can also be by
According to classification (for example passing through the entry in final election application type list) (for example, specified be unable to download games or with adult
The application of content or the grading more than some rank cannot be downloaded to logs in market using certificate corresponding with tissue
Equipment) " piping off " will be applied.
In contrast, mobile application 112 is placed into public pane 116 and fills drawing to mobile application 112 to strategy 110
It is indicated as being the available mobile application of public land with (for example, unique application identifier) and by mobile application 112.In this example
In, the available mobile application of public land refers to that can be accessed (for example, not limiting by general public by application market server 104
Availability) and answered to the movement shown in them when the member of tissue carrys out visited market using the certificate with weave connection
With.
Mobile application 112 is placed into reference of the privately owned pane 118 also to 110 filling of strategy to mobile application 112.So
And in such example, mobile application 112 is indicated as being the available mobile application of demesne or by application market service
Device 104 only can be by the mobile application of the employees access (for example, availability of limitation) of the mandate of specific organization.In general, demesne
Available application be tissue IT administrators or another employee first before to passing (and in particular tissue and write) in the market
Application rather than otherwise will can be used for coming the common application of the people other than self-organizing.It is as discussed further below that
Specific mobile application is indicated as being the available mobile application of public land or the available mobile application of demesne is at least realized pair by sample
The logic itemization (itemization) of mobile application is arranged for being shown so as to employee on user equipment 202
It easily identifies and accesses.
It can be expressed and storage strategy 110 with various ways.For example, relational database can be stored in the spy for tissue
Determine being associated between certificate and account (for example, IT administrators can via for general IT departments email account (such asadmin@example.com) open and the account in market).It can also generate and other such account informations (such as electronics branch
The number of paying a bill and certificate, credit number and related payment information etc.) relationship.Database can also include table, the table and field
The list of storage and the application of the associated mark of ID number for tissue together, the application that field instruction specifically selects is
The application type (for example, privately owned either public) being placed to or other groupings.For example, field can indicate to be allowed to download
The title (for example, marketing, engineering etc.) of one or more group of specific application.Strategy 110 can also indicate that can be used for be in
Other factors existing and that then offer is used to be downloaded with above and mode discussed below.
Definition according to IT administrators and the part as " strategy implement stage ", can be to application market server 104
Strategy 110 (for example, as shown in fig. 1) is provided.Then, employee use the browser 122 provided by user equipment 102 or
When special market is applied to access online software shop, as implemented as application market server 104, application market service
Device 104 can be with coordination strategy 110 and employee and/or user equipment 102 (equipment is related with user account and by user account
When related to the account of tissue).For example, application market server 104 can be differentiated or be determined and employee and/or user equipment
102 associated at least one certificates, and then when determining certificate and weave connection by strategy 110 be linked to employee and/or
User equipment 102.
For example, when user makes browser 122 be directed toward the homepage in online software shop, browser 122 can be to using city
Field server 104 forwards the peculiar certificate of user.The peculiar certificate of user can be used for by application market server 104 by strategy 110
It is linked to employee and/or user equipment 102.For example, the peculiar certificate of user can correspond to be used for login user equipment by employee
102 user name/password combination is (for example, user name：Corporate e-mails address；Password：Company's entry password).With this side
Formula and as in further detail below describe as, user without configuration or set up (for example, to user equipment 102 download
With the application of installation separation) to access the list for the mobile application recommended by IT administrators.The pass of user account and tissue account
Connection can such as domain name by the tissue in the certificate of user or the certificate by user with by IT administrators in earlier stage
The certificate (for example, e-mail address) of offer is matched and is determined (although rank discussed here can be executed in various orders
Section, such as when IT administrators add new stories to the list of the employee for the tissue unique portion that would have access to market).
Continue this example, once application market server 104 is associated with strategy 110 and employee and/or user equipment 102,
First list 124 can at least be presented to employee in browser 122.In the example present, first list 124 may include
The mobile application previously specified in strategy 110 as described above by IT administrators.In some implementations, also may be used
To show second list 126 to employee in browser 122, it is included in usual when consumer's access application market server 104
Presented to them mobile application (for example, be displayed for checking once user reaches the homepage in online software shop " most
Popular " mobile application).
Then employee can optionally select the mobile application in first list 124 and second list 126 when being presented
In one or more mobile application for being installed to user equipment 102.For example, employee can select in browser 122
Control 128 in single movement (for example, via with finger " tapping " such as in the control of the interior display of browser 122, to make
At automatically downloading all applications in turn) download and installation first list 124 and second list 126 in mobile application in it is every
A mobile application.
Application market server 104 then can be as discussed in first list 124 in further detail below
Mobile application automatically charge to specific organization associated business account, and the movement in second list 126 is answered
It is charged with to the associated personal account of employee.Additionally, as noted above, the certificate for being used to charge to business account
Information can be provided previously via IT administrators or another administrator, which can have agreed in this process
Can for by it is qualified individual (for example, have the e-mail address of the internet domain come self-organizing it is all individual or
All individuals in the list for the e-mail address that person IT administrators provide to application market server 104) carry out it is any
It downloads and presents the bill to tissue.
It, can be with after the mobile application in first list 124 and second list 126 is for example installed to user equipment 102
Corresponding mobile application is organized as a list 132 and Enterprise Lists 134 in the desktop screen 130 of user equipment 102,
In each such group such as visually detached from another group by adding profile by the frame around each corresponding group.One
In a little realization methods, Enterprise Lists 134 can be divided into public list 136 and privately owned list 136.In such an example,
Public list 136 may include the available mobile application of public land or can be by general public by application market server 104
The mobile application of access.In contrast, privately owned list 138 can show the available mobile application of demesne mobile application or
Following mobile application, these mobile applications be by application market server 104 only can by specifically organize (for example, " BigCo,
Inc. the application that the employee (for example, this exemplary employee) of mandate ") accesses.In this way, the realization pair of example system 100
Personal and enterprise mobile application itemization or tissue are easy so as to employee for being shown on user equipment 102
Mark and access.
It can be changed to the specific application shown in user based on the role within the organization of the mark of user.As one
Example, administrator selection for allow can be used for tissue member's in application, administrator receive first select the selection answer
For member's subset.For example, administrator can select group of " marketing ", and then multiple applications of the selection for the group first
(for example, contact manager, travelling application etc.).Administrator may then switch to " engineering " group and select a number of other answer
With some applications in these applications can be identical as the application selected for marketing group and some can be different.Then, it manages
Member can be to the e-mail address of each of system banner Liang Ge departments.System can be using such mark to be associated with
E-mail address and the application identified for particular department, and logged in obtain in employee in application, they can provide
Then their e-mail address, these e-mail addresses can be used for being associated with their departments with their mark, simultaneously
And the application then selected for department with administrator.Although mark can also use other sides by the grouping of department here
Formula is grouped (for example, C grades of supervisors can be related to specific application set) to user, and the correlation can be across multiple dimensions
(for example, Marketing Supervisor vice-minister be shown and provided to Marketing Supervisor vice-minister all applications for being assigned to sales department and
All applications being responsible for for C grades).
Referring now to Fig. 2, the block diagram of the example system 200 for implementing mobile application recommendation is shown.In general, being
System 200 can be used for implementing to interact, such as interaction discussed above and below, for example mark is used for group at public application market
The member of the application and tissue knitted accesses such application identified.
System 200 includes user equipment 102, application market server 104 and the manager device 106 of Fig. 1.Show at this
In example, system 200 further includes at least one network 202.Network 202 is bidirectional data communication path, so that being
Data are transmitted among the unit of system 200.The example of such network includes multiple wireless or hardwire WAN, LAN, Yin Te
Any communication network in net or other packet-based communication networks.
In general, system 200 can implement the technology above with respect to Fig. 1 and below in relation to Fig. 3 to Fig. 6 discussion.However,
It may not imply to the structure of the component in a width figure or any restrictions of function for the component in other figures.
Example A
It combines referring to Figures 1 and 2, in an exemplary scene, and as the part in " strategy implement stage ", specific use
Family can be interacted with the browser 122 (or the machine application) on user equipment 102 to ask to access by application market server
Webpage (such as " the http of 104 management://application.marketplace.com”).Before application market server 104
End 204 can receive access request and can inquire the policy database 206 and entity data bak of application market server 104
One of 208 or the two with by user equipment 102 and 204 pre-registered specific business entity of warp-wise application market server
It is related.
In the example present, preceding and in the certificate authority information matches of corporate e-mails address and special entity
End 204 can inquire application market server 104 application databases 210 and can to 102 returned content of user equipment,
In the content include following information, information instruction mobile application can be used for downloading and installing to user equipment 102.For example, interior
Appearance may include may be selected icons association with one or more user and the data fetched from application database 210 and
Other data.Icon can be organized at least first list 124, and can be organized into some implementations
For display in the browser 122 on user equipment 102 in two lists 126.
It can be rendered by browser 122 in general, icon and control 128 may be selected in user.Control 128 optionally by
Can be with instantiation process when having had accessed specific user's selection in market, which downloads and is mounted on to user equipment 102
Each mobile application in the mobile application shown in first list 124 and second list 126.For example, and in response to selection
The front end 204 of control 128, application market server 104 can be received for downloading and being mounted on first list 124 and secondary series
The request of each mobile application in the mobile application shown in table 126, and can be to the application transmission request of selector 212.
In such an example, binary file data library 214 can be inquired using selector 212 and can be to mobile device 102
It returns and each mobile application associated application generation in the mobile application of display in first list 124 and second list 126

" policy definition stage ".The policy definition stage corresponds to following steps, and administrator can be for these steps of harvesting of tissue to mark
Knowledge should be filtered and be grouped so that can be used for the specific application of specific user corresponding with tissue.The strategy implement stage corresponds to
In following steps, these steps can be taken with to being identified as the specific user of user corresponding with tissue (for example, tissue
Employee, the employee have its domain by the e-mail address of organizational controls) such application selected is shown.
It is taken referring to figs. 1 to the user equipment of Fig. 2 102, application market with together with identical specific user and specific business entity
Business device 104 and manager device 106 describe corresponding process 300 and 318.However, described about instantiation procedure 300 and 318
Step can be added as appropriate by Different Individual and entity and in different types of system and/or equipment, again
New arrangement and execution.
Especially now with reference to Fig. 3 A, show and " the strategy implement stage " for the mobile application recommendation based on strategy
Corresponding first instantiation procedure 300.In general, such as being taken by application market using user equipment 102 to access in specific user
Be engaged in application on site market that device 104 implemented when, can be presented extremely to them based on being associated with for user and specific business entity
Few first movement list of application.In the example present, be based on by with the predefined note of the associated management entity of specific business entity
Record is either tactful to specific user's " showing " or " recommendation " first movement list of application.
For example, at 302, application market server 104 receives the online software for accessing application market server 104
The request in shop.For example, with the associated specific user of specific business entity (for example, " BigCo, Inc. ") (for example, " Broten,
Neal ") it can be interacted with the client application (for example, browser 122) of user equipment 102 with the addresses typing URL, the URL
It quotes and 104 associated main page of application market server location.In general, the request may include uniquely identifying user to set
For 102 and/or at least one certificate of the specific user of user equipment 102.
For example, at 302, the user company for being used for logining user equipment 120 can be provided to application market server 104
Part of the e-mail address as access request.In another example, network mark can be provided to application market server 104
Know part of the symbol as access request, the network identifier is specified to be operated by specific business entity and used by user equipment 102
Carry out one or more communication network of the resource of access networked.In the two examples, transmitted to application market server 104
Certificate is without the further input (for example, being inputted without any additional labor) from specific user.For example, being not necessarily to user
The application of separation is installed to user equipment 102 and/or logins other application to recommend work(from the mobile application of present disclosure
It can be benefited.In this way, specific user without additional configuration or sets up.
At 304, user equipment 102 is identified as and spy by application market server 104 based on the certificate received at 302
Determine business entity's association, the business entity is by registered in advance to application market server 104.For example, application market server 104
User can be compared to be used for logining the corporate e-mails address of user equipment 120 and be used for 104 note of application market server
Volume multiple business entities in each business entity certificate authority information with identify or determine user equipment 102 with it is specific
Business entity is associated with.In the example present, it in the certificate authority information matches of corporate e-mails address and special entity, uses
Family equipment 102 (and final specific user) is linked to special entity or and special entity by application market server 104
Link.
At 306, application market server 104 special entity is linked at 304 based on user equipment 102 come identify by
Individual (for example, IT administrators) recommends at least one mobile application for downloading and installing to user equipment 102.It is general and
Speech, this can correspond to 104 association user equipment 102 of application market server and at least one strategy, at least one strategy
By for user equipment 102 download and install one or more " user is peculiar " application (at 308) and/or one or
Multiple " group the is peculiar " applications of person are appointed as the recommendation to specific user (at 310).
For example, at 308, application market server 104 can be with associating policy (for example, strategy 110) and user equipment
102, which specifies the mobile application for recommending to the specific user as individual of user equipment 120.For example, IT is managed
Member can with definition strategy, the strategy include for particular individual and specifically build mobile application (for example, as shown in fig. 1
" tool of Neal ") to improve or enhance the ability of their work functions of the execution of the individual.
At 310, application market server 104 can with associating policy (for example, at 308 quote strategy it is identical or
The different strategy of person) with user equipment 102, which specifies the mobile application for recommending to individual packets, the specific user
It is the part of the individual packets or is associated with the individual packets.In the example present, individual packets can be based on common features
Or attribute (for example, work functions, enterprise units association etc.) is classified together.For example, IT administrators can with definition strategy,
The specified movement that " sale " team for alloing specific user to be associated with or other types of profession grouping is benefited of the strategy
Using.In this way, application market server 104 can identify the mobile application that can be used for specific user, these movements are answered
Using is as individual specific user distinctive (for example, " user is peculiar ") and is that the group that specific user is associated with is distinctive
(such as " group is peculiar ").
At 312, application market server 104 based at 310 identify mobile application come provide information for
Presented in the client application of user equipment 102 or by the client application, the information instruction mobile application can be used for
Family equipment 102 is downloaded and installation.It is closed for example, can be provided to user equipment 102 and icon may be selected with one or more user
The data of connection in the client application on user equipment 102 for presenting.In the example present, icon can be organized into
At least first category (for example, first list 124) and it is organized into second category in some implementations (for example, second
Classification 126), first category 124 includes by IT administrators mobile application previously specified at least one strategy, second category
126 include the mobile application typically exhibited to the consumer for accessing application market server 104.In the example present, second
The mobile application enumerated in classification is not specified in any specific policy by IT administrators, and is visited in consumer
The mobile application shown to them when the online software shop for asking application market server is (for example, the master in online software shop
The mobile application enumerated in segment " highest payment applications (Top Paid Apps) " of webpage).
At 314, application market server 104 receives one or more mobile application and is selected to use by specific user
It is provided using data (for example, executable text in the instruction downloaded and installed to user equipment 102, and to user equipment 102
Part) so that installing corresponding application to user equipment 102.For example, specific user can select in client application
Icon (for example, control 128) in individual part at 312 download and install every into the mobile application that user is presented
A mobile application.In another example, specific user can individually select that (for example, by voice command, for example " download is answered
With X ") specific mobile application in the mobile application presented to user in client application is under user equipment 102
It carries and installs.
316, application market server 104 can automatically report with the associated account of specific business entity and for
Mobile application being downloaded from application market server 104, being recommended by specific enterprise is (for example, enumerate in first list 124
Those mobile applications) to the account charge.In some implementations, application market server 104 can automatically report with
The associated personal account of specific user and for it is being downloaded from application market server 104 but what specific enterprise was not recommended
Mobile application (for example, the mobile application enumerated in second list 126) is charged to the personal account.As in further detail below
As description, application market server 104 can at 316 based on the associated at least one strategy of user equipment 102
One or more interior definition determines or differentiates personal account information and/or business account information.
Referring now to Fig. 3 B, the second instantiation procedure 318 for implementing mobile application recommendation is shown.As mentioned above
Like that, the second instantiation procedure 318 corresponds to " the policy definition stage " recommended for the mobile application based on strategy.It is general and
Speech, for example, can be for defining at least one note with the associated IT administrators of specific business entity (for example, " BigCo, Inc. ")
Record or strategy purpose and the dashboard interface (for example, interface 108) provided by manager device 106 is provided so that
It, can be with base in specific user's (for example, " Broten, Neal ") using user equipment 102 come when accessing application market server 104
At least first movement list of application is presented (for example, first list with being associated with to them for specific business entity in specific user
124)。
For example, at 320, IT administrators can create the reality with the associated strategy of specific user (for example, strategy 110)
Example, and it is associated with the strategy and specific business entity.For example, IT administrators can include at least one certificate in strategy, than
As specific user is used for logining the corporate e-mails address/password combination or network identifier of user equipment 120, the network
Identifier is specified to be operated by specific business entity and is accessed for (for example, via user equipment 102) by specific user various
One or more communication network of networking or online resource.In the example present, and as described above, exist
Certificate and specific business entity to 104 previous definition of application market server or the certificate authority information matches of supply when,
User equipment 102 (and final specific user) by application market server 104 be linked to special entity or with specific reality
Body links.
At 322, IT administrators can select one or more shifting from the multiple applications enumerated in dashboard interface
Application is moved for being placed in strategy.In general, this can correspond to IT administrators selection in strategy include (or
Person excludes) one or more " user is peculiar " application (at 324) and/or for including (or exclude) in strategy
One or more " group is peculiar " applies (at 326).
For example, 324, IT administrators can optionally from dashboard interface (for example, in general pane 114) arrange
The multiple applications lifted select specific mobile application (for example, mobile application 112) for being placed into one of following region：In instrument
In board interface with the associated first area of the available mobile application of public land (for example, public pane 116)；In dashboard interface
It is interior with the associated second area of the available mobile application of demesne (for example, privately owned pane 118)；And in dashboard interface
Be indicated as being by limited to user equipment download and install the associated third region of mobile application (for example, filter window
Lattice 120).
At 326, in contrast, IT administrators can be based on specific user and to based on common features or attribute
(for example, work functions) and be classified together the predefined associations of individual packets or appointment, to strategy filling movement
Using the recommendation as the specific user to user equipment 120.For example, IT administrators can be optionally from dashboard interface
The multiple groupings enumerated select specific cluster (for example, " sale ") for being placed into and the associated strategy of specific user.At this
In a little examples (at 322), IT administrators have the ability mark and with the associated strategy of specific user in fill mobile application, this
A little mobile applications are distinctive as individual specific user and are that the group that specific user is associated with is distinctive.
At 328, IT administrators can specify or be filled in strategy at least one account of presenting the bill, so as to
User equipment 102 is downloaded and any mobile application (for example, the part in the strategy implement stage as Fig. 3 A) of installation can be by
It properly charges and pays.For example, IT administrators can specify in the mobile application such as recommended by special entity (for example,
The mobile application specified in one list 124) it is downloaded and installed the corporation account to be charged when user equipment 102.Another
In example, IT administrators can specify in the mobile application that do not recommended by special entity (for example, being specified in second list 124
Mobile application) be downloaded and installed the personal account charged when user equipment 102.In this way, appropriate entity pair
It is presented the bill and is charged in the download of the mobile application of user equipment 102.
It, can be 104 turns to application market server at 330 and after being created with definition strategy at 320 to 328
Hair strategy so that specific user using user equipment 102 come access such as implemented by application market server 104 it is online
When application market (for example, the part in the strategy implement stage as Fig. 3 A), pass that can be based on user and specific business entity
It is associated in client application and at least first movement list of application (for example, first list 124) is presented to user.
Referring now to Fig. 4, the example administration interface for implementing mobile application recommendation is shown.Although not limitation in this way,
But describe example interface referring to figs. 1 to the user equipment of Fig. 3 102, application market server 104 and manager device 106.
Particularly, Fig. 4 particularly illustrates another example at the interface 108 provided by manager device 106.In the example present, show
Go out and business entity's " employee " Broten, Neal " associated tactful 402 including " privately owned application " row of BigCo, Inc. "
Table, " public application " list, " application of filtering " list and " department " list.In the example present, strategy 402 further includes " using
Family certificate " element and " account " element.In general, strategy 402 it is corresponding partly can by with business entity " BigCo,
Inc. " associated IT administrators definition or specified.Then, in employee, " Broten, Neal " are accessed using user equipment 102
When the online software market such as implemented by application market server 104, strategy 402 can be based on to " Broten, Neal " are " aobvious
It is existing " or " recommendation " one or more mobile application.
For example, " user certificate " element in strategy 402, which can be user, may be selected control, which may be selected control
Allow IT administrators to define when being selected by IT administrators and uniquely identifies user equipment 102 and/or employee " Broten, Neal "
At least one certificate (for example, corporate user's name/password combination).In the example present, " Broten, Neal " use user
Equipment 102 is come when accessing application market server 104, application market server 104 can match card as discussed above
Book be used for business entity's " certificate authority information (for example, unique identifier) of BigCo, Inc. ".
Similarly, " account " entry in strategy 402 can be that control may be selected in user, which may be selected control and exist
Allowing IT administrators to define application market server 104 when being selected by IT administrators can be " Broten, Neal " be set to user
Standby 102 download and install the business account and/or personal account charged when mobile application.For example, can be to " BigCo, Inc. "
Business account opposite direction user equipment 102 download and installation by business entity " BigCo, Inc. " recommend mobile application (for example,
The mobile application enumerated in first list 124) charge, and can be to " Broten, Neal " personal account opposite direction user set
What is downloaded and install for 102 is not that " mobile application that BigCo, Inc. " recommend is (for example, in second list 126 by business entity
The mobile application inside enumerated) charge.
Additionally, IT administrators can select one or more movement enumerated in first pane 404 at interface 108
Using for placement (for example, via " drag and drop ") to strategy 402 in " privately owned application " list, " public application " list or
One of " application of filtering " list.For example, IT administrators can select mobile application " angry bird " simultaneously from the first pane 404
And this application is placed in " application of filtering " list in strategy 402 so that this mobile application " is effectively included in black name
It is single " or prevent this mobile application " Broten, Neal " are using user equipment 102 to access application market server 104
When be " exposed " or " showing " give he.These are prevented to apply since mobile application to be placed into " application of filtering " list
" it is exposed to him when the feature of Broten, Neal " browse application marketplace server 104, so in the example present, will move
It is placed into " application of filtering " list using " angry bird " and temporarily, at least prevents that " Broten, Neal " are to user equipment
102 download and install this mobile application.For example, IT administrators can determine that mobile application " angry bird " is things of diverting one's attention
And it can prevent that " Broten, Neal " have productivity in his work.
With with by the mobile application enumerated in the first pane 404 be placed into strategy 402 in " application of filtering " list
Similar mode can select other mobile applications for being placed into " privately owned application " list and " public as desired
Using " list.In such example, IT administrators provide for user equipment 102 download and install one or it is more
A " user is peculiar " application is used as to " the recommendation of Broten, Neal ".As discussed in further detail below, IT administrators
Can also provide one or more " group peculiar " application for downloading and installing to user equipment 102 as to " Broten,
The recommendation of Neal ".

In existing mode, search control 406 can be used for the mobile application that opposite application market server 104 is registered by IT administrators to carry out
Positioning.For example, IT administrators can select (for example, by " give directions and click ") search control 406 (not show in the text field
Going out) interior one or more key word item (for example, " sales applications ") of typing is with to the inquiry of application market server 104 and one
Or multiple associated mobile applications of key word item.In general, can be enumerated in the first pane 404 result of inquiry with
It is optionally selected in the interior placement of strategy 402 in by IT administrators.
In contrast, uploading control 408 can be used for optionally providing one to application market server 104 from IT administrators
A or multiple mobile applications.For example, IT administrators can select uploading control 408 and navigate to file path (for example,
c:Binaries Neals.Tool.apk) to upload specific mobile application to application market server 104.In this example
In, the mobile application of upload can be automatically enumerated in the first pane 404 for being selected by IT administrators or can be down to
(for example, via search control 406) can be found for the optional filling for example in strategy 402 by IT administrators less.
In the example of fig. 4, interface 108 further includes the second pane 410 and third pane 412.In general, the second pane
410 and third pane 412 can optionally by IT administrators be used for define (for example, via second pane 410) can be based on public affairs
One or more individual packets for being total to characteristic or attribute (for example, work functions) and being classified together.IT administrators are right
After can be associated with (for example, via third pane 412) one or more mobile application and particular individual and be grouped, and then may be used
Selection of land selects specific cluster (for example, " sale ") for " department " list being for example placed into strategy 402.For example, IT is managed
Reason person can select first in the second pane 410 to be grouped control 414 (for example, by " give directions and click "), the first grouping control
Part 414 allows IT administrators to define " sale " grouping in the second pane 410 and to " sale " group padding and business entity
" one or more associated employee of BigCo, Inc. " (for example, " Broten, Neal ").
Synergistically, IT administrators can select the second packet control 416 in third pane 412, the second packet control
416, which allow IT administrators to define " sale " in third pane 412, is grouped.Then IT administrators can optionally select at interface
One or more mobile application enumerated in 108 the first pane 404 arrives third for placement (for example, by " drag and drop ")
" sale " grouping in pane 412.For example, can be answered to " sale " group padding " proposal " mobile application and " Sybase " movement
With.In the example present, these corresponding mobile applications can be determined as potentially being beneficial to enterprise's reality via IT administrators
Body " employee's (for example, with back work achievement) of the usually participation " sale " of BigCo, Inc. ".Then, IT administrators can be with
From one of the second pane 410 and third pane 412 selection " sale " grouping for placement (for example, via " drag and drop ") to strategy
" department " list in 402.In such example, in employee, " Broten, Neal " are accessed such as by application market IT administrators
