- the search system 114 can be implemented on the client device 104 , for example, if a user installs an application that performs searches on the client device 104 .
- the client device 104 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 106 , for storing instructions and data and a processor 108 for executing stored instructions.
- the memory can include both read only and writable memory.
- a user 102 can use the client device 104 to submit a query 110 to a search system 114 .

- the term “database” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data: the data does not need to be structured in any particular way, or structured at all, and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more locations.
- the index database 122 can include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently.
- the term “engine” will be used broadly to refer to a software based system or subsystem that can perform one or more specific functions. Generally, an engine will be implemented as one or more software modules or components, installed on one or more computers in one or more locations. In some cases, one or more computers will be dedicated to a particular engine; in other cases, multiple engines can be installed and running on the same computer or computers.
- the search engine 130 identifies resources that satisfy the query 110 .
- the search engine 130 will generally include an indexing engine 120 that indexes resources, an index database 122 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 152 or other software that generates scores for the resources that satisfy the query 110 and that ranks the resources according to their respective scores.
- the search system 114 also includes or can communicate with a score modification engine 140 that generates modification factors that are applied to initial scores generated by the search engine 130 for resources that match the query 110 .
- the score modification engine 140 can generate the scores based at least in part on modification data that associates a respective modification factor with each of a number of multiple groups of resources.
- the modification data is stored in a repository accessible to the system, e.g., modification factor database 150 .
- a group of resources is a portion of the resources on the Internet.
- a group can be defined in any of a variety of ways.
- An address-based group of resources is a group of resources that is defined by the Internet addresses, e.g., Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), of the resources in the group.
- a group of resources can include each resource that can be accessed using a particular domain name. That is, the group could include http://www.domain.com/resource1, http://www.domain.com/resource2, http://www.domain.com/resourceN, and so on, without regard to when the resources first become available to the search engine 130 for indexing.
- a group of resources can include each resource that can be accessed using a particular host name, e.g., http://host.example.com/resource1, http://host.example.com/resource2, http://host.example.com/resourceN, and so on.
- Other address-based groupings are possible.
- a particular group can include only a portion of the resources that can be accessed using a particular host name or a particular domain name.
- a particular group may include resources that can be accessed using one domain name and other resources that can be accessed using another domain name. Generating a modification factor for a group of resources, and in particular for an address-based group of resources, will be described below with reference to FIGS. 3-5 .
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for adjusting an initial score for a resource identified by search results for a received search query.
- the process 200 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 200 .
- the system receives data identifying a resource, e.g., a resource identifier of some kind, and an initial score for the resource (step 202 ).
- the initial score is generated for the resource as a response to a received search query.
- the initial score can be, e.g., a measure of the relevance of the resource to the search query, a measure of the quality of the resource, or both.
- the system identifies an address-based group of resources to which the resource belongs (step 204 ).
- the system can identify the group of resources to which the resource belongs based on the URL by which the resource is accessed.
- the group can be resources that share the same domain name or resources that share the same host name.
- the system accesses modification data to obtain a group-based modification factor for the group of resources to which the resource belongs (step 206 ).
- the modification data is stored in a repository of modification data, e.g., modification factor database 150 of FIG. 1 .
- the modification data can include data that associates a respective modification factor with each of a number of groups. Generating a respective modification factor for each of a number of groups of resources will be described below with reference to FIGS. 3-5 .
- the system generates a resource-specific modification factor for the resource based on the group-based modification factor (step 208 ).
- the system can adjust the group-based modification factor based one or more query-specific factors to generate the resource-specific modification factor for the resource. Generating a resource-specific modification factor based on a group-based modification factor will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 6 .
- the system applies the resource-specific modification factor to the initial score for the resource (step 210 ).
- the resource-specific modification factor can be a multiplicative factor applied to the initial score to generate a modified score for the resource.
- the search results generated in response to the search query can then be ranked according to modified scores for the respective resources identified by the search results.
- the modified scores can be further adjusted before the search results are ranked and transmitted to a client device for presentation.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for determining a modification factor for a group of resources.
- the process 300 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 300 .
- the process 300 is performed for each of a number of groups of resources.
- the system determines, e.g., from a record of click data, a count of unique clicks on search results identifying resources in the group (step 302 ).
- the clicks are made by users on search results provided to the users by the system.
- the system can count unique clicks in a number of ways. For example, the system can count, as a unique click on a group of resources, a click by a unique user on a search result that identifies a resource in the group of resources.
- the system can use any of a variety of criteria to determine when a click occurs.
- the system can treat as a click any user action made with respect to a search result that initiates a request for the resource identified by the search result, e.g., a cursor click on a URL of a resource in the search result in a graphical user interface of a web browser.
- the system can further require that the user's viewing of the resource be for a minimum threshold length of time, which threshold can optionally depend on the type of the resource, the length of the resource, measured in time for a media resource or words for a text resource, or both.
- the selection of a search result is referred to by this specification as a “click,” the selection can also be a voice-based selection, or a selection by a user's finger on a presence-sensitive input mechanism, e.g., a touch-screen device, or any other appropriate selection mechanism.
- a click on a search result that identifies a resource in a group is counted as a unique click on the group only if the user making the click has not previously clicked on any search result identifying any resource in the group.
- the system can determine whether a user is unique, i.e., whether the user has previously selected a search result identifying a resource in the group of resources, using conventional techniques, e.g., based on an identifier of a cookie or a login identifier. That is, for example, only one click for each cookie identifier is counted as a unique click on a group of resources.
- the count of unique clicks can be determined over a specified time period or, alternatively, each unique click recorded in the data available to the system can be included in the count of unique clicks.
- the system determines, e.g., from the record of click data, a count of repeat clicks on the group of resources (step 304 ).
- the system can determine which clicks made by users on search results provided to the users by the system count as repeat clicks in a number of ways. For example, a user can submit a search query and click on one or more of the search results provided to the user in response to the search query. The user may later submit the same search query during a different search session and click on a search result that identifies the same resource as one of those identified by the search results the user previously clicked on. The system can count the later click on that resource as a repeat click on the group of resources to which that resource belongs.
- a click by the user on a search result that identifies a resource that is not the same as any of the resources identified by search results previously clicked on by the user is not counted as a repeat click.
- the system can count a click by a user on a search result that identifies a resource and is provided to the user in response to a search query as a repeat click only if the same user has previously clicked on a search result identifying the same resource after submitting the same query during a previous search session.
- the click is counted as a repeat click on the group of resources to which the resource belongs.
- Two queries are considered to be the same if the text of the two queries, as submitted by the user and without modification by the search engine, matches.
- the system can use any of a variety of criteria for determining whether two clicks occurred during different search sessions. For example, the system can count two clicks as occurring during different search sessions if the time between the two clicks exceeds a predetermined threshold time.
- the system counts only one click from any given user as a repeat click on a group of resources, e.g., if the same user has submitted multiple clicks that would be considered repeat clicks for the group of resources, only one of those clicks is used in the count of repeat clicks on the group of resources.
- the count of repeat clicks can be determined over a specified time period or each repeat click recorded in the data available to the system can be included in the count of repeat clicks.
- the system generates a repeat click fraction for the group of resources (step 306 ).
- the repeat click fraction RCF
- RCF repeat click fraction
- RCF RC UC , where RC is the number of repeat clicks counted for the group of resources and UC is the number of unique clicks counted for the group of resources.
- the system uses the repeat click fraction to determine the modification factor for the group (step 308 ).
- the sigmoid function can output a value between a base value and 1.0, inclusive.
- the base value is the greatest reduction in initial score that the system will apply based on the RCF.
- the base value can be, e.g., a value greater than zero and less than or equal to 0.50, e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5, and can be determined heuristically, e.g., based on possible ranges of values of the initial scores to which the modification factor is to be applied. For example, if the base value is 0.1, the system will reduce the initial score to no less than 10% of its previous value. In these and other cases, the use of a sigmoid function is described. However, other functions mapping input values to a limited range of values, e.g., the range between the base value and 1.0, inclusive, can be used.
- the system considers factors in addition to the repeat click fraction when determining modification factors for groups of resources.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for determining a modification factor for each of a group of resources.
- the process 400 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 400 .
- the process 400 is performed for each of a number of groups of resources.
- the system obtains a count of the number of deliberate visits to a group of resources (step 402 ).
- a deliberate visit occurs when a user directly accesses a resource in the group of resources, e.g., without clicking on a link to the resource included in a separate resource.
- Examples of requests for a resource that can be considered deliberate visits are requests that are initiated by a user directly inputting the resource locator of the resource, e.g., into an address bar of a web browser, and requests that are initiated by a user selecting a saved reference to the resource, e.g., a bookmark that leads to the resource.
- the system obtains a count of the number of search result visits to the group of resources (step 404 ).
- a search result visit occurs when a user initiates a request for a resource in the group of resources by clicking on a search result that identifies the resource.
- the system generates a deliberate visit fraction for the group of resources (step 406 ).
- the deliberate visit fraction can be expressed as:
- DVF DV SRV , where DV is the number of deliberate visits counted for the group and SRV is the number of search result visits counted for the group.
- the system uses the deliberate visit fraction to generate the modification factor for the group (step 408 ).
- the system can combine the sigmoid function for the repeat click fraction for the group with a sigmoid function for the deliberate visit fraction.
- the modification factor computed based on the repeat click fraction for the group and the deliberate visit function for the group (M RCF,DVF ) can be expressed as
- DVF S RCF ⁇ ( RCF ) + S DVF ⁇ ( DVF ) 2
- S DVF is a sigmoid function that takes as an input the deliberate visit fraction for the group of resources, which will be a value between 0 and infinity.
- the sigmoid function S DVF outputs a value between a base value and 1, inclusive. The base value is the greatest reduction in initial score that the system will apply based on the DVF.
- the base value can be, e.g., a value greater than zero and less than or equal to 0.50, e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5, and can be determined heuristically, e.g., based on possible ranges of values of the initial scores to which the modification factor is to be applied, on possible ranges of S RCF (RCF), or both.
- the base value for S DVF can be the same value as or a different value from the base value for S RCF .
- the two terms may be added together and then multiplied by a different fraction, e.g., one third or one fourth, or the two terms may be multiplied together to generate the modification factor for the group.
- the repeat click fraction may be determined to be a better indicator of the quality of a group of resources than the deliberate visit fraction.
- the deliberate visit fraction may be determined to be a better indicator of the quality of a group of resources than the repeat click fraction.
- the computation of the modification factor can be adjusted so that the sigmoid function for the repeat click fraction (S RCF (RCF)) is weighted differently than the sigmoid function for the deliberate visit fraction.
- the value of w can be a value between 0.5 and 1.
- the value of w can be a value between 0 and 0.5.
- M RCF,DVF min( w ⁇ S RCF (RCF)+(1 ⁇ w ) ⁇ S DVF (DVF)+ w ⁇ S RCF 1 (RCF),1), where w is the weight and S 1 RCF (RCF) is a second sigmoid function that takes as input the RCF of the group of resources and is defined such that, for an assigned weight w: w ⁇ S RCF (RCF)+(1 ⁇ w ) ⁇ S DVF (DVF)+ w ⁇ S RCF 1 (RCF) ⁇ 1 if RCF ⁇ T, where T is a predetermined threshold value.
- additional terms can be added in calculating the modification factor in order to protect some groups of resources from excessive modification.
- additional terms is described below with reference to FIG. 5 .
- Other uses of optional terms are possible.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process 500 for determining a modification factor for a group of resources.
- the process 500 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 500 .
- the process 500 is performed for each of a number of groups of resources.
- the system obtains a value of an average duration metric for the group of resources (step 502 ).
- the average duration metric for a group of resources is a statistical measure computed from a data set of measurements of the length of time that elapses between the time that users click on a search result included in a search results web page that identifies a resource in the group of resources and the time that the user navigates back to the search results web page.
- the duration measured for any given click is capped at a pre-determined maximum value.
- the predetermined maximum value can be, e.g., five minutes, ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes, or one hour.
- the system obtains a value of a group-specific query metric for the group of resources (step 504 ).
- the group-specific query metric for a group of resources is a metric that measures the quality of the group of resources based in part on how many queries that reference the group of resources have been submitted to a search engine.
- a query that references the group of resources can be, for example, a query that specifies that search results generated in response to the query should identify only resources from the group of resources or from a subset of the group of resources.
- the group-specific query metric (GS) can be expressed as:
- GS max ⁇ ( s - a , 0 ) ⁇ b q c , where s is the number of queries that reference a resource in the group of resources, q is the number of unique queries for which a search result identifying a resource in the group of resources received a click, and a, b, and c are suitable constants.
- the value of a may be a value between 5 and 30, e.g., 10, 15, or 20
- the value of b may be a value between 500 and 2000, e.g., 750, 1000, or 1500
- the value of c may be a value between 0.65 and 0.95, e.g., 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9.
- the system uses the average duration metric and the group-specific query metric values to determine the modification factor for the group (step 506 ). For example, the system can adjust the modification factor for the group determined using the deliberate visit fraction and the repeat click fraction based on a protection factor (PF) derived from the value of the average duration metric (AD) for the group and the value of the group-specific query metric (GS) for the group.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of an example process for generating a resource-specific modification factor for a resource.
- the process 600 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 600 .
- the process 600 can be performed for each of a number of resources in response to a search query received from a user.
- the system determines whether the received query is navigational to the resource (step 602 ). For example, the system can determine that a query is navigational to a resource if the query references the resource.
- a query can reference the resource if, e.g., the query includes a term referencing the resource locator of the resource, e.g., if the query includes all or part of the resource locator of the resource. For example, for the resource “www.examplesite.com,” a received query “news event examplesite” may be considered to be navigational to the resource.
- the system can determine whether the received query is navigational to the resource by accessing data that characterizes the query as either navigational or not navigational to the resource.
- the system determines not to modify the initial score for the resource (step 608 ). That is, the system applies a modification factor to the initial score that does not alter the value of the initial score (e.g., if the modification factor is multiplicative, the system can set the value of the modification factor to one).
- a modification factor to the initial score that does not alter the value of the initial score (e.g., if the modification factor is multiplicative, the system can set the value of the modification factor to one).
- the system determines whether the initial score for the resource is below a first threshold value (step 604 ).
- the initial score for the resource is generated by a search engine in response to the query and can be, e.g., a measure of the relevance of the resource to the search query. If the initial score for the resource is below the first threshold value, the system determines not to modify the initial score for the resource (step 608 ). For example, if the initial score for the resource is below the first threshold value, e.g., 0.65, it may not be desirable to modify the initial score because it is already low relative to the initial scores for other resources.
- the first threshold value e.g. 0.65
- the system determines whether the initial score is below a second, higher threshold value (step 606 ). If the initial score is below the second threshold, the system generates a first modification factor to be applied to the initial score (step 610 ). For example, if the modification factor is multiplicative, the first modification factor ⁇ 1 can be expressed as:
- T 1 the first threshold value
- IS the initial score
- M the group-based modification factor for the group of resources to which the resource belongs.
- the system If the initial score is not below the second threshold value, the system generates a second modification factor to be applied to the initial score (step 612 ).
- the second modification factor can be computed based on the first modification factor. For example, if the modification factor is multiplicative, the second modification factor ⁇ 2 can be expressed as:
- f 2 f 1 log T 2 ⁇ ( IS ) ⁇ g ⁇ ( f 1 ) , where T 2 is the second threshold value and g( ⁇ 1 ) is a smoothing function that reduces the effect of the second modification factor on the initial score for particular ranges of values of the first modification factor.
- the smoothing function can be defined so that, if the first modification factor exceeds a threshold value, the second modification factor, when applied to the initial score, has a muted effect or no effect on the value of the initial score.
- g ⁇ ( f 1 ) ( 1 - f 1 ) 1 - P , if ⁇ ⁇ f 1 > Q , where Q is a predetermined threshold value.
- the system can set ⁇ 2 equal to ⁇ 1 to avoid the value of ⁇ 2 being greater than ⁇ 1 or the value of ⁇ 2 being undefined.

M RCF,DVF=min(w·S RCF(RCF)+(1−w)·S DVF(DVF)+w·S RCF 1(RCF),1),
where SDVF is a sigmoid function that takes as an input the deliberate visit fraction for the group of resources, where w is a constant value, and where S1 RCF(RCF) is a second sigmoid function that takes as input the RCF of the particular group and is defined so that:
w·S RCF(RCF)+(1−w)·S DVF(DVF)+w·S RCF 1(RCF)≧1 if RCF≧T,
where T is a predetermined threshold value.

wherein SAD,GS(AD,GS) is a surface sigmoid function that takes as input the values of the average duration metric and group-specific query metric.
where RC is the number of repeat clicks counted for the group of resources and UC is the number of unique clicks counted for the group of resources.
M RCF =S RCF(RCF),
where SRCF(RCF) is a sigmoid function that takes as an input the RCF for the group of resources, which will be a value between 0 and 1, inclusive. The sigmoid function can output a value between a base value and 1.0, inclusive. The base value is the greatest reduction in initial score that the system will apply based on the RCF. The base value can be, e.g., a value greater than zero and less than or equal to 0.50, e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5, and can be determined heuristically, e.g., based on possible ranges of values of the initial scores to which the modification factor is to be applied. For example, if the base value is 0.1, the system will reduce the initial score to no less than 10% of its previous value. In these and other cases, the use of a sigmoid function is described. However, other functions mapping input values to a limited range of values, e.g., the range between the base value and 1.0, inclusive, can be used.
where DV is the number of deliberate visits counted for the group and SRV is the number of search result visits counted for the group.
where SDVF is a sigmoid function that takes as an input the deliberate visit fraction for the group of resources, which will be a value between 0 and infinity.

where w is a value between 0 and 1, inclusive, and is the weight assigned to the sigmoid function for the repeat click fraction. In a situation where it is desirable for the value of SRCF(RCF) to have more influence on the modification factor than the value of SDVF(DVF), the value of w can be a value between 0.5 and 1. Alternatively, where it is desirable for the value of SDVF(DVF) to have more influence on the modification factor, the value of w can be a value between 0 and 0.5.

where T is a predetermined threshold value.
where s is the number of queries that reference a resource in the group of resources, q is the number of unique queries for which a search result identifying a resource in the group of resources received a click, and a, b, and c are suitable constants. For example, the value of a may be a value between 5 and 30, e.g., 10, 15, or 20, the value of b may be a value between 500 and 2000, e.g., 750, 1000, or 1500, and the value of c may be a value between 0.65 and 0.95, e.g., 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9.
PF=S AD,GS(AD,GS),
where SAD,GS(AD,GS) is a surface sigmoid function that takes as input the values of the average duration metric and group-specific query metric and outputs a value in a range of zero to one, inclusive.
M=M RCF,DVF+PF,
so that the modification determined based on the repeat click-factor and the deliberate visit fraction is adjusted by the protection factor derived from the values of the average duration metric and the group-specific query metric.
where T1 is the first threshold value, IS is the initial score, and M is the group-based modification factor for the group of resources to which the resource belongs. Thus, if the initial score for the resource is between the first and second threshold values, e.g., between 0.65 and 10, the system applies a modification factor that decreases as the initial score increases.
where T2 is the second threshold value and g(ƒ1) is a smoothing function that reduces the effect of the second modification factor on the initial score for particular ranges of values of the first modification factor. For example, the smoothing function can be defined so that, if the first modification factor exceeds a threshold value, the second modification factor, when applied to the initial score, has a muted effect or no effect on the value of the initial score. In some implementations, the smoothing function is defined as a piecewise function, so that:
