For example, if the most recent and highest signal strength is associated with a first location, the first location may be determined as the location of the object. In another example, decreasing signal strength over a time period from a first location and an increasing signal strength over the same time period at a second location may result in a determination of the second location as the location of the object.

- 1. Field of the Invention
- This invention relates generally to computer-implemented searches and, more particularly, to locating real-world objects using such searches.
- 2. Description of the Related Art
- Small real-world objects, such as keys, remotes, smartphones, and the like are small and easily misplaced. A user of such objects may forget the previous location of the object and may be unable to locate the missing object via searching or memory. Such problems may occur even if the user typically spends most of the day in the same locations, such as a residence, a workplace, and so on. Although existing electronic location devices exist, these devices use significant amount of power. Moreover, existing electronic location devices are often too large to attach to a small real-world object such as keys. Attaching these location devices to real-world objects may make the objects bulky and reduce portability and convenience.
- Various embodiments of system, methods, and computer-readable media for locating a real-world object are provided. In some embodiments, a computer-implemented method for location a real-world object is provided. The method includes receiving over a network, at a search engine, a search query from a user device for a real-world object, the search engine configured to search digital documents accessible over a network and obtaining, via one or more processors, an identifier of a transmitter associated with the real world object.

- Additionally, in some embodiments, a non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium having executable computer code stored thereon for locating a real-world object is provided. The code includes a set of instructions that causes one or more processors to perform the following: receiving over a network, at a search engine, a search query from a user device for a real-world object, the search engine configured to search digital documents accessible over a network and obtaining, via one or more processors, an identifier of a transmitter associated with the real world object. Additionally, the code further includes instructions that cause one or more processors to perform the following: determining from location data, via one or more processors, the location of the real world object, the location data including one or more locations and a plurality of signal strengths and providing, via one or more processors, the location of the real world object to the user device in response to the search query.
- Further, in some embodiments a system for locating a real-world object is provided. The system includes a transmitter configured to be coupled to a real-world object, the transmitter configured to transmit a signal including an identifier and a receiver associated with a user device, the receiver configured to receive the signal. Additionally, the system includes a server having one or more processors and a non-transitory tangible memory accessible by the one or more processors and having executable computer code stored thereon. The code includes a set of instructions that causes one or more processors to perform the following: receiving over a network, at a search engine, a search query from a user device for the real-world object, the search engine configured to search digital documents accessible over a network and obtaining, via one or more processors, the identifier. The code further includes a set of instructions that causes one or more processors to perform the following: determining from location data, via one or more processors, the location of the real world object, the location data including one or more locations and a plurality of signal strengths and providing, via one or more processors, the location of the real world object to the user device in response to the search query.

It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but to the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
- As discussed in more detail below, provided in some embodiments are systems, methods, and computer-readable media for locating a real-world object using a computer-implemented search engine. A real-world object may be coupled to a transmitter that periodically transmits signals having an identifier. A user device having a location may include a received that detects such signals and stores the detected identifier and signal strengths. Upon determining changes in the signal strengths of received signals from a real-world object transmitter, the user device may send the identifier, the location, and the signal strengths to a location server. The location server may store and maintain an identifier and associated locations and signal strengths.
- If a user loses the real-world object, the user may submit a query for the location of the real-world object to a computer-implemented search engine. The computer-implemented search engine may search digital documents, such as webpages on the World Wide Web (WWW) via a search index. Upon receiving the query for the location of the real-world object, the search engine may send a request to the location server for the location of the real-world object. The location server may obtain the identifier corresponding to the real-world object and determine the location of the real-world object based on the stored signal strengths and locations. For example, if the most recent and highest signal strength is associated with a first location, the first location may be determined as the location of the object. In another example, decreasing signal strength over a time period from a first location and an increasing signal strength over the same time period at a second location may result in a determination of the second location as the location of the object. The determined location of the real-world object is send to the search engine. The search engine may send the determined location of the real-world object to the user in response to the search query. The location may be a geographic location identified by coordinates or on a computer-generated geographic map, or the location may be a user-assigned name (e.g., “My Home Office”).

FIG. 1 depicts asystem 100 for location real-world objects (e.g., object 102) using computer-implemented searching in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown inFIG. 1 , the real-world object 102 may include or be coupled to atransmitter 104 and amicrocontroller 106. Thetransmitter 104 transmitssignals 108 to a user device 110 having or coupled to areceiver 112 and amicrocontroller 114. As described below, the user device 110 may also include adetermined location 116 used in processing the location of the real-world object 102. Thesystem 100 also includes anetwork 118, a mobile user device 120, alocation service 122, location data 124, and asearch engine 126. As described further below, the location of the real-world object 102 may be searched for using, for example, the mobile user device 120 to send a search query to thesearch engine 126 via thenetwork 118. - As shown in
FIG. 1 , the user devices 110 and 120, theserver 122, and thesearch engine 126 may be in communication with thenetwork 118, such as through a network interface having a cellular antenna, a wireless Ethernet antenna, etc. In some embodiments, thenetwork 118 may include multiple networks, such as a wireless Ethernet network, a cellular network, or other wireless networks. Moreover, it should be appreciated that the user devices 110 and 120, theserver 122, and thesearch engine 126 may each communicate over additional and different networks. For example, the mobile user device 120 may communicate over thenetwork 314 and a cellular network. In another example, thesearch engine 126 andlocation server 122 may communicate between each other over a different network thannetwork 118. - The real-
world object 102 may include any real-world object for which a user desires to locate. For example, the real-world object 102 may include a key or set of keys, a remote, jewelry, a book, a wallet, a purse, or other suitable real-world objects. In some embodiments, a user may register the real-world object 110 with thelocation server 122, such as by assigning a name to the object 110 and identifying the transmitter (e.g., via a transmitter identifier) associated with the object 110. For example, thelocation server 122 may store and maintain a list of real-objects and identifiers associated with a user of the user device 110. - The
microcontroller 106 may control and monitor the state of thetransmitter 104 and the various transmissions sent therefrom. Thetransmitter 104, themicrocontroller 106, or both may include a battery for providing power to such components. Thetransmitter 104 may transmit thesignal 108 having a unique identifier according to a specified frequency. In between such transmissions, thetransmitter 104 may enter a low power state to conserve battery. Thetransmitter 104 may implement any suitable technology or protocol, such as active Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), passive RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, NFC, any other suitable technology and protocol, or combination thereof. - The
receiver 112 may be included in or coupled to the user device 110. For example, in some embodiments the user device 110 may include a personal computer, and thereceiver 112 andmicrocontroller 114 may be a peripheral device coupled to the user device 110 via a suitable interface (e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), Firewire, Thunderbolt, etc.). In some embodiments, thereceiver 112 may be controlled by a central processing unit (CPU) of the user device 110 and the user device 110 may not include or be coupled to themicrocontroller 114. Thereceiver 112 may implement various suitable technologies and protocols, including RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, NFC, or any other suitable technology, protocol, or combination thereof. Upon detection of thesignal 108, thereceiver 112 may obtain an identifier (e.g., transmitter identifier) and the strength of the received signal. - The user device 110 may include an
object detection program 130 that obtains received unique identifiers and signal strengths and maintains a log of received unique identifiers and signal strengths. Theobject detection program 130 may monitor the log for changes in received signal strengths. Upon detection of a change in received signal strengths, theobject detection program 130 may send all subsequent received unique identifiers and signal strengths to thelocation server 122 via thenetwork 118, as described below and illustrated inFIG. 2 . Additionally, theobject detection program 130 may send thelocation 116 of the user device 110 to thelocation server 122. - As will be appreciated, the
location 116 may be determined using any suitable technique or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the user device 110 may include a receiver for a satellite-based positioning system (e.g., the Global Positioning System (GPS)), and thelocation 116 may be determined from communications with the satellite-based positioning system. In other embodiments, thelocation 116 may be determined via communications with the satellite-based positioning system and other signals (e.g., Assisted GPS), such as Wi-Fi signals. In yet other embodiments, thelocation 116 may be determined via IP address geolocation using an IP address assigned to the user device 110. In some embodiments, the user may register the real-world object with thelocation server 122. - In some embodiments, a user may register the
location 116 to thelocation server 122, such by assigning a name (e.g., “My Home Office”) to thelocation 116. Thelocation server 122 may store and maintain a list of user-assigned names and locations, and may provide the user-assigned name when a location of a real-world object is determined. - The
location server 122 may receive identifiers, locations, and corresponding signal strengths from the user device 110 and other user devices. Thelocation 122 may be a single server (in a discrete hardware component or as a virtual server) or multiple servers. Thelocation server 122 may include web servers, application servers, or other types of servers. Additionally, thelocation server 122 may include computers arranged in any physical and virtual configuration, such as computers in one or more data processing centers, a distributed computing environment, or other configuration. Such configurations may use thenetwork 118 for communication or may communicate over other networks. The received identifiers, locations, and corresponding signal strengths may be stored in the location data repository 124. In some embodiments, the location data repository may be a part of thelocation server 122 or, in other embodiments, the location data repository 124 may be stored on a separate server accessible by thelocation server 122. The location data repository 124 may be a database or other suitable data structure for storing the location data. In some embodiments, the location data repository 124 may also store a list of registered real-world objects and associate identifiers, a list of locations and user-assigned names, and any other data used suitable for use with the techniques described herein. - The
location server 122 may include anobject location program 132 that determines a location of the transmitter 104 (and therefore the real-world object 102) using the received signals. For example, if the detected signal strength at the user device 110 has increased to a maximum over a period of time, and the detected signal strength at another user device has decreased to a minimum or zero over the same period of time, theobject location program 132 may determine that the transmitter 104 (and the real-world object 102) are located near the user device 110. The determined location of thetransmitter 104 may be stored in location data 124. - As shown in
FIG. 1 , thesearch engine 126 is in communication withlocation server 122. Thesearch engine 126 may be implemented in a single server (in a discrete hardware component or as a virtual server) or multiple servers. Such servers may include web servers, application servers, or other types of servers. Such servers may include computers arranged in any physical and virtual configuration, such as computers in one or more data processing centers, a distributed computing environment, or other configuration. In some embodiments, thesearch engine 126 and thelocation server 122 may be implemented in the same server or group of servers, and may be provided by the same entity or different entities. For example, thesearch engine 126 andlocation server 122 may be integrated in such a manner so as to provide seamless functionality to the user for searching for real-world objects and digital documents (e.g., webpages). - As will be appreciated, the
search engine 126 may include or have access to a search index for providing search results responsive to received search queries. For example, the search index may include an index of documents, such as web pages, accessible via the Internet using the World Wide Web (WWW). Thesearch engine 126 may be accessed via a user device in various ways, such as via a web browser and webpages, a search program (e.g., a native application of a smartphone), and so on. - If a user has lost the real-
world object 102, the user may send a search query to thesearch engine 126 using a user device, such as mobile user device 120. For example, the user may enter a search query for “my keys” and thesearch engine 126 may send the request to thelocation server 122. In some embodiments, thesearch engine 126 may determine the unique identifier for the real-world object 102 and send the unique identifier to thelocation server 122. After receiving a request from thesearch engine 126, thelocation server 122 may obtain the determined location for thetransmitter 104 from the location data 124 and provide the location to thesearch engine 126. The search engine may send the determined location to the mobile user 120 via thenetwork 118 as a response to the user's search query. In some embodiments, if the determined location corresponds to a geographic location, response may include a computer-implemented geographic map that displays the determined location of the transmitter 104 (and therefore the real-world object 102). In some embodiments, the determined location provided in response to the search query may be a user-assigned description for the location (e.g., “My Home Office”). - Although
FIG. 1 is described with reference to thesearch engine 126, in other embodiments the user and thelocation server 122 may communicate with a different entity. For example, in some embodiments, thesystem 100 may additionally or alternatively include a service for providing a list of real-world objects that the user has registered. In such embodiments, the user may view the list and query the location of a real-world object, and the request for the location of the real-world object may be sent to thelocation server 122 and processed in the manner described above. In other embodiments, thesystem 100 may additionally or alternatively include a service that will display the location of a real-world object on a map. In yet other embodiments, thelocation server 122 may provide the location of real-world objects to various other services, engines, or other entities. -
FIG. 2 depicts aprocess 200 for detecting and processing signals from a real-world object transmitter in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Some or all steps of theprocess 200 may be implemented as executable computer code stored on a non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of a special-purpose machine, e.g., a computer programmed to execute the code. In some embodiments, theprocess 200 may be implemented inobject detection program 130 described above. The illustratedprocess 200 begins atstart block 202. Initially, a signal having an identifier is received from an object transmitter at a user device (block 204). As described above, the transmitter of a real-world object may have a unique identifier that is transmitted from the transmitter. As also described above, the signals from the object transmitter are detected by a received included in or coupled to a user device (e.g., a personal computer). Using the identifier, the signal is evaluated to determine if the signal is the first signal received from the object transmitter (decision block 206). If the signal is the first signal received from the object transmitter (line 208), the identifier and signal strength are sent to the location server (block 210). Additionally, as mentioned above, the location of the user device is sent to the location server (block 212). Alternatively, in some embodiments the location server may determine the location of the user device via a token received from the user device, such as an IP address. Next, the signal strength of the revived signal is stored as the last received signal strength for the transmitter identifier (block 214), and further signals may be received (block 204). - If the received signal is not he first signal received from the object transmitter (line 216), the change between the received signal strength and a previously receives signal strength is compared to a threshold (decision block 218). If the change in signal strength is not greater or equal to the change threshold (line 220), the identifier and signal strength are stored (block 222) and the further signals may be received (block 204). If the change in signal strength is greater or equal to the change threshold (line 224), the identifier and signal strength are sent to the location server (block 210). Additionally, as described above, the location of the user device is sent to the location server (block 212) or, alternatively, in some embodiments the location server may determine the location of the user device via a token received from the user device,. Next, the signal strength of the revived signal is stored as the last received signal strength for the transmitter identifier (block 214), and further signals may be received (block 204). In this manner, a newly detected first signal of an object transmitter is send to the location server, thus indicating that an object transmitter may have been moved to near a user device. Similarly, a significant change in signal strength of signals from an object transmitter is also sent to the location server, thus indicating than an object transmitter is moving away from a user device or toward another user device.

FIG. 3 depicts aprocess 300 of a location server in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Some or all steps of theprocess 300 may be implemented as executable computer code stored on a non-transitory tangible computer-readable storage medium and executed by one or more processors of a special-purpose machine, e.g., a computer programmed to execute the code. In some embodiments, theprocess 300 may be implemented inobject location program 132 described above. The illustratedprocess 300 begins at start block 302. Afirst portion 304 of the process is associated with receiving and storing identifiers and signal strengths received from a user device, and asecond portion 306 of theprocess 300 is associated with determining the location of an object transmitter. An object identifier and signal strength may be received from a user device (block 308). For example, as described above and illustrated inFIG. 2 , a user device may send an identifier and signal strength to the location server if a received signal if the first received signal or if there is a significant change in signal strength. The received identifier and signal strength are stored a location data repository (block 310), such as a location data repository included in or accessible by the location server. Next, additional object identifier and signal strengths may be received (block 308) or, as described below, a request to locate an object is received. - As mentioned above, in some embodiments a request to locate an object may be received (block 312). As described above, after received a search query for a real-world object, a search engine may send a request for the object location to a location server. In some embodiments, the search engine may send an object identifier to the location server, and the location server may determine the transmitter identifier associated with the identified object. In other embodiments, the search engine may determine the transmitter identifier associated with an object of a search query and send the transmitter identifier to the location server.
- Next, the signal strengths, locations, and timestamps associated with the object transmitter are obtained from a location data repository (block 314). The location of the object transmitter (and therefore the object) is determined based on the signal strengths, locations, and timestamps (block 316). For example, if the most recent and highest signal strength is associated with a first location, the first location may be determined as the location of the object. In another example, decreasing signal strength over a time period from a first location and an increasing signal strength over the same time period at a second location may result in a determination of the second location as the location of the object. As mentioned above, in some embodiments the determined location may be a geographic location identified by coordinates or other geographic identification. In other embodiments, the determined location may be a user-assigned location specific to a user device, such as “My Home Office”, “My Work”, and so on. After determining the location of the object, the object location is sent to the requesting entity, e.g., a search engine (block 318). Next, additional object identifier and signal strengths may be received (block 308) or additional requests to locate an object are received (block 310).

FIG. 4 is a diagram 400 that depicts the changes in state of an object transmitter (e.g., object transmitter 104) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As mentioned above, in some embodiment the object transmitter is controlled via a microcontroller coupled to the transmitter. Initially, the transmitter is in a Power Onstate 402. The transmitter is then initialized (block 404), and the transmitter enters aReady state 406. Next, the transmitter enters a Transmitstate 408. After transmitting a signal that includes the identifier discussed above, the transmitter enters a Sleep state 410 (block 412). In theSleep state 410, the transmitter uses a minimal amount of power. TheSleep state 410 is maintained for a wait time period (block 412). In some embodiments, for example, the wait time period is 60 seconds. After the wait time period has elapsed, the transmitter returns to the Transmitstate 408 and transmits another signal having the identifier described above. Thus, after powering on and initializing, the transmitter alternates between the Transmitstate 408 and theSleep state 410 in the manner described above. -
