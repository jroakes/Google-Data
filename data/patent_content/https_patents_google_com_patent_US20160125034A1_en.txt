Herein, an entity is a thing or concept which exists in the world and which is represented by a unique ID. An entity ID may be independent of language restrictions or categorical limitations. For example, using the established Freebase entity system, a social networking app could be tagged with “entity:/m/01w362” (social network) and/or “entity:/m/0fj7z” (instant messaging), etc. - Another exemplary input signal is
co-clicked application data 270. A two or more apps may be defined as co-clicked apps when they are selected from the same search query by the same or different users.Co-clicked application data 270 may be therefore defined as the data associated with applications that are co-clicked with the target application. The value of co-clicked application data is based on the proposition that a user may click similar apps during a single search. For example, a user may searchdatabase 15 for apps using the query “shooter game.” Based on that single query, the user may select and view a plurality of apps, including the target app. -
Co-clicked application data 270 of a plurality of apps indatabase 15 may be generated by aggregating a plurality of users' search and selection statistics.Smear component 220 may obtainco-clicked application data 270 of the target application and propagate existing entity annotations of the co-clicked apps to generatefirst annotation data 300. For examples,smear component 220 may utilize a majority voting process to determine which entity annotations are propagated asfirst annotation data 300 for the target application. - The user search queries themselves may be used as an additional exemplary input signal. In other words, search queries 280 that result in a download/selection/purchase of the target app may be a valuable input signal. The
query annotation component 230 may obtainsearch query 280 input signals and map the query phrases (tokens) to defined entities. In this sense, thequery annotation component 230 may function similar to thedocument annotation component 210, however, being more customized to process asearch query 280 input signal. - Similarly, web documents that mention the target app can provide another exemplary input signal. Web signals 290 may be obtained by a
document annotation component 240 to generation additionalfirst annotation data 300 for the target application. For example, a web page titled “The Best Education Apps” may include mention of the target app. By mapping phrases from the page to defined entities, the document annotation component may generatefirst annotation data 300 for the target application. - A
fusion component 330 receives thefirst annotation data 300 obtained from the plurality of input signals 250. According to afusion model 320, the fusion component may generatesecond annotation data 340 based on the collectively receivedfirst annotation data 300. - Any of
several fusion models 320 may be used by thefusion component 330. For example,fusion model 320 may assign ranking to entity data based on a majority voting algorithm. In another embodiment,fusion model 320 may assign weighting to inputsignals 250 based on the source in a linear model. In the linear model, an entity may be appear asfirst annotation data 300 generated from more than one source. The final weight of the entity is a linear compilation of the weights assigned to the respective input signals 250. For example, web signals 290 may be assigned a weight of 0.2 whileco-clicked application data 270 may be assigned a weight of 0.7. An entity generated asfirst application data 300 from both ofweb signals 290 andco-clicked application data 270 may therefore be given a weight of 0.2+0.7=0.9 according tofusion model 320. - Based on the
fusion model 320 and thefirst annotation data 300, thefusion component 330 may generatesecond annotation data 340 to be outputted and associated with the target app. Thesecond annotation data 340 may be entities which are machine-understandable, thereby increasing the translatability and usefulness of the generated annotations. -
Annotation system 5 may further implement a machine-learning function by utilizing averification component 310. Theverification component 310 may receive a sampling of thefirst annotation data 300 and thesecond annotation data 340, indicated by the dashed lines inFIG. 2 . Based on the samplings, theverification component 310 may adjust thefusion model 320. For example, in one embodiment theverification component 310 may use human evaluation of the sampled data. The human evaluation may be used to assess and/or rate the accuracy of thefusion model 320 weighting designations and the accuracy of the final annotation entities as represented bysecond annotation data 340. Thereby theannotation system 5 may “learn” and constantly improve in accuracy of results. - The
second annotation data 340 may also be provided to adashboard component 350 prior to being output to be associated with the target app. Thedashboard component 350 may compute statistics/metrics to monitor the progress of theannotation system 5. For example, the dashboard component may compute comparative data based on the human evaluations used as verification data and thesecond annotation data 340. Exemplary data the dashboard component may provide include but are not limited to precision, recall, coverage, difference, and other statistical data. - The
annotation system 5 may accordingly annotate a target application as illustrated in the flowchart ofFIG. 3 . At operation S100, thesystem 5 obtains input signals about the target application. The input signals may be obtained from a plurality of sources. At operation S200 thesystem 5 generates first annotation data from the input signals. - At operation S300 the system fuses the first annotation data to generate second annotation data. The fusing may comprise ordering, ranking or selecting annotations from the first annotation data and discarding others. The second annotation is generated in a form that is machine-understandable. In some instances, this may require translation or conversion of data from one form to another. The second annotation data is fused from the first annotation data based on a fusion model. Once the second annotation data been generated in machine-understandable form, it is associated with the target app.
- At operation S400, the
system 5 adjusts the fusion model based on verification reference data. The system may acquire the verification reference data by human evaluation of the first and second annotation data. For example, human evaluation may be used to rate the accuracy of the first and second annotation data in view of the target application. - The
system 5 may utilize thedocument annotation component 210,smear component 220,query annotation component 230,fusion component 330 andverification component 310 as described above to execute the operations ofFIG. 3 . These and other components may be implemented using one or more individual processing circuits or collectively implemented using an integrated processing circuit.
