It will be understood that the MEMS mirror 6 could be configured to oscillate about any number of oscillation axes. For example the MEMS mirror 6 could be configured to oscillate about a single oscillation axes so that it can scan the collimated light beam 5 in one dimension.
- the image projector 2 may comprise two MEMS mirrors, arranged to be in optical communication with each other, one of the MEMS mirrors being configured to oscillate about one oscillation axis and the second MEMS mirror being configured to oscillate about a second oscillation axis which is orthogonal to the first oscillation axis, so that collectively the two MEMS mirrors can scan the collimated light beam 5 in two-dimensions.
- the image projector 2 further comprises a multiple-beam-generator 8 .
- the multiple-beam-generator 8 comprises a planar beam splitter 9 in the form of a planar beam splitter element 90 which is arranged to receive the collimated light beam 5 reflected by the MEMS mirror 6 .
- the planar beam splitter element 90 reflects part 5 b of the collimated light beam 5 and transmits another part 5 a of the collimated light beam 5 .

- the multiple-beam-generator 8 thus generates multiple light beams 15 a - c from the single collimated light beam 5 . Only three multiple light beams 15 a - c are illustrated in the figure for clarity, but it should be understood that the multiple-beam-generator 8 could generate any number of multiple light beams.
- the planar beam splitter element 90 and planar reflector element 100 are arranged to be in parallel.
- the planar beam splitter element 90 and planar reflector element 100 are further arranged such that the optical distance between the planar beam splitter element 90 and the planar reflector element 100 is greater than, or equal to, half the coherent length of the collimated light beam 5 (Typically the coherent length of the collimated light beam 5 will be a fixed value; the coherent length of the collimated light beam 5 is a property of the light source 4 which generates the collimated light beam 5 and is given as part of the specification for the light source 4 ).
- the optical distance is defined as:
- ‘OD’ is the optical distance
- ‘t’ is the thickness of the planar beam splitter element 90
- ‘ ⁇ i ’ is the incidence (AOI) of the collimated beam 5 (preferably the central beam) on the planar beam splitter element 90
- ‘n1’ is the refractive index of the material in which the collimated beam 5 passes before it is incident on the planar beam splitter element 90 (e.g.
- the material in which the collimated beam passes before it is incident on the planar beam splitter element 90 is air so ‘n1’ is equal to the refractive index ‘air’), ‘n’ is the refractive index of planar beam splitter element 90 , ‘h’ is the distance between the planar beam splitter element 90 and planar reflector element 100 , ‘n3’ is the refractive index of the material which occupies the space 13 between planar beam splitter element 90 and planar reflector element 100 .
- the space 13 between the planar beam splitter element 90 and planar reflector element 100 is occupied by ‘air’ (i.e.
- FIG. 1 illustrates the multiple-beam-generator 8 as comprising a planar beam splitter element 90 and planar reflector element 100 defining the planar beam splitter 9 and planar reflector respectively, and being separated by an air gap; it should be understood that the multiple-beam-generator 8 may have any other suitable configurations.
- a block of material preferably transparent material (e.g glass), having a thickness ‘h’, occupies the space 13 .
- planar beam splitter 9 and planar reflector 10 are attached, abut to, or are formed on, opposite sides of the block of material thus the planar beam splitter 9 and planar reflector 10 are fixed distance ‘h’ apart (‘h’ in this case is equal to the thickness of the block of material).
- the optical distance is defined as:
- OD h cos ⁇ ( ⁇ 2 ) wherein ‘h’ is the distance between the planar beam splitter 9 and planar reflector 10 (i.e. the thickness of the block of material) and ⁇ 2 is
- ⁇ i is the incidence (AOI) of the collimated beam 5 (preferably the central beam) on the planar beam splitter element 90
- n1 is the refractive index of the material in which the collimated beam 5 passes before it is incident on the planar beam splitter element 90 (e.g. in this example the material in which the collimated beam passes before it is incident on the planar beam splitter 90 is air so ‘n1’ is equal to the refractive index ‘air’), ‘n’ is the refractive index of planar beam splitter element 90 .
- the multiple-beam-generator may comprise a glass block with a beam splitter coating on one surface of the glass block and a reflective coating on a second, opposite surface of the glass block.
- the beam splitter coating defines the planar beam splitter 9 and the reflective coating defines the planar reflector 10 , and the optical distance is defined as:
- h is the distance between the beam splitter coating (i.e. the planar beam splitter 9 ) and the reflective coating (i.e. the planar reflector 10 ); in other words ‘h’ is equal to the thickness of the glass block, and ⁇ 2 is
- ⁇ 2 sin - 1 ( n 1 ⁇ sin ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ i n )
- ⁇ i is the incidence (AOI) of the collimated beam 5 (preferably the central beam) on the planar beam splitter 9
- n1 is the refractive index of the material in which the collimated beam 5 passes before it is incident on the planar beam splitter 9 (e.g. the refractive index ‘air’)
- n is the refractive index of planar beam splitter 9 .
- the image projector 2 further comprises a focusing lens 11 which is arranged to receive the multiple light beams 15 a - c which are output from the multiple beam generator 8 .
- the image projector 2 is arranged to be a distance ‘F’ equal to the focal length of the focusing lens 11 , from the microlens array 3 .
- the planar beam splitter 9 (planar beam splitter element 90 ) and planar reflector 10 (planar reflector element 100 ) causes the collimated light beam 5 to be split into multiple light beams 15 a - c ; because the optical distance is greater than, or equal to, half the coherent length of the collimated light beam the multiple beams are ‘independent’; two beam are ‘independent’ if the difference between their optical paths is greater than the coherence length of the light source which generated the two beams.
- the light beam 15 a is reflected only by the planar beam splitter element 90 whereas the consecutive (or neighbouring) light beam 15 b is transmitted by the planar beam splitter element 90 and reflected by the planar reflector element 100 and transmitted again by the planar beam splitter element 90 .
- the beam 15 b travels an optical distance which is greater than the optical distance traveled by the beam 15 a , by at least an amount equal to the coherence length of the light source 4 .
- consecutive (i.e. neighbouring) multiple light beams 15 a and 15 b are independent from each other.
- the other successive (i.e. neighbouring) multiple light beams ( 15 c etc.) will also have optical paths which differ at least by a distance greater than or equal to the coherence length of the light source 4 .
- planar beam splitter 9 planar beam splitter element 90
- planar reflector 10 the planar reflector element 100
- the multiple light beams 15 a - c are then focused onto the same point 16 on the microlens array 3 using the focusing lens 11 , so as to define a single pixel 17 of a projected image at point 16 .
- the multiple independent light beams 15 a - c each produce their own speckle and moiré pattern; accordingly when the multiple light beams 15 a - c are focused onto the same point 16 the speckle and moiré patterns of each of the multiple independent light beams 15 a - c will overlap at point 16 and thus will average-out; accordingly the speckle and moiré which is visible to a viewer viewing the pixel 17 will be reduced. In practice it is the viewer's eyes that will average out the speckle and moiré patterns upon viewing the pixel 17 .
- Each pixel of the image is projected onto the microlens array 3 in this manner so that there is a reduction in speckle and moiré pattern over the whole of the image projected on the microlens array 3 .
- the manufacturer will typically calculate the smallest angle of incidence ‘ ⁇ i ’ of the collimated light beam 5 (preferably the central beam) on the beam splitter 9 .
- the smallest angle of incidence can be found for example, in the following manner: when the MEMS mirror 6 is at rest (i.e. the MEMS mirror 6 is not oscillating) the collimated light beam 5 reflected by the MEMS mirror 6 towards the beam splitter 9 defines what is referred to as the ‘central beam.
- the manufacturer can adjust and measure the angle of incidence ‘ ⁇ i ’ of the central beam on the beam splitter 9 . Then, the smallest angle of incidence is equal to the angle of incidence ‘ ⁇ i ’ of the central beam minus half the maximum angle over which the MEMS mirror can scan the collimated light beam 5 . If the value for the smallest angle of incidence is less than 0° then 0° is taken to be smallest angle of incidence. Then, using the optical distance ‘OD’ formula described above and using the known refractive index of the materials composing the multiple beam generator, the manufacturer can adjust the dimension ‘t’ and ‘h’ such that the optical distance is greater than, or equal to, half the coherence length of the collimated light beam which is known.
- each light source generating one of the multiple independent light beams 15 a - c . Since each of the light beams will come from different light sources the multiple light beams 15 a - c will be “independent”. For example a first light source could be used to generate the light beam 15 a , a second light source could be used to generate light beam 15 b and a third light source could be used to generate light beam 15 c . In this variation no planar beam splitter 9 and planar reflector 10 is required; and the optical assembly may configured such that the first, second and third light sources generate respective light beams 15 a - c which are passed directly to the focusing lens 11 .
- FIG. 2 shows a perspective view of an optical assembly 20 according to a further embodiment of the present invention.
- the optical assembly comprises many of the same features of the optical assembly 1 shown in FIG. 1 and like features are awarded the same reference numbers.
- the optical assembly 20 further comprises a head-up-display 21 which is arranged to receive light from the microlens array 3 .
- the head-up-display 21 is arranged a distance ‘L’ from the microlens array 3 wherein ‘L’ is equal to: ( Ze ⁇ z )/ M wherein ‘Ze’ is a distance from a predefined position where the optical assembly 20 projects a virtual image 22 to a predefined position where a viewer should view the virtual image 22 , ‘z’ is a distance between the head-up-display 21 and the predefined position where a viewer should view the virtual image 22 , and ‘M’ is the magnification of the head-up-display 21 .
- the multiple light beams 15 a - c which are focused onto the microlens array 3 by the focusing lens 11 are diffused by the microlens array 3 .

- the sizes of the microlens' 51 in the microlens array 50 can increase from a centre row 56 of microlens towards the outermost row of microlens 57 of the microlens array 51 .
- the size of the microlens along each respective row 56 , 57 may be equal; however in a further variation of the invention the size of the microlens along each respective row 56 , 57 may increase or decrease.
- the size of the microlens' 51 in the microlens array 50 is such that the pitch between consecutive microlens 51 , is equal to: ( P eff /cos ⁇ scan ) wherein P eff is a predefined effective pitch value and ⁇ scan is the angle of incidence of a light beam emitted from the projector device on that microlens 51 .
- the ‘effective pitch’ is the projection of the pitch of the microlens along the incoming light direction ⁇ scan .
- FIG. 5 b illustrates the problem which arises with microlens arrays in which all microlens of the microlens array are of equal size:
- the angle of incidence of the light beam on microlens array will change over the scan amplitude; as the light beam is scanned towards the outermost microlens' in the angle of incidence will be reduced so that light beam experiences an ‘effective pitch’ which is lower than the physical distance between the centres of neighbouring microlens; this can result in a changing interference pattern along the scanning amplitude (wherein the scanning amplitude is the amplitude over which the oscillating MEMS mirror 6 scans the collimated light beam 5 ).
- the microlens array shown in FIG. 5 a resolves this problem; since the microlens' are sized such that the pitch between consecutive microlens 51 is equal to (P eff /cos ⁇ scan ) it compensates for the scanning of the light beam by the MEMS mirror 6 so that ‘effective pitch’ experienced by the light beam is equal across the whole scanning amplitude.
- the microlens 51 in the microlens array may be further sized such that they compensate for the change in angle of incidence of the collimated light 5 beam on the planar beam splitter 9 , which occurs when the collimated light beam 5 is scanned by the oscillating MEMS mirror 6 .
- the optical assembly will preferably take the form of the optical assembly 30 shown in FIG. 3 and the optical assembly 30 will be configured such that the distance ‘h’ between the planar beam splitter 9 (beam splitter coating 82 ) and the planar reflector 10 (reflective coating 84 )) is given by:
- the thickness ‘T’ of the glass block 81 between the beam splitter coating 82 and the reflective coating 84 defines the distance ‘h’ between the planar beam splitter 9 (beam splitter coating 82 ) and the planar reflector 10 (reflective coating 84 )), thus the optical assembly 30 is configured such that the above mentioned condition for ‘h’ is met by choosing a glass block 81 with the appropriate thickness.
- the optical assembly 30 is configured such that the distance ‘d’ between two consecutive (i.e. two neighbouring) multiple beams 15 a - c output from the multiple beam generator 80 measured prior to being incident on the focusing lens 11 is:
- the optical assembly 30 is configured such that the above conditions for ‘h’ and ‘d’ are met for the ‘central beam’. As the amplitude of the scanning angle increases, ⁇ i will change and the required value of ‘h’ to satisfy the condition on ‘d’ will thus change too. But it is difficult to have a changing thickness ‘h’ because the beam splitter and reflector should preferably be planar.
- pitch P between the microlens in the microlens array 50 should preferably vary according to the following equation:
- the screen 3 shown in FIG. 5 a is in the form of a microlens array 50
- the screen 3 could alternatively be in the form of a micromirror array having the same pitch conditions between consecutive micromirrors as those described above for the microlens array 50 .
- any of the above described optical assemblies could have a screen 3 in the form shown in FIG. 5 a .
- the screen 3 may alternatively comprise a micromirror array and similarly the pitch between consecutive micromirror in the micromirror array may be equal to (P eff /cos ⁇ scan ).
- the focusing lens 11 may take any suitable form; for example the focusing lens 11 may be a simple converging lens, a plano convex lens, double convex lens or a F-theta lens. Additionally, or alternatively, the focusing lens 11 may be further configured to correct chromatic aberration; for example the focusing lens 11 may be an achromatic lens such as an achromatic doublet or lens with a surface grating which is configured to correct chromatic aberration.
- the a light source 4 may be configured to emit collimated light beams 5 in pulses, each pulse of light defining a single pixel of a projected image.
- Each pulse may comprise the amount of red, green and blue light beams necessary for defining a corresponding pixel of the projected image; thus in this case the red, green and blue light beams are emitted by the light source simultaneously in the same pulse.
- the light source 4 may be configured to emit pulses of green, red and blue light beams consecutively in independent pulses, rather than emitting them simultaneously in the same pulse.
- the time of the emission of the green, red and blue light beams is synchronized with the orientation of the oscillating MEMS mirror 6 so that the red, green and blue light beams are incident at predefined respective positions on the focusing lens 11 .
- the predefined respective positions are such that the red, green and blue light beams are focused to same point on the screen 3 by the focusing lens 11 .
- the chromatic aberration of the focusing lens 11 is a known value; typically known from the lens manufacturer or it can be calculated using well known equations in optics; it can also be measured using a detector placed after the focusing lens 11 .
- the chromatic aberration is known for each pixel of a projected image.
- the optical assembly can also include a position sensor which is configured to measure the position and the speed of oscillation the MEMS mirror 6 about its oscillation axes 7 a , 7 b , so that the position and the speed of oscillation of the MEMS mirror 6 is known at all-times.
- the blue light portion of a pixel is offset by a fixed distance of ‘x mm’ with respect to the green light portion of a pixel at a given scanning angle ⁇ of the MEMS mirror.
- the speed of oscillation of the MEMS mirror 6 is ‘ ⁇ ’ in degree/second and the scanned spot 16 moves on the screen 3 at a speed ‘v’ in mm/s.
- the light source 4 is configured to emit independent pulses of blue, red and green light, consecutively, for each pixel to be projected; the red, green and blue pulses combine on the screen 3 to form an pixel.
- the amount of blue, red and green light in the each pulse is according to the amount of blue, red and green colour in the pixel to be projected.
- ‘t’ defines the time delay between consecutive red, green and blue pulses.
- the time delay of the emission of the green, red and blue light beams can vary for each position of the MEMS mirror 6 because the aberration and the speed of the MEMS mirror 6 also vary throughout the oscillation amplitude of the MEMS mirror 6 will vary.
- the synchronization of the emission of the independent red, green and blue light beams from the light source 4 with the oscillation of the MEMS mirror, so that the red, green and blue light beams are incident on predefined respective points on the focusing lens 11 such that they are focused by the focusing lens 11 onto the same point on the screen 3 can be used to correct chromatic aberration.

Typically the predefined effective pitch value will be a pitch value which the users desires the scanned light to experience as it is incident on the microlens/micromirror array. Because P varies along the scanning angle (i.e. the size of the microlens or micromirrors varies (increases or decreases depending on the direction of scanning)) the Peff remains constant, at a predefined value, throughout the whole of the scanning angle.
