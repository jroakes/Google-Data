Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to systems and methods for information retrieval.
- the present invention relates particularly to systems and methods for category-based search.
- Conventional search engines receive a search query from a user and execute a search against a global index. Such conventional search engines typically use one or more conventional methods for performing a search. For example, one known method, described in an article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a document, such as a web page, based on the link structure of the web.
- the search results are often presented in a list format, including article identifiers and brief snippets about the documents in a web page that can be resized.
- a user may also have access to other information stored on the user's local machine or on other storage media accessible via a network.
- a user enters an explicit search query that comprises keywords and the query is executed against either a global or a local index.
- the query may also be generated as an implicit query.
- the information found is output to the user as a result set.
- GoogleTM search engine allows a user to search using categories by selecting the “Directory” (Google Inc., Mountain View, Calif.; www.google.com).
- the Yahoo!® search engine allows a user to search by categories, either by selecting a category or by entering an explicit query and being presented with one or more categories in the result set (Yahoo! Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.; www.yahoo.com).
- the categories utilized by both of these search engines are static and are edited manually.
- a rule may specify, for example, that any incoming mail message with “News” in the subject be refilled to a news sub-folder within the user's inbox.
- Such rules are typically defined manually by the user or by an e-mail administrator.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for category-based search.
- a computer program identifies an article having an attribute, determines a category associated with the article based at least in part on the article attribute, and stores in a data store a data record comprising a category-article pair identifier associated with the category and the article.
- a search query may be received and executed on a data store comprising the association data record.
- the association data record is received from the data store.
- a computer-readable medium (such as, for example random access memory or a computer disk) comprises code for carrying out such a method.

- Methods according to the present invention may be implemented by, for example, a processor-executable program code stored on a computer-readable medium.
- a computer program identifies an article having an attribute, determines a category associated with the article based at least in part on the article attribute, and stores in a data store a data record comprising a category-article pair identifier associated with the category and the article.
- a set of base categories may be stored on a client device.
- the base categories are based on registered schemas (e.g., a schema may exist for Email, Documents, Media, etc., which correspond to Email, Document, and Media categories) and on schema fields (e.g., for a Document Schema, ad “document type” field is stored that has a value of DOC, PDF, MPEG, etc.).
- a search query can be received and executed on a data store comprising the association data record.
- the association data record can be received from the data store.
- the category-article pair identifier may comprise various attributes of an article, including, for example, an article identifier, name, file type, size, “author, and other attributes.
- the data store may comprise disk, memory, or any other type of suitable storage.
- the attribute that the categorization is based on may be any type of suitable attribute, comprising, for example, a file type, an event schema, an event schema field, a location, a name, or other suitable attribute or any combination of suitable attributes.
- the capture processor 124 can monitor activity on the client device and can capture events by a generalized event definition mechanism, such as an event schema.
- Each capture component can define its own event schema or can use a predefined one.
- Event schema can differ depending on the client application or activity the capture component is monitoring.
- the event schema can describe the format for an event, such as, for example, by providing fields for event data associated with the event (such as the time of the event) and fields related to any associated article (such as the title) as well as the content of any associated article (such as the document body).
- An event schema can describe the format for any suitable event data that relates to an event.
- an event schema for an instant messenger message event sent by the user 112 a can include a recipient or list of recipients, the time sent, the date sent, content of the message, and a conversation ID.
- An event schema for a web page currently being viewed by a user can include the Uniform Resource Locator or URL of the web page, the time being viewed, and the content of the web page.
- An event schema for a word processing document being saved by a user can include the title of the document, the time saved, the location of the document, the format of the document, the text of the document, and a pointer to the location of the document. More generally, an event schema can describe the state of the system around the time of the event and also contain information describing other articles.
- an event schema can contain a URL for a web page event associated with a previous web page that the user navigated from.
- event schema can describe fields with more complicated structure like lists.
- an event schema can also contain lists of information.
- An email schema can contain fields that list such as, for example, multiple recipients from an email.
- An event schema can also contain optional fields so that an application can include additional event data if desired.
- the article may be associated with none, one, or more than one category or action.
- the categories with which an article is associated with may be based on one or more attributes. For example, in one embodiment, a computer program attempts to associate an article with any categories that are relevant to one particular article attribute. In another embodiment, the computer program attempts to associate the article with multiple categories that are relevant to more than one attribute associated with the article. In yet another embodiment, the computer program attempts to associate the article with a category that is associated with an action, such as printing or emailing the article.
- a category may be associated with none, one, or more than one article.
- a list of categories is created prior to assigning articles to the categories.
- a category may not be initially or ever associated with an article or may be associated with one or more articles.
- an input signal is received.
- the input signal may comprise an event, and the event may comprise an article or part of an article or an identifier of an article.
- a user executes an explicit query and then views an article that was provided as a result in a result set.
- the article comprises information about cars.
- an event is generated and sent as a signal to an indexer or other computer program.
- the event comprises an identifier of the article and may comprise a snippet.
- the indexer uses the snippet to categorize the article associated with the article identifier.
- the article is associated with the category “Car.”
- categories may be associated with both articles and other categories.
- a search may be performed among interrelationships of categories.
- the category/category relationships may suggest nested or hierarchical relationships among the categories or may just signal some other reason that the categories are related to one another.
- the categories “Food” and “Mexican” are related based on a user's previous activity.
- the two categories may be related hierarchically—Mexican may be a type of Food.
- Food may be a sub-category for a general category labeled “Mexican.”
- the relationship may be captured in some way in the association data record.
- the record may comprise a field to denote the hierarchical level of the two categories.
- the two terms are related with no hierarchical relationship.
- an article is associated with a category that is associated with an action.
- the action may comprise, for example, printing, faxing, emailing, copying, or some other suitable action.
- the category associated with the action may be, for example, “Printed,” “Faxed,” “Email-Sent,” or “Copied.”
- the user creates a presentation and prints it.
- one embodiment of the present invention creates two categories, “Presentation” and “Printed.” Two corresponding association data records are also created linking the article with the categories.
- a search engine or other application is able to perform searches based on categories.
- the search engine receives a search query, causes the search query to be executed on the data store that comprises the association data records, and receives results from the data store that comprise an association between one or more categories and one or more article identifiers.
- the search engine receives results that comprise associations between one or more categories and one or more other categories and performs a further search or further searches to locate article identifiers associated with the categories.
- the search engine may generate a result set and may cause the article identifiers to be output.
- the search engine generates an output signal that comprises the article identifier.
- the search engine may generate an HTML page that comprises the article identifier, e.g., a short snippet, and a hyperlink to view the complete article.
- the output signal may comprise a plurality of article identifiers, and the identifiers may be sorted based at least in part on the categories.
- the search engine or other application may also comprise the category in the output signal.
- the search engine generates an HTML page that comprises multiple article identifiers that are separated visually by category headers.
- a computer program receives a search query that comprises a category and at least one keyword.
- the search engine identifies the keyword and searches a data store for data associated with the keyword. For example, if a user enters the search query “Atlanta Mexican,” the search engine identifies “Mexican” as a category and searches for association data records in which the article identifier is related to “Atlanta.”
- the search engine attempts to identify multiple categories in the search query. For example, if the user enters the search query “Atlanta Mexican Food,” the search engine may identify “Mexican” and “Food” as categories and attempt to find association data records for these two categories. Once the records are found, the search engine may attempt to find articles related to one or both of the categories.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method for associating a category with an article in one embodiment of the present invention.
- a computer program executing on the client 102 a such as capture processor 124 or the indexer 130 , identifies an article 202 . This identification may occur as a result of receiving the article, receiving data identifying the article (for example, a URL), or by other suitable means.
- the program receives an article 202 .
- the article comprises a plurality of attributes, such as the name, file type, size, creation time, last access time, and author.
- the indexer 130 evaluates one or more of the attributes 204 to determine a category with which to associate the article 206 .
- an article is categorized by file type.
- the indexer 130 evaluates the file extension attribute of the article identified to determine the file type. For instance, the indexer 130 receives an article with a file type attribute equal to “.pdf.”
- the indexer 130 searches a category-file type index, such as a table in a data store to determine one or more categories associated with the file type value.
- the “.pdf” extension may be categorized as a “PDF” or “Acrobat” article; a “.ppt” extension may be categorized as a “PowerPoint” and/or “Presentation” article.
- the name of a file is used to categorize the file. For example, a file that includes “2004 Budget” in the file name is categorized in both a “2004” category and a “Budget” category.
- keywords are extracted from the content of an article. The indexer 130 then searches a category-keyword data store for one or more categories associated with the keyword. The article is then categorized based on the results of the search. For instance, the most relevant keywords may be used to construct a set of categories the document belongs to.
- the search engine 122 may subsequently utilize the category to perform searches.
- the category may identify, for example, the article as having been created by an application, or the category may identify a subject matter of the article.
- the category may associate a person's name or the name of a place or organization with a particular article.
- the indexer 130 may be unable to find a category with which to associated the article. For instance, the indexer 130 may not find a category match for the file type, name, keyword, or other attributes of the article. If the indexer 130 determines that no existing categories exist that can be associated with the article 208 , the indexer 130 creates a new category and stores the category in a data store, such as a category data store, and an association with the article in a category-article data store.
- a data store such as a category data store
- the indexer 130 after finding categories associated with the article and storing the category-article pair identifier for each category, attempts to infer whether or not a new category or set of categories need be created for the article.
- the categories may be created in a number of ways. For example, in one embodiment, a user manually enters one or more categories. In another embodiment, the indexer 130 infers categories based on a user's past search patterns. For example, if a user uses a keyword frequently when performing searches, the indexer 130 may create a category for the keyword. If keywords are often submitted together, the indexer may infer relationships between the categories. In another embodiment, categories may be inferred from user behavior; for example, folders and directories on one or more computing devices mused by the user, categories created in various applications (e.g., folders of “Favorites” in a browser program, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or email folders or labels in an email program, such as Microsoft Outlook), etc.
- categories may be inferred from user behavior; for example, folders and directories on one or more computing devices mused by the user, categories created in various applications (e.g., folders of “Favorites” in a browser program, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or email folders
- ⁇ may be identified and used to create categories. For example, if a user has created a folder or directory named “Taxes,” then a category “Taxes” may be created, and articles stored in or otherwise associated with this folder may be tied to this category. Similarly, web documents indicated in a Favorites folder may be tied to a category name derived from the label of such folders.
- a user enters a search query including the term “presentation.”
- the query system 132 returns a result set including an article having a file type attribute value equal to “ppt.” If the indexer 130 has not encountered an article having a ppt file type attribute, the indexer 130 can create a new category.
- the indexer 130 can infer the category based on the keyword in the search query, “presentation.” Articles having a “ppt” file type may also be returned in response to a query comprising the term “PowerPoint.” In such cases, the indexer 130 may create another category, “PowerPoint,” and infer a relationship between the two categories, “presentation” and “PowerPoint.”
- the indexer 130 locates the appropriate category, or creates a new one, the indexer 130 creates an association data record 212 .
- the association data record identifies both the category and the article and may comprise additional information as well.
- the association data record comprises a category identifier and the uniform resource identifier (URI) for each category/article pair.
- the indexer 130 stores the association data record for later search and retrieval 214 .
- the association data record is stored in the data store 140 .
- One or more categories may be associated with any one article. And one or more articles may be associated with any one category.
- the user may interact with many PowerPoint documents.
- Each of the PowerPoint documents may be related to an additional category relating to content within the PowerPoint document.
- one PowerPoint may concern budgeting while another concerns targeted marketing.
- each PowerPoint document would be associated with the “PowerPoint” category and a second topical category.
- the indexer 140 inspects articles from categories related to the new category (e.g., parent category) and adds the qualifying articles to the newly created category.
- categories related to the new category e.g., parent category
- the categories may also be associated with one or more other categories.
- the categories are related in a hierarchical or nested structure such that broader categories are related to somewhat narrower categories, which are, in turn, related to narrower categories.
- no nesting or hierarchical relationship between categories is implied; each category is directly associated with other categories.
- the category associations provide the search engine 122 with a method of retrieving articles of interest to a user.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating relationships between categories in one embodiment of the present invention.
- two base categories have been created, Base Category A 302 and Base Category B 304 .
- Base categories A and B are related to one or more categories, Category A 306 , Category B 308 , and Category C 310 .
- Base categories and categories may be related to one another.
- Category B 308 and Category C 310 are related.
- the categories are in turn related to one or more articles.
- Category A 306 is related to Article A 312 .
- Category B is related to Article B 314 and Article C 316 .
- Category C 310 is related to Article C.
- a category may not be related to any other category or to any article.
- the category will simply exist with no relationships.
- the three-level hierarchy shown in FIG. 3 is merely exemplary; an embodiment of the present invention may comprise any number of levels, and the number of levels between what is described as a base category and an article may vary from base category to base category, i.e., one base category may be related directly to an article while a second base category is related to one or more categories which are in turn related to one or more articles.
- Presentation may be considered a base category, e.g., Base Category A 302 .
- PowerPoint may be considered a category, e.g., Category A 306 .
- An article having a file type equal to “.ppt” comprises an article, e.g., Article A 312 .
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a method for retrieving a result set using categories in one embodiment of the present invention.
- a search engine application such as the query system 132 of search engine 122 , receives a search query 402 .
- the search query comprises one or more keywords and may be an explicit or implicit query.
- the keywords may comprise a category or may comprise words that the query system 132 is able to categorize.
- the query system 132 attempts to identify categories associated with the keywords 404 . For instance, the query system 132 may receive a search query comprising the keywords “presentation 2003 budget.” The query system searches a data store comprising categories for each of these three terms and may search a data store comprising category-keyword associations as well 406 . The query system 132 identifies the term “presentation” as associated with the “PowerPoint” category. The query system 132 further identifies the keyword “budget” as associated with the “Budgeting” category. For example, the query system 132 may search a data store comprising category-keyword associations. Each query by keyword may return zero, one, or many categories.
- the query system 132 searches for articles associated with the category or categories 408 . For instance, in the example above, the query system 132 performs a query of the data store for association data records having “PowerPoint” or “Budgeting” as the Category. The query system may then perform a union or intersection of the data sets to create a set of category/article association data records with which to work.
- each association data record comprises an article identifier, such as a URI.
- the association data record comprises a pointer to data store containing article identifiers.
- the association data record comprises both article and category identifiers associated with each category retrieved in response to the search query. In such an embodiment, the query system 132 performs additional queries for each set of category/category relationships until they are resolved into category/article relationships.
- the term “Presentation” is a category. Associated with the category “Presentation” is the category “PowerPoint.” A search query that the query system 132 determines is associated with “Presentation” may also be associated with “PowerPoint.” Accordingly, articles associated with both the “PowerPoint” and “Presentation” categories would be returned or at least considered in response to the search query.
- the query system 132 adds an article identifier to a result set for each article that the query system 132 identifies as related to a relevant category 410 .
- the query system 132 may filter or otherwise limit the results so that not every article is added.
- the category search 406 , article search 408 , and article identifier addition to the result set 410 may be repeated until a pre-determined number of results has been found, until no additional results can be found, or according to some other condition.
- the result set is output 412 .
- the query system 132 may generate a result set comprising 20 relevant articles, based on the category search, and cause those 20 articles to be displayed to the user.
- the results may be presented separately or in conjunction with the results from other searches or types of searches.
- FIG. 5 is a screenshot illustrating a user interface supporting category-based searches in one embodiment of the present invention.
- the user has previously searched for, created, modified, or otherwise performed tasks that have caused the indexer 130 to create associations between categories and articles.
- the user then begins entering text in a word processing user interface 502 .
- the word processing interface shown comprises various sections, comprising a section for displaying search results 504 and a section for entering and editing text 506 . In other embodiments, these sections may be separate from the application interface.
- the user enters text in the text entry section 506 of the application that comprises the terms “test” and “preparation.”
- the application shown In response to the user completing the sentence, i.e., entering a period, the application shown generates an implicit query that comprises all of the terms from the first sentence, comprising the terms “test” and “preparation.”
- the query system 132 identifies a category called “Test Preparation.” Associated with the category are various articles identifiers.
- an event is generated.
- the event is captured, and a new category is created—“Email-Sent.”
- the application In response to the user emailing the article, e.g., pressing the send key, the application generates an implicit query.
- the query system 132 identifies the category “Email-Sent” as well as the category “Test Preparation.” Associated with both of these categories are various article identifiers.
- the query system 132 uses the article identifiers to find and/or generate brief snippets about the articles and displays those snippets in the search results section 504 of the application interface 502 .
- the results comprise previously retrieved search results, images, news, and information from the user's computer. In other embodiments both subsets of this information and/or additional information may be shown depending on the user's preferences and other criteria.
