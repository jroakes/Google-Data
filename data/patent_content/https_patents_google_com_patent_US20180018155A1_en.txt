- a given electronic document can include a third-party tag or third-party script (e.g., portion of code) that references the third-party content distribution system 110 .
- the third-party tag or third-party script is executed by the user device 106 when the given electronic document is processed by the user device 106 . Execution of the third-party tag or third-party script configures the user device 106 to generate a request 112 for third-party content, which is transmitted over the network 102 to the third-party content distribution system 110 .
- the third-party tag or third-party script can enable the user device 106 to generate packetized data request including a header and payload data.
- the request 112 can include data such as a name (or network location) of a server from which the third-party content is being requested, a name (or network location) of the requesting device (e.g., the user device 106 ), and/or information that the third-party content distribution system 110 can use to select third-party content provided in response to the request.
- the request 112 is transmitted, by the user device 106 , over the network 102 (e.g., a telecommunications network) to a server of the third-party content distribution system 110 .
- the request 112 can include data specifying the electronic document and characteristics of locations at which third-party content can be presented. For example, data specifying a reference (e.g., URL) to an electronic document (e.g., webpage) in which the third-party content will be presented, available locations (e.g., third-party content slots) of the electronic documents that are available to present third-party content, sizes of the available locations, positions of the available locations within a presentation of the electronic document, and/or media types that are eligible for presentation in the locations can be provided to the third-party content distribution system 110 .

- the header can specify a destination of the packet and the payload data can include any of the information discussed above.
- the third-party content distribution system 110 selects third-party content (e.g., information about apps) that will be presented with the given electronic document in response to receiving the request 112 and/or using information included in the request 112 .
- third-party content is selected in less than a second to avoid errors that could be caused by delayed selection of the third-party content. For example, delays in providing third-party content in response to a request 112 can result in page load errors at the user device 106 or cause portions of the electronic document to remain unpopulated even after other portions of the electronic document are presented at the user device 106 .
- delays in providing third-party content can result in a failed delivery of the third-party content, for example, if the electronic document is no longer presented at the user device 106 when the third-party content is provided.
- the third-party content distribution system 110 is implemented in a distributed computing system that includes, for example, a server and a set of multiple computing devices 114 that are interconnected and identify and distribute third-party content in response to requests 112 .
- the set of multiple computing devices 114 operate together to identify a set of third-party content that are eligible to be presented in the electronic document from among a corpus of millions of available third-party content (3PC1-x).
- the millions of available third-party content can be indexed, for example, in a third-party corpus database 116 .
- Each third-party content index entry can reference the corresponding third-party content and/or include distribution parameters (DP1-DPx) (e.g. selection criteria) that condition the distribution of the corresponding third-party content.
- distribution parameters DP1-DPx
- the distribution parameters (e.g., selection criteria) for a particular third-party content can include distribution keywords that must be matched (e.g., by electronic documents or terms specified in the request 112 ) in order for the third-party content to be eligible for presentation.
- the distribution parameters can also require that the request 112 include information specifying a particular geographic region (e.g., country or state) and/or information specifying that the request 112 originated at a particular type of user device (e.g., mobile device or tablet device) in order for the third-party content to be eligible for presentation.
- the distribution parameters can also specify a selection value (e.g., bid) and/or budget for distributing the particular third-party content.
- the identification of the eligible third-party content can be segmented into multiple tasks 117 a - 117 c that are then assigned among computing devices within the set of multiple computing devices 114 .
- different computing devices in the set of multiple computing devices 114 can each analyze a different portion of the third-party corpus database 116 to identify various third-party content having distribution parameters that match information included in the request 112 .
- each given computing device in the set of multiple computing devices 114 can analyze a different data dimension (or set of dimensions) and pass results 118 a - 118 c of the analysis back to the third-party content distribution system 110 .
- the results 118 a - 118 c provided by each of the computing devices in the set may identify a subset of third-party content that are eligible for distribution in response to the request and/or a subset of the third-party content that have certain distribution parameters or attributes.
- the third-party content distribution system 110 aggregates the results 118 a - 118 c received from the set of multiple computing devices 114 and uses information associated with the aggregated results to select one or more instances of third-party content that will be provided in response to the request 112 .
- the third-party content distribution system 110 can select a set of winning third-party content based on the outcome of one or more content evaluation processes, as discussed in further detail below.
- the third-party content distribution system 110 can generate and transmit, over the network 102 , reply data 120 (e.g., digital data representing a reply) that enable the user device 106 to integrate the set of winning third-party content into the given electronic document, such that the set of winning third-party content and the content of the electronic document are presented together at a display of the user device 106 .
- reply data 120 e.g., digital data representing a reply
- the user device 106 executes instructions included in the reply data 120 , which configures and enables the user device 106 to obtain the set of winning third-party content from one or more third-party content servers.
- the instructions in the reply data 120 can include a network location (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) and a script that causes the user device 106 to transmit a third-party request 121 to the third-party content server 108 to obtain a given winning third-party content from the third-party content server 108 .
- the third-party content server 108 will transmit, to the user device 106 , third-party data 122 that causes the given winning third-party content to be incorporated into the electronic document and presented at the user device 106 .
- the third-party content distribution system 110 can utilize one or more evaluation processes to identify and select the set of winning third-party content for each given request (e.g., based on data corresponding to the request).
- the evaluation process is not only required to determine which third-party content to select for presentation with the electronic document, but also the type of formatting that will be dynamically (e.g., on a per-request basis) applied to the selected third-party content, and the price that will be paid for presentation of the selected third-party content when presented with the applied formatting.
- the third-party content distribution system 110 may select winning third-party content in response to a given request from among a set of third-party content items (e.g., instances of third-party content) that have been deemed eligible to return to the user device 106 in response to that request.
- Eligible third-party content can be identified on a per-request basis according to various data specified in the request, or context associated with the request.
- the request may indicate a permissible size or aspect ratio of the requested third-party content, and the third-party content distribution system 110 may filter the total set of available third-party content to a set of eligible content that satisfies the size or aspect ratio constraint, and any other applicable constraints.
- the evaluation process for selecting winning third-party content can then be performed only with respect to the set of eligible third-party content.
- the evaluation process may involve scoring and ranking third-party content items.
- the winning third-party content item may be the highest-ranked item according to the scores.
- the ineligible third-party content may be excluded from the total set of available content before the content is scored and ranked.
- the ineligible third-party content may be excluded from the total set of available content after the content is scored and ranked.
- the third-party content distribution system 110 may be configured to trigger presentation of information related to applications.
- the third-party content distribution system 110 can receive (or receive notification of) an opportunity to provide third-party content to a user, such as receiving a submitted query or a request to fill a third-party content slot.
- the third-party content distribution system 110 can provide application information associated with an app, such as for a link to download the application.
- FIGS. 2-4 collectively show an example user interface 200 for application providers to specify strategies for distribution of content related to their applications.
- application providers 126 can identify post-install activities that are to be used for optimizing the selection of third-party content related to their applications.
- the application provider can specify that they want information about their application provided to users who will perform one or more of the specified post-install activities.
- the user interface 200 can be populated with a set of post-install activities 202 that the application provider is currently tracking (e.g., using an analytics system).
- the tracking of the post-install activities can be achieved, for example, by the app provider inserting a specific piece of code at a given location within their application, such that when the post-install activity is performed, the code will be executed by the user device and submit information to a tracking server indicating that the specified post-install activity was performed within the application.
- the user interface 200 can receive (through inputs by the application provider) data specifying post-install activities, such as through application provider interactions with one or more of the set of post-install activities 202 presented in the user interface 200 .
- the user interface 200 can be used by an application provider 126 , for example, to set content selection parameters for optimizing (e.g., maximizing or increasing) total conversion volume for an application provided by the application provider 126 .
- the user interface 200 can support a selection value landscape in which selection values and corresponding numbers of installs (or post install actions) are shown as a function of cost-per-install.
- the user interface 200 can be used by the application provider 126 advertiser to select a target cost per impression (CPI).
- CPI target cost per impression
- the user interface 200 can include features by which the application provider 126 can submit an input associated with a lifetime value of a user.
- the lifetime value of a user may be the total amount of revenue generated from a user who downloads an application and subsequently uses the application.
- the user interface 200 can allow the application provider 126 to specify thresholds (e.g., minimums) to compare, for example, with estimates of lifetime values of users in order to change selection value amounts.
- different selection value amounts can be associated with different ranges of lifetime values of a customer.
- different selection value amounts can be associated with a rate of gain (e.g., $X of revenue over N months) or a return on investment (ROI).
- the selection value can increase as the rate of gain increases (e.g., such that a higher selection value will be used when a higher level of revenue is expected).
- application provider 126 can choose to optimize content selection for post-install user interactions with the application as the goal and then proceed to select the categories (or types) of post-install user interactions the application provider is interested in driving.
- application providers can be recommended to select certain user interactions (e.g., first opening of the application) that the application provider is currently tracking.
- a different selection value landscape can be presented, thereby providing an interactive visualization of how many of the specified post-install user interactions can be achieved at various different selection value levels.
- the application provider can choose to distribute information about the application to optimize installs only by interacting, for example, with a post-install activity option 202 a (e.g., “Drive installs only”). Alternatively, or additionally, the application provider can choose to distribute information about the application in a manner that optimizes post-install activity by interacting with one of the post-install activity options 202 b , 202 c . For example, the application provider 126 using the user interface 200 can select one of the post-install activity options 202 b or 202 c , depending on the strategy that the application provider 126 wants to use for the selection of third-party content that includes information about a particular application (e.g., Example_App 203 ).
- a post-install activity option 202 a e.g., “Drive installs only”.
- the application provider can choose to distribute information about the application in a manner that optimizes post-install activity by interacting with one of the post-install activity options 202 b , 202 c .
- Post-install activity option 202 b can be selected when the selection value strategy is to use a target cost-per-install 204 to drive installs from users who are likely to complete specified in-app actions.
- Post-install activity option 202 c can be selected when the selection value strategy is to use the target cost-per-install 204 to drive installs from users who are likely to provide the highest gain (e.g., spend the most).
- a graph 206 can show estimated installs 206 a relative to an estimated cost-per-install (CPI) 206 b .
- a data point 207 a can identify a position on the graph 206 associated with the current settings within the post-install activity option 202 a.
- post-install user interactions 210 can include in-app actions that can occur (and are specific to) Example_App 203 after the app is installed, such as sign ups (e.g., creation of a user name and password), first-level completes (e.g., completion of a first level of a game or other application), shares in a social network, an in-app purchase of gems (or other items), and third game acquisition.
- sign ups e.g., creation of a user name and password
- first-level completes e.g., completion of a first level of a game or other application
- shares in a social network e.g., an in-app purchase of gems (or other items)
- third game acquisition e.g., third game acquisition.
- Other apps may have a different list of post-install user interactions 210 , including none, some or all of the list of post-install user interactions 210 applicable to Example_App 203 .
- Selected user interactions 212 can identify which ones of the post-install user interactions 210 are currently selected, e.g., sign ups and first-level completes.
- the application provider 126 is indicating, through the user interface 200 , that the selection value strategy for the Example_App 203 is to drive selection values for users receiving the Example_App 203 based on their likelihood of performing sign ups and first level completes.
- a graph 208 can show estimated in-app actions 208 a relative to an estimated cost-per-install (CPI) 208 b .
- a data point 207 b identifies a position on the graph 208 associated with the current settings within the post-install activity option 202 b.
- the user interactions 214 can include spend-related in-app actions that can occur (and are specific to) Example_App 203 after the app is installed, such as sign ups, first-level completes, shares, a gem purchase, and third game acquisition.
- Other apps e.g., different from Example_App 203
- Selected user interactions 216 can identify which ones of the user interactions 214 are currently selected, e.g., the gem purchase.
- a graph 218 can show an estimated in-app actions value 218 a relative to an estimated cost-per-install (CPI) 218 b .
- a data point 207 c can identify a position on the graph 218 associated with the current settings within the post-install activity option 202 c.
- FIG. 5A is a flowchart of an example process 500 for distributing third-party content.

- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages.

For example, the machine learning system can automatically determine a likelihood that a given user will perform a specified post-download activity (e.g., reaching a certain level of a game application or utilizing an application a given number of times post-download) based on characteristics of a user and characteristics of other users that have previously performed the specific post-download activity.

Electronic documents can be provided touser devices 106 byelectronic document servers 104. For example, theelectronic document servers 104 can include servers that host publisher websites. In this example, theuser device 106 can initiate a request for a given publisher webpage, and theelectronic document server 104 that hosts the given publisher webpage can respond to the request by sending machine executable instructions that initiate presentation of the given webpage at theuser device 106. - In another example, the
electronic document servers 104 can include app servers from whichuser devices 106 can download apps. In this example, theuser device 106 can download files required to install an app at theuser device 106, and then execute the downloaded app locally. - Electronic documents can include a variety of content. For example, electronic document can include static content (e.g., text or other specified content) that is within the electronic document itself and/or does not change over time. Electronic documents can also include dynamic content that may change over time or on a per-request basis. For example, a publisher of a given electronic document can maintain a data source that is used to populate portions of the electronic document. In this example, the given electronic document can include a tag or script that causes the
user device 106 to request content from the data source when the given electronic document is processed (e.g., rendered or executed) by auser device 106. Theuser device 106 integrates the content obtained from the data source into a presentation of the given electronic document to create a composite electronic document including the content obtained from the data source. - In some situations, a given electronic document can include a third-party tag or third-party script (e.g., portion of code) that references the third-party
content distribution system 110. In these situations, the third-party tag or third-party script is executed by theuser device 106 when the given electronic document is processed by theuser device 106. Execution of the third-party tag or third-party script configures theuser device 106 to generate arequest 112 for third-party content, which is transmitted over thenetwork 102 to the third-partycontent distribution system 110. For example, the third-party tag or third-party script can enable theuser device 106 to generate packetized data request including a header and payload data. Therequest 112 can include data such as a name (or network location) of a server from which the third-party content is being requested, a name (or network location) of the requesting device (e.g., the user device 106), and/or information that the third-partycontent distribution system 110 can use to select third-party content provided in response to the request. Therequest 112 is transmitted, by theuser device 106, over the network 102 (e.g., a telecommunications network) to a server of the third-partycontent distribution system 110. - The
request 112 can include data specifying the electronic document and characteristics of locations at which third-party content can be presented. For example, data specifying a reference (e.g., URL) to an electronic document (e.g., webpage) in which the third-party content will be presented, available locations (e.g., third-party content slots) of the electronic documents that are available to present third-party content, sizes of the available locations, positions of the available locations within a presentation of the electronic document, and/or media types that are eligible for presentation in the locations can be provided to the third-partycontent distribution system 110. Similarly, data specifying keywords associated with the electronic document (“document keywords”) or entities (e.g., people, places, or things) that are referenced by the electronic document can also be included in the request 112 (e.g., as payload data) and provided to the third-partycontent distribution system 110 to facilitate identification of third-party content items that are eligible for presentation with the electronic document. -
Requests 112 can also include data related to other information, such as information that the user has provided, geographic information indicating a state or region from which the request was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the third-party content will be displayed (e.g., a type of device at which the third-party content will be displayed, such as a mobile device or tablet device). Data specifying characteristics of theuser device 106 can also be provided in therequest 112, such as information that identifies a model of theuser device 106, a configuration of theuser device 106, or a size (e.g., physical size or resolution) of an electronic display (e.g., touchscreen or desktop monitor) on which the electronic document is presented.Requests 112 can be transmitted, for example, over a packetized network, and therequests 112 themselves can be formatted as packetized data having a header and payload data. The header can specify a destination of the packet and the payload data can include any of the information discussed above. - The third-party
content distribution system 110 selects third-party content (e.g., information about apps) that will be presented with the given electronic document in response to receiving therequest 112 and/or using information included in therequest 112. In some implementations, the third-party content is selected in less than a second to avoid errors that could be caused by delayed selection of the third-party content. For example, delays in providing third-party content in response to arequest 112 can result in page load errors at theuser device 106 or cause portions of the electronic document to remain unpopulated even after other portions of the electronic document are presented at theuser device 106. Also, as the delay in providing third-party content to theuser device 106 increases, it is more likely that the electronic document will no longer be presented at theuser device 106 when the third-party content, thereby negatively impacting a user's experience with the electronic document. Further, delays in providing the third-party content can result in a failed delivery of the third-party content, for example, if the electronic document is no longer presented at theuser device 106 when the third-party content is provided. - In some implementations, the third-party
content distribution system 110 is implemented in a distributed computing system that includes, for example, a server and a set ofmultiple computing devices 114 that are interconnected and identify and distribute third-party content in response torequests 112. The set ofmultiple computing devices 114 operate together to identify a set of third-party content that are eligible to be presented in the electronic document from among a corpus of millions of available third-party content (3PC1-x). The millions of available third-party content can be indexed, for example, in a third-party corpus database 116. Each third-party content index entry can reference the corresponding third-party content and/or include distribution parameters (DP1-DPx) (e.g. selection criteria) that condition the distribution of the corresponding third-party content. - In some implementations, the distribution parameters (e.g., selection criteria) for a particular third-party content can include distribution keywords that must be matched (e.g., by electronic documents or terms specified in the request 112) in order for the third-party content to be eligible for presentation. The distribution parameters can also require that the
request 112 include information specifying a particular geographic region (e.g., country or state) and/or information specifying that therequest 112 originated at a particular type of user device (e.g., mobile device or tablet device) in order for the third-party content to be eligible for presentation. The distribution parameters can also specify a selection value (e.g., bid) and/or budget for distributing the particular third-party content. - The identification of the eligible third-party content can be segmented into multiple tasks 117 a-117 c that are then assigned among computing devices within the set of
multiple computing devices 114. For example, different computing devices in the set ofmultiple computing devices 114 can each analyze a different portion of the third-party corpus database 116 to identify various third-party content having distribution parameters that match information included in therequest 112. In some implementations, each given computing device in the set ofmultiple computing devices 114 can analyze a different data dimension (or set of dimensions) and pass results 118 a-118 c of the analysis back to the third-partycontent distribution system 110. For example, the results 118 a-118 c provided by each of the computing devices in the set may identify a subset of third-party content that are eligible for distribution in response to the request and/or a subset of the third-party content that have certain distribution parameters or attributes. - The third-party
content distribution system 110 aggregates the results 118 a-118 c received from the set ofmultiple computing devices 114 and uses information associated with the aggregated results to select one or more instances of third-party content that will be provided in response to therequest 112. For example, the third-partycontent distribution system 110 can select a set of winning third-party content based on the outcome of one or more content evaluation processes, as discussed in further detail below. In turn, the third-partycontent distribution system 110 can generate and transmit, over thenetwork 102, reply data 120 (e.g., digital data representing a reply) that enable theuser device 106 to integrate the set of winning third-party content into the given electronic document, such that the set of winning third-party content and the content of the electronic document are presented together at a display of theuser device 106. - In some implementations, the
user device 106 executes instructions included in thereply data 120, which configures and enables theuser device 106 to obtain the set of winning third-party content from one or more third-party content servers. For example, the instructions in thereply data 120 can include a network location (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) and a script that causes theuser device 106 to transmit a third-party request 121 to the third-party content server 108 to obtain a given winning third-party content from the third-party content server 108. In response to the request, the third-party content server 108 will transmit, to theuser device 106, third-party data 122 that causes the given winning third-party content to be incorporated into the electronic document and presented at theuser device 106. - The third-party
content distribution system 110 can utilize one or more evaluation processes to identify and select the set of winning third-party content for each given request (e.g., based on data corresponding to the request). In some implementations, the evaluation process is not only required to determine which third-party content to select for presentation with the electronic document, but also the type of formatting that will be dynamically (e.g., on a per-request basis) applied to the selected third-party content, and the price that will be paid for presentation of the selected third-party content when presented with the applied formatting. - In some implementations, the third-party
content distribution system 110 may select winning third-party content in response to a given request from among a set of third-party content items (e.g., instances of third-party content) that have been deemed eligible to return to theuser device 106 in response to that request. Eligible third-party content can be identified on a per-request basis according to various data specified in the request, or context associated with the request. For example, the request may indicate a permissible size or aspect ratio of the requested third-party content, and the third-partycontent distribution system 110 may filter the total set of available third-party content to a set of eligible content that satisfies the size or aspect ratio constraint, and any other applicable constraints. The evaluation process for selecting winning third-party content can then be performed only with respect to the set of eligible third-party content. In some examples, the evaluation process may involve scoring and ranking third-party content items. The winning third-party content item may be the highest-ranked item according to the scores. In some implementations, the ineligible third-party content may be excluded from the total set of available content before the content is scored and ranked. In some implementations, the ineligible third-party content may be excluded from the total set of available content after the content is scored and ranked. - As described further with respect to
FIGS. 2-5B , the third-partycontent distribution system 110 may be configured to trigger presentation of information related to applications. For example, the third-partycontent distribution system 110 can receive (or receive notification of) an opportunity to provide third-party content to a user, such as receiving a submitted query or a request to fill a third-party content slot. In response, the third-partycontent distribution system 110 can provide application information associated with an app, such as for a link to download the application. -
FIGS. 2-4 collectively show anexample user interface 200 for application providers to specify strategies for distribution of content related to their applications. For example, using theuser interface 200,application providers 126 can identify post-install activities that are to be used for optimizing the selection of third-party content related to their applications. For example, the application provider can specify that they want information about their application provided to users who will perform one or more of the specified post-install activities. - When presented to an
application provider 126, for example, theuser interface 200 can be populated with a set ofpost-install activities 202 that the application provider is currently tracking (e.g., using an analytics system). The tracking of the post-install activities can be achieved, for example, by the app provider inserting a specific piece of code at a given location within their application, such that when the post-install activity is performed, the code will be executed by the user device and submit information to a tracking server indicating that the specified post-install activity was performed within the application. Theuser interface 200 can receive (through inputs by the application provider) data specifying post-install activities, such as through application provider interactions with one or more of the set ofpost-install activities 202 presented in theuser interface 200. - The
user interface 200 can be used by anapplication provider 126, for example, to set content selection parameters for optimizing (e.g., maximizing or increasing) total conversion volume for an application provided by theapplication provider 126. For example, theuser interface 200 can support a selection value landscape in which selection values and corresponding numbers of installs (or post install actions) are shown as a function of cost-per-install. In some implementations, theuser interface 200 can be used by theapplication provider 126 advertiser to select a target cost per impression (CPI). - In some implementations, the
user interface 200 can include features by which theapplication provider 126 can submit an input associated with a lifetime value of a user. For example, the lifetime value of a user may be the total amount of revenue generated from a user who downloads an application and subsequently uses the application. In some implementations, theuser interface 200 can allow theapplication provider 126 to specify thresholds (e.g., minimums) to compare, for example, with estimates of lifetime values of users in order to change selection value amounts. In some implementations, different selection value amounts can be associated with different ranges of lifetime values of a customer. In some implementations, different selection value amounts can be associated with a rate of gain (e.g., $X of revenue over N months) or a return on investment (ROI). For example, the selection value can increase as the rate of gain increases (e.g., such that a higher selection value will be used when a higher level of revenue is expected). - For example,
application provider 126 can choose to optimize content selection for post-install user interactions with the application as the goal and then proceed to select the categories (or types) of post-install user interactions the application provider is interested in driving. In some implementations, for post-install user interaction optimization, application providers can be recommended to select certain user interactions (e.g., first opening of the application) that the application provider is currently tracking. Depending on the post-install user interactions chosen, a different selection value landscape can be presented, thereby providing an interactive visualization of how many of the specified post-install user interactions can be achieved at various different selection value levels. - In some implementations, the application provider can choose to distribute information about the application to optimize installs only by interacting, for example, with a
post-install activity option 202 a (e.g., “Drive installs only”). Alternatively, or additionally, the application provider can choose to distribute information about the application in a manner that optimizes post-install activity by interacting with one of the post-install activity options 202 b, 202 c. For example, theapplication provider 126 using theuser interface 200 can select one of the post-install activity options 202 b or 202 c, depending on the strategy that theapplication provider 126 wants to use for the selection of third-party content that includes information about a particular application (e.g., Example_App 203). Post-install activity option 202 b can be selected when the selection value strategy is to use a target cost-per-install 204 to drive installs from users who are likely to complete specified in-app actions. Post-install activity option 202 c can be selected when the selection value strategy is to use the target cost-per-install 204 to drive installs from users who are likely to provide the highest gain (e.g., spend the most). In some implementations, agraph 206 can show estimated installs 206 a relative to an estimated cost-per-install (CPI) 206 b. Adata point 207 a, for example, can identify a position on thegraph 206 associated with the current settings within thepost-install activity option 202 a. - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , when post-install activity option 202 b is selected, for example, controls 209 are presented that are used to specifypost-install user interactions 210 to optimize. For example, thepost-install user interactions 210 can include in-app actions that can occur (and are specific to)Example_App 203 after the app is installed, such as sign ups (e.g., creation of a user name and password), first-level completes (e.g., completion of a first level of a game or other application), shares in a social network, an in-app purchase of gems (or other items), and third game acquisition. Other apps (e.g., different from Example_App 203) may have a different list ofpost-install user interactions 210, including none, some or all of the list ofpost-install user interactions 210 applicable toExample_App 203.Selected user interactions 212, for example, can identify which ones of thepost-install user interactions 210 are currently selected, e.g., sign ups and first-level completes. At this time, based on the selecteduser interactions 212, theapplication provider 126 is indicating, through theuser interface 200, that the selection value strategy for theExample_App 203 is to drive selection values for users receiving theExample_App 203 based on their likelihood of performing sign ups and first level completes. In some implementations, agraph 208 can show estimated in-app actions 208 a relative to an estimated cost-per-install (CPI) 208 b. Adata point 207 b identifies a position on thegraph 208 associated with the current settings within the post-install activity option 202 b. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , when post-install activity option 202 c is selected, for example, controls 219 are presented that are associated withuser interactions 214. For example, theuser interactions 214 can include spend-related in-app actions that can occur (and are specific to)Example_App 203 after the app is installed, such as sign ups, first-level completes, shares, a gem purchase, and third game acquisition. Other apps (e.g., different from Example_App 203) may have a different list ofuser interactions 214, including none, some or all of the list ofuser interactions 214 applicable toExample_App 203.Selected user interactions 216, for example, can identify which ones of theuser interactions 214 are currently selected, e.g., the gem purchase. Based on the selecteduser interactions 216, theapplication provider 126 is indicating that the selection value strategy for theExample_App 203 is to distribute information about theExample_App 203 to users based on their likelihood of spending the most acquiring gems in the application. In some implementations, agraph 218 can show an estimated in-app actions value 218 a relative to an estimated cost-per-install (CPI) 218 b. Adata point 207 c, for example, can identify a position on thegraph 218 associated with the current settings within the post-install activity option 202 c. -
FIG. 5A is a flowchart of anexample process 500 for distributing third-party content. In some implementations, the third-partycontent distribution system 110 and components that it includes can perform steps of theprocess 500 using one or more servers and a memory device storing instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-4 and 5B are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 500. For example, stages 1-6 inFIG. 5B track to steps 502-512, respectively. - Data specifying a post-install activity is received from a provider of an application and by one or more servers (502). As an example, the 110 can receive (e.g., at
stage 1 inFIG. 5B ) data specifying apost-install activity 520. Receipt of the data can occur, for example, when theapplication provider 126 uses theuser interface 200 to specify one of thepost-install activities 202 to be used as a selection value strategy for distributing content about an application of theapplication provider 126. If theapplication provider 126 selects post-install activity option 202 b, for example, then theapplication provider 126 can select specific ones of thepost-install user interactions 210 for which the target cost-per-install 204 is to be applied. In some implementations, information associated with the data specifying thepost-install activity 520 can be stored in a data store of universal application campaigns 536 that allow, for example, theapplication provider 126 to specify a single campaign including a single set of content selection parameters to be used across all existing advertisement networks/platforms. A data store ofapplications 538, for example, can include theExample_App 203 of theapplication provider 126, as well as applications for the same anddifferent application providers 126. - An opportunity is identified to provide third-party content to a user (504). For example, the third-party
content distribution system 110 can receive a request forcontent 522, e.g., from auser device 106 a associated with auser 524. The request for content 522 (e.g., atstage 2 inFIG. 5B ) can be, for example, a search query or a request for content to fill a third-party content slot of a resource (e.g., streaming media, a web page, a social network page, or in a native application executing at the user device) presented at theuser device 106 a. In some implementations, the opportunity that is identified can be an opportunity to provide a content item from third-party content 534, which can include, for example, information about applications, including, for example, a link that initiates a download of the application or links to an application download site. - A likelihood is determined that the user will perform the specified post-install activity based on one or more attributes of the user and attributes of users that have previously performed the specified post-install activity in the application (506). A
content selection engine 526, for example, can determine (e.g., atstage 3 inFIG. 5B ) alikelihood 528 that the user will perform the specified post-install activity, such as one of the post-install activities that theapplication provider 126 has specified on theuser interface 200. The likelihood that the user will perform the specified post-install activity can be determined by applying a model generated by a machine learning system to attributes of the user. The one or more attributes of the user can include, for example, an operating system executing on the user device, a version of the operating system and/or user device, a geographic region from which the request for content was received (e.g., a geo-location of the user device), and/or a type of user device from which the request for content was submitted. - The model generated by the machine learning system can take, as input, information about (e.g., attributes of) users who performed the specified post-install activity in the past, and generate a model that predicts whether a user will perform the specified post-install activity based on the input. The model can specify, for example, the importance (e.g., weight) of each of the attributes in predicting whether a user will perform the specified post-install activity. The model (and the importance of the various attributes) can be generated, for example, using linear regression, or another machine learning technique.
- A selection value for third-party content that identifies (e.g., included information about) the application is adjusted based on the determined likelihood (508). In some implementations, the selection value increases as the likelihood increases. For example, based on the selection value strategy and settings provided by the
application provider 126 in theuser interface 200, such as in post-install activity options 202 b and 202 c, thecontent selection engine 526 can provide (e.g., atstage 4 inFIG. 5B ) an adjustedselection value 530, such as to raise the selection value (e.g., in an auction) for one or more content items associated withExample_App 203. The raised selection value can be in lines with the target cost-per-install 204, e.g., so that on average the specified target cost-per-install 204 is achieved. - The third-party content identifying the application is selected based on the adjusted selection value (510). As an example, the
content selection engine 526 can select (e.g., atstage 5 inFIG. 5B ) selected third-party content 532 identifying the application. - The third-party content identifying the application is distributed to a client device of the user (512). For example, the third-party
content distribution system 110 can provide (e.g., atstage 6 inFIG. 5B ) third-party content 532 identifying the application in response to the request forcontent 522. - In some implementations, receiving data specifying a post-install activity comprises receiving data specifying one or more user interactions with the application that are capable of being performed. For example, in addition to specifying the post-install activity options 202 b or 202 c, the
application provider 126 can select particular ones of theuser interactions user interactions application provider 126 is willing to increase a selection value in line with the target cost-per-install 204. - In some implementations, receiving data specifying a post-install activity comprises receiving data specifying a target level of gain to be obtained following install of the application, e.g. the level of gain being defined by one or more or of spend a user and profit, such as a lifetime profit or a profit for some other time period that is related to a value provided by having the
user 524 as a customer. For example, theuser interface 200 can include one or more features that allow theapplication provider 126 to identify a threshold lifetime value threshold, value-to-cost threshold, or some other value associated with a likelihood that the user will achieve after downloading an app (e.g., Example_App 203). - In some implementations, determining the likelihood that the user will perform the specified post-install activity can include the following. Historical user activity data, e.g., accessed from a data store of historical user activity 540, is accessed that specifies prior user activity within the application. User attributes of users that performed the specified post-install activity are accessed, e.g., by analyzing past user activity, including user interactions, before and after installs of applications. A model is generated that provides a likelihood the user will perform the specified post-install activity after install of the application by the user. The model is applied to the one or more attributes of the user to obtain the likelihood. For example, the
content selection engine 526 can use the generated model to determine a likelihood that theuser 524 will perform the user interaction(s) specified in the selection value strategy for the application. As a result, machine learning systems can be used so as to predict, for a given query (e.g., for generating an ad), user, and app combination, a likelihood of the user installing the app and performing a post-install activity. The machine learning system can also similarly generate a model that outputs an estimated post-install lifetime value of a given user based on lifetime values of users having similar attributes as the given user. - In some implementations, determining the likelihood that the user will perform the specified post-install activity includes the following. Historical user activity data is accessed that specifies prior gain obtained through interaction within the application. User attributes of users that interacted with the application are accessed. A model is generated that provides an estimated gain that will be obtained from the user through interaction with the application after install of the application by the user. The model is applied to the one or more attributes of the user to obtain the estimated gain that will be obtained from the user. For example, the
content selection engine 526 can also determine information associated with financial gain that is likely to occur for particular users or groups of users, and the information can be used when adjusting selection values for content items associated with applications. -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram ofexample computing devices Computing device 600 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 600 is further intended to represent any other typically non-mobile devices, such as televisions or other electronic devices with one or more processors embedded therein or attached thereto.Computing device 650 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be examples only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. -
Computing device 600 includes aprocessor 602,memory 604, astorage device 606, a high-speed controller 608 connecting tomemory 604 and high-speed expansion ports 610, and a low-speed controller 612 connecting to low-speed bus 614 andstorage device 606. Each of thecomponents processor 602 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 600, including instructions stored in thememory 604 or on thestorage device 606 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 616 coupled to high-speed controller 608. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 600 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 604 stores information within thecomputing device 600. In one implementation, thememory 604 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 604 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 604 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. - The
storage device 606 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 600. In one implementation, thestorage device 606 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, thestorage device 606 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 604, thestorage device 606, or memory onprocessor 602. - The high-
speed controller 608 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 600, while the low-speed controller 612 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is an example only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 608 is coupled tomemory 604, display 616 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 610, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 612 is coupled tostorage device 606 and low-speed bus 614. The low-speed bus 614 (e.g., a low-speed expansion port), which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth®, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet), may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The
computing device 600 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure.

computing device 650 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as acellular telephone 680. It may also be implemented as part of asmartphone 682, personal digital assistant, or other mobile device. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. Other programming paradigms can be used, e.g., functional programming, logical programming, or other programming. As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” “computer-readable medium” refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
- To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), and the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- Thus, particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
