Embodiment
System utilizes various signal to the information scoring of crossing over multiple platform, and described information, such as based on web resource content and the local application content of browser, then uses consistent marking scheme to for standardizing to the score value of information rank.In some implementations, system is marked to this locality application based on local application content and other signal, and utilizes web resource score value to standardize to this locality application score value.The signal used can comprise overall signal and the signal specific to subscriber equipment, the holistic correlation of overall signal's instruction local application internal information, the correlativity that this locality specific to the signal designation subscriber equipment of subscriber equipment is applied.
System acceptance web resource score value, each corresponds to web resource, and as the tolerance of web resource for the correlativity of search operation.For this locality application, system determines local application score value, and each local application score value corresponds to local application, and as the tolerance of local application for the correlativity of search operation.Then, for this locality application with the corresponding web resource of having marked, local application score value is typically canonicalized as web resource score value.Based on these standardization, the system determination common specification factor, and this locality application score value standardizing factor being applied to this locality application without corresponding web resource.Then, the web resource of scoring and this locality application of scoring are correspondingly contrasted rank mutually.
In some implementations, web resource score value and local application score value are independent of inquiring about the quality score determined.Such as, local application score value can based on performing the link of local application from other resources or can installing the link of the resource of local application from it; The number of times of local application is installed; From the semantic signal etc. that user comment draws.Can determine web resource score value and local application score value before query time, and web resource score value and local application score value can be stored in corresponding web resource and local application references.Then, score value can be typically canonicalized, and be combined based on the content of ad hoc inquiry and web resource and the local relevance score applying the content of score value.In other implementations, web resource score value and local application score value are the search score values depending on inquiry at least in part.Such as, the combination that score value can be quality score and relevance score is searched for.Then, the search score value of local application is typically canonicalized, and the raw application in this locality of the web resource of then marking and scoring is correspondingly contrasted rank mutually.
Be described in more detail below the process of the operation of the system of indexes applications page data and the Search Results of the application page.
Fig. 1 is the block diagram of the example context 100 of the application page of index and search this locality application.The computer network 102 connection resource publisher website 104 of such as the Internet, application publisher 106, subscriber equipment 108 and search engine 120.
Publish resource person website 104 comprises one or more web resource 105, and it is associated with territory and by the one or more trust server in one or more position.Usually, publish resource person website is the set of the webpage formatd with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) (HTML), can comprise text, image, content of multimedia and compile element.Each website 104 is safeguarded by content publisher, and content publisher is the entity controlling, manage and/or have website 104.
Web page resources can be provided by network 102 by publisher website 104 and have any data of resource address (such as URL(uniform resource locator) (URL)).Web resource can be html page, image file, video file, audio file and feeding source, only lifts a few example.Described resource can comprise embedding information, such as metamessage and hyperlink; And/or embedding instruction, such as client-side script.Application publisher website 106 can also comprise one or more web resource 105, and provides local application 107.As mentioned above, local application 107 is application that specialized designs is run in special user equipment operating system and machine firmware.Local application 107 can comprise the multiple versions being designed to run in different platform.Such as, corresponding with movie database website this locality is applied and can be included in second local the 3rd this locality applied and run on first kind flat computer of first local apply, running on Second Type smart phone that first kind smart phone runs and apply.
As used in this specification, " the application page " is specific display environment in the application of this locality and wherein displaying contents, such as text, image etc.The application page is specific to the application of specific this locality, and local application is the specific operation system specific to subscriber equipment 108.The application page is with the web resource difference played up: generate to apply the page and apply the page in this locality is applied and apply specific to this locality, and web resource can be played up in the compatible any browser of web page resources, and independent of the operating system of subscriber equipment.
Subscriber equipment 108 is the electronic equipments under user controls.Subscriber equipment 108 can ask and receive web page resources 105 and local application 107 usually by network 102.Exemplary user equipment 108 comprises personal computer, mobile communication equipment and flat computer.
In order to search for web resource 105 and local application 107, search engine 120 accesses web index 112 and application references 114.Web index 112 is such as from the index crawling the Internet resources 105 that publisher website 104 builds.Application references 114 is indexes of the applying web page of local application 107, and uses application data extraction apparatus and processor 110 and index 112 to build.Although be depicted as independent index, web index 116 and application references 114 can be combined in single index.
Subscriber equipment 108 submits search inquiry to search engine 120.In response to each inquiry, search engine 120 accesses web index 112 and application references 114, to identify resource associated with the query and application respectively.Search engine 120 realizes resource scorer 132 process of web resource scoring and the application scorer process 134 to this locality application scoring.Various suitable search engine algorithms may be used for realizing resource scorer 132.The operation of application scorer 134 is described in more detail below with reference to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.
Search 120 utilizes normalizer 136 this locality to be applied score value to standardize to public ratio nominal with web resource score value.Below with reference to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 Description standard in more detail.After standardizing to score value, search engine 120 by web resource and the mutual rank each other of Search Results, and identifies the web resource in the form of web resource searching result and local application searches result and application respectively.Once generate, Search Results is provided to the subscriber equipment 108 receiving inquiry from it.
Web resource searching result identifies web resource and provides the data that the search engine 110 of the information meeting particular search query generates.The web resource searching result of resource can comprise web page title, from the text extract of Resource Access and the URLs of resource, the URL of such as webpage.Local application searches result specifies local application, and generates in response to the search of the application references 114 of the application page.Various function can be called by the selection of application searches result.Such as, local application start (if being arranged on subscriber equipment 108) can be made to the selection of local application searches result, and generate the example comprising the application page of the content relevant to search inquiry quoted in application searches result.This function is called as " deeply linking " in application searches result.
Fig. 2 is scoring and carries out normalized system flow Figure 200 to resource score value and local application score value.It is the process flow diagram 300 of marking and resource score value and local application score value are carried out normalized instantiation procedure with reference to Fig. 3 descriptive system flow process Figure 200, Fig. 3.Process 300 can realize in the data processing equipment of one or more computing machines carrying out data communication.
Process 300 receives web resource score value (302).Each web resource score value corresponds to web resource, and is the tolerance of web resource for the correlativity of search operation.Such as, web resource score value can be quality score, its measuring relative to the importance of other resource that be resource, or can be relevance score as an alternative, and it is the tolerance of the correlativity of resource and inquiry.In the latter case, relevance score can be based in part on authoritative score value.Process 300 can receive score value, such as from resource scorer 132 from of a search engine assembly.
Process 300 determines local application score value (304) for this locality application.Each local application score value corresponds to local application, and is the tolerance of local application for the correlativity of search operation.As resource score value, local application score value can be quality score or relevance score.Search engine 120 uses application scorer 134 access application index 114 to generate application score value.In some implementations, the overall signal that scorer 134 can consider the holistic correlation indicating local application internal information is applied.It is recency and intersect resource ownership that the example of this overall signal comprises link data, installation data, usage data, ratings data, semantic signal data, key word and content of text, application.Also other suitable overall signals can be used.
In some implementations, link data describes the quality and quantity that can point to local application or can install the link of the web resource of local application from it.Such as, the quality of link can based on the quality of Internet resources (or the territory belonging to web resource) comprising link.
Installation data describes the installation number of times (or as an alternative download time) of local application.Link data can be polymerized from multiple different downloaded resources.In some implementations, download time is divided by application type.Such as, if local application has smart mobile phone version and dull and stereotyped version, then independent download time is determined to each application.In other implementation, the download time of each local application type can be polymerized, to determine total local application download time.The link of counting also can comprise the application link applied to this locality from the application page of other local application.Local application score value can be caused to increase relative to the very high-caliber download of other local application, and the very low-level download of other local application relatively can cause local application score value to decline.
The entirety that usage data describes application uses.Described entirety uses based on every equipment or often can install.The example of use information comprises the illustrative time, based on the participation of the number of times of application page browsing and user interactions and other suitable operation parameter values.Local application score value can be caused to increase relative to the very high-caliber use of other local application, and the very low-level use of other local application relatively can cause local application score value to decline.
Ratings data describes the grading of user's application.In some implementations, ratings data divides according to version, makes the grading of previous version not affect the grading of current version.Ratings data can be collected from downloading the local resource applying or otherwise describe ratings data.Very positive grading can cause local application score value to increase, and very passive evaluation can cause local application score value to decline.Such as, " star " for application-specific to be graded etc. and can be collected from different web sites, and is using in application rank.
Semantic signal data describe the user emotion about this locality application.Such as, can by using mood testing process to determine semantic signal data to the user input data of such as user comment.Very positive mood can cause local application score value to increase, and very passive mood can cause local application score value to decline.
Key word and content of text may be used for this locality application scoring to special key words.Such as, special key words can be one group common with high frequency key word, or as an alternative, can be the keyword from the inquiry received.Various suitable relevance algorithms can be used.
Local application is recency to be described local application (or current version of local application) and how long has issued.Very near application can receive scoring punishment or the scoring upper limit (no matter be front and negative), and relatively long-time (such as more than one month) obtainable this locality application can without undergoing such punishment or the upper limit.
The correlativity of web page resources and quality signal are belonged to the application of corresponding this locality by resource ownership of intersecting, and alternatively, the quality signal that this locality is applied are belonged to corresponding web page resource.This intersect that ownership reduces may due to web page resources or corresponding local application be not enough distribute the harmful scoring caused and affect.Similarly, ownership of intersecting also can consider the poor quality of web page resources or the application of corresponding this locality.Such as, if specific this locality application data set too little cause statistically unreliable, but its corresponding web resource has the data set of statistically robust, then the score value of website can belong to this application.Convergent-divergent can be carried out to ownership based on the statistics of data set.Such as, the data set along with application becomes more greatly and more reliably, can drop to 0% from website to the ownership of application from 100%.
In some implementations, the signal specific to subscriber equipment that scorer 134 it is also conceivable to the correlativity of this locality application of equipment for indicating user is applied.Such as, the signal of special user equipment can be considered when inquiring about.Example specific to the signal of subscriber equipment comprises installment state, instantiation state, frequency of utilization and application stability.Also other suitable signals specific to subscriber equipment can be used.
Whether can have according to subscriber equipment specific this locality that subscriber equipment is installed should be used for determining installment state.If install local application, then system can increase the correlativity of the application of this special user equipment relative to other subscriber equipmenies not installing local application.
Whether can have according to subscriber equipment specific this locality that subscriber equipment runs should be used for determining instantiation state.If local application runs, then system increases the correlativity of application.
Frequency of utilization is described in the frequency that preset time, section subscriber equipment used this locality to apply.Along with the increase of frequency of utilization, system increases the correlativity of this locality application of special user equipment.
How application stability describes local application stability on a user device.With this locality apply represent better stability another subscriber equipment compared with, trend towards collapse, freeze or run on special user equipment other mistakes this locality application be confirmed as that there is less correlativity.Stability can be subject to user facility operation system or other application impact by this locality may be disturbed to apply.
Process 300 determines the suitable subset of local application, and each this locality application in the suitable subset determined has the corresponding web resource (306) for this locality application.As used herein, corresponding web resource applies the resource providing same or analogous function and/or provide same or analogous information.Such as, weather website can provide weather data and prediction, and can have the corresponding this locality application providing identical data and prediction.Similarly, movie database website can provide the information of film, and can have the corresponding this locality application providing identical data.Because some local application may not have corresponding website, identify the suitable subset of local application.Normalizer 136 can be configured to identify corresponding web resource.Such as, corresponding web resource address can be stored in application references 114, and normalizer 136 access index 114 is to determine the corresponding web resource of local application.As provided indicated by the arrow between local application 107 and resource 105 in fig. 2, the suitable subset of local application 107 has respective resources 105.
Process 300 is determined this locality to be applied the standardizing factor (308) that score value adjusts to nominal public ratio according to the web resource score value of the corresponding web resource of local application in this locality application score value of this locality application in the first suitable subset and the suitable subset of foundation first.Such as, normalizer receives web resource score value { RS
1, RS
5, RS
8... and apply score value { AS accordingly
1, AS
5, AS
8....Normalizer 136 can use various suitable process to the score value that standardizes.Such as, normalizer 136 can depend on corresponding web score value and apply score value along with variable comes linear regression this locality.Various suitable linear regression technique can be used.In another implementation, each this locality application score value can represent based on various signal and corresponding weight, and machine-learning process can be used to adjust weight.Therefore, the standardizing factor NF in this implementation is weight vectors.
Then, standardizing factor is applied to local application score value to generate normalized this locality application score value (310) by process 300.Such as, as shown in Figure 2, normalizer 136 will apply score value { AS
l, AS
2, AS
3... adjust to the score value { AS' of adjustment
1, AS'
2, AS'
3....
Then, process 300 applies rank (312) based on web resource score value and normalized this locality application score value to web resource and this locality.Rank indicates each web resource and local application relative to other web resources each and the correlativity of local application for search operation.Because the score value { AS' of gained
1, AS'
2, AS'
3... and { RS
1, RS
2, RS
3... nominally be public, so resource and local application can comparatively ranks mutually.
