Abstract
In a method implemented in a base station configured to communicate with user equipment located in a coverage area of a cell associated with the base station, the base station generates one or more first messages that collectively indicate a set of one or more network slices (e.g., nsais or S-nsais) supported by the cell and one or more offsets associated with the set of network slices. The one or more offsets are one or more cell selection offsets that can be used by the user equipment in determining suitability of the cell for cell selection or one or more cell reselection offsets that can be used by the user equipment in determining one or more cell ranks for cell reselection. The base station transmits (310) one or more first messages (e.g., including SIB or dedicated RRC messages) to the user equipment.
Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communications, and more particularly to radio access networks and network slicing.
Background
As the increase in connectivity and mobility enables the transition and innovation of many industries (e.g., manufacturing, transportation, energy, administration, health care, etc.), there is a corresponding increase in demand for wireless communications in the vertical market. Applications/services in these vertical markets may have widely varying performance requirements with respect to parameters such as throughput, capacity, latency, mobility, reliability, and the like. Network slicing (e.g., as provided in a 5G network under 3GPP release 15) may provide a flexible and scalable network architecture supporting these different requirements by superimposing logical networks with different services on the same physical network. However, efforts to support network slicing have been focused almost exclusively on the Core Network (CN) to date, while relatively little attention has been paid to the Radio Access Network (RAN). Thus, there is an opportunity to improve network performance by incorporating slice-based functionality in the RAN.
Disclosure of Invention
The base station of the present disclosure may inform a User Equipment (UE) as to which network slice or slices (also referred to herein simply as "slice(s)") are supported by the cell of the base station, allowing the UE to make faster decisions about network connectivity (e.g., whether to select the cell, or if the cell is already a serving cell, whether to reselect to a different cell). In the embodiments and scenarios discussed herein, each slice may correspond to, for example, network slice selection assistance information (nsai), or to a "single nsai" (S-nsai) within an nsai. For example, the base station may broadcast slice information in a System Information Block (SIB) such as SIB1 or transmit slice information in a Radio Resource Control (RRC) message during an RRC reconfiguration, establishment, re-establishment, or connection recovery procedure. In some embodiments, the base station provides slice information as a bitmap, where each bit corresponds to a different network slice.
In some embodiments, the UE may request the base station to provide information on network support for a particular slice of interest to the UE, as needed. For example, when the UE is ready (or expects it to transmit uplink data associated with a slice soon) but the serving cell does not support the slice (or, in some embodiments/scenarios, when the UE is ready to transmit uplink data and the serving cell chooses not to broadcast system information about which slice(s) the cell supports), the UE may request such information. The base station may respond, for example, by indicating Radio Access Technologies (RATs), frequencies, or neighbor cell identifiers supporting a particular slice, and/or may provide other information that may facilitate changes in UE network connectivity supporting the slice (e.g., random Access Channel (RACH) configuration that the UE may use in neighbor cells supporting the slice, etc.).
The UE may request network support information by sending a random access message of a RACH procedure (e.g., an MsgA of a two-step contention-based RACH procedure or an Msgl of a four-step contention-based RACH procedure) to the base station using a RACH configuration (e.g., preamble and/or PRACH occasion) specifically associated with the network slice of interest. Prior to the request, the base station may provide the UE with a plurality of dedicated slice-specific RACH configurations (e.g., in SIB or dedicated RRC messages) so that the UE may identify and use the appropriate RACH configuration when requesting network support information for a given slice. Upon receiving the random access message, the base station may determine/identify a slice based on which RACH configuration (e.g., which preamble and/or PRACH occasion) the UE uses to transmit the random access message. For example, the base station may then include the requested network support information for the slice in a response random access message (e.g., modified Msg2 or MsgB). In some embodiments and/or scenarios, the UE uses only a dedicated slice-specific RACH configuration to request network support information for one or more slices without attempting to gain access to the channel of the current cell via a RACH procedure. For example, the UE may remain in an idle state or an inactive state regardless of channel availability on the current cell, so RACH procedure may be abbreviated. Thus, as used herein, the term "RACH procedure" may refer to a complete RACH procedure (e.g., substantially as specified in the standards of the current RAT), or may refer to only a portion of such a procedure (e.g., no corresponding HARQ process at the base station), and does not necessarily require that the procedure (or message, etc.) be used in an attempt to obtain channel access.
In some embodiments, the RAN uses the offset to steer the UE toward or away from particular cells based on whether those cells support network slices that the UE needs (or prefers, desires, etc.) to utilize. To this end, the base station may transmit an offset for use in cell selection and/or an offset for use in cell reselection. For cell selection, each base station may broadcast its own positive and/or negative offset, which the UE in range may then use when calculating the value of cell suitability (e.g., by modifying the S standard as defined in TS 38.304). For example, the UE may apply a positive offset (or no offset) for a first cell supporting at least one network slice of interest to the UE and a negative offset (or no offset) for a second cell not supporting any network slice of interest to the UE.
For cell reselection, the serving base station may transmit an offset of its own (serving) cell, as well as an indication of "popular" neighbor cells supporting the same network slice or subset of network slices as the serving cell. The UE may then use this information and its own knowledge of slicing requirements/preferences to positively and/or negatively offset the ranking of the serving cell and neighboring cells (e.g., by modifying R as defined in TS 38.304 s And R is n )。
Whether used for cell selection and/or cell reselection, the offset may be slice specific (e.g., a different offset for each slice) or more generally applicable (e.g., a single offset that the UE applies or does not apply based on whether the cell supports at least one desired slice). In embodiments where the offsets are slice-specific, and where the UE wants to support multiple slices, the UE may use various techniques to determine cell suitability or cell ranking (e.g., summing all offsets associated with the desired network slice, or using the maximum or minimum of these offsets, etc.).
One example embodiment of these techniques is a method in a base station configured to communicate with user equipment located in a coverage area of a cell associated with the base station, the method comprising: generating, by processing hardware of the base station, a first message indicating a set of one or more network slices supported by the cell; and transmitting the first message to the user equipment.
Another example embodiment of these techniques is a method in a user equipment configured to communicate with a base station when located in a coverage area of a cell associated with the base station, the method comprising: receiving a first message from a base station; processing, by processing hardware of the user equipment, the first message to determine a set of one or more network slices supported by the cell; and determining, by the processing hardware and based at least in part on the set of network slices, whether to transmit, via the cell, data associated with the desired network slice.

Detailed Description
Fig. 1 depicts an example wireless communication system 100 in which a UE 102 is configured to communicate with base stations 104A, 104B, and 104C (collectively referred to herein as "base stations 104") at different times or in some scenarios and implementations that support dual connectivity or carrier aggregation at the same time. The UE 102 may be any suitable device capable of wireless communication with the base station 104 (e.g., any of the example user devices discussed below following the description of the figures). For example, base stations 104 may include any one or more suitable types of base stations, such as an evolved node B (eNB), a next generation eNB (ng-eNB), and/or a 5G node B (gNB). In the example shown in fig. 1, each of the base stations 104 is connected to a Core Network (CN) 110.
As a more specific example, base station 104A may be an eNB supporting an SI interface for communicating with EPC 110 of CN 110, and base stations 104B and 104C may be gnbs each supporting an NG interface for communicating with 5gc 112 of CN 110. In other embodiments and/or scenarios, the base stations 104A, 104B, and/or 104C may alternatively (or also) operate according to other types of Radio Access Technologies (RATs), and/or the base stations 104A, 104B, and/or 104C may alternatively (or also) connect to other types of CNs. For example, base station 104A may operate as a ng-eNB and/or base station 104B may operate as an en-gcb. In different embodiments, base stations 104A, 104B, and/or 104C implement the same RAT or different RATs and support the same or different frequency bands. To exchange messages directly with each other during the various embodiments and scenarios discussed below, base station 104 may support an Xn and/or X2 interface, as shown in fig. 1.
EPC 111 may include, among other components, a serving gateway (S-GW) 112 and a Mobility Management Entity (MME) 114.S-GW 112 is typically configured to transmit user plane packets related to audio calls, video calls, internet traffic, etc., and MME 114 is typically configured to manage authentication, registration, paging, and other related functions. The 5gc 160 includes a User Plane Function (UPF) 162 and an access and mobility management function (AMF) 164, and/or a Session Management Function (SMF) 166.UPF 162 is typically configured to transport user plane packets related to audio calls, video calls, internet traffic, etc., AMF 164 is typically configured to manage authentication, registration, paging, and other related functions, and SMF 166 is typically configured to manage PDU sessions.
In general, the wireless communication system 100 may include any suitable number of base stations supporting either NR cells or EUTRA cells. More specifically, CN 110 may be connected to any suitable number of base stations supporting NR cells and/or EUTRA cells. Although the examples herein refer primarily to specific CN types EPC and 5GC, and specific RAT types EUTRA and 5G NR, in general, the techniques of this disclosure may also be applied to other suitable radio access and/or core network technologies, such as, for example, sixth generation (6G) radio access and/or 6G core networks.
In the example embodiment of fig. 1, base station 104A covers cell 124A, base station 104B covers cell 124B, and base station 104C covers cell 124C. In cell 124, UE 102 may use the RACH procedure to obtain access to an uplink channel for communication with a corresponding one of base stations 104. For example, UE 102 and base station 104A may support one or more RACH procedures. In one embodiment, the UE 102 and the base station 104A support only a contention-based four-step RACH procedure. In another embodiment (e.g., if the base station 104A supports a 5G NR RAT), the UE 102 and the base station 104A may support a contention-based four-step RACH procedure, a contention-based two-step RACH procedure, and a "fallback" procedure for changing from a two-step to a four-step RACH procedure. In cell 124A, other UEs (not shown in fig. 1) may also operate and sometimes attempt to gain access to the same uplink channel (e.g., the same time-frequency resources used for uplink transmission) as UE 102. Other UEs may be similar to UE 102 or may be other types of devices that are similarly capable of communicating with base station 104A via cell 124A using the same RACH procedure as UE 102.
As shown in fig. 1, the base station 104A is equipped with processing hardware 130, which may include one or more general-purpose processors (e.g., central Processing Units (CPUs)) and non-transitory computer-readable memory storing machine-readable instructions executable on the one or more general-purpose processors and/or special-purpose processing units. The processing hardware 130 includes an Access Stratum (AS) controller 132 and a slice support unit 134. The AS controller 132 generally supports processes at an AS layer, such AS the AS layer discussed below in connection with fig. 2 (e.g., PHY, RRC, MAC, etc.). For example, AS controller 132 may control RACH procedures, RRC messaging, and the like for base station 104. The AS controller 132 may be a single controller, including a plurality of different controllers (e.g., RACH controller, RRC controller, PHY controller, etc.), or may be part of another controller.
Regarding the RACH procedure, the AS controller 132 may configure a UE (e.g., UE 102) with a set of available time-frequency resources (e.g., PRACH occasions), from which the UE may select a particular time-frequency resource to transmit a first message (e.g., msgA or Msg 1) of the RACH procedure. The AS controller 132 may also or alternatively configure the UE with a set of preambles, each preamble associated with a different PRACH occasion, wherein any UE using a particular PRACH occasion for a RACH procedure includes the corresponding preamble in a first RACH message (e.g., msgA or Msg 1). In one such embodiment, the AS controller 132 may also associate each preamble/PRACH occasion with a different PUSCH occasion (i.e., time-frequency resource for uplink data transmission), or possibly with a different set of multiple PUSCH occasions, and the UE using a particular preamble and PRACH occasion transmits or retransmits data (e.g., in MsgA or Msg 3) using the corresponding PUSCH occasion (or one occasion from the set of corresponding PUSCH occasions). Each set of time-frequency resources and its associated preamble (and possibly other information such as how many times the preamble was transmitted per attempt, etc.) constitutes a single RACH configuration.
In some embodiments, AS controller 132 may also configure the UE with RACH resources dedicated/reserved for purposes other than or in addition to channel access. Specifically, and AS discussed in further detail below, AS controller 132 may configure the UE with a particular RACH configuration dedicated to requesting network support information for a particular slice (e.g., a first RACH configuration for requesting information about a first slice, a second RACH configuration for requesting information about a second slice, etc.). Although the examples provided herein refer to requests for information about a particular slice (singular), it should be understood that such requests may also relate to one or more additional slices (e.g., a first RACH configuration is reserved for requesting information about a set of two particular slices, a second RACH configuration is reserved for requesting information about a set of five other slices, etc.).
The base stations 104B and 104C are equipped with processing hardware, which may be similar to the processing hardware 130, but may differ in some respects (e.g., if different RATs are supported, and possibly by excluding the slice support unit 134, etc.).
The AS controller 142 generally supports processes at an AS layer, such AS the AS layer discussed below in connection with fig. 2 (e.g., PHY, RRC, MAC, etc.). The AS controller 142 may be a single controller, including a plurality of different controllers (e.g., RACH controller, RRC controller, PHY controller, etc.), or may be part of another controller. The AS controller 142 may control RACH procedures, cell selection and reselection procedures, etc. for the UE 102.
The AS controller 142 may perform cell selection and reselection substantially AS defined in 3gpp TS 38.304. For cell selection, if the cell is part of a selected Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or registered PLMN (or PLMN of equivalent PLMN list, etc.), and if cell suitability criteria are met, the AS controller 142 may consider the cell "suitable", wherein the cell suitability criteria relate to various cell measurements (e.g., signal power and signal quality). For cell reselection, the AS controller 142 may rank the serving cell and the neighbor cells based on similar cell measurements. However, in some embodiments, AS controller 142 also applies an offset for a particular cell based on the level of support for one or more slices of interest to UE 102 when evaluating cell suitability criteria for cell selection and/or when ranking cells for cell reselection. This type of offset is discussed in more detail below with reference to fig. 9 and 10.
The 3GPP NR specifications support configuration of dedicated priorities for use in cell reselection, where each of the priorities corresponds to a different NR and/or inter-RAT frequency. However, in some embodiments, the network (e.g., base station 104A) may configure a UE, such as UE 102, with a particular set of such frequency priorities (from multiple potential/candidate sets) based at least in part on the slice information. For example, the UE 102 may be preconfigured with (stored) sets of indices, where each index corresponds to a different set of frequency priorities. The base station (e.g., base station 104A) may then broadcast a particular index, and UE 102 may apply a set of priorities corresponding to the index. For example, the base station may select which index to broadcast based on the slices supported by the base station.
Alternatively, the UE 102 may be preconfigured (e.g., stored) with a set of geographic tag values, where each value corresponds to a different set of frequency priorities. For example, the geographic tag may be a Tracking Area Code (TAC), RAN area code, cell list, or Local Area Data Network (LADN) information. A base station (e.g., base station 104A) may broadcast a particular tag value (e.g., a particular TAC, a particular RAN area code, etc.), and UE 102 may apply a set of frequency priorities corresponding to the tag value. For example, the base station may select which tag value to broadcast based on the slice(s) supported by the base station.
In either case (index-based or tag-based frequency priority set), the UE 102 may use the indicated frequency priority set during cell reselection. For example, UE 102 may reselect to a cell supporting a high priority frequency, more likely according to a priority set of frequencies indicated by an index or geotag value as specified in the current specification (3 gpp TS 38.304).
The NAS controller 144 typically supports procedures at the NAS layer, such as mobility management procedures. NAS controller 144 may be a single controller, including a plurality of different controllers, or may be part of another controller (e.g., another controller that also includes AS controller 142). NAS controller 144 may communicate with AS controller 142 via inter-protocol layer (IPL) messages. In some implementations, after one or more higher (application) layers notify NAS controller 144 of the slice needs/preferences, NAS controller 144 uses IPL messages to notify AS controller 142 of which slices are needed or preferred by UE 102. For example, the NAS controller 144 may provide this information specifically for cell selection or cell reselection purposes. NAS controller 144 may also inform AS controller 142 of priorities associated with some or all of the desired slices and/or provide an indication of whether each slice is a basic or non-basic slice.
In different embodiments and/or scenarios, for example, each desired slice (e.g., each nsai) may correspond to a particular PDU session (e.g., operator defined PDU session, always-on PDU session, PDU session with pending data, etc.), to a "requested" nsai configured by the (home) network (e.g., as defined in 3GPP specification TS 23.501), to a urs (UE routing policy), or to a local configuration of UE 102 (e.g., user configuration or OEM configuration). In general, the slice of interest may be determined locally by the UE 102 (e.g., based on which applications are running at the UE 102), and/or may be configured by the network (e.g., via NAS messages received by the UE 102 and NAS controller 144).
The network may also control, at least to some extent, how the UE 102 uses the desired slice information. For example, for the purpose of obtaining network support for a particular segment, AMF 164 may send NAS message to UE 102 indicating whether UE 102 is allowed to perform cell selection and/or reselection. Based on the NAS message, the NAS controller 144 may then include (or omit) a particular slice of interest from the list that the NAS controller 144 sends to the AS controller 142. For example, if the AMF 164 (or other network node) has notified the UE 102 that the UE 102 is not allowed to perform cell selection or reselection based on the slice, the NAS controller 144 may omit the desired slice from the list. The AMF 164 (or another network node) may also configure the UE 102 with other restrictions on how the NAS layer (i.e., NAS controller 144) shares the slice of interest with lower layers (i.e., with AS controller 142). For example, the AMF 164 may instruct the NAS controller 144 to share all desired nsais with the AS controller 142, to share only the highest priority S-nsais of the desired nsais with the AS controller 142, or to not share any desired nsais with the AS controller 142, etc. In some embodiments and/or scenarios, the NAS controller 144 also or alternatively determines the sharing and use of desired slice information based on a pre-configuration (e.g., user and/or OEM configuration) at the UE 102.
The slice support query unit 146 may be implemented by the AS controller 142 and/or by another controller of the UE 102. In general, the slice support query unit 146 performs one or more processes for requesting slice-specific network support information from a base station (e.g., base station 104A). In some implementations, the slice support query unit 146 first identifies the slice for which network support information is desired. In embodiments in which the slice support querying unit 146 is executed, for example, by the AS controller 142, and after the NAS controller 144 provides the AS controller 142 with a list of desired slices, the slice support querying unit 146 may compare the list to slice support information received by the UE 102 from a base station (e.g., base station 104A). If the overlap of the desired slice and the supported slices does not meet certain criteria (e.g., the serving base station supports at least one desired slice or all desired slices, or all desired slices with at least one threshold priority level, etc.), then the slice support query unit 146 initiates a slice support query procedure. As discussed below in connection with fig. 3-5, the query procedure may be a RACH procedure that uses a RACH configuration (i.e., a specific set of RACH resources, such as preambles and PRACH occasions) for the purpose of making such a query, or may be another type of procedure (e.g., UE 102 transmitting an RRC message that explicitly identifies the slice requesting network support information for it).
In some implementations, the UE 102 may transmit its list of desired slices (possibly with priority values) to the serving base station. For example, the UE 102 may include such a list in an rrcconfiguration complete message transmitted by the UE 102 to the base station 104A. The base station 104A may then use the desired slice information to locate better network support for one or more slices and possibly initiate a change in network connectivity of the UE 102. For example, the base station 104A may determine that it does not support one, some, or all of the slices of interest to the UE 102, and in response, (1) determine a neighboring cell (and/or another RAT) supporting the slice(s), and (2) perform a handover to the neighboring cell (e.g., cell 124B or 124C) or otherwise redirect the UE 102 to the neighboring cell (and/or another RAT).
Fig. 2 illustrates in a simplified manner an example radio protocol stack 200 according to which a ue 102 may communicate with a base station 104A (and possibly base stations 104B and 104C). In the example stack 200, a physical layer (PHY) 202 provides transport channels to a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer 204, which Medium Access Control (MAC) layer 204 in turn provides logical channels to a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer 206. The RLC layer 206 in turn provides RLC channels to a Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer 208, which Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer 208 in turn communicates with an RRC layer 210. The RRC layer 210 encapsulates and interprets RRC Protocol Data Units (PDUs), which may contain any of various types of RRC messages associated with different RRC procedures (e.g., connection setup or re-establishment procedures, measurement reporting procedures, etc.). The layers 202 to 210 form at least part of an Access Stratum (AS) 212.
The non-access stratum (NAS) 214 of the protocol stack 200 includes, among other possible layers, one or more Mobility Management (MM) layers 216 for handling registration, attachment or tracking area update procedures. As further shown in fig. 2, the protocol stack 200 also supports higher layer protocols 218 for various services and applications. For example, higher layer protocols 218 may include Internet Protocol (IP), transmission control protocol, and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
In some embodiments, AS controllers 132 and 142 of FIG. 1 implement the procedures of AS 212, while NAS controller 144 of FIG. 1 implements the procedures of NAS 214. While fig. 2 depicts a particular order of the various layers 202, 204, 206, 208, 210, 216, and 218, it should be understood that in some embodiments and/or scenarios, one or more of the depicted layers may operate in a manner that does not strictly follow the order shown. Further, in other embodiments, the UE 102 and the base station (e.g., base station 104A) may alternatively operate according to different protocol stacks.
Next, various types of RAN-level procedures/functions that the base station 104A and the UE 102 (and in some cases, the base station 104B and/or 104C) may implement are discussed with reference to fig. 3-10. In particular, fig. 3 illustrates an example scenario in which the base station 104A provides the UE 102 with information specifying which slice(s) the base station 104A supports, after which the UE 102 requests network support information for a different (unsupported) slice, and fig. 4A, 4B, and 5 illustrate alternative RACH procedures that the UE 102 may initiate to make such a request. Fig. 6-8 illustrate an example scenario in which the UE 102 has data associated with multiple slices ready for uplink transmission, and fig. 9 illustrates an example scenario in which the base station 104 provides the UE 102 with an offset that steers the UE 102 toward or away from its associated cell during cell selection. Fig. 10 illustrates an example scenario in which base station 104A is serving UE 102 and provides one or more offsets to UE 102 that steer UE 102 toward or away from serving cell 124A and/or neighboring cells (e.g., cells 124B and 124C) during cell reselection. Although fig. 3-10 and the accompanying description specifically mention UE 102 and base station 104A (and in some cases base stations 104B and 104C) of fig. 1, it should be understood that the following techniques may be implemented by other user equipment and/or base stations and/or may be implemented in systems other than wireless communication system 100 of fig. 1.
Referring first to fig. 3, in an example scenario 300, a base station 104A transmits 310 a slice capability message to a UE 102 indicating which slice or slices the base station 104A supports. "support" for a particular slice may mean, for example, that the base station 104A may provide at least some minimum level of performance (e.g., low latency, high throughput, etc.) required for the slice, and/or that the base station 104A identifies the slice (i.e., knows the level of performance required for the slice), etc. The slice support information may be a bitmap, for example, where each bit of the bitmap corresponds to a different slice (e.g., based on a ranking/mapping known to the UE 102).
In some implementations, the base station 104A broadcasts 310 the slicing capability message. For example, the slicing capability message may be a System Information Block (SIB), and may include other system information in addition to slicing capability/support information (e.g., SIB 1). In other embodiments, the base station 104A transmits 310 only the slice capability message to the UE 102. For example, the slicing capability message may be an rrcrecconfiguration message transmitted by the UE 102 during an RRC reconfiguration procedure, an RRCSetup message transmitted by the UE 102 during an RRC connection setup procedure, an rrcreestabilishing message transmitted by the UE 102 during an RRC reestablishment procedure, or an rrcresestring or RRCSetup message transmitted by the UE 102 during an RRC connection recovery procedure (e.g., because various RRC procedures are defined in 3gpp TS 38.331). In some implementations, the slice support unit 134 generates a slice capability message, or a particular portion of a message related to slice capability.
At some point thereafter (or, in other embodiments and/or scenarios, prior to event 310), UE 102 determines 314 that data associated with a particular network slice (arbitrarily referred to as a "first" network slice in fig. 3) is ready for transmission. Alternatively, the UE 102 may determine 314 that the data associated with the first network slice is expected to be ready for transmission soon (e.g., in response to the start of an application attempting to utilize the first network slice, etc.). Event 314 may include an application (e.g., at a layer implementing one of protocols 218) requesting a first network slice from NAS controller 144 via a first IPL message, and NAS controller 144 then requesting the first network slice from AS controller 142 via a second IPL message. The data associated with the first network slice may have a slice-specific priority level configured by the network (e.g., by the base station 104A). Alternatively, the priority level may be predefined (e.g., by the OEM). In either case, NAS controller 144 may inform AS controller 142 of the priority level of the first network slice.
The UE 102 (e.g., AS controller 142, responsive to the second IPL message) may then determine 318 whether the first network slice is supported by the serving cell 124A by comparing the first network slice to a list of supported slices received from the base station 104A at event 310. In the example scenario 300, the UE 102 determines 318 that the serving cell 124A does not support the first network slice. In other scenarios, UE 102 may instead determine 318 that serving cell 124A does support the first network slice, in which case events 320, 330, 332, and 340 (described below) may be omitted, and UE 102 may instead use serving cell 124A to transmit any uplink data (and possibly receive downlink data) associated with the first network slice.
In scenario 300, after determining 318 that serving cell 124A does not support the first network slice, UE 102 transmits 320 a request message to serving base station 104A. For example, the slice support query unit 146 may trigger and/or generate a request message in response to the determination 318. In response to the request message, the base station 104A transmits 330 a response message to the UE 102 providing network support information for the first network slice. In different embodiments, the response message may be a RACH message (e.g., msgB or Msg 2), a broadcast message (e.g., SIB), a dedicated RRC message (e.g., rrcrecon configuration message), or another suitable type of message.
The network support information includes information about one or more other network resources that may support the first network slice and that UE 102 may be capable of using in transmitting data associated with the first network slice. For example, the network support information may indicate a particular RAT supporting the first network slice, a frequency (e.g., channel, frequency band, etc.) supporting the first network slice, a physical cell identifier of a neighboring cell supporting the first network slice (e.g., cells 124B and/or 124C), a RACH configuration associated with the neighboring cell supporting the first network slice, and/or whether the neighboring cell supporting the first network slice also supports one or more other particular network slices (e.g., other slices that may also be of interest to UE 102).
In some embodiments, the serving base station 104A gathers some or all network support information (or other information from which the base station 104A may derive network support information) from one or more base stations of neighboring cells before transmitting 330 a response message to the UE 102. For example, the base station 104A may receive information indicating support (or lack of support) for at least the first network slice from the base station 104B and/or the base station 104C via the X2 or Xn interface. The base station 104A may request the information in response to receiving the request message at event 320, or may receive the information periodically, etc. In some embodiments, base station 104A also or alternatively receives such information from CN 110 (e.g., in embodiments where CN 110 stores information regarding slice support at various network nodes, or in embodiments where base station 104 communicates via CN 110, etc.).
In some implementations, the slice support unit 134 generates the response message, or generates a particular portion of the response message related to network support for the first network slice. As described above, slice support unit 134 may also collect network support information for the first network slice from neighboring base stations (e.g., base stations 104B and/or 104C) and/or from CN 110.
In some embodiments and/or scenarios, UE 102 initiates procedure 332 (i.e., transmits 320 a request message) even though base station 104A indicates (at event 310) support for the first network slice. For example, in the event that the quality of the radio link between the UE 102 and the base station 104A suddenly decreases at some later time and the UE 102 has to reselect to another cell, the UE 102 may want to know which neighboring cells (and/or which RATs, frequencies, etc.) support the first network slice.
After UE 102 and base station 104A perform procedure 332 to inform UE 102 of network support for the first network slice, UE 102 and/or base station 104A may optionally perform 340 one or more subsequent operations. For example, if the base station 104A informs the UE 102 that the cell 124B supports the first network slice, the UE 102 may attempt to reselect to the cell 124B and establish an RRC connection with the base station 104B in response. As another example, in embodiments and scenarios in which performing procedure 332 includes performing a RACH procedure and in which the RACH procedure results in UE 102 accessing a channel on cell 124A, base station 104A may use knowledge of UE 102's interest in the first network slice to configure UE 102 in a particular manner (e.g., to facilitate a faster connection with another base station). For example, the base station 104A may schedule the UE 102 to make signal and/or channel quality measurements to the cell 124B, thereby enabling the UE 102 to connect to the base station 104B via the cell 124B more quickly than would otherwise be possible. In one such embodiment, if there is a reason for the UE 102 to remain connected to the base station 104A (e.g., if the UE 102 has some data buffered at the base station 104A), the base station 104A may cause the UE 102 to communicate with both base stations 104A and 104B (e.g., in a multi-RAT dual connectivity scheme). As yet another example, if both base stations 104A and 104B support the same RAT (e.g., 5G NR), but only a particular frequency of base station 104B supports a first network slice, base station 104A may initiate carrier aggregation using a first frequency supported by base station 104A and a different second frequency supported by base station 104B. In yet other scenarios (e.g., if no neighboring cells support the first network slice and the UE 102 decides to wait to transmit any associated data), the UE 102 may take no action and may omit event 340.
In still other embodiments and/or scenarios, the UE 102 does not initiate the procedure 332. For example, in response to determining 318 that serving cell 124A does not support the first network slice, UE 102 may proceed to initiate a cell reselection procedure at event 340 to establish an RRC connection to the RAN via a different cell without initiating procedure 332.
In some embodiments and/or scenarios, after process 332 (e.g., during event 340), the (possibly new) serving base station (e.g., base station 104A, 104B, or 104C) transmits another message to UE 102 that contains slice-specific network support information (e.g., similar to any of the network support information discussed above with reference to event 330). For example, the message may be an RRCReject or RRCRelease message as defined in 3gpp TS 38.331. The UE 102 may then use the network support information in the message to select the cell on which to camp or to establish a connection to the network.
Fig. 4A, 4B, and 5 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the process 332 of fig. 3. In particular, fig. 4A and 4B correspond to an embodiment of a contention-based RACH procedure (labeled as procedure 432A and 432B in fig. 4A and 4B, respectively) in which procedure 332 is four-step, and fig. 5 corresponds to an embodiment of a contention-based RACH procedure (labeled as procedure 532 in fig. 5) in which procedure 332 is two-step. In other embodiments, UE 102 and base station 104A may use a different type of RACH procedure than procedure 332.
Referring first to fig. 4A, the UE 102 initiates a four-step contention-based RACH procedure 432A by transmitting 410a Msg1 to the base station 104A, possibly while the UE 102 is camped on the cell 124A and in an idle state or an inactive state. As in a conventional RACH procedure (e.g., as specified in the 3GPP ETE or NR specifications), msg1 includes a preamble sequence and is transmitted via a PRACH occasion. Depending on the implementation, the preamble and/or PRACH occasion may be specifically dedicated/reserved for requesting network support information for the first network slice (e.g., as discussed further below in connection with fig. 4B), or may be a preamble and/or PRACH occasion that may also be used for standard channel access attempts.
After receiving Msg1, the base station 104A transmits 416a Msg2 (random access response, or "RAR") to the UE 102. In some implementations, msg1 transmitted 410A by base station 104A includes CORESET and/or search space. In these embodiments, after UE 102 transmits 410AMsg1, UE 102 detects Msg2 (at event 416A) by detecting a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) addressed to a Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) using CORESET and/or search space, where the PDCCH indicates transmission of Msg2 (RAR) from base station 104A.
Msg2 contains an uplink grant for UE 102. After receiving Msg2, UE 102 transmits 420a Msg3 using the uplink grant. In this embodiment, msg3 includes an indicator of the network slice (arbitrarily referred to herein as the "first" network slice) of interest to UE 102. After receiving Msg3 at event 420A, the base station 104A determines 425a that Msg3 indicates the first network slice (or equivalently, the UE 102 is requesting network support information for the first network slice).
In response to determining 425A, the base station 104A determines 428A what network support exists for the first network slice. The base station 104A may limit the determination 428A only to network resources that may be readily accessed by the UE 102 given its current location in the cell 124A. For example, the base station 104A may determine 428A only which neighbor cells, and/or which resources (e.g., which frequencies) associated with the neighbor cells support the first network slice.
In some implementations, the base station 104A determines 428A network support for the first network slice by accessing a static or semi-static database stored locally at the base station 104A. In other implementations, the base station 104A determines 428A network support for the first network slice by requesting (e.g., via the X2 or Xn interface) that neighboring base stations 104B and 104C provide information about their ability to support the first network slice. In still other embodiments, base station 104A accesses CN 110 to determine 428A whether neighboring base stations 104B and/or 104C support the first network slice.
After determining 428A, the base station 104A transmits 460A to the UE 102 Msg4 indicating network support determined by the UE 102 at event 428A. For example, the network support information in Msg4 may include any or all of the types of information discussed above in connection with event 330 of fig. 3 (e.g., a particular RAT and/or frequency supporting the first network slice, physical cell identifiers of neighboring cells supporting the first network slice, etc.).
Referring next to fig. 4B, the UE 102 initiates an alternative four-step contention-based RACH procedure 432B by transmitting 420B Msg1 to the base station 104A, possibly while the UE 102 is camped on the cell 124A and in an idle or inactive state. As in a conventional RACH procedure (e.g., as specified in the 3GPP LTE or NR specifications), msg1 includes a preamble sequence and is transmitted via a PRACH occasion. However, in this embodiment, the preamble and/or PRACH occasion is specifically dedicated/reserved for requesting network support information for the first network slice. Referring to fig. 3, for example, the base station 104A may have configured the UE 102 with RACH configuration (e.g., a particular preamble and/or PRACH occasion) by transmitting a configuration (e.g., RRC or broadcast) message to the UE 102 at a time prior to the beginning of the procedure 332. Examples of such configuration messages are discussed in more detail below.
In some embodiments, UE 102 selects a RACH configuration (i.e., a set of RACH resources) for Msg1 from among a plurality of RACH configurations, where each RACH configuration is dedicated to checking network support for a different slice. For example, the base station 104A may have configured the UE 102 with a first RACH configuration dedicated to checking the availability of a first network slice and configured the UE 102 with a second RACH configuration dedicated to checking the availability of a different second network slice. In the example of fig. 4B, msg1 itself may omit any information (e.g., information elements or fields) specifying the first network slice.
After (or concurrently with) receipt of Msg1 at event 420B, the base station 104A determines 426B that Msg1 is associated with the first network slice (or equivalently, the UE 102 is requesting network support information for the first network slice). More specifically, in some embodiments, the base station 104A determines 426b Msg1 is requesting network support information for a slice associated with a particular RACH configuration/resource (e.g., preamble and/or PRACH occasion) that the UE 102 has used to generate and transmit 420b Msg1. The base station 104A may make this determination 426B, for example, by detecting a preamble and/or PRACH occasion used by the UE 102 to transmit 420B Msg1, and then comparing the preamble and/or PRACH occasion to locally stored data indicative of an association between (1) the preamble and/or PRACH occasion and (2) the network slice.
In response to determination 426B, base station 104A determines 428B what network support exists for the slice. For example, event 428B may be similar to event 428A. After determining 428B network support information, the base station 104A transmits 430B Msg2 (random access response, or "RAR") to the UE 102. Msg2 may be similar to Msg2 of a conventional four-step contention-based RACH procedure, but is modified to include an indication of network support information as determined 428B by base station 104A. For example, msg2 may include additional fields or fields including network support information. For example, the network support information may include any or all of the types of information discussed above in connection with event 330 of fig. 3 (e.g., a particular RAT and/or frequency supporting the first network slice, physical cell identifiers of neighboring cells supporting the first network slice, etc.).
The RACH procedure initiated by the UE 102 to request network support information for the first network slice may or may not be a complete RACH procedure (i.e., may or may not have the possibility of causing channel access and/or transition of the UE 102 to a connected state). In embodiments in which the UE 102 does not use the RACH procedure 432B for channel access attempts, the base station 104A may not perform any HARQ processes, and/or the procedure 432B may end after the base station 104A transmits 430B Msg2 (or after the UE 102 processes the received Msg2 to identify network support for the first network slice). However, in other embodiments and/or scenarios, in response to receiving Msg2 at event 430B, UE 102 transmits 431B Msg3 comprising a scheduled transmission to base station 104A. In response to Msg3, base station 104A transmits 433B Msg4 to UE 102 indicating contention resolution.
In some implementations, msg1 transmitted 420B by base station 104A includes CORESET and/or search space. In these embodiments, after UE 102 transmits 420B Msg1, UE 102 detects Msg2 (at event 430B) by detecting a PDCCH addressed to the RNTI using CORESET and/or search space, wherein the PDCCH indicates transmission of Msg2 (RAR) from base station 104A.
In an alternative embodiment, the base station 104A provides the network support information at event 430B by broadcasting the system information (e.g., in the SIB) instead of transmitting the Msg2 (or in addition to transmitting Msg2 without network support information if RACH procedure 432 is used for channel access). If the RACH procedure 432B is still ongoing when the UE 102 receives broadcast system information, the UE 102 terminates the RACH procedure 432B.
Referring next to fig. 5, in another alternative embodiment of event 332 of fig. 3, the UE 102 initiates a two-step contention-based RACH procedure 532 by transmitting 520MsgA to the base station 104A, possibly while the UE 102 is camped on the cell 124A and in an idle state or inactive state. As in a conventional two-step RACH procedure (e.g., as specified in the 3gpp 5g NR specification), msgA includes two parts sent on different occasions: the preamble sequence (e.g., similar to Msg1 of fig. 4A) is transmitted 522 via a PRACH occasion, and the payload (e.g., similar to Msg3 of fig. 4B) is transmitted 524 via a PUSCH occasion. However, in this embodiment, the preamble and/or PRACH occasion is dedicated/reserved for requesting network support information for the first network slice. Alternatively or additionally, PUSCH occasions for the MsgA payload may be dedicated to such requests. That is, the preamble and/or PRACH occasion (and possibly PUSCH occasion for the MsgA payload) may be a resource that the base station 104A already includes in the RACH configuration dedicated to such a request. Referring to fig. 3, for example, the base station 104A may have configured the UE 102 with RACH configuration (e.g., a particular preamble and/or PRACH occasion) by transmitting a configuration (e.g., RRC or broadcast) message to the UE 102 at a time prior to the beginning of the procedure 332. Examples of such configuration messages are discussed in more detail below.
In some embodiments, the UE 102 selects a RACH configuration (i.e., a set of RACH resources) to be used for MsgA from among a plurality of RACH configurations, wherein each RACH configuration is dedicated/reserved for checking network support for different slices. For example, the base station 104A may have configured the UE 102 with a first RACH configuration dedicated to checking the availability of a first network slice and configured the UE 102 with a second RACH configuration dedicated to checking the availability of a different second network slice. In the example of fig. 5, the MsgA itself may omit any information (e.g., information elements or fields) specifying the first network slice.
In other embodiments, the base station 104A configures the UE 102 with only a single RACH configuration for requesting slice-specific network support information, and the UE 102 uses the content of the MsgA to indicate the specific slice that the UE 102 expects (e.g., needs or desires) to use. For example, the UE 102 may include a field or information element in the MsgA payload that indicates the slice of interest.
After (or concurrently with) receipt of the MsgA at event 520, the base station 104A determines 526 that the MsgA is associated with (or equivalently, the UE 102 is requesting network support information for) the first network slice. In embodiments where the base station 104A configures the UE 102 with a different RACH configuration for each of the plurality of network slices, the base station 104A may determine 526 the precise slice (herein the "first" network slice) by detecting a preamble of MsgA and/or a PRACH occasion (and/or a PUSCH occasion) and then comparing the preamble and/or PRACH occasion (and/or PUSCH occasion) with locally stored data indicative of an association between (1) the preamble and/or PRACH occasion (or PUSCH occasion) and (2) the network slice.
However, in embodiments in which the base station 104A has configured the UE 102 with a single RACH configuration to process network support requests for any of a plurality of different slices, the base station 104A may determine 526 the slice of interest by: (1) First detecting RACH configurations (e.g., preambles, PRACH occasions, and/or PUSCH occasions) for generating and/or transmitting 520MsgA, and then (2) in response to determining that RACH configurations are typically reserved for requesting slice support information, examining the MsgA payload to identify a particular slice of interest (herein "first" network slice) in an appropriate field or information element.
After the MsgA has been identified as a request for network support information for the first network slice, the base station 104A proceeds to determine 528 network support information for that slice. For example, event 528 may be similar to event 428A of fig. 4A.
After determining 528 the network support information, the base station 104A transmits 530MsgB to the UE 102. The MsgB may be similar to that of a conventional two-step contention-based RACH procedure, but is modified to include an indication of network support information as determined 528 by the base station 104A. For example, the MsgB may include additional fields or fields including network support information. For example, the network support information may include any or all of the types of information discussed above in connection with event 330 of fig. 3 (e.g., a particular RAT and/or frequency supporting the first network slice, physical cell identifiers of neighboring cells supporting the first network slice, etc.).
The RACH procedure initiated by the UE 102 to request network support information for the first network slice may or may not be a complete RACH procedure (i.e., may or may not have the possibility of causing channel access and/or transition of the UE 102 to a connected state). In embodiments where UE 102 does not use dedicated RACH procedure 532 for channel access attempts, base station 104A may generate and transmit 530MsgB without performing other operations typically associated with contention-based RACH procedures (e.g., HARQ procedures). However, in other embodiments, the UE 102 and the base station 104A may perform a complete two-step contention-based RACH procedure, possibly resulting in channel access and/or causing the UE 102 to enter a connected state with respect to the cell 124A and the base station 104A.
In an alternative embodiment, the base station 104A provides the network support information at event 530 by broadcasting system information (e.g., in a SIB) instead of transmitting the MsgB (or in addition to transmitting the MsgB without network support information if RACH procedure 532 is used for channel access). If the RACH procedure 532 is still ongoing when the UE 102 receives broadcast system information, the UE 102 terminates the RACH procedure 532.
As described above for either procedure 432B or procedure 532 (or possibly procedure 432A), the base station 104A may configure the UE 102 with a dedicated RACH configuration by sending one or more configuration messages to the UE 102. For example, the base station 104A may specify the dedicated RACH configuration in a SIB (e.g., SIB 1) broadcast by the base station 104A on the cell 124A. Alternatively, the base station 104A may specify a RACH configuration in a dedicated RRC message, such as an RRCRelease message sent by the base station 104A to the UE 102 when the UE 102 transitions from a connected state to an idle state. In still other embodiments and/or scenarios, the base station 104A specifies the RACH configuration in another suitable type(s) of message (e.g., in a Master Information Block (MIB), in an rrcrecconfiguration message sent by the base station 104A to the UE 102 during RRC reconfiguration, in an RRCSetup message sent by the base station 104A to the UE 102 during RRC connection establishment, in an rrcreestabilishing message sent by the base station 104A to the UE 102 during RRC reestablishment, in an rrcreseume or RRCSetup message sent by the base station 104A to the UE 102 during RRC connection restoration, etc.). In some implementations, the base station 104A transmits the dedicated RACH configuration in the same message that includes the slice capability information transmitted at event 310.
The configuration message sent by the base station 104A may include a particular preamble and/or PRACH occasion for each dedicated slice-specific RACH configuration. In some implementations, the configuration message may also include other information. For example, each RACH configuration may include a maximum number of allowed preamble transmission attempts before the UE 102 should conclude that the radio link has failed. In another example, each RACH configuration may include a type of RACH procedure (e.g., two or four steps) to be performed by UE 102. In still other examples, each RACH configuration may include a RAR window length (e.g., a period in which UE 102 should attempt to receive a RAR from base station 104A and then select and transmit a new preamble if unsuccessful), an MsgB response window length (e.g., a period in which UE 102 should attempt to receive an MsgB from base station 104A and then consider the RACH procedure as unsuccessful if no MsgB containing both an identifier of a preamble in the MsgA and a Common Control Channel (CCCH) Service Data Unit (SDU) is received), or a contention resolution time (e.g., a period in which UE 102 should attempt to detect a PDCCH addressed to a suitable C-RNTI or receive a message from base station 104A that includes a contention resolution identification MAC Control Element (CE) and then consider the RACH procedure unsuccessful and make another attempt to transmit a preamble if unsuccessful). In still other examples, each RACH configuration may include a power increment (ramping step) for successive preamble transmissions by UE 102 (i.e., for each retry of the failed RACH procedure), and/or a backoff factor to be used by UE 102 when performing backoff in the RACH procedure (e.g., where UE 102 selects a backoff value between zero and a maximum value provided by base station 104A and multiplies the backoff value by the backoff factor).
In some embodiments, if UE 102 is served by or camped on cell 124A and requests base station 104A to transmit information related to a desired slice, and if base station 104A supports the slice, base station 104A transmits a configuration message with RACH configuration for use by UE 102 when accessing the channel of cell 124A. For example, the configuration message may include any of the types of RACH configuration information discussed above (e.g., a particular preamble and/or PRACH occasion, a maximum number of allowed preamble transmission attempts, etc.).
Fig. 6-8 illustrate example scenarios in which the UE 102 is ready to transmit uplink data associated with two different slices simultaneously (or at overlapping times, etc.) and in which the base station 104A supports (or may support) two of those slices. In these cases, UE 102 may need to prioritize its attempts to obtain channel access for data associated with different slices. Each of the scenarios in fig. 6-8 may occur instead of, for example, processes 332, 432A, 432B, or 532 (e.g., if the slice capability message received by UE 102 at event 310 indicates support for two slices). Alternatively, each of the scenarios in fig. 6-8 may be implemented by a base station (e.g., by base station 104B or 104C) of a different cell after procedures 332, 432A, 432B, or 532, and after UE 102 reselects to a different cell (e.g., cell 124B or 124C) that provides support for both slices.
Referring first to scenario 600 of fig. 6, ue 102 determines 614 that data associated with a first network slice is ready for transmission and determines 616 that data associated with a second, different network slice is also ready for transmission. For example, events 614 and 616 may each be similar to event 314 of FIG. 3, and may occur in either order or simultaneously. In some embodiments and scenarios, event 616 may occur after the first RACH procedure has been initiated (e.g., after event 660 but before event 680, both of which are discussed below).
In scenario 600, UE 102 decides to attempt channel access for data associated with a first network slice before attempting channel access for data associated with a second network slice. The UE 102 may determine the order based on the first network slice (or its associated data) having a higher priority than the second network slice (or its associated data) because the determination 614 occurs before the determination 616 and/or for a different reason. To obtain channel access for the first network slice data, the UE 102 initiates a four-step RACH procedure. Specifically, the UE 102 transmits 660Msg1 using a first RACH configuration (e.g., a first preamble sent on a first PRACH occasion), and the base station 104A responds by transmitting 670Msg2 (RAR). Msg2 may also contain an identifier of the preamble used by UE 102 to transmit 660Msg 1.
In scenario 600, UE 102 does not receive Msg2 in RAR window 672. Although fig. 6 shows base station 104A transmitting 670Msg2 and UE 102 not successfully receiving the transmitted Msg2, in other scenarios base station 104A does not receive Msg1, in which case event 670 does not occur. In either case, in response to the UE 102 detecting that the RAR window 672 ends without receiving Msg2 (or at least without receiving Msg2 containing the appropriate preamble identifier), the UE 102 decides to select a new preamble and/or PRACH occasion instead and attempts to access the channel using the new RACH configuration. Fig. 6 only shows the start of this subsequent RACH procedure, where the UE 102 transmits 680Msg1 using the new RACH configuration. The UE 102 then waits for the base station 104A to respond with Msg2 within another RAR window, and so on.
Referring next to scenario 700 of fig. 7, ue 102 determines 714 that data associated with a first network slice is ready for transmission and determines 716 that data associated with a second, different network slice is also ready for transmission. Events 714 and 716 may each be similar to, for example, event 314 of fig. 3, and may occur in either order or simultaneously. In some embodiments and scenarios, event 716 may occur after the first RACH procedure has been initiated (e.g., after event 760 but before event 780, both of which are discussed below).
In scenario 700, UE 102 decides to attempt channel access for data associated with the first network slice before attempting channel access for data associated with the second network slice. The UE 102 may determine the order based on the first network slice (or its associated data) having a higher priority than the second network slice (or its associated data) because the determination 714 occurs before the determination 716 and/or for a different reason. To obtain channel access for the first network slice data, the UE 102 initiates a four-step RACH procedure. Specifically, the UE 102 transmits 760Msg1 using a first RACH configuration (e.g., a first preamble sent on a first PRACH occasion), and the base station 104A responds by transmitting 770Msg2 (RAR). Msg2 may also contain an identifier of the preamble used by UE 102 to transmit 760Msg 1.
In response to receiving the Msg2 with the appropriate preamble identifier (within the RAR window 772), the UE 102 transmits Msg3 containing CCCH SDUs to the base station 104A using the uplink grant included in the Msg2 by the base station 104A. In response, the base station 104A transmits Msg4 containing CCCH SDUs to the UE 102. In scenario 700, the UE 102 does not receive Msg2 in the contention resolution window 778. Although fig. 7 shows that base station 104A transmits 776Msg4 and UE 102 did not successfully receive the transmitted Msg4, in other scenarios base station 104A did not receive Msg3, in which case event 776 did not occur. In either case, in response to the UE 102 detecting that the contention resolution window 778 ends without receiving Msg4 (or at least without receiving Msg4 containing the appropriate CCCH SDU), the UE 102 decides to select a new preamble and/or PRACH occasion instead and attempts to access the channel using the new RACH configuration. Fig. 7 only shows the start of this subsequent RACH procedure, where the UE 102 transmits 780Msg1 using the new RACH configuration. The UE 102 then waits for the base station 104A to respond with Msg2 within another RAR window, and so on.
Referring next to scenario 800 of fig. 8, ue 102 determines 814 that data associated with a first network slice is ready for transmission and determines 816 that data associated with a second, different network slice is also ready for transmission. Events 814 and 816 may each be similar to, for example, event 314 of fig. 3, and may occur in either order or simultaneously. In some embodiments and scenarios, event 816 may occur after the first RACH procedure has been initiated (e.g., after event 862 but before event 882, both of which are discussed below).
In scenario 800, UE 102 decides to attempt channel access for data associated with the first network slice before attempting channel access for data associated with the second network slice. The UE 102 may determine the order based on the first network slice (or its associated data) having a higher priority than the second network slice (or its associated data) because the determination 814 occurs before the determination 816 and/or for some other reason. To obtain channel access for the first network slice data, the UE 102 initiates a two-step RACH procedure. Specifically, the UE 102 transmits 862MsgA using a first RACH configuration (e.g., a first preamble sent on a first PRACH occasion), and the base station 104A responds by transmitting 872MsgB (RAR). The MsgA may include a preamble and a CCCH SDU, and the MsgA may contain an identifier of the preamble used by the UE 102 to transmit 862 MsgA.
In scenario 800, the UE 102 does not receive an MsgB in the MsgB window 873. Although fig. 8 shows that base station 104A transmits 872MsgB and UE 102 did not successfully receive the transmitted MsgB, in other scenarios base station 104A did not receive MsgA, in which case event 872 did not occur. In either case, in response to the UE 102 detecting that the MsgB window 873 ends without receiving an MsgB (or at least without receiving an MsgB containing the appropriate preamble identifier), the UE 102 decides to select a new preamble and/or PRACH occasion instead and attempts to access the channel using the new RACH configuration. Fig. 8 only shows the beginning of this subsequent RACH procedure, where UE 102 transmits 882MsgA using the new RACH configuration. The UE 102 then waits for the base station 104A to respond with an MsgB within another MsgB window, and so on.
Other implementations and scenarios are also possible in addition to those shown in fig. 6-8. In some embodiments, for example, if UE 102 starts a first RACH procedure using a first RACH configuration (to attempt channel access for data associated with a first network slice) and UE 102 determines during the first RACH procedure that second data associated with a second network slice is ready for transmission, UE 102 terminates the first RACH procedure and instead starts a second RACH procedure to attempt channel access for the second network slice data. This may occur, for example, if the UE 102 determines that the second network slice and/or its associated data has a higher priority than the first network slice and/or its associated data.
In some implementations, if the UE 102 initiates a RACH procedure with a serving base station (e.g., base station 104A) to attempt channel access for uplink data associated with a particular slice and the UE 102 selects or reselects a cell during the RACH procedure, the UE 102 terminates the RACH procedure. UE 102 may then initiate another RACH procedure on the selected or reselected cell. In another scenario, if UE 102 initiates a RACH procedure with a serving base station (e.g., base station 104A) to attempt channel access for uplink data associated with a particular slice and serving cell 124A becomes unsuitable (e.g., due to channel quality degradation), UE 102 may terminate the ongoing RACH procedure.
In some embodiments, the RAN uses the offset to steer the UE toward or away from particular cells based on whether those cells support network slices that the UE needs (or prefers, desires, etc.) to utilize. To this end, a base station (e.g., base station 104A, 104B, or 104C) may transmit an offset for use in cell selection and/or an offset for use in cell reselection.
Fig. 9 illustrates an example scenario 900 in which base stations 104A-104C provide an offset to UE 102 that steers UE 102 toward or away from an associated cell (i.e., cells 124A-124C) during cell selection. As shown in fig. 9, base station 104A transmits 910A first slice capability message to UE 102, base station 104B transmits 910B a second slice capability message to UE 102, and base station 104C transmits 910C a third slice capability message to UE 102. Each of the slicing capability messages may be broadcast by a respective one of the base stations 104 and may be similar to the slicing capability message transmitted at event 310. For example, the slice capability message may be a SIB (e.g., SIB 1) indicating which network slice(s) are supported by the respective base station 104.
Further, in the embodiment of fig. 9, each specifies one or more cell selection offsets in the slicing capability message that UE 102 may use in calculating the value of cell suitability (e.g., by modifying the S criteria as defined in TS 38.304). In general, the suitability of a given cell may depend on both the slice desired by the UE 102 and the slice supported by the cell. In other implementations, the base station 104 transmits (e.g., broadcasts) its slice-related offset separately from its indication of supported slices. Although the following techniques refer to a single cell for each base station, in some embodiments and scenarios, a base station may transmit (e.g., broadcast) a different cell selection offset or a different set of cell selection offsets for each of a plurality of cells associated with the base station.
At some point in time after or during events 910A through 910C, UE 102 decides to select a cell. For example, the UE 102 may decide to select a cell at power-up of the UE 102 or in response to the UE 102 determining that data is ready for uplink transmission, or the like. In some implementations, if the cell (1) meets the S criteria as defined in TS 38.304 (i.e., the given cell is a "fit" criteria for selection) (or other criteria based at least in part on cell measurements), and (2) supports at least some threshold number of slices (e.g., at least one desired slice or all desired slices, etc.) of interest to the UE 102, the UE 102 determines that the cell is suitable for cell selection. In these embodiments, the slice capability message sent at events 910A through 910C may omit the offset and include only an indication of the supported slices.
However, in the depicted embodiment, the UE 102 determines 916 a cell suitability value based in part on one or more of the offsets received from the base station 104. In one such embodiment, if the respective cell 124 supports one or more slices desired by the UE, the base station 104 broadcasts (at events 910A through 910C) a positive offset that steers the UE toward those cells 124. In one such embodiment, the S criteria is that both Srxlev and square are greater than zero, where Srxlev and square are defined as:
Srxlev＝Q rxlevmea s-(Q rxlevmin +Q rxlevminoffset )-P compensation -Qoffset temp +RSNoffset；
and
Squal＝Q qualmeas -(Q qualmin +Q qualminoffset )-Qoffset temp +RSNoffset。
In the above equation, srxlev is the cell selection reception level value and square is the cell selection quality value (both expressed in dB), while Q rxlevmeas Is to measure a cell reception level value (reference signal received power or RSRP) and Q qualmeas Is to measure cell qualityValue (reference signal received quality or RSRQ). Q is defined in TS 38.304 rxlevmin 、Q qualmin 、Q rxlevminoffset 、Q qualminoffset 、P compensation Qoffset and Qoffset temp . RSNoffset is an offset by which the base station 104 broadcasts a particular value at events 910A-910C to steer a UE (e.g., UE 102) toward the corresponding cell 124 if the base station 104 and cell 124 support at least one desired slice. For example, when Srxlev and square are calculated for cell 124A, if cell 124A supports at least one slice of interest to UE 102, then UE 102 applies (adds) RSNoffset, otherwise RSNoffset is not applied. While this and other embodiments for cell selection are shown with the same offset applied for both Srxlev and square, it is to be understood that the UE may use different offsets for Srxlev and square (or slice-related offset for only one of the two, etc.).
In another embodiment, if the respective cell 124 does not support any slices desired by the UE, the base station 104 broadcasts (at events 910A through 910C) a negative offset that diverts the UE away from those cells 124. In one such embodiment, the S criteria is that both Srxlev and square are greater than zero, where Srxlev and square are defined as:
Srxlev＝Q rxlevmeas -(Q rxlevmin +Q rxlevminoffset )-P compensation -Qoffset temp -RSPoffset；
and
Squal＝Q qualmeas -(Q qualmin +Q qualminoffset )-Qoffset temp -RSPoffset，
Where RSPoffset is a cell-specific value that the base station 104 broadcasts at events 910A-910C to steer a given UE (e.g., UE 102) away from the cell 124 without the cell 124 supporting any slices of interest to the UE. For example, when Srxlev and square are calculated for cell 124A, if cell 124A does not support at least one slice of interest to UE 102, then UE 102 applies (subtracts) RSPoffset, otherwise RSPoffset is not applied. In some implementations, the base station 104 broadcasts both the positive RSNoffset and RSPoffset values (at events 910A-910C) simultaneously such that a given UE (e.g., UE 102) may apply (add) RSNoffset if the respective cell supports at least one slice of interest to the UE, or alternatively apply (subtract) RSPoffset if the respective cell does not support at least one slice of interest to the UE.
In other implementations, the base station 104 broadcasts (at events 910A through 910C) a slice-specific offset to provide the network with finer control over cell selection. For example, a given cell supporting k slices may broadcast k corresponding offsets (e.g., at one of events 910A through 910C), RSoffset i Wherein i is more than or equal to 1 and k is more than or equal to k. If the UE 102 expects j slices, and if m represents a slice supported by the cell (from among the j expected slices), then the offset corresponding to the m "overlapping" slices may be labeled as RSoffset l Wherein l is more than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to m. In one such embodiment, the S criteria is that both Srxlev and square are greater than zero, where Srxlev and square are defined as:
and
In addition to the slice-specific offset, each cell may broadcast an offset RSoffset that UE 102 may apply (subtract) when the cell does not support any slices desired by UE 102 (e.g., as shown above for RSoffset). Depending on the implementation and/or scenario, when Srxlev and square are calculated, the offset
In other implementations, the base station 104 broadcasts (at events 910A through 910C) a slice-specific offset RSoffset i (1.ltoreq.i.ltoreq.k), and UE 102 uses another operation (in addition to summing) to incorporate the slice-specific offset. For example, UE 102 may calculate Srxlev and square as:
Srxlev＝Q rxlevmeas -(Q rxlevmin +Q rxlevminoffset )-P compensation -Qoffset temp +RSMergedOffset；
and
Squal＝Q qualmeas -(Q qualmin +Q qualminoffset )-Qoffset temp +RSMergedOffset，
Where RSMergedOffset is a value that UE 102 determines based on m desired slices that are also supported by the cell. In one embodiment, RSMergedOffset is from all offsets RSoffset l The minimum offset among the two is 1-l-m. In another embodiment, RSMergedOffset is from all offsets RSoffset l The maximum offset among them is 1.ltoreq.l.ltoreq.m. Furthermore, each cell may also broadcast an offset RSoffset that the UE 102 may apply when the cell does not support any slices desired by the UE 102, and/or m may instead be defined as the number of desired slices not supported by the cell.
In yet other implementations, the base station 104 broadcasts (at events 910A through 910C) a slice-specific offset RSoffset i (1.ltoreq.i.ltoreq.k), and UE 102 weights the offset of the desired slice supported by the cell. For example, UE 102 may calculate Srxlev and square as:
and
Wherein W is l Is UE 102 for the first offset (RSoffset) l ) The weight of the application. The network may have assigned slice-specific weights via dedicated signaling (e.g., in an RRCRelease message from one of the base stations 104). Likewise, each cell may also broadcast an offset, RSoffset, that the UE102 may apply when the cell does not support any slices desired by the UE102, and/or m may instead be defined as the number of desired slices not supported by the cell.
In other embodiments, the UE102 otherwise applies a slice-related (e.g., slice-specific) offset received by the UE102 from the base station 104 and/or applies the offset to a different S-standard.
After determining 916 the cell suitability values, the UE102 selects 917 a cell based on those values. For example, UE102 may limit consideration to cells that meet a suitability criterion (e.g., both Srxlev and square are greater than zero after applying all suitable offsets), and then select cells from those remaining cells using any other suitable criterion (e.g., cells with a maximum Srxlev and/or square value, or cells that support a maximum number of slices that UE102 needs or desires to use, etc.).
Fig. 10 illustrates an example scenario 1000 in which a (serving) base station 104A provides one or more offsets to a UE102 to steer the UE102 toward or away from a serving cell 124A and/or neighboring cells (e.g., cells 124B, 124C) during cell reselection. As shown in fig. 10, the base station 104A transmits 1010 a slice capability message to the UE 102. For example, the slicing capability message may be broadcast by the base station 104A or included in a dedicated RRC message. The slicing capability message may be similar to the slicing capability message transmitted at event 310. For example, the slice capability message may be a SIB (e.g., SIB 1), or an rrcc reconfiguration message indicating which network slice(s) are supported by the base station 104A, or the like.
Further, in the embodiment of fig. 10, the slicing capability message specifies one or more cell reselection offsets (e.g., by modifying the ranking formula as defined in TS 38.304) that the UE 102 may use in calculating a ranking for the serving cell 124A and/or neighboring cells (e.g., cells 124B, 124C). Unlike the cell selection scenario 900 discussed above, in the cell reselection scenario 1000, the serving base station 104A provides an offset not only for itself, but also for other cells (here, cells 124B and 124C) that the UE 102 will consider. In general, the ranking of a given cell may depend on both the slice desired by the UE 102 and the slice supported by that cell. In some implementations, the base station 104A transmits the slice-related offset(s) separately from its indication of supported slices. The slicing capability message (or a different message from the base station 104A) may also specify a "popular" cell list discussed in more detail below. Although the following techniques refer to a single cell per base station, in some embodiments and scenarios, a base station may transmit (e.g., broadcast) a different cell reselection offset, or a different set of cell reselection offsets, for each of a plurality of cells associated with the base station, and/or transmit a different list of popular cells for each of the plurality of cells.
At some point in time after or during event 1010, UE 102 decides to perform a cell reselection procedure. For example, UE 102 may decide to perform a cell reselection procedure in response to degradation in quality of a communication channel in cell 124A. To perform the cell reselection procedure, the UE 102 determines 1018 a cell rank for the serving cell 124A and one or more neighboring cells (in this example, cells 124B and 124C) based in part on the cell reselection offset received from the base station 104A. In one such embodiment, if the respective cell 124 supports one or more slices desired by the UE, the base station 104A transmits 1010 a positive offset that steers the UE toward those cells 124. For example, the cell ranking criterion for the serving cell may be that Rs is greater than zero, where Rs is defined as:
Rs＝Q meas，s +Q hyst -Qoffset temp +RSNoffset
in the above equation, Q meas，s Is a measured serving cell reception level value (RSRP). Q is defined in TS 38.304 meas，s 、Q hyst And Qoffset temp . RSNoffset is a value that base station 104A transmits 1010 to steer the UE towards cell 124A if cell 124A supports at least one slice of interest to the UE (e.g., UE 102). For example, when calculating Rs for cell 124A, if cell 124A supports at least one slice of interest to UE 102, then UE 102 applies (adds) RSNoffset, otherwise RSNoffset is not applied.
Other embodiments are also possible, as discussed above in connection with cell selection. For example, in a scenario where serving cell 124A does not support any slices desired by UE 102, UE 102 may instead subtract an offset (e.g., RSPoffset) from Rs. As another example, UE 102 may instead determine the total cell reselection offset based on the UE 102's desired and slice-specific offsets for the slices supported by cell 124A (or for those slices that UE 102 desired but not supported by cell 124A if the offset is subtracted from the ranking). For example, UE 102 may add or subtract in the same manner as discussed above with respect to Srxlev and square for cell selection
The UE 102 also uses the slice-related offset received at event 1010 to determine 1018 a cell rank for the neighboring cells (here cells 124B and 124C). However, unlike in the cell selection scenario 900, the neighboring base stations 104B, 104C do not (at least not directly) inform the UE 102 which slices they support. Thus, in some embodiments, base station 104A includes in its slicing capability message (or in another message) of event 1010 a list of which neighbor cells are "popular" which are neighbor cells supporting the same slice as the serving cell (in this case, the same slice as serving cell 124A). In various embodiments, the base station 104A also includes an indication of which neighbor cells are "unpopular" (i.e., which neighbor cells do not support the same slice as the serving cell), or does not include such an indication, in which case the UE 102 may simply assume that any cells not on the popular list are unpopular cells. In some implementations, the "popular" cell is not necessarily a cell that precisely supports the same set of slices as the serving cell 124A. For example, the popular cell may be any neighbor cell supporting at least one slice supported by serving cell 124A, or any neighbor cell supporting all basic slices supported by serving cell 124A, etc.
In embodiments where the "popular" state means that neighboring cells support the same slice as serving cell 124A, UE 102 may calculate a ranking for a given neighboring cell based on: (1) Whether the serving cell 124A supports any slices of interest to the UE 102, and (2) whether neighboring cells are popular. If serving cell 124A does support at least one desired slice and the neighbor cell is popular, UE 102 may determine the ranking for the neighbor cell in the same manner as for serving cell 124A. For example, the UE 102 may determine that the sum (Q meas，s +Q hyst -Qoffset temp ) Or by not subtracting RSPoffset (or by adding or not subtracting RSPoffsetUE 102 uses to rank the neighbor cells. If serving cell 124A supports at least one desired slice but the neighbor cell is undesirable, UE 102 may determine the ranking for the neighbor cell in a different manner than for serving cell 124A. For example, UE 102 may either by subtracting RSPoffset or by not adding RSNoffset (or by subtracting or not adding +. >UE 102 uses to rank the neighbor cells.
In other embodiments, the UE 102 applies the slice-related (e.g., slice-specific) offset received by the UE 102 from the base station 104 in other ways, and/or applies the offset to different cell ranking criteria.
After determining 1018 the serving cell ranking and the neighbor cell ranking, and based on those rankings, UE 102 reselects to a new cell (e.g., cell 124B or 124C) or remains on serving cell 124A at event 1019. For example, UE 102 may decide to reselect to (or remain on) the cell with the highest ranking. In some embodiments, the user equipment also uses the frequency-specific set of priorities to determine the cell (if any) to reselect to. For example, the priority set may be one that the base station 104A indicates to the UE 102 by providing an index or a geotag value, as discussed above in connection with fig. 1.
Fig. 11 and 12 illustrate example methods for informing a user equipment which slice(s) are supported by a base station.
Referring first to fig. 11, an example method 1100 may be implemented in a base station (e.g., base station 104A) configured to communicate with user equipment (e.g., UE 102) located in a coverage area of a cell associated with the base station (e.g., cell 124A). For example, the method 1100 may be implemented in whole or in part by the processing hardware 130 of the base station 104A.
At block 1102, a base station generates a first message (e.g., a message of event 310, 910A, or 1010) indicating a set of one or more network slices supported by a cell associated with the base station. At block 1104, the base station transmits (e.g., broadcasts, or transmits in a dedicated RRC message, etc.) a first message (e.g., event 310, 910A, or 1010) to the user equipment.
In some implementations and/or scenarios, the method 1100 includes one or more additional blocks not shown in fig. 11. For example, method 1100 may include: wherein the base station receives a first additional block of a request message (e.g., event 320, 420A, 420B, or 520) from the user equipment; and wherein the base station transmits a second additional block to the user equipment in response to the request message that includes a second message (e.g., event 330, 430A, 430B, or 530) that includes information regarding network support for the desired network slice. The method 1100 may also include an additional block that occurs prior to block 1104, wherein the base station receives network support information related to a desired network slice from a neighboring base station (e.g., base station 104B) via an X2 or Xn interface.
In some implementations, if the request message is a first random access message (e.g., msg1 or MsgA) and the response message transmitted by the base station is a second random access message (e.g., msg2 or MsgB), the method 1100 includes an additional block in which the base station determines that the first random access message is associated with a desired network slice (e.g., event 425A, 426B, or 526). The method 1100 may further include an additional block in which the base station transmits another message to the user equipment indicating one or more RACH configurations (before the base station receives the first random access message), the one or more RACH configurations including a slice-specific RACH configuration for use by the user equipment in generating and transmitting the first random access message. Alternatively, the RACH configuration may be included in the first message transmitted by the base station at block 1104.
In some embodiments, the method 1100 includes an additional block in which the base station transmits a message (e.g., event 910A) to the user equipment indicating one or more cell selection offsets that are available to the user equipment for determining suitability of the cell for cell selection. Alternatively, the cell selection offset may be included in the first message transmitted by the base station at block 1104.
In some implementations, the method 1100 includes an additional block in which the base station transmits a message (e.g., event 1010) to the user equipment indicating one or more cell reselection offsets that are available to the user equipment for determining ranking for one or more cells (including cells associated with the base station implementing the method 1100) during cell reselection. Alternatively, the cell reselection offset may be included in the first message transmitted by the base station at block 1104. In any of these embodiments, the method 1100 may include yet another block in which the base station transmits another message to the user equipment indicating one or more neighboring cells supporting at least one network slice that is also supported by the cell of the base station implementing the method 1100 (e.g., a "popular" cell list indicating neighboring cells supporting all the same network slice). Alternatively, the indications of these neighboring cells may be included in the first message transmitted by the base station at block 1104.
Referring next to fig. 12, an example method 1200 may be implemented in a user equipment (e.g., UE 102) configured to communicate with a base station (e.g., base station 104A) when located in a coverage area of a cell associated with the base station (e.g., cell 124A). For example, the method 1200 may be implemented in whole or in part by the processing hardware 140 of the UE 102.
At block 1202, the user equipment receives a first message (e.g., event 310, 910A, or 1010) from a base station. At block 1204, the user equipment determines a set of one or more network slices supported by a cell associated with the base station by processing the first message received at block 1202. At block 1206, the user equipment determines whether to transmit data associated with the desired network slice via the cell (e.g., during cell selection or cell reselection) based at least in part on the set of supported network slices.
In some implementations and/or scenarios, the method 1200 includes one or more additional blocks not shown in fig. 12. For example, the method 1200 may include an additional block (prior to block 1206) in which the user device determines a desired network slice (e.g., within a list of desired slices) by, for example, transferring an indicator of the desired network slice from the NAS layer to an AS layer implemented in the user device (e.g., from the NAS controller 144 to the AS controller 142).
In some implementations, the method 1200 includes an additional block in which the user device transmits a request message (e.g., event 320, 420A, 420B, or 520) to the base station and in response receives a second message (e.g., event 330, 430A, 430B, or 530) from the base station that includes information regarding network support for the desired network slice. The method 1200 may further include a block in which the user equipment performs a cell reselection procedure based on information in the second message. In embodiments in which the request message transmitted by the user equipment is a first random access message (e.g., msg1 or MsgA) and the response message transmitted by the base station is a second random access message (e.g., msg2 or MsgB), the method 1200 may include a further block in which the user equipment receives another message from the base station indicating one or more RACH configurations (including a slice-specific RACH configuration used by the user equipment to generate and transmit the first random access message) prior to transmitting the first random access message.
In some implementations (e.g., if block 1206 includes performing cell selection), method 1200 includes: a first additional block (or set of blocks) in which the user equipment receives one or more other messages (e.g., events 910B and/or 910C) from one or more other respective base stations (e.g., base stations 104B and/or 104C) associated with one or more other respective cells (e.g., cells 124B and/or 124C); and a second additional block (or set of blocks), wherein for each of the one or more other messages, the user equipment determines one or more other respective sets of network slices supported by the respective cells.
In some implementations (e.g., if block 1206 includes performing cell selection), method 1200 includes an additional block in which the user equipment receives another message from the base station indicating one or more cell selection offsets (e.g., the offset provided at event 910A). Alternatively, the first message received by the user equipment at block 1202 may include a cell selection offset.
In some implementations (e.g., if block 1206 includes performing cell reselection), method 1200 includes an additional block in which the user equipment receives another message from the base station indicating one or more cell reselection offsets (e.g., the offset provided at event 1010). Alternatively, the first message received by the user equipment at block 1202 may include a cell reselection offset. In any of these embodiments, the method 1200 may include yet another block in which the user equipment receives another message from the base station indicating one or more neighbor cells supporting at least one network slice that is also supported by the serving cell (e.g., a "popular" cell list indicating neighbor cells supporting all the same network slice). Alternatively, the indications of these neighboring cells may be included in the first message received by the user equipment at block 1202.
Fig. 13 and 14 illustrate an example method for obtaining network support information for a slice using a RACH procedure.
Referring first to fig. 13, an example method 1300 may be implemented in a base station (e.g., base station 104A) configured to communicate with user equipment (e.g., UE 102) located in a coverage area of a cell associated with the base station (e.g., cell 124A). For example, the method 1300 may be implemented in whole or in part by the processing hardware 130 of the base station 104A.
At block 1302, the base station receives a first random access message (e.g., event 320, 420A, 420B, or 520) of a RACH procedure from a user equipment. At block 1304, the base station determines that the first random access message is associated with a first network slice (e.g., event 425A, 426B, or 526). At block 1306, the base station transmits a second random access message (e.g., event 330, 430A, 430B, or 530) of the RACH procedure to the user equipment, the second random access message including information regarding network support for the first network slice.
In some implementations and/or scenarios, method 1300 includes one or more additional blocks not shown in fig. 13. For example, the method 1300 may include an additional block (prior to block 1302) in which the base station transmits a configuration message to the user equipment that provides at least a slice-specific RACH configuration (e.g., preamble, PRACH occasion, etc.) that the user equipment uses to generate and transmit the first random access message. The method 1300 may also include a block in which the base station transmits other slice-specific RACH configurations associated with other slices to the user equipment.
Referring next to fig. 14, an example method 1400 may be implemented in a user equipment (e.g., UE 102) configured to communicate with a base station (e.g., base station 104A) when located in a coverage area of a cell associated with the base station (e.g., cell 124A). For example, the method 1200 may be implemented in whole or in part by the processing hardware 140 of the UE 102.
At block 1402, the user device identifies a desired network slice (e.g., event 314). At block 1404, the user equipment transmits a first random access message of a first RACH procedure to the base station to indicate to the base station a desired network slice (e.g., event 320, 420A, 420B, or 520). At block 1406, the user equipment receives a second random access message (e.g., event 330, 430A, 430B, or 530) of the first RACH procedure in response to the first random access message. At block 1408, the user equipment identifies network support for the desired network slice based on the second random access message received at block 1406.
In some implementations and/or scenarios, method 1400 includes one or more additional blocks not shown in fig. 14. For example, the method 1400 may include an additional block (prior to block 1404) in which the user equipment receives a configuration message from a base station (or a neighboring base station) that configures the user equipment to request information regarding network support for a desired network slice using a first RACH configuration (e.g., preamble, PRACH occasion, etc.). The method 1400 may also or alternatively include an additional block that occurs after block 1408, wherein the user equipment performs a cell reselection procedure (e.g., to reselect to a cell supporting a desired network slice) based at least in part on the network support identified at block 1408.
