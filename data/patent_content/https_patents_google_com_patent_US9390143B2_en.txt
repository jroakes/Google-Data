- the present disclosure relates to using queries provided by one or multiple users to identify the intent of the user or users.
- Internet search engines aim to identify documents or other items that are relevant to a user's queries and to present the documents or items in a manner that is most useful to the user. Such activity often involves a fair amount of inferring from various clues of what the user wants. Certain clues may be user specific. For example, knowledge that a user is making a request from a mobile device, and knowledge of the location of the device, can result in much better search results for such a user.
- Clues about a user's needs may also be more general. For example, search results can have an elevated importance, or inferred relevance, if a number of other search results link to them. If the linking results are themselves highly relevant, then the linked-to results may have a particularly high relevance. Such an approach to determining relevance may be premised on the assumption that, if authors of web pages felt that another web site was relevant enough to be linked to, then web searchers would also find the site to be particularly relevant. In short, the web authors “vote up” the relevance of the sites.
- the methods include receiving prior queries followed by a current, the prior and current queries being received within an activity period and originating with a search requester.
- the methods include receiving a plurality of search results based on the current query, each search result identifying a search result document, each respective search result document being associated with a query specific score indicating a relevance of the document to the current query.
- the methods include determining a first category based, at least in part, on the prior queries.
- the methods include identifying a plurality of prior activity periods of other search requesters.
- Each prior activity period contains a prior activity query where the prior activity query matches the current query and where the prior activity period indicates the same first category.
- the methods include obtaining category based selection statistics of the other requesters search results based on the prior activity queries of the other activity periods.
- the methods include obtaining general selection statistics of a more general population of requesters based on the current query.
- the methods include generating adjusted scores for the search result documents by adjusting the respective scores based on the query specific score and the category specific score.
- the methods include ranking the search result documents according to the respective adjusted scores.
- Determining that the prior queries indicate the first category may also include analyzing time spent between selecting a first result and a second result. Generating may include determining a category specific selection frequency measuring the frequency with which the respective search result document is selected in the other activity periods, determining a general selection frequency measuring the frequency with which the respective search result document is selected by the more general population; and comparing the category specific selection frequency and the general selection frequency. Comparing may also include determining the difference between the category specific selection frequency and the general selection frequency. Comparing may also include determining that the difference exceeds a given threshold. Generating may also include comparing a selection value for the search result document and a total selection value aggregated across search result documents in the first category of search requester interest.
- the selection count for the search result may be weighted based on time between selecting the search result and at least one of a selection of successive search results and other user activity marking the end of the user engagement with the search result.
- Adjusting the respective scores based on the category specific score may include adjusting the respective score by multiplying and summing the category specific score and the multiplied value to the respective score.
- Determining a first category may include determining a second category. Determining the first category of interest may be based on search requester specific information.
- the search requester specific information may include demographic information and/or location information.
- Generating the category specific score for the search result documents may include determining an absence of the category specific score for statistically insignificant categories.

- FIG. 7 shows a schematic diagram of an example computer system.
- FIG. 1 shows an example system 1000 for improving the relevance of results obtained from submitting search queries as can be implemented in an internet, intranet, or other client/server environment.
- the system 1000 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components and techniques described below can be implemented. Although several components are illustrated, there may be fewer or more components in the system 1000 . Moreover, the components can be distributed on one or more computing devices connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication mediums.
- a search requester 1002 ( 1002 a , 1002 b , 1002 c ) can interact with the system 1000 through a client device 1004 ( 1004 a , 1004 b , 1004 c ) or other device.
- the client device 1004 can be a computer terminal within a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).
- the client device 1004 can include a random access memory (RAM) 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device) and a processor 1008 .
- the processor 1008 is structured to process instructions within the system 1000 .
- the processor 1008 is a single-threaded processor.
- the processor 1008 is a multi-threaded processor.
- the processor 1008 can include multiple processing cores and is structured to process instructions stored in the RAM 1006 (or other memory and/or a storage device included with the client device 1004 ) to display graphical information for a search requester interface.
- a search requester 1002 a can connect to a search engine 1030 within a server system 1014 to submit a query 1015 .
- a client-side query signal 1010 a is sent into a network 1012 and is forwarded to the server system 1014 as a server-side query signal 1010 b .
- Server system 1014 can be one or more server devices in one or more locations.
- the server system 1014 includes a memory device 1016 , which can include the search engine 1030 loaded therein.
- a processor 1018 is structured to process instructions within the system 1014 . These instructions can implement one or more components of the search engine 1030 .
- the processor 1018 can be a single-threaded processor or a multi-threaded processor, and can include multiple processing cores.
- the processor 1018 can process instructions stored in the memory 1016 related to the search engine 1030 and can send information to the client device 1004 , through the network 1012 , to create a graphical presentation in a search requester interface of the client device 1004 (e.g., a search results web page displayed in a web browser).
- the server-side query signal 1010 b is received by the search engine 1030 .
- the search engine 1030 uses the information within the search requester query 1015 (e.g. query terms) to find relevant documents.
- the search engine 1030 can include an indexing engine 1020 that actively searches a corpus (e.g., web pages on the Internet) to index the documents found in that corpus, and the index information for the documents in the corpus can be stored in an index database 1022 .
- This index database 1022 can be accessed to identify documents related to the search requester query 1015 .
- an electronic document (which for brevity will simply be referred to as a document) does not necessarily correspond to a file.
- a document can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other documents, in a single file dedicated to the document in question, or in multiple coordinated files.
- the search engine 1030 can include a ranking engine 1052 to rank the documents related to the search requester query 1015 .
- the ranking of the documents can be performed using traditional techniques for determining an information retrieval (IR) score for indexed documents in view of a given query.
- IR information retrieval
- the relevance of a particular document with respect to a particular search term or to other provided information may be determined by any appropriate technique. For example, the general level of back-links to a document that contains matches for a search term may be used to infer a document's relevance.
- a document is linked to (e.g., is the target of a hyperlink) by many other relevant documents (e.g., documents that also contain matches for the search terms) then it can be inferred that the target document is particularly relevant. This inference can be made because the authors of the pointing documents presumably point, for the most part, to other documents that are relevant to their audience.
- the pointing documents are in turn the targets of links from other relevant documents, they can be considered more relevant, and the first document can be considered particularly relevant because it is the target of relevant (or even highly relevant) documents.
- Such a technique may be the determinant of a document's relevance or one of multiple determinants. The technique is exemplified in some systems that treat a link from one web page to another as an indication of quality for the latter page, so that the page with the most such quality indicators is rated higher than others. Appropriate techniques can also be used to identify and eliminate attempts to cast false votes so as to artificially drive up the relevance of a page.
- search requesters are often interested in one or more particular subjects or categories for a short time period, e.g., the last 30 minutes or two hours of a search session.
- the short-term interests of a search requestor may be identified and used to adjust ranking of search results.
- the search engine 1030 can include an interest identifier 1058 that may implement one or more interest identification techniques.
- the categories of interest may be gleaned from adjustments provided by the search requester.
- a search requester's interested in a particular category may issue queries related to the category and select search results referring to resources related to the category.
- a search requester may have a browsing history that indicates a particular area of interest. Generally, the search requester's recent activity can indicate the search requester's present needs and interests.
- the search may be refined by the search requester to steer the subsequent search towards desired results. For example, adding or removing particular search terms and phrases during a search session may provide clues to the interests of the search requester 1002 a (regarding the search).
- the manner in which an individual interacts with search results e.g., search selections, time spent interacting with search selections, advertisement selections, etc.
- the interest identifier 1058 may enable the interest identifier 1058 to identify one or more categories of search requester interest.
- an interest identifier may look at information over a recent time period. (for example, the last 30 minutes, one hour, two hours, or twenty-four hours) to determine a short-term category of user interest.
- the search system infers that a search requester is not interested in a particular category based on the search requester's recent activity, e.g., the search requester ignores a search result referring to a resource related to the particular category, or the search requester views the resource for a very short period of time after selection of the search result.
- Additional information may also be used in conjunction with the refinement information for identifying search requester interest.
- the language of the search requester e.g., English, Spanish, etc.
- the location of the search requester e.g., country, region, state, city, etc.
- data representing the identified interest may be cataloged in a database (e.g., the index db 1022 ).
- the identified search requester interest may be used for various applications such as providing assistance during future search sessions performed by the search requester 1002 a or other search requesters.
- Search result scoring and ranking e.g., as performed by the ranking engine 1020 or the rank modifier engine 1056 ) can be adjusted to account for interest of the search requester 1002 a or similar search requesters.
- the ranking engine 1052 receives one or more signals (i.e., data indicative of relevance) from a rank modifier engine 1056 to assist in determining an appropriate ranking for the resources.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 can provide one or more measures of category relevance for the resources, which can be used by the ranking engine 1052 to improve the ranking of resources referred to by search results 1028 provided to the search requester 1002 .
- the measure of category relevance represents a probability of search result selection given the values of one or more features, as described further below.
- the rank modifier engine 1056 can perform one or more of the operations described below to generate the one or more measures of category relevance.
- the search engine 1030 includes a scoring engine that generates scores for resources based on many different features, including content based features that indicate the relevance of resource content to the query and query independent features that generally indicate the quality of resources.
- the ranking engine 1052 can produce a ranking of resources based on scores received from the scoring engine and one or more measures of category relevance from the rank modifier engine 1056 .
- the search engine 1030 can forward the final, ranked result list within a server-side search results signal 1028 a through the network 1012 .
- a client-side search results signal 1028 b can be received by the client device 1004 a where the results can be stored within the RAM 1006 and/or used by the processor 1008 to display the results on an output device for the search requester 1002 a.
- FIG. 2 shows example components of an information retrieval system. These components can include an indexing engine 2010 , a scoring engine 2020 , a ranking engine 2030 , a rank modifier engine 2070 , and an interest identifier 2080 .
- the indexing engine 2010 can function as described above for the indexing engine 1020 .
- the scoring engine 2020 can generate scores of document results based on many different features, including content-based features that link a query to document results, and query-independent features that generally indicate the quality of document results.
- the content-based features can include aspects of document format, such as query matches to title or anchor text in an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) page.
- the query-independent features can include aspects of document cross-referencing, such as a rank of the document or the domain.
- the particular functions used by the scoring engine 2020 can be tuned to adjust the various feature contributions to the final IR score using automatic or semi-automatic processes.
- the ranking engine 2030 can produce a ranking of document results 2040 for display to a search requester based on IR scores received from the scoring engine 2020 and one or more signals from the rank modifier engine 2070 .
- the rank modifier engine 2070 can adjust rankings, at least in part, based on data received from the interest identifier 2080 .
- other sources may provide information to the interest identifier 2080 .
- queries entered into a search requester interface may be provided to the interest identifier 2080 .
- the interest identifier 2080 may provide information about the relevance of particular search results for a category of interest and a query to the rank modifier engine 2070 .
- the interest identifier 2080 provides information to the rank modifier engine 2070 , however other architectures may be implemented.
- a category of interest information may be provided by the interest identifier 2080 to the indexing engine 2010 or one or more other components of the information retrieval system.
- a tracking component 2050 can be used to record information regarding individual search requester selections of the results presented in the ranking 2040 .
- the tracking component 2050 can be embedded JavaScript code included in a web page ranking 2040 that identifies search requester selections (clicks) of individual document results and also identifies when the search requester returns to the results page. Therefore the component may indicate the amount of time the search requester spent viewing the selected document result.
- the tracking component 2050 can be a proxy system through which search requester selections of the document results are routed, or the tracking component can include pre-installed software at the client (e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system).
- the client e.g., a toolbar plug-in to the client's operating system.
- Other arrangements are also possible, such as using a feature of a web browser that allows a tag/directive to be included in a page, which requests the browser to connect back to the server with message(s) regarding link(s) clicked by the search requester.
- the recorded information can be stored in result selection log(s) 2060 .
- the recorded information can include log entries that indicate, for each search requester selection, the query, the resource, the time on the resource, the language employed by the search requester, and the country or region where the search requester is likely located (e.g., based on the server used to access the IR system).
- search requester interactions with a presented ranking including negative information, such as the fact that a document result was presented to a search requester but was not clicked, position(s) of click(s) in the search requester interface, IR scores of clicked results, IR scores of all results shown before the clicked result, the titles and snippets shown to the search requester before the clicked result, the search requester's cookie, cookie age, IP (Internet Protocol) address, search requester agent of the browser, etc.
- further information can be recorded such as described below during discussion of the various features that can be used to build a prior model.
- similar information e.g., IR scores, position, etc.
- the information stored in the result selection log(s) 2060 can be used by one or more components of the information retrieval system.
- information could be provided to interest identifier 2080 and the rank modifier engine 2070 in generating one or more signals to the ranking engine 2030 .
- a wide range of information can be collected and used to modify or tune the click signal from the search requester to make the signal, and the future search results provided, a better fit for the search requester's needs.
- search requester interactions with the rankings presented to the search requesters of the information retrieval system can be used to improve future rankings
- query adjustments indicative of refining a search can be used to modify rankings.
- the search requester interaction and search requester interest data may be provided to one or more server systems (e.g., server system 1014 ) for use and storage (e.g., database 1022 ) for later retrieval.
- server system 1014 e.g., server system 1014
- storage e.g., database 1022
- interest identifier 2080 may compare current search results with previous search activity to provide ranking adjustments to the rank modifier engine 2070 .
- the components shown in FIG. 2 can be combined in various manners and implemented in various system configurations.
- the scoring engine 2020 and the ranking engine 2030 can be merged into a single ranking engine, such as the ranking engine 1052 of FIG. 1 .
- the interest identifier 2080 , the rank modifier engine 2070 , and the ranking engine 2030 can also be merged and, in general, a ranking engine includes any software component that generates a ranking of document results after a query.
- a ranking engine can be included in a client system in addition to (or rather than) in a server system.
- FIG. 3 shows another example of an information retrieval system.
- a server system 3050 includes an indexing engine 3060 and a scoring/ranking engine 3070 .
- a client system 3000 includes a search requester interface for presenting a ranking 3010 , a tracking component 3020 , result selection log(s) 3030 and a ranking/rank modifier engine/interest identifier 3040 .
- the client system 3000 can include a company's enterprise network and personal computers, in which a browser plug-in incorporates the ranking/rank modifier engine/intent identifier 3040 .
- the scoring/ranking engine 3070 can return the search results along with either an initial ranking or the actual IR scores for the results.
- the browser plug-in can then re-rank the results locally based on tracked page selections for the company-specific search requester base.
- FIGS. 2 and 3 provide two exemplary information retrieval systems, other architectures may be implemented.
- an indent identifier may be positioned in other locations of an information retrieval system or distributed across multiple locations.
- the search system 1014 can modify the IR score of a resource for a particular searcher based on the searcher's inferred short-term categorical interests.
- the search system 1014 can refer to the search result selections of other searchers who issued the same query or similar queries and were interested in the same categories.
- the search system 1014 can increase the IR scores of the resources associated with the search results that were preferred by these similarly interested search requesters.
- the search system 1014 can decrease the IR scores of the resources associated with the search results that were ignored or not preferred by these similarly interested search requesters.
- Preference for a search result can be inferred in a number of ways, e.g., from a high rate of search requester selection of the search result or long views of the associated resource by search requesters selecting the search result.
- the rank of the resource relative to other responsive resources may be increased or decreased. Whether the rank of a particular resource changes depends on the rank of the resource before modifying the score, how much the score is modified, and how much the score for neighboring resources are modified. For example, if the ranking engine 1052 has already ranked a particular resource as the top resource for a given query, increasing the score for that particular resource will not change the resource's rank. However, if the search system increases the score for the second-ranked resource for the given query, the amount increased might be large enough to boost the second-ranked resource to the top spot. Thus, the search system can promote or demote resources in a search results list for a particular search requester based on the search requester's inferred short-term categorical interests.
- the search system 1014 only modifies the score of a resource for a particular search requester issuing a given query if similarly interested search requesters selected the search result referring to the resource at a rate that differs (e.g., by a statistically significant amount) from the rate at which the general population selected the same search result returned for the same query.
- the required threshold to determine that the result is selected more often for search requesters with a specific interest than by search requesters with a more general interested may be a fixed threshold (for example a difference of at least 0.01 in absolute click through rate).
- the required threshold may be relative, for example, the click through rate may need to be at least 10% greater.
- the threshold may also be statistical. For example, if the click through rate based on a sample observation period for a given result is more than a standard deviation greater for users having a particular interest than for the general population. In some arrangements the threshold may be a combination of absolute, relative, and/or statistical thresholds.
- the search system 1014 can use the rate at which search requesters select a particular search result for a given query as a measure of the relevance of the associated resource to the given query. For example, if search requesters with an identified interest select a search result more frequently then the general population, the search system can infer that other similarly interested search requesters will find the search result to be more relevant. Likewise, if search requesters with an identified interest select a search result less frequently than the general population, the search system can infer that other similarly interested search requesters will find the associated resource to be less relevant.
- the difference between the two rates must be greater than a predefined threshold for the search system to modify the resource's score. If the difference is greater than the predefined threshold, the search system modifies the score of the resource to reflect the measure of category relevance (e.g., the expected selection rate) of the resource to the given query for the similarly interested search requesters.
- a predefined threshold for the search system to modify the resource's score. If the difference is greater than the predefined threshold, the search system modifies the score of the resource to reflect the measure of category relevance (e.g., the expected selection rate) of the resource to the given query for the similarly interested search requesters.
- a search requester may be researching business schools during a particular period. During this period, the search requester issues the query “harvard business” 420 a in the query interface 404 . As shown by process arrows 422 a and 424 a , the search query 420 a and characteristics associated with the user (e.g. language, location, etc.) may be sent to the server side system 402 via the network 412 .
- the server side system 402 can process the search query 420 a and related information, for example by using one or more software modules (e.g., a search engine) executed by the server 408 .
- the “harvard business” query 420 a may be stored in the data store 410 .
- Other information e.g., index information, user characteristics, search session statistics, etc.
- index information e.g., user characteristics, search session statistics, etc.
- the data store 410 is representative of various types of information sources that may be in communication with the server 408 .
- one or more storage devices e.g., hard drives, etc.
- servers, and computing device equipment may be directly or indirectly (e.g., via one or more networks) in communication with the server 408 .
- search results may be sent to the client side system 400 via the network 412 .
- a set of search results 440 a may be presented to a user via the results interface 406 .
- the search requester selects the “Harvard Business School” search result 432 , referring to the Harvard Business School web site.
- process arrows 434 a and 436 a information about the selection is sent to the server side system 402 and stored in the database 410 .
- the same search requester issues a query “kellogg” 420 b in the query interface 404 .
- the search query 420 b and characteristics associated with the user may be sent to the server side system 402 via the network 412 .
- the server side system 402 may process the search query 420 a and related information.
- the query “kellogg” 430 b may be stored in the data store 410 .
- Other data may be retrieved from or stored in the data store 410 , including information about the previously submitted query 420 a and the previously selected result 432 a .
- the server 408 determines that there is insufficient data to support an inference of a category of interest.
- the previously submitted query 420 a the search results returned from executing the query, and/or the previously selected result 432 a alone, or coupled with the user information, may be sufficient for the server 408 to infer a category of user interest.
- search results may be sent to the client side system 400 via the network 412 .
- a set of search results 440 b may be presented to a user via the results interface 406 .
- the search requester selects the “Kellogg School of Management” search result 432 b referring to the website of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. As shown by process arrows 434 b and 436 b , information about the selection is sent to the server side system 402 and stored in the database 410 .
- the same search requester then issues a query “anderson” 420 c in the query interface 404 .
- the search query 420 c and characteristics associated with the user may be sent to the server side system 402 via the network 412 .
- the server side system 402 can process the search query 420 c and related information.
- data may be retrieved from or stored in the data store 410 , including information about the previously submitted queries 420 a , 420 b and the previously selected results 432 a , 432 b .
- the server 408 infers from the available data that the search requester has an interest in “business schools.”
- the server 408 computes or retrieves previously computed selection statistics for the search results returned for the query “anderson” 420 c for both search requesters of the general population and search requesters with an inferred interest in “business schools.”
- the selection statistics might indicate that search requesters interested in “business schools” selected the UCLA Anderson School of Management search result 432 c at a higher rate (e.g., 87%) than the rate (e.g., 2.7%) at which search requesters of the general population selected this search result returned for the query “anderson.” If the difference in the two rates exceeds a predefined threshold, the server 408 may increase the score for the UCLA Anderson School of Management web site for this search requester, where the increase reflects the higher measure of category relevance of this resource for similarly interested search requesters.
- search results may be sent to the client side system 400 via the network 412 .
- a set of search results 440 c may be presented to a user via the results interface 406 .
- the UCLA Anderson School of Management search result 432 c may appear higher on the list of search results returned for the query “anderson” 420 c for this particular search requester relative to the search result's position on the list of search results returned for the query for search requesters of the general population.
- a flow chart 5000 represents a particular arrangement of operations of the interest identifier ( FIG. 1, 1058 ). Typically the operations are executed by one or more processors of a computer system upon which the interest identifier is resident. While typically executed by a single electronic device, in some arrangements operation execution may be distributed among two or more electronic devices (for example, computer systems).
- Operations include storing recent activity 5010 .
- recent activity may be stored by the interest identifier 1058 directly.
- another component of the server system 1014 may store the recent activity for later use by the interest identifier 1058 .
- a search requester's browing history may be stored.
- a search requester's interactions with the search system are stored. Their interaction may include queries submitted by a search requester and information descriptive of a search requester's interactions with the provided search results. For example, a search requester may select a particular resource and perform some action which indicates the search requester in finished with the resource, such as selecting another result, entering a new query, or leaving the search page or selecting another result.
- the selected results may be stored along with a measure of the passage of time between the selection and the subsequent action.
- a search requester may submit a query and subsequently submit a second query which further refines the query.
- information about the particular search requester may also be stored.
- the system may store location, demographic, and linguistic information.
- Operations also include identifying categories of interest 5020 .
- the system may use the stored activity to identify categories of interest.
- the system may examine a search requester's interactions with the system to determine a category of interest. This may include analyzing patterns of query submission and result selection to infer a category.
- the short term categorical interests are identified using a technique for classifying text (e.g., query terms or text in resources) into fine grained hierarchical categories.
- a hierarchical category may consist of a series of progressively narrower categories in a parent/child relationship, for example, a “sports” category may have a “football” child category, which in turn may have “high school football” and “professional football” child categories.
- the depth of the hierarchy defines the level of refinement.
- a search requester's category of interest may be defined at any level of the hierarchy. For example, a search requester may be determined to be interested in the “high school football” or a search requester may be determined to be interested in “sports.” In other arrangements, a category of interest may only be defined at the narrowest level subcategory, for example, “high school football”.
- a determined interest in a parent category indicates interest in all child categories for that parent (for example, “professional football” and “high school football”). In other arrangements, interest in a parent category indicates only a general interest and does not indicate interest in the child categories, for example, an interest in “sports” may not indicate an interest in “football” or “high school football.”
- categories are formed by comparing a search requesters queries with the search results the search requester selects. For example, for the search requester submissions of query “professional football” a search engine may present a URL pointing to document to the search requester a number of times. If a search requester clicks on the URL, the click can be considered a confirmation that document is a valid search result for query. In this manner, categories of interest may be formed based on the queries and the search requester's selections. In some arrangements, queries which produce similar results or similar selected results may be determined to refer to the same category of interest.
- Operations also include determining selection counts 5030 .
- determining selection counts may include calculating the number of times a resource is selected by a search requester executing a particular query and having a particular category of interest. The results of this process may be stored for later access. In some arrangements, selection counts are further refined based on the location, demographic or linguistic information.
- the selection count may be weighted based on the time between a search requester selects the respective resource and when the search requester indicates that the requester is finished with the respective source.
- the selection of a subsequent resource by a search requester indicates that the requester is finished with the first resource. For example, if a search requester selects the resource referring to a particular resource and views that resource for a long period of time before selecting a different resource, the selection count may be increased by an amount proportional to how long the requester waited before selecting the different resource.
- submitting a new query may indicate that a search requester is finished with the first resource.
- a search requester may indicate that the search requester is finished with a particular resource by not returning to the search results.
- Operations also include calculating a category click-fraction 5040 .
- the category click-fraction may be calculated for each resource selected for a particular query and category of interest.
- the category click-fraction may be a measure of the selection count for a particular resource as a percentage of the combined selection count for all resources for the query and category of interest.
- Operations also include calculating a general click fraction 5050 .
- the general click fraction may be a measure of the selection count for a particular resource as a percentage of the combined selection count for all resources for the query independent of any category of interest.
- Operations also include calculating category relevance 5060 .
- the category relevance may be a measure of the difference between category click fraction and the general click fraction. The difference may be determined in either absolute or relative terms.
- Operations also include determining if the category is significant 5070 .
- the significance of the category may be determined based on the category relevance, the category click fraction, and the general click fraction.
- the category may be significant if the category relevance exceeds a certain threshold.
- the category may be significant if the difference between the category click fraction and the general click fraction is statistically significant.
- a category may be insignificant, regardless of any click fraction, if an aggregated selection count for all queries and resources is less than a predefined threshold.
- Operations also include providing a category relevance score 5080 .
- the category relevance score may be determined based on the category relevance.
- the category relevance score may be determined by multiplying the category relevance by a constant value.
- the category relevance score may be provided to a ranking engine and stored for later use.
- the interest identifier 1058 may execute the process 5000 in batch.
- the interest identifier 1058 may cache the measures of category relevance for quick retrieval.
- the interest identifier 1058 may modify the score of resources matching a given query for a particular search requester as soon as the system infers one or more categories of interests for the search requester.
- the interest identifier 1058 may also cache other scoring information, for example, measures of category relevance, general click fractions or category click fractions.
- a flowchart 6000 represents a particular arrangement of operations of the interest identifier ( FIG. 1, 1058 ). Typically the operations are executed by one or more processors of a computer system upon which the search system is resident. While typically executed by a single electronic device, in some arrangements, operation execution may be distributed among two or more electronic devices (for example, computer systems).
- Operations include reviewing recent activity 6010 .
- the interest identifier 1058 reviews the recent activity of a search requester.
- the recent activity can be queries issued and the resources selected within a short time period, e.g., during the last 30 minutes, two hours, or 24 hours of a search session.
- Recent activity can also or alternatively be defined as a sequence of queries and interactions with resources with no interruption of more than a predetermined amount of time.
- Recent activity can also be determined in terms of the current task. In some arrangements, the end of the task may be identified when the current queries are no longer consistent with the previously identified category of interest.
- Operations also include identifying categories of interest 6020 .
- the interest identifier 1058 may identify at least one category of interest for the search requester based on the search requester's recent activity.
- the system can identify the categories using the technique used in process 5000 described above.
- the category of interest is further identified using location, demographic, and linguistic information of the search requester.
- Operations also include receiving a current query 6030 .
- the interest identifier 1058 receives a new query issued by the search requester.
- Operations also include identifying resources 6040 .
- the interest identifier 1058 identifies multiple resources matching the search requester's current query. Each resource is provided with a IR score which measures the general relevance of the resource to the current query.
- resources matching particular popular queries are predetermined and cached. If available the system retrieves a list of the cached resources and their scores.
- Operations also include collecting category relevance scores 6050 .
- the interest identifier 1058 retrieves category relevance scores for each resource matching the search requester's current query based on the category of interest.
- Operations also include determining adjusted relevance scores 6060 . While this operation may be performed by the interest identifier 1058 , it is typically performed by the ranking engine 1052 . In one example, the ranking engine 1052 adjusts IR scores based on the category relevance score provided by the interest identifier 1058 . In one arrangement, the adjusted relevance score is determined by summing the IR score and the category relevance score. In other arrangements, the adjusted score is determined by multiplying the IR score and the category relevance score.
- the relevance score of a resource may have been previously adjusted based on other characteristics of the search requester independent of any category of interest. For example, a relevance score may be adjusted based on the search requester's location, linguistic, and demographic information.
- the interest identifier 1058 may further adjust the relevance score of the resource by applying an adjustment that replaces the previous adjustments and accounts for both the characteristics of the search requester and categories of interest.
- the interest identifier 1058 may identify multiple categories of interest for the search requester. The interest identifier 1058 then determines a category relevance score for each category of interest. The final category relevance score reflects a combination of the relevance of the multiple categories. In some arrangements, the category relevance score for multiple categories may be based on summing the click fractions for each category. In other arrangements, the category relevance score may be based on the sum of all the category relevance scores. In other arrangements, the category relevance for multiple categories may be based on the multiplication of each category click fraction.
