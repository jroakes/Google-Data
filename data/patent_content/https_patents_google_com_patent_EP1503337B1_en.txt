Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to the field of document layout, design, and analysis and, more particularly, to methods which quantitatively measure a document's quality based on characteristics inherent in the document itself.
- Factors that contribute to the quality and effectiveness of layout and style decisions for a document are the handling of groups of content elements as style and layout choices affect groups of content.
- a group is a collection of content elements.
- Group membership is a property of the logical structure of the document. The neighborhood of groups can be considered a layout property. While layout structure often matches the logical structure, there is no requirement that it do so.
- US-A-5 424 945 discloses a system for evaluating the psychological effects of an image embodied in image data.
- the psychological effect of visual aspects is determined and evaluated by a point score. This point score is compared to information collected from users by asking a set of question. Finally, the system displays the results of the psychological test as based on the point scores.
- the visual aspects for evaluating the psychological effects are conflict and dominance, repetition, balance, harmony and gradation, unity and symmetry of the document.
- the system executes subjective determination of the psychological effects of these aspects.
- EP-A-1 109 132 relates to the field of image processing.
- the content of the images is assessed and several images are then arranged in a logical order to meet certain criteria.
- the images are assessed on the features of colorfulness, sharpness and format uniqueness. Additionally, in order to take into consideration the interest of an image, also features relating to people on the images are assessed. On the basis of this assessment, the images are laid out on a page.
- Engeldrum "Image quality modeling: where are we?” Society for Imaging Science and Technology: Image Processing, Image Quality, Image Capture, Systems Conference, 1999, pages 251-255 , XP002349898 refers to an image quality model.
- the model focuses on the customer perception of a document containing images and evaluates the document with respect to certain criteria, for example, uniformity and reproducibility. These criteria are evaluated by multiple regression analysis to construct a picture quality scale, which is a psychometric scaling of a quality of the document.
- One aspect of the ease of use of a document is one's ability to tell which elements belong to a group and which do not.
- the style and layout decisions that are made in the presentation of a document can affect the degree of group identity that it conveys.
- Considerations for ease-of-use with respect to groups include spatial coherence, spatial separation, alignment separation, heading separation, background separation, and/or style separation. Measures for various characteristics of content, feature, and the like could be weighted by intent, relevance, and other parameters and these could then be combined to obtain one or more overall measures for the document itself. If one had a method for evaluating properties inherent in the document itself then such a measure could be used during the document development process to help determine optimal presentation.
- Searchability can be defined as the degree to which the document structurally supports the finding of a desired content element.
- a document with high searchability provides aids that help in finding desired content.
- a document with high searchability measure is easier to use because it is easy to locate the portion of the document containing the information of interest.
- the distinguishability of content can be defined as the ability to identify one particular content element from another content element within the document. Distinguishability is important in establishing the context for the information disclosed by the element. It can reduce confusion about what that element is and to what group or setting it belongs. It can also aid in locating a desired element. The distinguishability of the document elements is therefore a contributing factor to the ease of use of the document.
- Another property that would be desirable to be able to quantitatively measure is the ability of the document to hold the viewer's attention and interest. While much of the document's ease of use depends upon the actual content and its relevance to the viewer, there can also be a contribution from the style with which that content is presented. If a measure of the effect of style decisions on ease of use could be defined it could be used in determining a measure of optimal presentation.
- Documents can present content in ways that make it easier to locate individual items. This can be referred to as 'locateability'.
- a way to distinguish one content object from another object is to evaluate the target object's locatability, i.e., how easy it is to find an object within the document. This is a little different from distinguishability, which tells how well an item can be differentiated from its neighbors.
- Structural aids such as layout of tables or bullet lists help the document viewer to locate objects.
- Presenting content in a table allows its location to be identified by row or column. The presence of headings for the rows and columns can further increase the ease of locating items.
- Presenting content items in a list introduces an ordering that aids in locating them, and the use of list bullets or item numbers aids further. Separability and distinguishability contribute to the locatability of an object.
- Measures for various aspects of content, features, and the like could be weighted by intent, relevance, and other parameters and these could then be combined to obtain one or more overall measures for the document itself. If one had a method for evaluating such properties inherent in the document itself then such a measure could be used during the document development process to help determine optimal presentation.
- the present invention relates to a method for quantifying a measure of quality of a document.
- the method measures a predetermined set of characteristics of the document; quantizes the measured predetermined set of characteristics of the document; and generates a quantized interest value for the document based on a predetermined combining function, the predetermined combining function combining the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics, the quantized interest value being a measure of quality of the document.
- a further aspect of the present invention is a method for quantifying a measure of quality of a document.
- the method measures a predetermined set of characteristics of the document; quantizes the measured predetermined set of characteristics of the document; generates a quantized interest value for the document based on a predetermined interest combining function, the predetermined eye-catching ability combining function combining a predetermined subset of the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics; generates a quantized ease of use value for the document based on a predetermined ease of use combining function, the predetermined ease of use combining function combining a predetermined subset of the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics; and generates a quantized quality value for the document based on a predetermined quality combining function, the predetermined quality combining function combining the generated quantized interest value and the generated quantized ease of use value.
- Another aspect of the present invention is a method for quantifying a measure of quality of a document.
- the method measures a predetermined set of characteristics of the document; quantizes the measured predetermined set of characteristics of the document; and generates a quantized eye-catching ability value for the document based on a predetermined eye-catching ability combining function, the predetermined eye-catching ability combining function combining a predetermined subset of the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics; generates a quantized interest value for the document based on a predetermined interest combining function, the predetermined interest combining function combining a predetermined subset of the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics; and generates a quantized quality value for the document based on a predetermined quality combining function, the predetermined quality combining function combining the generated quantized eye-catching ability value and the generated quantized interest value.
- a further aspect of the present invention is a method for quantifying a measure of quality of a document.
- the method measures a predetermined set of characteristics of the document; quantizes the measured predetermined set of characteristics of the document; generates a quantized aesthetics value for the document based on a predetermined aesthetics combining function, the predetermined aesthetics combining function combining a predetermined subset of the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics; generates a quantized interest value for the document based on a predetermined interest combining function, the predetermined interest combining function combining a predetermined subset of the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics; and generates a quantized quality value for the document based on a predetermined quality combining function, the predetermined quality combining function combining the generated quantized aesthetics value and the generated quantized interest value.
- a further aspect of the present invention is a method for quantifying a measure of quality of a document.
- the method measures a predetermined set of characteristics of the document; quantizes the measured predetermined set of characteristics of the document; generates a quantized interest value for the document based on a predetermined interest combining function, the predetermined interest combining function combining a predetermined subset of the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics; generates a quantized ease of use value for the document based on a predetermined ease of use combining function, the predetermined ease of use combining function combining a predetermined subset of the quantized measured predetermined set of characteristics; and generates a quantized quality value for the document based on a predetermined quality combining function, the predetermined quality combining function combining the generated quantized interest value and the generated quantized ease of use value.
- the present invention is directed to various methods for quantifying various document properties to assist document developers in determining document quality.
- Quality can have several competing aspects and the overall quality can depend not only on the absolute properties of the document, but also on the relative importance of these properties to the beholder.
- One aspect or class of document quality is its aesthetics, which is its beauty, the degree to which pleasure can be derived from its appearance. Often this property is manifested in the degree of displeasure generated by an ugly layout.
- Another aspect or class contributing to the quality of a document is the effectiveness with which it communicates information to the user.
- Documents are vessels of information, and the ease at which the viewer can gather and understand the information can be an important factor in how well the document does its job.
- a third aspect or class that contributes to the quality of a document is its ease of use.
- a factor that contributes to the ease of use is how convenient the document is, that is, can it be used with a minimum of effort.
- a second factor contributing overall ease of use is content grouping. Information often has some logical organization and documents can reflect this organization by grouping the content. The effectiveness with which the document coveys this grouping and enables the viewer to capitalize on it contributes to the ease of use.
- a fourth aspect or class that enters into document quality is the degree to which the user is comfortable with it. Documents that create anxiety are generally not as desirable as those that the viewer finds soothing and familiar.
- a fifth aspect or class that is an important contributor to the quality of some documents is the degree to which they can catch the eye of the viewer. Advertisements for example, strive to capture the attention and not to be easily overlooked
- a sixth aspect or class that is similar is the ability for the document to maintain interest. It is one thing to capture the attention, but another to hold it and to avoid boredom as the document is used.
- a seventh aspect or class of quality can be the economy of the document, both to the creator and to the viewer. If the other contributors to quality are the same, then a lower cost version of a document is generally considered better than a more expensive one. While other factors may also contribute to document quality, the measuring of these seven aspects or classes provides a good basis for evaluating document quality.
- the aspects or classes listed as contributing to document quality are usually considered soft and ill-defined concepts; however, these properties can be quantified.
- the method for measuring and quantifying these attributes is to first identify document features that contribute to the property. Quantifiable measures of the individual features are then devised. And finally, the individual feature values are combined to form an overall score for the more abstract property.
- Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating an architectural layout for quantifiably measuring document quality according to the concepts of the present invention.
- the quantization of a document's quality can be carried out in by a system architecture that includes a memory 91 , a document processor circuit 92 , microprocessor 90 , user interface 94 , and a display 93 .
- the memory 91 may store for processing purposes a portion of a document, a page of the document, a portion of a page of a document, a document, or multiple documents.
- the display 93 may display the document or portion thereof that is being quantized with respect to quality.
- the display 93 may also display the various options that a user can choose though the user interface 94 with respect to the classes that the user wishes to quantize or the various parameters that a user can choose though the user interface 94 , which are to be measured within the chosen quantization class.
- the quantization architecture of Figure 1 further includes various circuits for measuring/quantizing various aspects or classes of document quality. These circuits include aesthetics quantizer 10 , ease of use quantizer 20 , eye catching ability quantizer 30 , interest quantizer 40 , communicability quantizer 50 , comfort quantizer 60 , convenience quantizer 70 , and economy quantizer 75 . Each of these (except the economy quantizer, for which measures and methods are well known) will be discussed in more detail below.
- Figure 2 illustrates a single quality quantizer or combiner 80 that receives measured and/or calculated quantized values representing aesthetics, ease of use, eye catching ability, interest, communicability, comfort, and/or convenience.
- Quality quantizer or combiner 80 processes these values based upon a predetermined algorithm so as to generate a quality quantization value for the document or portion of the document being analyzed. If alternate or additional measures of quality are considered, they would also be combined at combiner 80.
- Each value thereof is based on properties inherent in the document itself.

- circuits or circuit for the aesthetics quantization process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- one of the parameters or factors used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's balance or balance in page layout.
- balance there are at least two primary ways of defining balance.
- Other definitions for balance are to be considered within the scope of the present invention.
- the overall balance is calculated by determining the center of visual weight 102 of Figure 4 and noting how much it differs from the visual center of the page 101 of Figure 4 .
- Figure 8 provides a detail example of determining the overall balance of a page of a document.
- V OB 1-[(((x m -x c )/d x ) 2 +((y m -y c )/d y ) 2 )/2] 1/2 .
- V LR 1 - [(((x m - x c )/d x ) 2 + ((y L - y R )/d h ) 2 )/2] 1/2 . It is noted that other definitions are possible.
- balance values For example, raise these balance values to powers in order to express the idea that balance is non-linear.
- the above expressions make use of the visual weight of an object. To first order, this can be defined as the objects area times its optical density. However, other psychological effects can also be included. Examples include color carrying more weight than gray; round shapes carrying more weight than rectangular, and positioning at the top of the page giving more weight than at the bottom.
- balance is defined with respect to the visual center of the page 101 .
- the visual center 101 lies halfway between the left and right edges of the page, but it is not halfway between the top and bottom.
- the visual center 101 is taken to be offset a twentieth of the page height towards the top from the geometric center 102 .
- the balance is considered a combination of two approaches described above.
- the quantized overall balance value is derived by a combining of the overall balance and the left-right balance using a balance quantizer or combiner circuit 11 .
- V bl 1 - [w ob (1 - V ob ) -q + w LR (1 - V LR ) -q ] -1/q .
- the weights w ob and w LR give the relative importance of the two balance approaches and should sum to 1. If either of the balance measures is near 1 (good), the overall result is also near 1. The exponent 'q' determines how strong this behavior is.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the balance quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- Non-uniformity is defined herein as the variance of the visual density.
- Densities are preferably scaled to range between 0 and 1.
- a rescale may be needed if visual weight includes factors in addition to the optical density that alter the range of values.
- An average page density can also be defined as the sum of the visual weights for all objects on the page divided by the imageable area of the page.
- the imageable area Ap i is typically the area of the page excluding margins.
- D AV ⁇ M i /Ap i .
- a non-uniformity value is calculated by dividing the imageable area into a small number of portions and comparing the visual density for portions to the average page density.
- a non-uniformity value can be calculated as the difference between the visual density for the portion of the page and the average page density, which is squared and weighted by the portion's area. Subtracting 1 this gives a uniformity value.
- the average page density can also be calculated for each page individually, or an overall average page density can be determined from the visual weight of all objects on portions of all pages and the area of all pages.
- An alternative to calculating a single non-uniformity value for the document directly is to calculate non-uniformity values for individual pages and then combines the page values by some means such as an average, or by a non-linear scheme that might, for example, yield a low result if any page has a low value.
- Other uniformity measures are possible, for example, the true variance in the densities can be calculated and used to give non-uniformity.
- a function is constructed from measured human responses to differing uniformities.
- a good page design is one with white space (including margins) totaling about half of the total page area.
- the non-white space area can be estimated by totaling the areas of the content objects.
- the white space fraction, the amount of area not associated with an object 110 on page 100 totals more than half of the imageable area and thus it is undesirable.
- the white space fraction, the amount of area not associated with an object 110 on page 100 totals less than half of the imageable area and thus it is also undesirable.
- the white space fraction, the amount of area not associated with an object 110 on page 100 totals about half of the imageable area and thus it is optimal.
- the class of trapped white space is primarily concerned with relatively large blocks of white space.
- One way that efficiency, as used herein, can be improved is by performing a trapped white space analysis at a coarse resolution. The approach taken is to determine the area of all white space that can be accessed directly from the margins. This area then gets added to the area of the content objects ( 110 of Figure 16 ) and compared to the area of the page. Any difference becomes the amount of trapped white space ( 120 of Figure 16 ).
- the value stored in the TopProf array is compared to the top boundary and the array value is replaced with the top value if top is smaller.
- the difference between the bottom boundary and the page height is compared to the BottomProf array value and updated with the smaller result. This is captured in the following:
- L, R, T, B contain the left, right, top, and bottom boundary positions of the content object respectively, and H is the page height. Similar calculations update the LeftProf and RightProf arrays for the content object.
- Total white space area ( 125 of Figure 21 ) connected to the page edges can be found by examining the entire page and comparing and checking each point position against the profile arrays. A sum of all points that lie between a page edge and the corresponding profile boundary is computed. Summing all points in this manner avoids double counting of areas where profiles overlap. Pseudo-code to do the computation follows:
- a white space free-flow measure for the overall document can be defined as an average of the white space free-flow for the individual pages.
- Non-linear combinations are also possible such as taking the root of the average of powers of the page values.
- the content objects it is desirable for the content objects to be displayed in an aligned pattern.
- the alignment might be for all left edges to have the same x value. Alternatively, it might be for all objects to share the same centerline. If right edges are aligned as well as left ones, this is better still. Similarly, rows of objects should be vertically aligned.
- Figure 22 illustrates objects 110 on a page 100 that are poorly aligned.
- Figure 23 illustrates objects 110 on a page 100 that are well aligned.
- a method for calculating an alignment measure which can be applied to object's left edges, right edges or horizontal centerlines, is disclosed. The method also applies to tops, bottoms, and vertical centers. Each application yields a different alignment measure. These are then all combined for an overall alignment measure.
- the alignment measure can be applied to all content objects, or alternatively, can be applied to a restricted set of objects such as all objects belonging to a logical group in the document structure. Alignment can also be restricted to objects of a given type, such as all paragraphs, or all pictorial images.
- Each alignment metric may be built on a page basis and provides a quantifiable indication of how well different components on the page are aligned. With this approach the individual page alignments can be combined to form an alignment measure for the entire document. Alternatively, alignment values can be calculated using document objects across multiple pages. When components are aligned well, then the number given by the metric is one. When components are not aligned well, the metric gives a number smaller than one. Advantageously, changing the position of the components on the page changes this number in a smooth and continuous way.
- a histogram of edge (or center) position ( Figure 25 ) is created reflecting the distance objects 110 on page 100 are from an edge, in the illustration of Figure 24 , the edge is the left edge.
- the histogram is preferably created at lower resolutions than the actual positioning. This reduces alignment sensitivity as well as saving on memory and computation requirements.
- EdgeCount EdgeCount
- EdgeCount[b*x] + 1. Strong alignment will result in most positions contributing to the same histogram element. If one is interested in the alignment of the left edges of objects, the histogram is filled using left-edge positions. Alignments for right, top, or bottom edges and center positions are intended to be calculated similarly.
- the alignment measure depends on the distances between neighboring entries in the histogram. The closer together the entries are, the higher the score. This dependence must be non-linear. Otherwise, any moving of an object closer to its neighbor is canceled by the moving of the object away from its neighbor on the other side.
- the non-linear function used for entries separated by a distance z is: A/(A+z) where A is a constant that controls how fast values fall away from 1 as the distance between entries increases.
- n-1 separations exist between edges of distance zero. As such, there should be a contribution of n-1 from an entry count of n as well as the contribution from the separations between neighboring entry positions. If the total number of components were NumberOfObjects, the maximum contribution, if they were all perfectly aligned, would be NumberOfObjects-1. Divide by this value to normalize the score so that the final result ranges between 0 and 1.
- align L 1 - (w L (1 - align L ) -q + w R (1 - align R ) -q + w C (1 - align C ) -q ) -1/q ; where w L , w R , and w C , are weights of the relative importance of each of the three alignments and the exponent 'q' controls how strongly one alignment dominates.
- alignment measures are calculated for the top, bottom, and vertically centered positions, referred to herein as: align T , align B , and align M . These are combined into a vertical alignment measure align V .
- align T align H
- align B align M
- align M align M
- V alH align H
- V alV align V
- the alignment is considered a combination of the left alignment, right alignment, top alignment, bottom alignment, vertical center alignment, and horizontal center alignment values described above.
- the quantized alignment value is derived by a combining of the left alignment, right alignment, top alignment, bottom alignment, vertical center alignment, and horizontal center alignment values using an alignment quantizer or combiner circuit 12 .
- the illustration shows a circuit for the alignment quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- An overall document alignment can be formed as a combination of alignment values determined for separate pages.
- an overall document alignment can be calculated by considering all content objects at once without separating them according to page.
- an average may be used as the combining mechanism, but alternatives are possible.
- a method of combining that yields a low result if any of the pages have low values may be preferred. Techniques such as taking the reciprocal root of the average of reciprocal powers are an example of such a combining method.
- Figure 27 illustrates an example of low position regularity of objects 110 on page 100
- Figure 28 illustrates an example of high position regularity of objects 110 on page 100
- Figure 29 illustrates an example of low spacing regularity of objects 110 on page 100
- Figure 30 illustrates an example of high spacing regularity of objects 110 on page 100 .
- One way to measure regularity is to identify the neighbors of each object ( 110 ) and then consider the distance between corresponding edges of the object and its neighbors (e.g. the left edge of the object and the left edge of its neighbors). But because the identification of neighbors can be expensive, a simpler approximation is often preferred.
- This provides a measure of regularity, but it will be dependent on which alignment measure is used in the extraction of alignment position separations. While all six alignments can be used and the results combined, the left alignment is preferred for determining horizontal regularity and the top alignment is preferred for finding vertical regularity.
- An overall position regularity value can be defined as a weighted sum of the horizontal and vertical contributions.
- a uniform separation between objects can also be calculated to determine document quality. This is a measure of spacing regularity preferably calculated in a manner similar to alignment and positional regularity. However, in this instance, the array of data values corresponding to EdgeCount, contains the histogram of spacing values between objects.
- spacing values for horizontal spacing regularity for each object first determine the closest object (if any) that lies to the right and which overlaps in the vertical direction. The spacing then becomes the distance from the right edge of the current object and the left edge of that object's neighbor. A similar calculation determines separations for the vertical direction.
- an approximation of spacing can be created without the cost of identifying object neighbors by examining arrays of edge positions (as were generated for the alignment calculation). For horizontal spacing, step through the array of right edge positions. For each position determine the first left edge to the right of this location from the left edge array. The separation value becomes the distance between the right and left edge positions. To account for the possibility that more than one object may have an edge at these locations, enter into the histogram the product of the count of edges from the right and left edge histograms at these locations. The sum of these products is then used to normalize the final result instead of NumberOfObjects as in the alignment calculation. The approximate separation count is then given by:
- V SH sreg when SpacSepCount is computed from left and right edges
- V SV sreg when SpacSepCount is computed from top and bottom edges
- An overall separation regularity measure can be defined as the weighted sum of the horizontal and vertical contributions.
- small objects 110 not be positioned at or near the edge of a page 100 as they appear insecure and could fall off. This is particularly true of objects such as page numbers placed outside of the margins.
- the distance from its center to each of the page edges is determined.
- the distance may be weighted by which edge is used since an object may appear less secure near a bottom edge than at the top edge.
- the minimum weighted-distance should be preserved.
- the bounding box of the content ( 1101 , 1102 , 1103 , 1104 , and 1105 ) is preferred.
- the bounding box is calculated as follows: Step through the content objects and find the minimum left edge, the maximum right edge, and (measuring top down) the minimum top edge and maximum bottom edge.
- the width is the difference between the maximum right edge and minimum left edge.
- the height is the difference between the minimum top edge and maximum bottom edge.
- object 1101 has a good proportionality or aspect ratio, while object 1102 has a poor proportionality or aspect ratio.
- quantifiable features that contribute to the aesthetics of a document and thereby to the document quality are possible.
- the particular embodiments describe here are meant to illustrate how a quantifiable aesthetic measure can be constructed and how either directly, or through the aesthetics, they contribute to document quality. Their identification should not rule out the use of other features as appropriate.
- a combining circuit 20 receives measured and/or calculated quantized values representing separability, distinguishability, locatablility, searchability, and/or group identity and processes these values based upon a predetermined algorithm so as to generate an ease of use quantization value for the document or portion of the document being analyzed.
- Each value thereof is based on properties inherent in the document itself.
- the values are individually combined into an overall value or score for the document.
- Other methods for measuring, assigning, or otherwise associating a quantifiable value for document quality should be considered within the scope of the present invention; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular methods put forth, but also in the much broader concept of determining a value for document quality.
- each rule is defined to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1 such that 0 means low value and 1 means high value. This enables quantized quality values to be calculated and combined to form the overall document quality measure.
- V i is the value calculated for the i th rule
- the combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions. However, because any bad contributor can ruin the document quality no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.
- V EU ( ⁇ w i (V i ) -p ) -1/p .
- the w i factors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one.
- the exponent 'p' introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The larger the value of the exponent 'p' is, the greater this effect
- V EU ( ⁇ w i (d + V i ) -p ) -1/p - d.
- the w i factors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one.
- the exponent 'p' introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones.
- the parameter d is a number slightly larger than 0. The larger the value of the exponent 'p' is, the greater this effect.
- circuits or circuit for the ease-of-use quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- the measurement of ease of use requires the identification of quantifiable features that contribute to the ease of use. Examples of methods to measure and combine such features are provided.
- the features first considered are those that relate to the logical structure of the document, that is, to the organization of the document content into group.
- content objects of interest need to be identified as to what kind of content these objects are, (e.g., images, paragraphs, headings, titles, blocks, borders, lists, tables, etc.). This of course will be highly dependent upon the kind of document the document's creator or developer either envisions, or is creating, or has already created.
- content needs to be characterized, as illustrated in Figure 33 , as to how content is intended to be grouped such that content can be distinguished from other content, from other content groups, from other content group members ( 1104, 1105, 1106 ) or elements, and from neighboring content ( 1101, 1102, 1103 ).
- This can be effectuated by parsing content objects of interest into a tree structure of content, as illustrated in Figure 34 , wherein nodes 135 of the content tree are content groups (i.e., lists, tables, etc.) and leaves of the branches 130 of the content tree are content elements (i.e., paragraphs, images, and the like).
- nodes 135 of the content tree are content groups (i.e., lists, tables, etc.) and leaves of the branches 130 of the content tree are content elements (i.e., paragraphs, images, and the like).
- a neighbor list associated with content group G is initialized to an empty list.
- the content tree is traversed upward to identify branches neighboring content group G.
- the content tree is then traversed downward such that elements of the identified content branches can be examined.
- Branches are pruned that are considered to exceed a predetermined distance from the node of the group G. Only branches considered as 'nearby' are recursively analyzed.
- the procedure IsNeighbor(G,N) is used herein to ascertain whether or not a node N is within a threshold distance of content group G, such that node N is to be considered a neighbor N of group G. This can be readily effectuated by calculating a distance between group G and neighbor N and comparing that distance to a threshold variable CloseEnough so as to determine whether Distance(G,N) ⁇ CloseEnough.
- Distance can be the distance between content borders or alternatively the distance between content centers. With respect to the former, if the content centers of group G are (x G , y G ) and neighbor N are (x N , y N ) and the widths and heights of group G and neighbor N are (w G , h G ) and (w N , h N ) respectively, then distance can be readily computed by the relationship of: max(abs(x G -x N ) - (w G +w N )/2, 0) + max(abs(y G -y N ) - (h G +h N )/2, 0). More complex distance calculations such as minimum Euclidean distance between corners can also be used.
- the threshold CloseEnough can either be a constant or be adjustable with respect to content size.
- One can use the square root of the area of object G to determine a threshold value such that: CloseEnough (Area(G)) 1/2 .
- This also can be scaled by factor S where S is typically close to 1 such that: CloseEnough S* (Area(G)) 1/2 .
- the methods provided for evaluating distance or determining threshold are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining a distance measure for content objects should be considered within the scope of the present invention; such that the present invention is directed to the much broader concept of using a measure of distance between content objects in the context of evaluating document quality.
- pseudo-code illustrates how the content tree can be traversed. It should be understood that pseudocode provided herein is illustrative, and as such, is intended to be modified by one skilled in the art of computer science and programming without undo experimentation to effectuate implementation hereof in one's own system. Note that group G is the content currently under examination, C is a node, P is a node, and N is used as a convenience index to identify the node being examined.
- the depth in the tree of neighbor node N relative to content group G can be obtained by adding a depth d parameter wherein d+1 is passed in the recursive call to TraverseUp and wherein depth d-1 is passed in the recursive call to TraverseDown.
- the initial value of depth for d would be zero, i.e., TraverseUp(G, G, 0).
- Depth can be stored along with other information on the previously described list of neighbor nodes of group G.
- a document's degree of overall separability can be ascertained by determining the degree of total separability for the document's content objects of interest contained therein.
- Individual measures for content object separation includes: spatial separation ( Figure 37 ), alignment separation ( Figure 38 ), style separation ( Figure 39 ), background separation ( Figure 40 ), and inherent separation ( Figure 41 ), among others.
- a combination of separation measures, as illustrated in Figure 36 , for content is then useful in evaluating the document content's degree of effective separation of content.
- Effective separation is useful in evaluating the document content's degree of total separation of content, which, in turn, is useful in evaluating the document's degree or measure of overall separation.
- Overall separation is subsequently used in assessing document quality.
- the effective separability is considered a combination of the spatial separation, alignment separation, style separation, background separation, and/or inherent separation.
- the quantized alignment value is derived by a combining of the spatial separation, alignment separation, style separation, background separation, and/or inherent separation using an effective separability quantizer or combiner circuit 21 .
- the illustration shows a circuit for the effective separability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- the spatial separation (SpatialSep) for a group or element can be the minimum of the separation distance between the group or element and each identified neighbors.
- spatial separation can be distances between horizontal and vertical components with a floor of zero.
- W p width
- H p height
- alignment separation means that one or more positions of object G on a particular page matches a corresponding position of neighboring content N. Alignment separation is how well content avoids having corresponding positional matches within a page.
- alignment separation is the minimum of the absolute differences of their corresponding positions, given by: min(abs(x GL -x NL ), abs(x GR -x NR ), abs(y GT -y NT ), abs(y GB -y NB )).
- Alignment separation can be further normalized to a value between 0 and 1 by dividing by a maximum possible difference in positions (page width W p and page height H p ) of the document page upon which the content resides as expressed by: min(abs(x GL -x NL )/W p , abs(x GR -x NR )/W p , abs(y GT -y NT )/H p , abs(y GB -y NB )/H p ).
- alignment separation can be measured by the sum of the alignment separations between multiple edges as given by: min((abs(x GL -X NL ) + abs(x GR -x NR ))/W p , (abs(y GT -y NT ) + abs(y GB -y NB ))/H p ).
- the methods for evaluating alignment and alignment separation herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing alignment separation amounts; such that the present invention is directed to the much broader concept of using a measure of alignment separation of content objects in a determination of total separability in the context of evaluating document ease of use and document quality.
- style separation is used herein to provide a means by which objects can be further distinguished.
- content types need to be compared against every other style type and a value assigned for the amount of style separation therebetween.
- the assignment of such a value would be made as a judgment call by the document developer. For example, one document developer may consider it easier to distinguish TEXT from an IMAGE than it is to distinguish a LIST from a TABLE. Thus, that developer would assign a much smaller style separation value for types LIST vs. TABLE because it is much more difficult to distinguish between these two types of content.
- the degree of style separation is small.
- the developer may consider it much easier to distinguish between these two types of content.
- separations in style is high so type TEXT vs. type IMAGE would be assigned a high value in the table of style separations, e.g., TypeSepTable, which is preferably multi-dimensional and indexed by type.
- the table of style separation values contains a value for all types vs. all other types.
- content type IMAGE would be assigned a style separation value against all other types of content (e.g., TEXT, IMAGE, GRAPHIC, LIST, TABLE, etc.).
- the IMAGE vs. TEXT types would have one value for their degree of style separation.
- the IMAGE vs. GRAPHIC types would have a value for their respective degree of style separation. All types would be stored in a manner, which renders the value for the degree of style separation between two content types readily retrievable.
- StyleSep TypeSepTable[type(G)][type(N)].
- the style difference can be calculated as just the absolute difference of the size values.
- the style difference can be the distance between the values.
- enumerated values such as quadding, font family or font style one can use a two-dimensional look-up table indexed by the enumerated values for the two objects to retrieve difference.
- An overall style separation difference becomes the weighted sum of the various style differences available for the object type.
- StyleSep ⁇ w i d i (G, N); where the sum is over available style parameters i, and w i is the weight of the i th style parameter, and d i is the difference measure for the i th style parameter.
- the particular methods for evaluating style separation herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining style separation should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing styles; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining style separation, but also in the much broader concept of using a measure of style separation in a determination of content separability in the context of evaluating document ease of use and document quality.
- background separation can be thought of as the difference in backgrounds 1102 of two objects ( 110 and 1101 ). If, for instance, background color 1102 is a style parameter of the object G ( 1101 ) or one of its ancestors, the content tree is searched upward until the first object with a specified background is found. The following pseudocode illustrates this.
- Differences in color can be determined using the distance in a color space that strives for visual uniformity such as L*a*b* coordinates. Other color spaces can be used as well.
- the measure of background separation should not be just distance between colors in color space because once the colors are sufficiently different to easily tell apart, further differences between them does nothing to increase separability. What is preferred is a function of distance that is 1 for all values of color difference except those close to zero. One way to obtain this is by scaling color difference Dc by a large factor and then clamping the results to 1
- BackgroundSep min(s*Dc,1).
- An alternative is to take the n th root of the difference value to limit the color difference Dc to the range 0 to 1.
- BackgroundSep Dc 1/r .
- the particular methods for evaluating background separation herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining background separation should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing backgrounds; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of computing background separation, but also in the much broader concept of using a measure of background separation in a determination of content separability in the context of evaluating document ease of use and document quality.
- features are constructed into content objects. Such features are considered inherent to the object itself.
- An example is an object's border 1103 or an indented first line or other feature that inherently indicates a separation from other objects. Spacing before the paragraph or after the paragraph that is different from the internal line spacing, can also signal a separation. Further, some separators only serve to distinguish on a single boundary, i.e., indicating separation at the top but not at the sides.
- neighbor N will also have an inherent separation.
- the complementary inherent separations from both object G and neighbor N can be combined as well. For example, if neighbor N is substantially above object G, then use the sum of InherentSepTop of G and InherentSepBottom of N. Alternatively, the maximum of the complementary inherent separations from G and N can be used.
- the InherentSep from a neighbor is one of the top, bottom, left or right Inherent Separations as chosen above.
- the particular method for evaluating effective separation herein is exemplary and not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining effective separation should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing separation devices; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining effective separation, but also in the much broader concept of using a measure of effective separation of content in a determination of content separability in the content of evaluating document ease of use and document quality.
- an object's total separation from all neighbors a determination of the minimum of the effective separations between object G, and all its neighbors has to be made.
- n is the number of neighbors
- c is a small constant to guard against division by zero, and the power p determines how strongly small separations dominate. If an object has no neighbors then its TotalSep value should be 1.
- An overall separability measure for a document is determined by combining total separations for all document content objects and groups. This can be by a straight average. Although, any object or group with a low separability value may adversely impact the value for the entire document, and therefore, should be given a higher weight by combining as the root of powers.
- Separability may vary with level in the content tree hierarchy in which an object exists.
- An algorithm for computing separability by recursively traversing the content tree is provided herein which calculates a weighted average using weights w L which vary with content's tree level L.
- the following pseudocode is provided by way of example.
- the degree of separability of these object paragraphs can be based on a determination as to where one object ends and another object begins. In this instance, the separability value would be high since these objects have no neighboring objects on the same page. In other words, the closer objects are to one another, the easier it is to note their differences.
- a heading can distinguish the content that follows, as illustrated in Figure 44 .
- the heading can be a separate paragraph at the start of a group of content objects (usually with a different style to distinguish it as a heading). Numbering of list elements and, to a lesser degree, bullet elements also help distinguish content.
- the following recursive algorithm determines heading contribution to distinguishability of object G. It assumes that heading content objects have already been identified. A heading's contribution is weighed according to its distance up the tree from the original object.
- Object G and neighbor N should be distinguishable based on content type and value, as illustrated in Figure 45 .
- content properties can be compared. For groups, lists and tables, the total number of words or characters for all of their contained elements can be compared.
- objects can be distinguished by their position on their respective pages, as illustrated in Figure 46 .
- the center position for these objects 110 on page 100 (x G , y G ) and (x N , y N ), the distance between them can be calculated preferably normalized by the dimensions of the page W P by P .
- PositionDistinguish (((x G - x N ) 2 + (y G - y N ) 2 ) / (W P 2 + H P 2 )) 1/2 .
- This can be further limited by only considering nearby neighbors on the same page. The same list of neighbors generated for separability can then be utilized. The cost in limiting comparisons to objects on a page, however, is the failure to recognize cases where objects on different pages are indistinguishable.
- PositionDistinguish can be a further differentiator.
- the constant c is slightly larger than 1 to prevent division by zero. Note that this is the effective distingishability between an object
- Total distinguishability can be determined by taking the minimum of all EffectiveDistinguish values for all neighbors.
- TotalDistinguish w h * HeadingDistinguish + (1- w h ) * ([(1/n) * ⁇ (c + EffectiveDistinguish) -p ] -1/p - c); where w h is the weight of the HeadingDistinguish property relative to the neighbor differencing properties, n is the number of neighbors, constant c is a small constant to guard against division by zero, and power p determines how strongly close similarities dominate.
- a combination of distinguishability measures, as illustrated in Figure 43 is useful in evaluating the document's total distinguishability.
- the total distinguishability is considered a combination of the effective distinguishability and the heading distinguishability.
- the quantized distinguishability value is derived by a combining of the effective distinguishability and the heading distinguishability using a total distinguishability quantizer or combiner circuit 23.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the total distinguishability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- a document's overall distinguishability can be defined as the combining of all total distinguishability for all content objects and groups. These values can be combined using a straight average. Alternatives, however, are possible.
- locatability is used to mean the ability to find or locate a particular content item from among all the other content items.
- a measure of locatability is constructed by examination of the document factors that aid or inhibit the locating of content objects.
- one factor in determining an object's locatability is to determine the visibility of the object, i.e., how well it can be seen against its background.
- visibility means how easy it is to see the object, or how difficult it is to overlook it.
- two characteristics are used in measuring the value of the object's visibility. One is the size of the object 1110 (the larger the object the easier it should be to detect and identify it) and the other 1111 is its difference from the background.
- the luminance contrast is used, although other and more complex measures are envisioned. If the background is textured, the luminance contrast and color difference may not be well defined. Texture may also act to hide an object.
- the yr, yg and yb values depend upon the details of the color space actually used but typical values are 0.25, 0.68 and 0.07 respectively.
- / (Y b + Y f ). It should be pointed out that since both contrast and size affect visibility, these values are combined by multiplying them together. While contrast ranges between 0 and 1, size can be unbounded. For a size to be bounded by 0 and 1, the object size is normalized by dividing it by the maximum size it can be. For example: visibility contrast * (object area) / (maximum area). In general, this is the area of the document. But, if objects are restricted to a page, the page size can be used.
- another factor in the ease of locating a document element is the presence of structural aids (such as headings and bullets within the document).
- This measure is termed the structural locatability and can be implemented by a tree or table look-up where the result is a predefined value, which depends on the type and style of the structure that contains the element. For example, a decision tree that set a structural location term StructLocate for element E might look as follows:
- a member of a group may be identified by its effective distinguishability from other group members. For example, one might locate the long paragraph in a group and ignore the short ones, or locate the middle paragraph of a list. The methods of measuring effective distinguishability can also be used for locatability. However, instead of comparing the object to its neighbors, the object is compared to its sibling members in the group.
- DistinguishLocate [(1/n) ⁇ (c + EffectiveDistinguish) -p ] -1/p - c; where the sum is overall n sibling group members.
- the constants c and P have the same effect as for the TotalDistinguish calculation and may be the same values.
- MemberLocate (c - [w m * (c - StructLocate) -p + (1-w m ) * (c - DistinguishLocate) -p ] -1/p ) * GroupSizeFactor; where w m is the weight of the structural contribution relative to the distinguishability contribution, c is a constant slightly larger than 1 and P is an number greater than 1.
- a combination of locatability measures, as illustrated in Figure 48 , is useful in evaluating the document's member locatability.
- the member locatability is considered a combination of the structural locatability, as described above, and/or the distinguished locatability, as described above.
- the quantized member locatability value is derived by a combining of the the structural locatability and the distinguished locatability using a member locatability quantizer or combiner circuit 25.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the member locatability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- a further combination of locatability measures, as illustrated in Figure 47 , is useful in evaluating the document's direct locatability.
- the direct locatability is considered a combination of the member locatability, distinguishability, separability, and/or visibility.
- the quantized direct locatability value is derived by a combining of the member locatability, distinguishability, separability, and/or visibility using a direct locatability quantizer or combiner circuit 24.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the direct locatability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- another mechanism to aid in locating an element is a reference or link to that element, such as a page number in a table of contents, or as a hyperlink in an electronic document.
- a paragraph might be found through the table of contents or by looking in the index for the location of a particular word.
- the above individual locatability contributions can be combined into a total locatability measure.
- DirectLocate ([w v * (c + Visibility) -p + w s * (c + TotalSep) -p + w d * (c + TotalDistinguish) -p + w dl * (c + DistinguishLocate) -p ] -1/p - c); where w v , w s , w d and w dl are the weights describing the relative importance of the contributions and sum to 1; c is a small number used to prevent division by zero and P determines how strongly one bad contribution to locatability spoils the overall result.
- TotalLocate c - [w n * (c - DirectLocate) -p + w r * (c - ReferenceLocater) -p + w p *(c - TotalLocate(parent)) -p ] -1/p ; where the weights w n , w r and w p sum to 1, c is a number slightly larger than 1 and P is a number greater than or equal to 1.
- An overall locatability for a document is determined by combining the total locatability for all document content objects and groups.
- the simplest way to combine these values is a straight average. Just as for separability and distinguishability, one might argue that any object or group with a low locatability value strongly impacts the entire document and should be given higher weight such as by combining the root of powers.
- the documents overall locatability gives an overall feel for how easy it is to locate items in a document by calculating and combining measures of how easy it is to locate each and every document component.
- An algorithm for computing document locatability is provided herein which recursively traverses the content tree to calculate a weighted average; although the weights w L can vary with tree level L. To find the overall Locatability of a document, the following routine is executed on the root node of the content tree.
- the particular methods for evaluating a document's overall degree of locatability are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining locatability should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing techniques for locating content objects; such that the present invention is directed to the much broader concept of determining separability for a document based on a combination of individual content separability measured in the context of evaluating document ease of use and document quality.
- a combination of locatability measures, as illustrated in Figure 51 , is useful in evaluating the document's total locatability.
- the total locatability is considered a combination of the direct locatability, reference locatability, and/or parents' locatability.
- the quantized total locatability value is derived by a combining of the direct locatability, reference locatability, and/or parents' locatability using a total locatability quantizer or combiner circuit 26.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the total locatability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- a document's degree of searchability can be determined by first determining a value for strength of searchability of the document, and then determining the document's search density relative to the strength of searchability.
- the search density is mapped to a value that ranges between 0 and 1 and in one embodiment consists of evaluating the relationship given by: 1 - c / (c + Search Density); where c is a constant which is the size of the typical search density and P determines how quickly searchability approaches 1 with increasing search density.
- the strength of searchability is determined by features of the document intended to aid in searching.
- Features include at least one of the number of table elements, the number of list elements, the number of list bullets, and the number of list element numbers or the number of other reference terminals, a reference terminal being a position indicator that can be used by a reference; such as a label, a chapter number for a textual reference, or an anchor for a hyperlink.
- One method for collecting such features is to traverse the content tree looking for the features and incrementing counters when they are discovered.
- group identity is the ability to see the members of a group as a group.
- One indicator of group identity is referred to herein as Spatial Coherence meaning that members of a group are all located close together on the page.
- Other indicators include the presence of a common background or surrounding border, a uniform style among the elements, alignment of the elements, organization of the elements into a list or a table, and the presence of a heading for the group. How to measure and combine these indicators is now discussed.
- spatial coherence is calculated when all the group elements ( 110 of Figure 55 ) lie on the same page ( 100 of Figure 55 ).
- the bounding box (1120 of Figure 55 ) for a group or a group element can be found.
- Figure 53 is an example of low spatial coherence.
- Figure 54 is an example of high spatial coherence.
- the particular methods for evaluating spatial coherence provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining spatial coherence should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing spatial placements of content objects; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining spatial coherence but also in the much broader concept of using a measure of spatial coherence of content objects in a determination of content group identity in the context of determining document ease of use and document quality.
- another indicator that elements belong to a group is that they all have the same style.
- One measure of consistency of style for a group would be to define the sameness of style as: 1 - StyleSep; where StyleSep measures the difference in style, and then to pair-wise compare all of the group elements and combine their sameness values. Combining can be done by averaging.
- One method that looks deeper than just the first level of the group, and compares styles, is to recursively move down the content tree and compare the leaves for consistency of style.
- the style of the leaves discovered can be compared to the style of the first leaf in the tree. Since one is looking for style features that tie all members of the group together, a simple check is to compare style properties to the first leaf. If any leaf has a different property value, then that property cannot be used as an indicator of group membership.
- Figure 56 is an example of poor consistency of style.
- Figure 57 is an example of good consistency of style.
- Non-leaf nodes can also be compared to one another for consistency of their properties. Further, for the non-leaf nodes, one might just compare tables to tables, lists to lists and so on. But this raises the question of just what is the proper depth to use in the search.
- One way is to calculate consistency for all depths and combine the results, weighing the shallow depths higher than the large ones.
- measures for the contributions to group identity from structure, headings, borders and backgrounds can also be calculated. Assume a means of determining whether a group object has a background (or border); whether it has a heading element; and whether it is a list or table, a heading indicator can be created based on whether the group contains a heading. The following pseudocode illustrates this:
- GroupIdentity c - [ w sp * c - SpatialCoherence - p + w st * c - StyleConsistency - p + w ah * c - alignH - p + w av * c - alignV - p + w bk * c - HasBackground - p + w bd * c - HasBorder - p + w si * c - StructuralIdentity - p ⁇ ] - 1 / p ; where w sp , w stl , w ah , w av , w h , w bk
- any object or group with a low group identity value may strongly impact the entire document and preferably given a higher weight such as, for instance, by combining as the root of powers.
- a pseudocode algorithm for computing document group identity by recursively traversing the content tree is provided. This calculates a simple weighted average. Weights wL can vary with tree level L. To find the DocumentGroupIdentity call this routine on the root node of the content tree.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 52 is useful in evaluating the document's group identity.
- the group identity is considered a combination of the spatial coherence, consistency of style, structural identity, horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, heading, background, and/or border.
- the quantized group identity value is derived by a combining of the spatial coherence, consistency of style, structural identity, horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, heading, background, and/or border using a group identity quantizer or combiner circuit 27.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the group identity quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- the content group ease-of-use is calculated as a combination of the measures of contributing factors.
- the factors can include separability, distinguishability, locatability, searchability, and/or group identity. These factors can be calculated using relations of the group elements with one another and with relations of group elements with non-group neighbors.
- the combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions, but because any bad contributor can ruin the ease of use no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.
- the w 1 factors are the weights that specify the relative importance of each rule; they should sum to 1.
- the exponent p introduces the nonlinearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The larger p is, the greater this effect.
- the group ease of use is considered a combination of separability, distinguishability, locatability, searchability, and/or group identity.
- the quantized group ease of use value is derived by a combining of the separability, distinguishability, locatability, searchability, and/or group identity using an ease of use quantizer or combiner circuit 20 .
- the illustration shows a circuit for the ease of use quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- the present invention provides a method of calculating such an eye-catching measure.
- Eye-catching ability is calculated as a combination of simpler properties. If any of the simpler eye-catching properties is strongly present, then the overall effect is an eye-catching document. Contributing factors can include colorfulness, color dissonance, font size, information lightness, picture fraction, and/or novelty. Each factor is defined such as to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1 such that 0 means low or bad eye-catching value and 1 means high or good eye-catching value. These (and possibly other such rules), can be calculated and combined to form an overall eye-catching measure.
- V EC E(V cl , V d , V f , V il , V p ... V n )
- the combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions, but because any good contributor can lead to an eye-catching document, no matter how bad the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.
- d is a number slightly larger than 1.
- the w i factors are the weights that specify the relative importance of each rule; they should sum to 1.
- the exponent p introduces the nonlinearity that can also increase the strength by which one good value can overwhelm many bad ones. The larger p is the greater this effect.
- this formula for combining the contributing factors differs from the preferred method for combining aesthetics factors or ease-of-use factors. In the cases of aesthetics and/or ease-of-use, any bad factor would spoil the quality. Thus, when combining, any low contribution will lead to a low result. For eye-catching however, any good factor will rescue the others, and when combining, any high contribution will lead to a high result.
- the particular methods for evaluating ability of the document to catch the eye provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining eye-catching ability should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document characteristics with respect to the ability to catch the eye; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining eye-catching ability, but also in the much broader concept of using a combination of individual measures in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 58 , is useful in evaluating the document's eye-catching ability.
- the eye-catching ability is considered a combination of colorfulness, color dissonance, font size, information lightness, picture fraction, and/or novelty.
- the quantized eye-catching ability value is derived by a combining of the colorfulness, color dissonance, font size, information lightness, picture fraction, and/or novelty using an eye-catching ability quantizer or combiner circuit 30.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the eye-catching ability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- color is eye-catching and a bright orange page can capture attention better than a gray one.
- the primary property of color of interest here is saturation (or chrominance).
- saturation or chrominance
- There are several possible ways to calculate an approximate saturation value that can be used in determining the overall colorfulness of a document or a page. Perhaps the simplest calculation for colors expressed in an RGB color space is: c max(R, G, B) - min(R, G, B) where c is the saturation, as illustrated by Figure 59 (or chrominance) and max and min are the maximum and minimum functions respectively.
- V cl ⁇ c i A i / Ad
- V cl the colorfulness measure
- c i the saturation value for the i th object
- a i that object's area
- Ad is the area of the entire document. The sum is over all objects visible in the document.
- Other variations such as raising the saturation to a power before using it to weight the area are possible.
- the identified colored areas can be summed across all the objects in order to determine how much area in each hue can be seen on the page.
- the dissonance table captures the model of color harmony and dissonance.
- a simple model is that the harmony of colors only depends on their hue difference and not the absolute hues themselves.
- the dissonance table need only be indexed with the hue difference.
- An example of such a model is colors with hue angles that are similar (near 0 degrees apart) or opposite (180 degrees apart) or a third of the way round the hue circle (120 degrees apart) are considered harmonious while other hue angle differences are dissonant.
- the values stored in the dissonance table would look similar to those depicted graphically in Figure 96 .
- color dissonance should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing amounts and types of color; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining color dissonance but also in the concept of using a color dissonance measure in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.
- another mechanism for catching the eye is to use large fonts. This makes the text readable from a distance and gives it a feeling of importance. This mechanism can be used when the document is presented in black and white. It is the maximum font size that is important here (not the average). It can be found by stepping through all the fonts used (or stepping through all the text and finding the fonts) and keeping track of the largest. The maximum font size found should be converted to a number between 0 and 1 for combination with the other measures.
- V f f /(fn+f) where f is the maximum font size found and fn is close to the typical font size found in documents (e.g. 8 or 10 point).
- the impact of font size can be calculated by considering all of the fonts within a document simultaneously, however, an alternative would be to determine the impact of each page separately and then to combine the results of the pages. Combining page results could be done by a simple average, and this may be appropriate for documents such as presentations. However, for many documents it is sufficient for only one page to be eye-catching (e.g. the cover page) and it may be better to employ a non-linear combining method that gives a high score if any of the individual page contributions are high. Or alternatively, one might use a weighted average where the first page is weighted higher than the other.
- page that is densely packed with information will typically require that information to be small and uniform and unlikely to catch the eye. This is not as hard-and-fast an indicator as color or font size because the information might, for example, be presented as a mixture of easy to ignore small black text and eye-catching large colored text.
- information lightness the inverse of information density
- a rough measure of the information present is just the number of characters Nc used to encode the information.
- Ng For graphic figures, one can count the number of primitive graphical constructs (lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, strokes, triangles, polygons, etc.) used to build the figures.
- the count of graphic constructs Ng may be multiplied by a scaling value to normalize it with respect to the text measure.
- V id Id / (a + Id) where a is a constant on the order of the typical information density value.
- pictures are more eye-catching than pure text. That is why there are pictures on paperback-book covers that are intended to attract viewers to purchase them, but only simple text inside to convey the story.
- pictures on paperback-book covers that are intended to attract viewers to purchase them, but only simple text inside to convey the story.
- some analysis of the picture content would be necessary.
- the mere presence of any pictures in a document is generally an indicator of greater eye-catching ability.
- a simple measure of this is the fraction of the document area devoted to pictorial images Ap.
- the particular method for evaluating picture fraction provided herein is exemplary and is not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining picture fraction should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing amounts of pictorial information; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining picture fraction but also in the concept of using a picture fraction measure in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.
- another indicator of how eye-catching a document is its novelty, that is, the presence of the unexpected or unconventional.
- the presence of the unexpected or unconventional is its novelty.
- Such models can be quite sophisticated and can include such factors as the type of document and its anticipated use.
- the use of novelty is illustrated with a simple model. That model is a single typical value expected for each style parameter.
- Style parameters are the available choices that govern the appearance and presentation of the document. They can include the presence of backgrounds and borders, the thickness of borders and rules, paragraph indentation and separation, list indentation, list bulleting, font style, font weight and so on. Style parameters also include font size and color selections, which were considered separately above.
- each style parameter P i has an anticipated value P0 i .
- P0 i the expected value
- n i F(P i - P0 i )
- n i T[P i ]
- the expected values P0 i can be set a priori, or preferably can be found by examining the style settings of typical documents. If they are determined by analyzing documents, the analysis can be conducted on an on-going basis and they can be allowed to adapt to the current typical document style.
- the expected style value may depend upon the location of the content item within the document's logical structure.
- the expected font style for a heading might be weighted differently from the expected setting for the body text. But however it is calculated, novelty can provide a clue as to the documents ability to catch the eye.
- the particular methods for evaluating novelty provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining novelty should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing styles.
- the present invention lies not only in the particular method of determining picture fraction but also in the concept of using a novelty measure in the context of evaluating document eye-catching ability and document quality.
- a property of a document contributing to its quality that is similar to its eye-catching ability is the ability of the document to hold attention and interest. While a major contributor to the interest of a document is its subject matter, the presentation of that subject matter (the style and format) can affect the interest level as well.
- This invention provides a method of calculating an interest measure for the style and format decisions, calculated as a combination of simpler factors that contribute to interest. If any of the simpler interest factors is strongly present, then the overall effect is an interesting document.
- Factors can include variety, change rate, emphasis, graphic fraction colorfulness, color dissonance, picture fraction, and/or novelty. Calculation methods are defined for each of these factors and each are designed to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1, such that 0 means low or bad interest value, and 1 means high or good interest value. These (and possibly other such factors) can be calculated and combined to form an overall interest measure Vi. The separate factors can be combined by a method similar to that described above for the eye-catching ability property.
- Style parameters are the available choices that govern the appearance and presentation of the document. They can include the presence of backgrounds and borders, the thickness of borders and rules, paragraph indentation and separation, list indentation, list bulleting, font style, font weight, font size, color selections and so on.
- Style parameters can be grouped and associated with the logical structure of the content.
- style parameters associated with a text string include the font family, font size, font style, font weight, and color.
- Style parameters associated with a paragraph include the indentation, line length, line spacing, before and after spacing and quadding.
- Style parameters associated with lists include left and right list indentation, bullet or numbering style, and bullet positioning.
- the preferred method is to group the style parameters according to their associated content type (i.e. text styles, paragraph styles, graphic styles, list styles, table styles, content element background styles etc.).
- style parameters and parameter groups to include in the analysis. For example, one might decide to consider just the text, paragraph, and graphic styles. For text, consider font family, size, weight, style and color. For graphics, consider fill color, edge color and edge thickness. For paragraphs, consider line length, line spacing, quadding, and first-line indentation.
- the list elements contain the values of the style parameters for that group.
- Figure 62 is an example of high variety.
- Calculating the style change rate is similar to calculating the style variety as described above, and uses the same style parameters and groupings. However, one need only to maintain for a single description of the most recently encountered style parameter set for each group (instead of a list of all previously encountered sets). For example, there would be a single set of most recently encountered text style parameters, a single set of the graphic style parameters and a set of the most recently encountered paragraph parameters. Step through the document's logical description and examine the style settings. Whenever a content element has style parameters that differ from those seen most recently, a count of the changes for that style group is incremented, and the new set of style values for use with the next content element is remembered.
- the change counts can be weighted and combined to form a total weighted change count c.
- c ⁇ w x c x
- c x is the size of the x th style group change count
- w x is the weight.
- Figure 63 is an example of high change rate.
- some font styles are chosen to emphasize the text. Large text, bold text, and underscored text all have an implied importance over the normal text presentation. This implied importance tells the reader to wakeup and pay attention. As such, it has a special contribution to the maintenance of viewer interest.
- One can calculate an average emphasis measure for the text in a document by summing an emphasis value for each character and then dividing by the total number of characters. V e ⁇ e(t) / nc where V e is the emphasis measure, e is the emphasis function for character t, the sum is over all characters and nc is the total number of characters.
- the function e(t) should include factors for the size of the text, its weight, its variant and its contrast (other factors such as font style might also be included).
- the font weight e.g. light, normal, bold, heavy
- a table of suitable emphasis factors for each weight ew[weight(t)] can be used in the emphasis function.
- the font variant e.g. normal, underlined, strikethrough, outlined
- Contrast also plays a role in the strength of text emphasis. Text with low contrast to the background will not have the same degree of impact as high contrast text.
- the luminance contrast can be calculated as described above as 2
- / (Yb + Yf) where Yb is the luminance of the background and Yf Lum(t) is the luminance of the text.
- Another parameter or factor used in determining interest is the measurement and quantization of the document's graphical fraction.
- graphical constructs are often used to explain or illustrate concepts and ideas. They also add variety to the content. As such, graphics can make a document more interesting, and so, a measure of the graphical content should contribute to the estimation of how interesting the document is.
- An alternative approach is to sum the areas of the bounding boxes that enclose each of the graphical content objects encountered. This sum can then be divided by the total area of the document to yield a number ranging between 0 and 1.
- a third approach is to examine the graphical content objects in greater detail and to count the primitive drawing objects such as lines, curves, rectangles, polygons and ellipses from which they are constructed.
- This approach gives a better measure of the complexity of the graphic and possibly a better measure of how interesting that graphic is.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 61 , is useful in evaluating the.document's interest.
- the interest is considered a combination of variety, change rate, emphasis, graphic fraction, colorfulness, color dissonance, picture fraction, and/or novelty.
- the quantized interest value is derived by a combining of the variety, change rate, emphasis, graphic fraction, colorfulness, color dissonance, picture fraction, and/or novelty using an interest quantizer or combiner circuit 40.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the eye-catching ability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- the present invention provides a method of calculating such a communicability measure.
- the approach to quantifying communicability is to evaluate factors identified as contributing to the effectiveness of the communication. These factors are then combined to form a composite measure. The factors contribute to the quality of the document design. If any of the simpler communicability factors is absent, then the overall ability of the document to communicate is reduced.
- the combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions, but because any bad contributor can lead to a poor communicating document, no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.
- V CM ( ⁇ w i (d + V i ) -p ) -1/P - d
- d is a number slightly larger than 0. The closer the value of d to 0, the more strongly a bad value will cancel all other values.
- the w i factors are the weights that specify the relative importance of each rule; they should sum to 1.
- the exponent p introduces a nonlinearity that can also increase the strength by which one bad value can overwhelm many good ones. The larger p is, the greater this effect.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 65 is useful in evaluating the document's communicability.
- the communicability is considered a combination of legibility, information lightness, technical level, text and image balance, red-green friendliness, ease of progression, and/or ease of navigation.
- the quantized communicability value is derived by a combining of the legibility, information lightness, technical level, text and image balance, red-green friendliness, ease of progression, and/or ease of navigation using a communicability quantizer or combiner circuit 50 .
- the illustration shows a circuit for the communicability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- legibility is considered a combination of decipherability, line retrace, relative line separation, and/or quadding.
- the quantized legibility value is derived by a combining of the decipherability, line retrace, relative line separation, and/or quadding using a legibility quantizer or combiner circuit 51.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the legibility quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- one of the first and foremost factors in estimating a document's communication effectiveness is the legibility of its text.
- Legibility measures the ease of following and recognizing the words of the document when reading.
- Legibility is itself a property that can be broken down into contributing components. As noted above, chief among these components is decipherability, line retrace, relative line separation, and/or quadding. Other factors that might also be considered include the word and character spacing and the use of hyphenation.
- the decipherability is considered a combination of display device properties, font, character familiarity, and/or luminance contrast.
- the quantized legibility value is derived by a combining of the display device properties, font, character familiarity, and/or luminance contrast using a decipherability quantizer or combiner circuit 52.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the decipherability quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- decipherability the most complex of the legibility factors, measures the ability to recognize the letter shapes. It can itself be further broken down into simpler pieces.
- factors that contribute to the decipherability include the display device, the font, the character familiarity, and/or the luminance contrast.
- the properties of the display device and the font may often be considered together; that is, one determines how decipherable a particular font is on a particular device. For example, fonts with serifs are, as a rule, easier to decipher than san serif fonts; but on a device that cannot effectively produce serifs, this may not be true.
- the font family, font size, font weight, font style, and font variant all can contribute to the decipherability.
- fonts are, in general, much more decipherable when printed on paper than when presented on a CRT display.
- An example of an adjustment to the font decipherability is to multiply it by an adjustment factor ad for the display device.
- One way to determine the adjustment factor is as a function of the smallest font size that the device is capable of effectively presenting.
- the function could, for example, be the ratio of the smallest effective text size for the device used in measuring the font decipherability to the smallest effective text size for the display to actually be used. For example, if the font properties were measured on a CRT that could effectively display only 8-point or larger fonts, but was to be printed on paper that could support 4-point fonts or larger, then the device adjustment factor should be 2. One may wish to adjust this factor according to the font size actually used because the effect of the display may be less important for large text.
- An average overall decipherability d, for a string of text can be found by finding the sum of the decipherability measures for each character in the string and then dividing by the total count of characters in the string.
- decipherability The particular methods for evaluating decipherability provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining decipherability should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document text characteristics with respect to decipherability; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining decipherability, but also in the much broader concept of using decipherability measures in the context of evaluating document legibility, communicability and document quality.
- Another parameter or factor used in determining legibility is the measurement and quantization of the document's line retrace.
- the second factor contributing to text legibility is the length of the text lines. There is some cost in moving the eye from the end of one line to the start of the next, but the cost increases with the length of the line. This cost is included by multiplying the decipherability by a line retrace factor r.
- r B / (n 2 + B) where B is a constant (with value on the order of 3600) and n is the average number of characters per line.
- the third contribution to legibility is the relative line separation. Increasing the separation between line acts to improve legibility. It makes it easier for the eye to track correctly from the end of a line to the start of the next line.
- the effect of lines separation is included by means of a line separation factor s.
- y (hL - hf) / hf + bs
- hL the height of the line (baseline to baseline)
- hf the height of the font
- bs is a small biasing term (e.g. 0.1) to indicate just how far lines must overlap before they become unreadable.
- legibility is also affected by the quadding (i.e. the alignment and justification of the text).
- quadding i.e. the alignment and justification of the text.
- Left-aligned unjustified text is easiest to read, and justified text is almost as easy.
- Center-aligned text is more difficult and right aligned is the hardest of all.
- legibility measurement For an entire document, one must measure the legibility of each paragraph and then combine them. Combining can be done by a simple average, but it may be preferred to use a non-linear method such that a low legibility score on any paragraph can result in a lower overall score that would be obtained by a simple average. Methods such as the root of the average of powers that have been described can be used to achieve this effect.
- Figure 70 illustrates an example of a left aligned document.
- Figure 71 illustrates an example of a right aligned document.
- Figure 72 illustrates an example of a center aligned document.
- Figure 73 illustrates an example of a justified document.
- a short road sign communicates more effectively than a long one.
- the information lightness, (the inverse of information density), of a document is included as another factor in how well it communicates. This factor is not nearly as important as legibility and is weighted accordingly.
- the ease with which a document communicates also depends upon the audience for which it was designed. A child's book will probably be easier to follow than a technical manual.
- the technical level is a measure that estimates this intended degree of sophistication. It can be composed from simple measures that can include reading ease, number fraction, and/or picture fraction.
- the presence of graphic constructs may also have an effect on the technical level, but it is unclear at this time whether the effect is to increase or decrease it. It has therefore not been included in this example measure.
- the technical level is considered a combination of reading ease, number fraction, and/or picture fraction.
- the quantized technical level value is derived by a combining of the reading ease, number fraction, and/or picture fraction using a technical level quantizer or combiner circuit 53.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the technical level quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- reading ease is a well-known measure of a document's text.
- words are easier to comprehend than numbers; a large table of numbers is typically much more difficult to grasp than an equal quantity of words. To capture this, calculate the number fraction Fn, measure the ratio of numbers to the total of numbers and words.
- pictures are used to aid understanding.
- the use of pictures reduces the technical level measure.
- T1 Rd Fn Fnp
- Figure 75 illustrates an example of poor text and image balance.
- Figure 76 illustrates an example of poor text and image balance.
- Figure 77 illustrates an example of good text and image balance.
- another aspect of how well a document communicates is its ability to serve viewers with handicaps or impairments.
- An example of this is whether the document can be used by the fraction of men who are red-green colorblind.
- One element of red-green friendliness is checking that an object's color and its background color differ by more than just a red-green contrast.
- Luminance contrast and blue-yellow contrast are the mechanisms by which the colorblind can distinguish the foreground objects from background. Step through the document examining the foreground and background colors for each object. If a color is specified by its red, green and blue components (R, G, B), then the luminance and luminance contrast CY can be calculated as described above.
- a weighted average can also be used to combine the contrast components.
- a third approach combines features of the above two methods.
- the values are weighted by area, but values are raised to a power in a way that emphasizes low values.
- V rg (( ⁇ ( drg + Frg i ) -P A i ) / ⁇ A i ) -1/p - drg where drg is a positive constant near zero and p is a positive power 1 or greater.
- one more property that has a bearing on the communicability of a document is the ease of progression, as illustrated in Figure 78 .
- Ease of progression measures the difficulty in progressing from one document component to the next component in logical order; for example, in moving from the bottom of one column to the top of the next.
- An estimation of the ease of progression is calculated as a composite of several properties, each of which aids in the progression process. These properties include distinguishability, group identity, spatial coherence, list bullets, progression links, headings, alignment, white space, consistency of scan, and/or consistency of order.
- V ep W ds V ds + W gi V gi + W sc V sc + w 1b V 1b + W p1k V p1k + W hd V hd + w a1 V a1 + W ws V ws + W cs V cs + W co V co
- the w's are the weights and the V's are the contributing factors.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 78 , is useful in evaluating the document's ease of progression.
- the ease of progression is considered a combination of distinguishability, group identity, spatial coherence, list bullets, progression links, headings, alignment, white space, consistency of scan, and/or consistency of order.
- the quantized ease of progression value is derived by a combining of the distinguishability, group identity, spatial coherence, list bullets, progression links, headings, alignment, white space, consistency of scan, and/or consistency of order using an ease of progression quantizer or combiner circuit 54 .
- the illustration shows a circuit for the ease of progression quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- the distinguishability indicating how well one can distinguish an element from its neighbors the group identity property indicating how easy it is to tell which objects belong as part of a logical group and which do not, the spatial coherence property that measures how closely packed together the members of a group are, and headings that describe the logical structure, were defined above in the discussion of the group contribution to ease of use. These factors also contribute to how well the document communicates, but with weights to reflect different relative importance. Spatial Coherence is singled out here because it has particular relevance to ease of progression and one may wish to give its contribution a different weight form that entering via group identity.
- bullets and numbers in lists help to identify the list elements and to progress through them. Documents that use bulleted and/or numbered lists should be easier to progress through that those that do not.
- V1 b (alb Nlb + aln Nln) / Nle where alb and aln are the constant weights applied to the count of bullets and count of list numbers.
- internal references serve to guide the reader when the intended progression differs from basic convention.
- Electronic documents can include hyperlink forms that conduct the same function of guiding the reader.
- a simple measure of how helpful the document is in guiding the reader is just a count of such hyperlinks and/or references NL. This count should be divided by some measure of the size of the document (such as the number of content objects NO) in order to get a link density.
- V p1k NL / NO
- a better measure may be obtained by dividing the count of the references by a count of all the points at which the progression does not follow the typical scan order NSO.
- the conventional western scan order is that the next logical content element should be aligned with and to the right or below the current object.
- progression link contribution should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to the presence of progression link specifications with respect to ease of progression and communicability; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the progression link contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using progression link measures in the context of evaluating document ease of progression, communicability and document quality.
- the particular methods for evaluating contribution from alignment to ease of progression and communicability provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining the alignment contribution should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing alignment specifications with respect to ease of progression and communicability; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the alignment contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using alignment measures in the context of evaluating document ease of progression, communicability and document quality.
- the particular methods for evaluating contribution from white space to ease of progression and communicability provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining the white space contribution should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing white space specifications with respect to ease of progression and communicability; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the white space contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using white space measures in the context of evaluating document ease of progression, communicability and document quality.
- one of the conventions for progression through western documents is the scan positioning of left to right, top to bottom. This is the convention followed by text, but it can also be applied to other objects (such was the panes in a comic book). For this convention, one expects the items to have about the same height and to be aligned in rows. The left edge of the rows should be vertically aligned.
- Step through the document elements in their logical order For each element find a bounding box that contains the object and indicates the position of its top yt, bottom yb, left side xl and right side xr.
- the vertical position of the new object (ytn, ybn) is compared with that of the old object (yto, ybo).
- Objects should be placed to the right and below, but not above, so a deviation amount should be added to a deviation accumulation dcs for the degree to which the new object is above the old.
- the new object is vertically in the same row as the old object, then one expects it to be located to the right of the old object.
- the degree to which it is left of the old object is the amount by which it deviates from the scan order model.
- dcs dcs + (xlo - xln) * (xro - xm) / (xro - xln) 2
- Figure 79 illustrates an example of the placement for consistency of scan.
- the particular methods for evaluating contribution from the consistency of scan to ease of progression and communicability provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining the consistency of scan contribution should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing layouts of ordered content with respect to ease of progression and communicability; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the consistency of scan contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using consistency of scan measures in the context of evaluating document ease of progression, communicability and document quality.
- an alternative model for progression order is top to bottom, left to right. This is, for example, the order typically used for layout of a story in a newspaper or magazine.
- Figure 80 illustrates an example of the placement for consistency of order.
- a property similar to ease of progression is ease of navigation. While progression measures the ease or difficulty of moving through the document in the order intended by the creator, ease of navigation measures the ability to locate an arbitrary element of the document. In estimating the ease of navigation one looks mainly for those features that can aid in finding an element or section. In the example method provided here includes headings, list bullets and numbers, running heads and page numbers, internal links, and/or group identity. These properties each contribute to the ease of navigation and an overall measure can be created from a weighted average.
- V en W hd V hd + W lb V lb + w rh V rh + W lnk V lnk + w gi V gi
- w's are the weights and the V's are the value properties. Note that alternative methods of combination, as well as additional contributing factors, are possible. Many of the properties were also used for ease of progression, but the weights used in calculating the ease of navigation may be different.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 81 is useful in evaluating the document's ease of navigation.
- the ease of navigation is considered a combination of headings, list bullets and numbers, running heads and page numbers, internal links, and/or group identity:
- the quantized ease of navigation value is derived by a combining of the headings, list bullets and numbers, running heads and page numbers, internal links, and/or group identity using an ease of navigation quantizer or combiner circuit 55 .
- the illustration shows a circuit for the ease of navigation quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- page numbers can help greatly in navigating a document.
- a measure of their value is the number of different heads divided by the number of pages. One can find this by examining the document for the heads and making a list of the distinct ones. Then one can count the number of heads in the list. For page numbers, one just asks whether or not they are present and if they are, one can add a contribution to the measure.
- V rh wh Nh / Np + (1 - wh) Bpn where wh is the weight given to running heads, Nh is the number of distinct heads, Np is the number of pages in the document, and Bpn is 1 if there are page numbers and 0 otherwise.
- ease of navigation is strongly related to the locatability property for group elements that was described above in the discussion on the ease of use of groups.
- the measures of headings, list bullets and numbers and internal links can be captured as described.
- group identity measure is another measure that is also used in the ease of progression estimation.
- a measure of group identity was described in the above discussion of ease of use of groups. Group identity is calculated from other measures such as spatial coherence, the presence of borders or backgrounds, style uniformity, and alignment of elements.
- another property that contributes to the quality of a document is the comfort level at which the document is perceived.
- a method for quantifying the document comfort level will be described next.
- Comfort is calculated as a combination of simpler properties or rules. Violating any of the component rules can result in discomfort and ruin the overall comfort of the document layout.
- Component rules can include limitation of font forms, limitation of colors, grouping number, neatness, decipherability, non-intimidating, conventionality, color harmony, color appropriateness, consistency of luminance, and/or consistency of size. Each rule is defined to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1 such that 0 means low or bad comfort value and 1 means high or good comfort value. These (and possibly other such rules) can be calculated and combined to form an overall comfort measure.
- V c E(V lf , V lc , V gn , V nt Y dc , V ni , V cv , V ch , V ca, V cl , ... V csz )
- the combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions, but because any bad contributor can ruin the comfort no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.
- V c [ ⁇ w i (d + V i ) -p ] -1/p - d.
- the w i factors are the weights that specify the relative importance of each rule; they should sum to 1.
- the exponent p introduces the nonlinearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The larger p is, the greater this effect.
- the constant d is a positive number near 0 and guards against division by 0.
- the set of rules chosen is illustrative of how a comfort measure can be constructed. Other factors contributing to comfort exist and could certainly be included in a more sophisticated quantification of comfort.
- the particular methods for evaluating document comfort provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining the document comfort should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document characteristics with respect to the feeling of comfort; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the comfort level, but also in the much broader concept of using a combination of individual measures in the context of evaluating document comfort level and document quality.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 82 , is useful in evaluating the document's comfort.
- the comfort is considered a combination of limitation of font forms, limitation of colors, grouping number, neatness, decipherability, non-intimidating, conventionality, color harmony, color appropriateness, consistency of luminance, and/or consistency of size.
- the quantized comfort value is derived by a combining of the limitation of font forms, limitation of colors, grouping number, neatness, decipherability, non-intimidating, conventionality, color harmony, color appropriateness, consistency of luminance, and/or consistency of size using a comfort quantizer or combiner circuit 60.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the comfort quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- fonts have many properties that can be selected to achieve different effects. Font families can be chosen to give the document different feelings, from formal to playful, light to serious, modem to classical. Font size can affect the cost and legibility. Font weights such as bold, can convey importance; font styles, such as italic, can indicate that it is special. Font variants such as strikethrough or outlined can add further meaning.
- bf is a small positive number that controls how quickly the measure falls off with increasing font differences.
- One further possible extension of the measure may be considered. Since the font differences will have a greater impact if the separate font forms are mixed together in the same paragraph than if they are spread over different paragraphs, one can count the number of font forms per paragraph and average this over the paragraphs of the document. The final accumulated difference measure fd can then be scaled by the average fonts-per-paragraph before the inversion to form V lt .
- the test for whether a color is already in the list does not have to be a strict match.
- One can compare colors by computing the distance between them in color space and comparing the distance to a threshold. If the distance is below the threshold, the colors can be considered close enough to match, and a new color list entry is not needed.
- the comfort can depend on the choice of colors as well as the number of them.
- a simple value to accumulate would be the distance between the colors in a color space, but a better measure of the affect on comfort would be the color dissonance of the pair. Since comparing colors pair-wise accumulates values as the square of the number of colors, one can divide the total by the number of colors in the document to get a measure that varies linearly with the number of colors.
- the contribution can be a function of the saturation. For example, for the i th color with saturation c i , the contribution might be ac + c i where ac is a constant value representing the effect of just having another color, and c i is the additional discomfort due to that color's saturation.
- dc ac Nc + ⁇ c i where dc is the color discomfort measure:
- V lc 1 / (bc + dc) where bc is a small positive constant, can be used to convert the discomfort measure into a limitation of color measure that varies between 0 and 1.
- a group should not have too many or too few elements, and odd numbers are preferred over even.
- the best size for a group is 3 elements.
- More complex averaging schemes are possible. For example, one could weight the effect of the grouping number comfort differently depending on the placement of the group within the hierarchy of the document's logical structure tree.
- the particular methods for evaluating contribution from the grouping number to document comfort level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining the contribution from the grouping number should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to the number group elements with respect to feeling of comfort; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the grouping number contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using group size measurements in the context of evaluating document comfort level and document quality.
- people are generally more comfortable with a neat document than with a messy one.
- An example of a neatness measure is offered based on the text neatness, border and background presence, alignment, and/or regularity. Neatness estimates that employ additional factors are possible. In combining the component neatness measures, assume that any source of messiness will destroy the overall neatness (just as was argued for overall comfort).
- V nt [ ⁇ w i (d + V i ) -p ] -1/p - d only now the V i are taken from the set V tn , V bb , V al and V rg for the text neatness, border/background, alignment and regularity.
- the weights w i , and parameters p and d can be different from those used in calculating comfort.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 83 is useful in evaluating the document's neatness.
- the neatness is considered a combination of text neatness, border and background presence, alignment, and/or regularity.
- the quantized neatness value is derived by a combining of the text neatness, border and background presence, alignment, and/or regularity using a neatness quantizer or combiner circuit 60.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the neatness quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- the contributions from font and character can be chosen such that the total messiness contribution for a character never exceeds 1.
- Figure 84 illustrates an example of a neater document.
- Figure 85 illustrates an example of a less neat document.
- borders and backgrounds can aid in understanding the document's structure and can add to the document's interest, but it also results in a document that is not quite as neat as one without these additions.
- an important contributor to neatness is the impression that the document components are aligned and regularly positioned. These factors were described above in the discussion on document aesthetics. Using the techniques described measures V al and V rg for document alignment and regularity can be calculated. Note that the weighting factors for their contribution to neatness are likely to be different from the factors used in their contribution to aesthetics.
- some text takes more work to decipher and understand than others do. Text printed in italics or using an abnormal font variant is harder to read. Light colored text on a light background, or dark text on a dark background takes an effort to decipher. This work will tire the reader and make the document uncomfortable to use.
- a method for estimating the average decipherability of a document V dc was described above in the discussion on how well a document communicates.
- the particular methods for evaluating contribution from the text decipherability to document comfort level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining the contribution from the text decipherability should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to different text style with respect to decipherability and the feeling comfort; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the text decipherability contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using text decipherability measures in the context of evaluating document comfort level and document quality.
- some document constructs can act to intimidate the reader. By noting the degree to which these factors are present, one can form an intimidation measure. Intimidation acts against comfort, so the inverse of the intimidation factor should contribute to the comfort estimation. Factors that intimidate include a low amount of white space, high information density, low legibility, bold text, a low picture fraction, line use, and/or a high technical level. Many of the factors are familiar from IRS forms.
- V in ⁇ Wi V i where w i are the weights and the V i are the non-intimidation component values V ws , V il , V lg , V dc , V nb, V pf, V nl , V lt corresponding to the above list of factors.
- the intimidation is considered a combination of a low amount of white space, high information density, low legibility, bold text, a low picture fraction, line use, and/or a high technical level.
- the quantized intimidation value is derived by a combining of the a low amount of white space, high information density, low legibility, bold text, a low picture fraction, line use, and/or a high technical level using an intimidation quantizer or combiner circuit 62.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the intimidation quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- Figure 87 is an example of an intimidating document.
- the particular methods for evaluating a measure of how intimidating or non-intimidating a document is provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.

- documents that are "open" with lots of white space are not as intimidating as those that are filled with content.
- a method for estimating the white space fraction was described above in the discussion of how well a document communicates.
- the non white space area can be estimated by totaling the areas of the content objects.
- the total object area can be scaled by the total document area Ad.
- V ws (Ad - ⁇ A i ) / Ad
- the particular methods for evaluating contribution from the white space to document intimidation level and comfort level provided herein is exemplary and is not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining the contribution from the white space should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to different white space amounts with respect to feeling of intimidation; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the white-space contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using white space measures in the context of evaluating document intimidation level, document comfort level and document quality.
- densely packed information is intimidating and so inverse of the information density can contribute to the non-intimidation measure.
- Such an information lightness measure was described above in the discussion of a document's eye-catching ability.
- the particular methods for evaluating contribution from the information lightness or density to document intimidation level and comfort level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining the contribution from the information density should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to different information and area amounts with respect to feeling of intimidation; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the information lightness or density contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using information density measures in the context of evaluating document intimidation level, document comfort level and document quality.
- an illegible document is intimidating, so legibility should contribute to the non-intimidation measure.
- a method for estimating legibility was described in the above discussion of a document's ability to communicate.
- the presence of vertical lines can be intimidating, especially thick ones with high contrast.
- a method for quantifying the effect of vertical lines is to first step through the document and find them. This includes vertical lines that are part of borders and also rectangles with the ratio of width to height less than a threshold value. For each line discovered, multiply its area Al by its luminance contrast cl.
- the measure of technical level includes such things as reading ease, the presence of numbers, and the absence of pictures.
- a definition of an example technical level measure is given above in the discussion of how well a document communicates.
- the technical level V tl can be inverted for a measure of non-technical level that can be used in the non-intimidating calculation.
- V nt 1 - V tl
- the appropriateness of the color choices is the appropriateness of the color choices.
- the document design rule is that large background areas should use desaturated colors while small foreground objects should use saturated colors.
- the area should be measured as a fraction of the total document area Ad in order to restrict the result to the range of 0 to 1.
- a large result comes from a large area with a high saturation (which is inappropriate).
- For an average value for the entire document one must combine the values from all objects, and with a simple weighting of saturation by area it would be possible to get a measure of inappropriate color use from many small saturated foreground objects, when this may actually be appropriate.
- V ca 1 - ⁇ c i (A i / Ad) p where p is a value greater than 1.
- the rule for consistency of luminance states that for a group of content elements, the dark elements should come first and the lighter elements should follow.
- the logical structure of a document is typically a tree with each branch node representing a group.
- the content elements may not be simple objects with a single color and luminance.
- the consistency of luminance rule can still be applied, but the luminance used should be the average luminance of the subtree group member.
- the above method indicates how to calculate a measure for each node in the content tree, but does not say how to obtain a collective value for the tree as a whole.
- One method for doing this is to form a weighted average of all the tree node values, where the weight is a function of the depth of the tree.
- V cl (( ⁇ w i (dcl + Vcl i ) -p ) / ⁇ w i ) -l/p - dcl where the sums are over all group nodes in the content tree, w i is the node depth Vcl i is the consistency of luminance of the node and dcl is a small positive constant and p is a positive value such as 1.
- Figure 88 is an example of consistent luminance.
- Figure 89 is an example of inconsistent luminance.
- the particular methods for evaluating contribution from the consistency of luminance to document comfort level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining the contribution from the consistency of luminance should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to different object luminance values and ordering with respect to consistency of luminance and the feeling comfort; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the consistency of luminance contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using consistency of luminance measures in the context of evaluating document comfort level and document quality.
- the design rule for consistency of size is that for a group of content elements, the large elements should come first and the smaller elements should follow.
- To find a measure of the consistency of size for a group step through the members of the group and find the bounding size of each member. Compare that size to the previous member's size and if the new size is bigger than the old then collect the difference. This actually gives a measure of the inconsistency and one can use a reciprocal function to convert it to a consistency value ranging between 0 and 1.
- the method is illustrated by the following pseudocode:
- the above method indicates how to calculate a measure for each node in the content tree, but does not say how to obtain a collective value for the tree as a whole.
- One method for doing this is to form a weighted average of all the tree node values, where the weight is a function of the depth of the tree.
- V cs (( ⁇ w i ( dcs + Vcs i ) -p ) / ⁇ w i ) -l/p - dcs
- w i the node depth
- Vcs i the consistency of size of the node
- dcs is a small positive constant
- p is a positive value such as 1.
- Figure 90 is an example of consistent size.
- Figure 91 is an example of inconsistent size.
- another document property that contributes to its quality is the convenience level or ease of use at which the document is perceived.
- a method for quantifying the document convenience level will next be described.
- convenience is calculated as a combination of simpler properties or factors. Violating any of the component factors can result in inconvenience and ruin the overall convenience of the document layout.
- Component factors can include consistency, legibility, disability proof, ease of navigation, ease of progression, searchability, locatability, viewable fraction, single window display, and/or transmission and processing time.
- V cv E(V cns , V lg , V dp , V en , V ep , V sh , V lo , V vf , V sw , ... V tm )
- the combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions, but because any bad contributor can ruin the convenience no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.
- An alternative is to use: V cv [ ⁇ w i (d + V i ) -p ] -l/p - d.
- the w i factors are the weights that specify the relative importance of each rule; they should sum to 1.
- the exponent p introduces the nonlinearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The larger p is the greater this effect.
- the constant d is a positive number near 1 and guards against division by 0.
- the convenience is considered a combination of consistency, legibility, disability proof, ease of navigation, ease of progression, searchability, locatability, viewable fraction, single window display, and/or transmission and processing time.
- the quantized convenience value is derived by a combining of the consistency, legibility, disability proof, ease of navigation, ease of progression, searchability, locatability, viewable fraction, single window display, and/or transmission and processing time using a convenience quantizer or combiner circuit 70.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the convenience quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- Consistency helps people build an internal model of the document that, in turn, makes it easier to use.
- Some of the contributing rules or factors to consistency and how factors can be combined into an overall consistency measure will now be described.
- the example consistency measure will include position order, luminance, size, and/or style. The methods for calculating measures for these factors have been described above and will not be repeated in detail here.
- V nt [ ⁇ w i (d + V i ) -p ] -l/p - d
- V i are taken from the set V cp , V cl , V csz and V cst .
- the weights w i indicate the relative importance of the different measures.
- the parameter p is a number 1 or larger and d is a value slightly larger than 0.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 94 , is useful in evaluating the document's consistency.
- the consistency is considered a combination of position order, luminance, size, and/or style.
- the quantized consistency value is derived by a combining of the position order, luminance, size, and/or style using a consistency quantizer or combiner circuit 72.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the consistency quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- the particular methods for evaluating a measure of the consistency of a document is provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope.
- Other methods for determining the document consistency level should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing document characteristics with respect to the feeling of consistency; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the consistency level, but also in the much broader concept of using a combination of individual measures in the context of evaluating document consistency level, document convenience level and document quality.
- V cp dcp - (((dcp - V cs ) -p + (dcp - V co ) -p ) / 2) -l/p where dcp is a constant slightly larger than 1 and p is also a number 1 or greater.
- a combination of measures, as illustrated in Figure 93 , is useful in evaluating the document's consistency of position.
- the consistency of position is considered a combination of consistency of scan and/or consistency of order.
- the quantized consistency of position value is derived by a combining of the consistency of scan and/or consistency of order using a consistency of position quantizer or combiner circuit 71.
- the illustration shows a circuit for the consistency of position quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware.
- the quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- a method for computing a measure of the consistency of luminance V cl is described in the above discussion of document comfort. The idea is that darker items should precede lighter ones in a group.
- a method for computing a measure of the consistency of size V csz is also presented in the above discussion on document comfort. The idea is that larger items should precede smaller ones in a group.
- a method for computing a measure of the consistency of style V cst is presented above in the discussion of ease of use of groups. The idea is that items at similar positions in the content structure should have matching styles.
- a document that is difficult to read is often difficult to use.
- a measure of legibility V lg was defined above as a contributor to a document's communicability. It can contribute to convenience as well as communicability but with a different weight. In fact, one could argue that communicability, as a whole, should be used as a contributor to convenience. While this is not ruled out, the example here will just include a few of the components of communicability that have particular bearing on convenience. Considering them separately allows one to give them different weights when contributing to convenience than those used for the contribution to communicability.
- legibility to document convenience level The particular methods for evaluating contribution from legibility to document convenience level provided herein are exemplary and are not to be considered as limiting in scope. Other methods for determining the contribution from legibility should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to different text characteristics with respect to legibility and the feeling convenience; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular method of determining the legibility contribution, but also in the much broader concept of using legibility measures in the context of evaluating document convenience level and document quality.
- disability proof refers to how well the document can serve people with handicaps. For example, a document of only text can be read to someone who is blind, but a document with images would be much harder to convey.
- Another example of a contributor to a disability proof measure is the red-green friendliness property that was defined in the above discussion on how well a document communicates. The idea behind the measure is that there should be either luminance contrast or blue-yellow contrast between foreground and background colors in order to be red-green friendly. Without this contrast it would be difficult for a colorblind person to distinguish foreground object from background. This measure will be used as an example of a simple disability proof function, V dp . Additional functions for other handicaps are certainly possible and could be combined into a more sophisticated measure.
- searchability is a measure of how easy it is to find a document object (whereas ease of navigation is how easy it is to find a document location).
- Searchability is a rougher measure that looks for the presence of document features that aid in locating document objects.
- some content groups may get spread over two or more pages. If the document is displayed on a workstation, some entire content groups may not fit completely into the display window. This inability to view the logical group as a unit can be a hindrance and should reduce the document's convenience measure.
- the viewable fraction measure gives some indication of whether document components can be seen in their entirety
- Figure 95 illustrates the generation of an electronic window 150 associated with a page 100 of a document.
- the electronic window 150 includes navigation buttons to navigation over the page or through the document.
- This electronic window 150 can be used to define the areas of the document to be analyzed by the present invention as well as allow the user to define what classes and sub-parameters which are to be measured and quantized by the present invention.
- one of the more annoying and inconvenient occurrences when obtaining or processing a document is having to wait while the machine works on downloading or displaying it.
- the transmission time is a product of the size of the document file and the bandwidth of the communications channel. While processing time can also depend upon the types of objects that the document contains and on the type of processing being done, a rough estimate can be formed as the product of the file size and a processing speed factor. One can therefore use the file size as a rough indicator of these time costs.
- V tm at/(at + S) where at is a constant that is about the typical document file size.
- one other dimension by which the quality of a document may be judged is by the costs that it incurs.
- Costs arise in several ways. For printed documents, there is the cost of the materials required (the paper and the ink). There is also a cost in the effort required to print the document (labor and press time). Material cost may not apply to documents viewed on electronic displays, but there is the cost to transmit and store the document. There is also the cost in the time the viewer spends waiting while the document is transmitted, or while it is being processed for display. Many of these costs depend upon the size of the document (such as described above for transmission and processing time). However, other properties can also have an effect. For example, the size of the fonts can affect the amount of paper needed for printing, and the presence of color can affect the cost of the ink.

The document processing system identifies the stored document with the portion which is closest to the selected portion of the original document based on the highest generated score, although the document processing system could use other ways to identify the stored document with the closest portion.
- the document processing system obtains the one or more mutators used in the identified, stored document from memory storage device for possible use in the selected portion of the original document.
- mutators for adjusting a font of type, adjusting line spacing, adjusting at least one color, adjusting a location of at least one section in the portion of the original document, increasing font size to increase legibility, and making the line lengths shorter to increase legibility, etc. It is noted that other types of mutators alone or in different combinations could be obtained and used.

- the document is modeled as a constraint optimization problem which combines both required constraints with non-required design constraints that act as optimization criteria.
- One of a set of many existing constraint optimization algorithms is then used to solve the problem, resulting in an automatically generated document that is well designed because it has optimized some specified design criteria.
- a document template is represented as a constraint optimization problem, and therefore contains a set of variables, a value domain for each variable, a set of required constraints, and a set of desired constraints (i.e. optimization functions).
- the areas of the document to be filled with content are modeled as problem variables, as are any parameters of the document that can be changed.
- a template specifies that there are two areas that should be filled with content: areaA and areaB.
- the template also specifies that the positions and sizes of areaA and areaB can be changed.
- the problem variables for this example are: areaA, areaB, areaA-topLeftX, areaA-topLeftY, areaB-topLeftX, areaB-topLeftY, areaA-width, areaA-height, areaB-width, and areaB-height.
- the constraint optimization formulation further specifies that each problem variable has a value domain consisting of the possible values to assign to that variable.
- the value domains are the content pieces that are applicable to each area.
- the value domains are discretized ranges for those parameters, so that each potential value for the parameter appears in the value domain e.g., 1..MAXINT].
- the default domain is set up to be all possible content pieces in the associated content database, which is specified in the document template.
- the required constraints specify relationships between variables and/or values that must hold in order for the resulting document to be valid.
- the desired constraints specify relationships between variables and/or values that we would like to satisfy, but aren't required in order for the resulting document to be valid. Constraints may be unary (apply to one value/variable), binary (apply to two values/variables), or n-ary (apply to n values/variables), and in our invention are entered by the user as part of the document template.
- An example of a required unary constraint in the document domain is: areaA must contain an image of a castle.
- An example of a required binary constraint is: areaA-topLeftY + areaA-height ⁇ areaB-topLeftY. If we had another variable (areaC), an example of a required 3-ary constraint is: areaA-width + areaB-width > areaC-width.
- the constraints would also refer to customer attributes (e.g., areaA must contain an image that is appropriate for customer1.age).
- Desired constraints are represented as objective functions to maximize or minimize.
- the problem becomes a multi-criteria optimization problem. If it is a multi-criteria optimization problem, we sum the individual objective function scores to produce the overall optimization score for a particular solution. We can furthermore weight each of the desired constraints with a priority, so that the overall optimization score then becomes a weighted sum of the individual objective function scores.
- This invention further describes a means to use a genetic algorithm (one of the many possible constraint optimization algorithms) for doing the constraint optimization and thereby automatically creating a final output document that adheres not only to the required constraints, but also to a set of desired constraints.
- the genome is built such that each gene in the genome is a variable of the constraint problem.
- the unary constraints are used to set up the allowable value domains for each gene. These can be some default range, or input by the user.
- the fitness function is defined such that it returns a fitness of 0 for any population members that do not meet the required constraints, and for the members that do meet the required constraints, it returns a fitness score that is a sum of the scores of the individual desired constraints. For instance, if we have the required constraints:
- Our formulation also extends to allow weighting of the various desired constraints.
- the document creator can specify that certain desired constraints are more important than others. For instance, we could have constraint C3 weighted with an importance of 1.5, and C4 weighted with an importance of .5, meaning that the two objects having the same width is more important than the two objects having the same height.
- the fitness function's overall score is then computed as a weighted sum of the individual desired constraints.
- an initial population of chromosomes is created by selecting values for each gene, and doing this for the desired number of population members. We evaluate each member of this population according to the fitness function, resulting in a score for each population member. We then select the most fit individuals (i.e., best fitness score) as parents for the new population, and create a new population from the parents using crossover/mutation operations. We iterate through populations until we reach a specified stopping condition (e.g., a certain number of iterations are complete, or until we have crossed a minimum threshold for the fitness function).
- a specified stopping condition e.g., a certain number of iterations are complete, or until we have crossed a minimum threshold for the fitness function.
- each genome is evaluated according to how well it satisfies or achieves the design qualities along with the other required constraints.
- This evaluation results in a generated document that not only satisfies the required constraints, but that is also optimized for the specified design qualities.
- the document processing system determines an order or sequence for applying the one or more obtained mutators and the one or more determined mutators to the selected portion of the original document. In these particular embodiments, the document processing system determines the order based on the order the obtained mutators were used in the identified, stored document, although other manners for determining the order for applying the mutators could be used.
- the ordering may be a learned function based on noting the effectiveness of orderings on the document quality measure.
- the selected order for applying mutators could be based on a predetermined priority order for applying mutators which is stored in memory. The document processing system would determine where each of the obtained mutators occurred in the stored priority order and then would base the order of applying the mutators based on this determination.
- the document processing system applies the selected one or more obtained mutators and the one or more determined mutators in the determined ordered order to the selected portion of the original document.
- the document processing system stores the selected portion of the original document with the applied mutators as one of the stored documents in memory storage device.
- the newly stored portion of the original document can now be used to assist with determining the layout of other portions of the original document or of other documents to be displayed.
- the document processing system determines if another portion of the original document should be selected for determining a dynamic document layout. If one or more additional portions in the original document are desired to be selected, for example if other portions of the original document have not already been selected, the process for determining a dynamic document layout begins again for the newly selected portion of the original document in the same manner as described above. If no more portions in the original document are desired to be selected, for example if the entire original document was selected for processing or all of the portions of the original document have already been selected, the process for determining a dynamic document layout ends.
- the concepts of the present invention can also continuously store the determined layouts for use in determining the layout of future documents.
- case-based mutators with genetic algorithms for dynamic document layout, a more efficient and reliable automated scheme for dynamic document layout is realized.
Description
- The present invention generally relates to the field of document layout, design, and analysis and, more particularly, to methods which quantitatively measure a document's quality based on characteristics inherent in the document itself.
- When documents are created, many decisions must be made as to style, content, layout, and the like. The text, images, and graphics must be organized and laid out in a two-dimensional format with the intention of providing a presentation to the viewer which will capture and preferably maintain their attention for the time sufficient to get the intended message across. Different style options are available for the various content elements and choices must be made. The best choices for style and layout depend upon content, intent, viewer interests, etc. In order to tell if a set of choices made as to the look and feel of the final version of the document were good or bad, one might request feedback from a set of viewers after viewing the document and compile the feedback into something meaningful from which the document's creators or developers can make alterations, changes, or other improvements. This cycle repeats until the document's owners are satisfied that the final version achieves the intended result.
- Factors that contribute to the quality and effectiveness of layout and style decisions for a document are the handling of groups of content elements as style and layout choices affect groups of content. A group is a collection of content elements. Group membership is a property of the logical structure of the document. The neighborhood of groups can be considered a layout property. While layout structure often matches the logical structure, there is no requirement that it do so.

US-A-5 424 945 discloses a system for evaluating the psychological effects of an image embodied in image data. The psychological effect of visual aspects is determined and evaluated by a point score. This point score is compared to information collected from users by asking a set of question. Finally, the system displays the results of the psychological test as based on the point scores. The visual aspects for evaluating the psychological effects are conflict and dominance, repetition, balance, harmony and gradation, unity and symmetry of the document. The system executes subjective determination of the psychological effects of these aspects. -
EP-A-1 109 132 relates to the field of image processing. The content of the images is assessed and several images are then arranged in a logical order to meet certain criteria. In order to maintain a logical and pleasing presentation, the images are assessed on the features of colorfulness, sharpness and format uniqueness. Additionally, in order to take into consideration the interest of an image, also features relating to people on the images are assessed. On the basis of this assessment, the images are laid out on a page. - Engeldrum: "Image quality modeling: where are we?" Society for Imaging Science and Technology: Image Processing, Image Quality, Image Capture, Systems Conference, 1999, pages 251-255, XP002349898 refers to an image quality model. The model focuses on the customer perception of a document containing images and evaluates the document with respect to certain criteria, for example, uniformity and reproducibility. These criteria are evaluated by multiple regression analysis to construct a picture quality scale, which is a psychometric scaling of a quality of the document.
- Govindaraju et al.: "Assessment of image quality to predict readability of documents" Proceedings of the SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering SPIE-Int. Soc. Opt. Eng. USA, vol. 2660, 1996, pages 333-342, XP002349899 refers to the investigation of text to determine the readability of scanned documents by humans. Therefore, the document analyzes different reasons leading to a poor readability of the document, such as misregistration of a document, skew, multiple feeds or poor binarization. Furthermore, the document suggests different numerical treatments for handwritten documents to enhance their readability.
- Preferably, one would like to have a quantitative measure of various value properties of the document (measures of the document "goodness") based on properties inherent in the document itself. In this manner the document itself provides a level of quantitative feedback. For instance, one property that developer's would like to be able to measure would be how easy it is to use a document. A measure for the ease of use of a. document can be used in evaluating or making document design decisions.
- One aspect of the ease of use of a document is one's ability to tell which elements belong to a group and which do not. The style and layout decisions that are made in the presentation of a document can affect the degree of group identity that it conveys. In evaluating a document's design for its ease of use, it is useful to have a measure of the degree of group identity. Considerations for ease-of-use with respect to groups include spatial coherence, spatial separation, alignment separation, heading separation, background separation, and/or style separation. Measures for various characteristics of content, feature, and the like could be weighted by intent, relevance, and other parameters and these could then be combined to obtain one or more overall measures for the document itself. If one had a method for evaluating properties inherent in the document itself then such a measure could be used during the document development process to help determine optimal presentation.
- An aspect of the ease of use of a document is its searchability. Searchability can be defined as the degree to which the document structurally supports the finding of a desired content element. A document with high searchability provides aids that help in finding desired content. In general, a document with high searchability measure is easier to use because it is easy to locate the portion of the document containing the information of interest.
- Another aspect of a document's ease of use is the document's degree of distinguishability. The distinguishability of content can be defined as the ability to identify one particular content element from another content element within the document. Distinguishability is important in establishing the context for the information disclosed by the element. It can reduce confusion about what that element is and to what group or setting it belongs. It can also aid in locating a desired element. The distinguishability of the document elements is therefore a contributing factor to the ease of use of the document.
- Another property that would be desirable to be able to quantitatively measure is the ability of the document to hold the viewer's attention and interest. While much of the document's ease of use depends upon the actual content and its relevance to the viewer, there can also be a contribution from the style with which that content is presented. If a measure of the effect of style decisions on ease of use could be defined it could be used in determining a measure of optimal presentation.
- Documents can present content in ways that make it easier to locate individual items. This can be referred to as 'locateability'. A way to distinguish one content object from another object is to evaluate the target object's locatability, i.e., how easy it is to find an object within the document. This is a little different from distinguishability, which tells how well an item can be differentiated from its neighbors. Structural aids such as layout of tables or bullet lists help the document viewer to locate objects. Presenting content in a table allows its location to be identified by row or column. The presence of headings for the rows and columns can further increase the ease of locating items. Presenting content items in a list introduces an ordering that aids in locating them, and the use of list bullets or item numbers aids further. Separability and distinguishability contribute to the locatability of an object.
- Measures for various aspects of content, features, and the like could be weighted by intent, relevance, and other parameters and these could then be combined to obtain one or more overall measures for the document itself. If one had a method for evaluating such properties inherent in the document itself then such a measure could be used during the document development process to help determine optimal presentation.
- Therefore, it is desirable to provide a methodology to measure the quality of a document in a quantifiable way. Moreover, it is desirable to provide a quantifiable measurement of quality which is useable in evaluating the document and improving its quality so as to add value to the information being conveyed through the document.

Figure 96 illustrates color dissonance as a function of hue difference. - The present invention is directed to various methods for quantifying various document properties to assist document developers in determining document quality. Quality can have several competing aspects and the overall quality can depend not only on the absolute properties of the document, but also on the relative importance of these properties to the beholder. One aspect or class of document quality is its aesthetics, which is its beauty, the degree to which pleasure can be derived from its appearance. Often this property is manifested in the degree of displeasure generated by an ugly layout.
- Another aspect or class contributing to the quality of a document is the effectiveness with which it communicates information to the user. Documents are vessels of information, and the ease at which the viewer can gather and understand the information can be an important factor in how well the document does its job.
- A third aspect or class that contributes to the quality of a document is its ease of use. A factor that contributes to the ease of use is how convenient the document is, that is, can it be used with a minimum of effort. A second factor contributing overall ease of use is content grouping. Information often has some logical organization and documents can reflect this organization by grouping the content. The effectiveness with which the document coveys this grouping and enables the viewer to capitalize on it contributes to the ease of use.
- A fourth aspect or class that enters into document quality is the degree to which the user is comfortable with it. Documents that create anxiety are generally not as desirable as those that the viewer finds soothing and familiar.
- A fifth aspect or class that is an important contributor to the quality of some documents is the degree to which they can catch the eye of the viewer. Advertisements for example, strive to capture the attention and not to be easily overlooked
- A sixth aspect or class that is similar is the ability for the document to maintain interest. It is one thing to capture the attention, but another to hold it and to avoid boredom as the document is used.
- A seventh aspect or class of quality can be the economy of the document, both to the creator and to the viewer. If the other contributors to quality are the same, then a lower cost version of a document is generally considered better than a more expensive one. While other factors may also contribute to document quality, the measuring of these seven aspects or classes provides a good basis for evaluating document quality.
- The aspects or classes listed as contributing to document quality (with the exception of economy) are usually considered soft and ill-defined concepts; however, these properties can be quantified. The method for measuring and quantifying these attributes is to first identify document features that contribute to the property. Quantifiable measures of the individual features are then devised. And finally, the individual feature values are combined to form an overall score for the more abstract property.

Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating an architectural layout for quantifiably measuring document quality according to the concepts of the present invention. As illustrated inFigure 1 , the quantization of a document's quality can be carried out in by a system architecture that includes amemory 91, adocument processor circuit 92,microprocessor 90,user interface 94, and adisplay 93. Thememory 91 may store for processing purposes a portion of a document, a page of the document, a portion of a page of a document, a document, or multiple documents. - The
display 93 may display the document or portion thereof that is being quantized with respect to quality. Thedisplay 93 may also display the various options that a user can choose though theuser interface 94 with respect to the classes that the user wishes to quantize or the various parameters that a user can choose though theuser interface 94, which are to be measured within the chosen quantization class. - The quantization architecture of
Figure 1 further includes various circuits for measuring/quantizing various aspects or classes of document quality. These circuits includeaesthetics quantizer 10, ease ofuse quantizer 20, eye catchingability quantizer 30,interest quantizer 40,communicability quantizer 50,comfort quantizer 60,convenience quantizer 70, andeconomy quantizer 75. Each of these (except the economy quantizer, for which measures and methods are well known) will be discussed in more detail below. - On the other hand
Figure 2 illustrates a single quality quantizer orcombiner 80 that receives measured and/or calculated quantized values representing aesthetics, ease of use, eye catching ability, interest, communicability, comfort, and/or convenience. Quality quantizer orcombiner 80 processes these values based upon a predetermined algorithm so as to generate a quality quantization value for the document or portion of the document being analyzed. If alternate or additional measures of quality are considered, they would also be combined atcombiner 80. - Each value thereof is based on properties inherent in the document itself. The values are individually combined into an overall value or score for the document. Other methods for measuring, assigning, or otherwise associating a quantifiable value for document quality should be considered within the scope of the present invention; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular methods put forth, but also in the much broader concept of determining a value for document quality.
- In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each rule is defined to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1 such that 0 means low value and 1 means high value. This enables quantized quality values to be calculated and combined to form the overall document quality measure.
- If Vi is the value calculated for the ith rule, the document quality measure VQ is formed as a function E of these contributions such that: VQ = E(V1, V2, ... VN). The combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions. However, because any bad contributor can ruin the document quality no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.
- An alternative is: VQ = (Σwi (Vi)-p)-1/p. In a preferred embodiment, the wi factors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one. The exponent 'p' introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The larger the value of the exponent 'p' is, the greater this effect
- A further alternative is: VQ = (Σwi (d + Vi)-p)-1/p - d. The wi factors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one. The exponent 'p' introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The parameter d is a number slightly larger than 0. The larger the value of the exponent 'p' is, the greater this effect.
- Other combining functions are, for example, the product of the contributions. If weighting of the contribution is desired, this can be achieved by: VQ = IIVi wi'.
- It is noted that the illustrations show circuits or circuit for the quality quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- For the case of document aesthetics, the methods herein are used to generate quantifiable values for the contributing features of: balance, uniformity, white-space fraction, white-space free-flow, alignment, regularity, page security, and/or aspect ratio (optimal proportionality). As illustrated in
Figure 3 , a combining circuit 10 (theaesthetics quantizer 10 ofFigure 1 ) receives measured and/or calculated quantized values representing balance, uniformity, white-space fraction, white-space free-flow, alignment, regularity, page security, and/or aspect ratio (optimal proportionality) and processes these values based upon a predetermined algorithm so as to generate an aesthetic quantization value for the document or portion of the document being analyzed. - Each value thereof is based on properties inherent in the document itself. The values are individually combined into an overall value or score for the document. Other methods for measuring, assigning, or otherwise associating a quantifiable value for document quality should be considered within the scope of the present invention; such that the present invention is directed to not only in the particular methods put forth, but also in the much broader concept of determining a value for document quality.
- In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each rule is defined to produce a value ranging between 0 and 1 such that 0 means low value and 1 means high value. This enables quantized quality values to be calculated and combined to form the overall document quality measure.
- If Vi is the value calculated for the ith rule, the document quality measure VA is formed as a function E of these contributions such that: VA = E(V1, V2, ... VN). The combining function E can be as simple as a weighted average of the contributions. However, because any bad contributor can ruin the document quality no matter how good the others are, a linear combination is not preferred.
- An alternative is: VA = (Σwi (Vi)-p)-1/p. In a preferred embodiment, the wi factors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one. The exponent 'p' introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The larger the value of the exponent 'p' is, the greater this effect
- A further alternative is: VA = (Σwi (d + Vi)-p)-1/p - d. The wi factors are weights that specify the relative importance of each rule and should sum to one. The exponent 'p' introduces a non-linearity that can make one bad value overwhelm many good ones. The parameter d is a number slightly larger than 0. The larger the value of the exponent 'p' is, the greater this effect.
- Other combining functions are, for example, the product of the contributions. If weighting of the contribution is desired, this can be achieved by: VA = IIVi wi'.
- It is noted that the illustrations show circuits or circuit for the aesthetics quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- As illustrated in
Figure 3 , one of the parameters or factors used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's balance or balance in page layout. - In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there are at least two primary ways of defining balance. There is an overall balance where the center of visual weight is at the visual center of a page of a document; as illustrated by
Figure 5 withobjects 110 ondocument 100 having substantially a center of visual weight equal to a visual center of a page of a document; and a left-right balance; as illustrated byFigures 6 and 7 withobjects 110 ondocument 100 where the weight ofobject 110 on the left side of the page is matched by the weight ofobject 110 at the same vertical position on the right side of the page. Other definitions for balance are to be considered within the scope of the present invention. - The overall balance is calculated by determining the center of
visual weight 102 ofFigure 4 and noting how much it differs from the visual center of thepage 101 ofFigure 4 .Figure 8 provides a detail example of determining the overall balance of a page of a document. - As illustrated in
Figure 8 , if the visual weight of an object i (110 ofFigure 8 ) is Mi (115 ofFigure 8 ) and the object's center is positioned at (xi, yi), the center of visual weight for thepage layout 116 is at (xm, ym) where xm = (ΣxiMi)/(ΣMi) and ym = (ΣyiMi)/(ΣMi) are the sums of all objects on the page.Objects 110, as used herein, may refer to paragraphs, pictures, graphics, etc. - If the visual center of the
page 116 is at (xc, yc) and the maximum x and y distances (117 shows the x distance) an object can be from thevisual center 102 are dx and dy, a balance value can be calculated as: VOB = 1-[(((xm-xc)/dx)2+((ym-yc)/dy)2)/2]1/2. - Note that one can, in a similar way, compute the balance of subclasses of objects by considering only objects belonging to the subclasses. For example, one could compute the visual balance of all pictorial images on the page, or the visual balance of all text blocks.
- For left-right balance, the center of visual weight (118 of
Figure 9 ) for the x component is calculated as given above. However, for the y component, what is desired is that the left and right halves have the same position, rather than the total being centered. This is achieved by calculating the center of weight for the left side (118) as: yL = (ΣyiMi)/(ΣMi) where the sums are over the portions ofobjects 110 with xi < xc. Similarly, yR = (ΣyiMi)/(ΣMi) where the sums are over the portions of objects with xi > xc. - If a content object spans both the left and right sides of the page, for the purposes of this calculation, the object is divided along the vertical centerline of the page. The left and right divisions of the object are then entered into the left and right sums, respectively. If the page height is dh, a left-right balance value is: VLR = 1 - [(((xm - xc)/dx)2 + ((yL - yR)/dh)2 )/2]1/2. It is noted that other definitions are possible.
- One might, for example, raise these balance values to powers in order to express the idea that balance is non-linear. Ideally, one would perform the psychophysical experiments to measure human response to balance and define a function that matches that response.
- The above expressions make use of the visual weight of an object. To first order, this can be defined as the objects area times its optical density. However, other psychological effects can also be included. Examples include color carrying more weight than gray; round shapes carrying more weight than rectangular, and positioning at the top of the page giving more weight than at the bottom.
- As illustrated in
Figure 4 , balance is defined with respect to the visual center of thepage 101. Thevisual center 101 lies halfway between the left and right edges of the page, but it is not halfway between the top and bottom. Typically, thevisual center 101 is taken to be offset a twentieth of the page height towards the top from thegeometric center 102. - The balance, as illustrated in
Figure 10 , is considered a combination of two approaches described above. InFigure 10 , the quantized overall balance value is derived by a combining of the overall balance and the left-right balance using a balance quantizer orcombiner circuit 11. - One approach is: Vbl= 1 - [wob (1 - Vob)-q + wLR (1 - VLR)-q]-1/q. The weights wob and wLR give the relative importance of the two balance approaches and should sum to 1. If either of the balance measures is near 1 (good), the overall result is also near 1. The exponent 'q' determines how strong this behavior is.
- It is noted that the illustration shows a circuit for the balance quantization process, this process may also be performed in software by the microprocessor and/or firmware. The quantization is not limited to specific circuits, but any combination of software and/or hardware that is able to carry out the below described methodologies.
- As illustrated in
Figures 11 and 12 , another parameter or factor used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's uniformity. - In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is preferred to have
content objects 110 distributed uniformly over apage 100, as illustrated inFigure 12 , and not clumped together, as illustrated inFigure 11 . However, for other values, such as attention grabbing, it may be beneficial to have clustered and even unbalanced positioning. Uniformity is preferred. - Non-uniformity is defined herein as the variance of the visual density. For a portion of a page, a visual density is determined by it's the visual weight of the objects contained within the portion, divided by it's the portion's area such that: Di = ΣMj/Ai where the sum is over objects j contained in page portion i. Densities are preferably scaled to range between 0 and 1. A rescale may be needed if visual weight includes factors in addition to the optical density that alter the range of values. An average page density can also be defined as the sum of the visual weights for all objects on the page divided by the imageable area of the page.
- The imageable area Api is typically the area of the page excluding margins. DAV = ΣMi/Api. A non-uniformity value is calculated by dividing the imageable area into a small number of portions and comparing the visual density for portions to the average page density.
- A non-uniformity value can be calculated as the difference between the visual density for the portion of the page and the average page density, which is squared and weighted by the portion's area. Subtracting 1 this gives a uniformity value. In other words, a non-uniformity value van be defined as VNU = 1 - (Σ (Di - Dav )2 Ai) / Σ Ai.
- The average page density can also be calculated for each page individually, or an overall average page density can be determined from the visual weight of all objects on portions of all pages and the area of all pages.
- An alternative to calculating a single non-uniformity value for the document directly is to calculate non-uniformity values for individual pages and then combines the page values by some means such as an average, or by a non-linear scheme that might, for example, yield a low result if any page has a low value. Other uniformity measures are possible, for example, the true variance in the densities can be calculated and used to give non-uniformity. Alternatively, a function is constructed from measured human responses to differing uniformities.
- As illustrated in
Figures 13 to 15 , another parameter or factor used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's white space fraction. - In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a good page design is one with white space (including margins) totaling about half of the total page area. The non-white space area can be estimated by totaling the areas of the content objects.
- In
Figure 13 , the white space fraction, the amount of area not associated with anobject 110 onpage 100, totals more than half of the imageable area and thus it is undesirable. InFigure 14 , the white space fraction, the amount of area not associated with anobject 110 onpage 100, totals less than half of the imageable area and thus it is also undesirable. Lastly, inFigure 15 , the white space fraction, the amount of area not associated with anobject 110 onpage 100, totals about half of the imageable area and thus it is optimal. - The
total object area 110 can be scaled by the total page area Ap and the difference between this value and the desired 50% can be found. Squaring the difference to give a positive number produces a measure of how much the layout differs from the 50% rule. Scaling by 4 to get a number ranging between 0 and 1 and then subtracting this from 1 gives the white space fraction quantization value. Thus: Vws = 1 - 4((ΣAi / Ap) - 0.5)2. - Other measures of the effect of the white space fraction on document aesthetics and on document quality are envisioned herein and should be considered within the scope of the present invention, for example, a function of measured human responses to differing white space fractions.
- As illustrated in
Figures 16 to 21 , another parameter or factor used in determining aesthetics is the measurement and quantization of the document's trapped white space. - In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is desired that there should not be any large blocks of white space trapped, in the middle of the page, by content. The white space should always be connected to the margins.
- To quantize this class of trapped white space, an efficient method of detecting trapped white space is illustrated in
Figures 16 to 21 and discussed in more detail below. - The class of trapped white space is primarily concerned with relatively large blocks of white space. One way that efficiency, as used herein, can be improved is by performing a trapped white space analysis at a coarse resolution. The approach taken is to determine the area of all white space that can be accessed directly from the margins. This area then gets added to the area of the content objects (110 of
Figure 16 ) and compared to the area of the page. Any difference becomes the amount of trapped white space (120 ofFigure 16 ). - To achieve this, four profiles (
Figures 17-20 ) of white space are accessible from the four margins of the document constructed. These profiles are preferably stored in arrays at the coarse resolution. Call the arrays, for example: TopProf, BottomProf, LeftProf and RightProf. Elements of the TopProf and BottomProf arrays are initialized to the page height, while the LeftProf and RightProf arrays are initialized to the page width. - Next all
content objects 110 are stepped through and for each, their left (Figure 17 ), right (Figure 18 ), top (Figure 19 ), and bottom (Figure 20 )boundary positions - For points from the left to right boundary, the value stored in the TopProf array is compared to the top boundary and the array value is replaced with the top value if top is smaller. The difference between the bottom boundary and the page height is compared to the BottomProf array value and updated with the smaller result. This is captured in the following:
for ( x = L; x < R; x++) { if (T < TopProf[x]) TopProf[x] = T; if (H - B < BottomProf[x]) BonomProf[x] = H - B}; }
Freeflow = 0; for (x = 0; x < W; x++) { for (y=0;y<H;y++) { if (x < LeftProfly] || W - x < RightProf[y] || y < TopProf[x] || H - y < BottomProf[x]) Freeflow = Freeflow + pixelArea; } }
while (EdgeCount[i] is 0) i=i+1. align = EdgeCount[i] - 1; for (j = i+1; j < b*W; j++) if (EdgeCount[j] is not 0) { align = align + A/(A+j-i) + EdgeCount[j] -1; i = j; } align = align / (NumberOfObjects - 1);
if (EdgeCount [0] > EdgeCount [1]) { peakCount++; SepCount[1]++; prevPeak = 0; } else prevPeak = -1; for(i=1;i<b*W-1; i++) if (EdgeCount [i-1] < EdgeCount [i] && EdgeCount [i+1] < EdgeCount [i]) { peakCount++; SepCount[i - prevPeak]++; prevPeak = i; } if (EdgeCount [b*W-1] > EdgeCount [b*W-2]) { peakCount++; SepCount[i - prevPeak]++; }
while (SepCount [i] is 0) i=i+1; preg = SepCount [i] - 1; for (j=i+1; j<b*W; j++) if (SepCount [j] is not 0) { preg = preg + A/(A+j-i) + SepCount [j] - 1; i = j ; } preg = preg / (peakCount - 1);
for (i=0; i<b*W-1; i++) if (LeftEdgeCount [i] != 0) { j=i+1; while (RightEdgeCount[j] = 0) { j = j + 1; } totalSepCount += LeftEdgeCount[i] * RightEdgeCount[j]; SpacSepCount[j - i] += LeftEdgeCount[i] * RightEdgeCount[j]; }Here LeftEdgeCount and RightEdgeCount contain the values of the EdgeCount array when filled with left-edge values and right-edge values respectively. For vertical separations the calculation is analogous with the use of top and bottom edge values. The calculation of the spatial regularity measure would follow as:
while (SpacSepCount [i] is 0) i =i+ 1; sreg = SpacSepCount [i] - 1; for (j =i+ 1; j < b*W; j++) if (SpacSepCount [j] is not 0) { sreg = sreg + A/(A+j-i) + SpacSepCount [j] - 1; i = J; } sreg = sreg / (totalSepCount - 1);
TraverseUp(G, C) { if node C is the root node then return /* done */ P = parent(C) for each child node N of parent P if child N is different from C then TraverseDown(G, N) TraverseUp(G, P) return } TraverseDown(G, N) { if IsNeighbor(G, N) then add node N to the list of neighbors of group G otherwise return if node N is not a leaf node then for each child C of node N TraverseDown(G, C) return }
FindBackground(G) { if G specifies a background color then return that color otherwise if G is the root of the content tree then return the default background color (e.g. white) otherwise return FindBackground( parent(G)) }If, on the other hand, backgrounds are content objects, such as rectangles that are members of the same group (or perhaps a parent group) as the object in question, another search has to be done. The pseudocode is as follows:
FindBackground(G, C) { if C is the root of the content tree then return the default background color (e.g. white) P = parent(C) for each child K of P if K is different from C and K is a rectangle and K encloses G then return the color of K return FindBackground(G, P) }The test for K enclosing G can be performed, for example, using the bounding box for K and G to ensure that the corners of the bounding box of G are within the corners of the K box.
if q1 > 0 then if q2 > 0 then use InherentSepTop otherwise use InherentSepRight otherwise if q2 > 0 then use InherentSepLeft otherwise use InherentSepBottom.
Separability(G) { if G is a leaf node then return TotalSep(G) otherwise for each child C of G call Separability(C) and find the average of these values A return wL * TotalSep(G) + (1 - wL) * A }The above Separability() routine should start at the root node of the content tree.
HeadingDistinguish(G) { if G is the root then return 0 P = parent(G) if P is a list then if P numbers the list elements then R = ListNumberWeight otherwise if P is a bulleted list then R = ListBulletWeight otherwise R = 0 if a child of P is a heading then R = minimum (R + HeadingWeight, 1) return w * R + (1 - w) * HeadingDistinguish(P) }The expressions: ListNumberWeight, ListBulletWeight and HeadingWeight are constant contributions to the heading result. These have values between 0 and 1. The ListNumberWeight should have the largest value since list numbers are distinct and near to their corresponding list element content objects. Whereas, HeadingWeight and ListBulletWeight have lesser values, since the heading applies to all list elements. Bulleted elements have identical values for all elements in the list. The ListBulletWeight may be larger than the HeadingWeight since there will be a bullet close to the object. The weight w specifies the relative importance of the heading at the current tree level to headings at higher levels. For example, if w=0.5, then a heading at the current level would be considered as important as headings at all higher levels combined.
Distinguishability (G) { if G is a leaf node then return TotalDistinguish(G) otherwise for each child C of G call Distinguishability (C) and find the average A of values return wL * TotalDistinguish (G) + (1 - wL) * A }
G = parent(E) if G is a table then if G has row headings then if G has column headings then StructLocate = Vtrc otherwise StructLocate = Vtr otherwise if G has column headings then StructLocate = Vtc otherwise StructLocate = Vt otherwise if G is a list then if G has bullets then StructLocate = Vlb otherwise if G has numbers then StructLocate = Vln otherwise StructLocate = Vl otherwise StructLocate = Vgwhere Vtrc, Vtr, Vtc, Vt, Vlb, Vln, Vl and Vg are the predetermined locatability contributions for structural cases.
G = parent(E) if G is a table then GroupSizeFactor = (1-A+A/rows(G))*(1-A+ A/columns(G)) otherwise GroupSizeFactor = (1 - A + A/elements(G));where rows(G) and columns(G) are the number of rows and columns in the table G and elements(G) is the number of elements in the group G and A is a parameter controlling the strength of the factor with group size.
Locatability (G) { if G is a leaf node then return TotalLocate(G) otherwise for each child C of G call Locatability (C) and find the average of these values A return wL * TotalLocate (G) + (1 - wL) * A }
CollectSearchFeatures(G) { if G is a table then Ft = Ft + number of elements is G for each element E of G CollectSearchFeatures(E) otherwise if G is a list then Fl = Fl + number of elements in G if G is bulleted then Fb = Fb + number of bullets in the list G if G is numbered then Fn = Fn + number of numbered elements in G for each element E of G CollectSearchFeatures(E) otherwise if G is a group then for each element E of G CollectSearchFeatures(E) otherwise if G acts as a reference label then Fr = Fr + 1 if G is an anchor then Fa = Fa + 1 }
GetFirstLeaf(G) { if G is a leaf then return G otherwise return GetFirstLeaf(FirstElement(G)) }
LeafConsistency(G, StyleProperties, CurrentConsistency) { if G is a leaf then CurrentConsistency = CheckConsistency(G, StyleProperties, CurrentConsistency) otherwise for each element E of G CurrentConsistency = LeafConsistency(E, StyleProperties, CurrentConsistency) return CurrentConsistency }where StyleProperties is an array containing the style property values for the first leaf and CurrentConsistency is an array indicating for each style property whether all leaves checked thus far have a uniform value.
CheckConsistency(G, StyleProperties, CurrentConsistency) { for each style property i if StyleValue(G, i) does not match StyleProperties[i] then CurrentConsistency[i] = 0 return CurrentConsistency }The procedure for checking consistency of style would look as follows:
StyleConsistency(G) { E = GetFirstLeaf(G) for each style property i { StyleProperties[i] = StyleValue(E, i) CurrentConsistency[i] = 1 } LeafConsistency(G, StyleProperties, CurrentConsistency) return the sum of the CurrentConsistency array value divided by the array size. }
if first element of the group is a heading then HasHeading = 1 otherwise HasHeading = 0Similarly, explicit background elements and/or borders can be examined, as in the following pseudocode:
if the group has its own background then HasBackground = 1 otherwise HasBackground = 0 if the group has a border then HasBorder = 1 otherwise HasBorder = 0
where wsp, wstl, wah, wav, wh, wbk, wbd and wsi are the weights and sum to 1. The parameter c and P control the degree to which a single good value dominates. Constant c is slightly larger than 1 and the power P is typically 1 or larger. Indicators can be combined using a power function that favors high values.
DocumentGroupIdentity (G) { if G is a leaf node then return 1 otherwise for each child C of G call DocumentGroupIdentity (C) and find the average of these values A return wg * GroupIdentity (G) + (1 - wg) * A }
where c is the saturation, as illustrated by
v = max (R, G, B) w = min(R, G, B) c = v - w rl =(v-R)/c gl = (v - G) / c b1 =(v-B)/c if (R = = v) if (G = = w) h = 5 + b1 else h = 1 - gl else if (G = = v) if (B = = w) h = 1 + r1 else h = 3 - b1 else if (R = = w) h = 3 + gl else h=5-rl h=h/6
Vd=0 for i from 1 to n { for j from i to n { dissonance = calculateDissonance(i, j, H[i], H[j]) if dissonance > Vd Vd = dissonance } }The calculateDissonance function might look as follows: calculateDissonance(i, j, ai, aj)
{ if ai > bigEnough and aj > bigEnough return dissonanceTable[j - i] otherwise return 0 }where bigEnough is a threshold value used to ignore small areas of color and dissonance table is a table of color dissonance values.
then dcs = dcs + (xlo - xln) * (xro - xm) / (xro - xln)2
fd = 1 for f1 from 1 to Nf for f2 from f1 to Nf fd = fd + |size(f1) - size(f2)| + Fw[weight(fl), weight(f2)] if family(fl) differs from family(f2) or style(f1) differs from style(f2) or variant(f1) differs from variant(f2) then fd = fd + af end of f2 loop end of f1 loop fd = fd / Nf
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, just as too many fonts are considered to be poor style, so are too many colors. A document with lots of colors is considered garish. The viewer tries to make sense of the colors and a large number makes this a difficult and uncomfortable task. A large number of colors will tire the eye. A simple measure of the effect is just a count of the number of different colors found within the document. This can be determined by stepping through the document, identifying the colors and saving them in a list (or other data structure such as a tree or hash table). As each color is encountered it can be compared to the colors already in the list to determine whether or not it has been seen before. If it is a new color then it is added to the list. After the document has been processed, the number of entries in the list can be counted to give the total number of colors Nc. This can be converted to a number ranging from near 0 (for many colors) to 1 (for no more than a single color) by the expression: Vlc = 1 / MAXIMUM(l, Nc)
incon = 0 oldlum = AverageLuminance(groupMember(1)) for i = 2 to number of group members { newlum = AverageLuminance(groupMember(i)) if newlum < oldlum then incon = incon + oldlum - newlum oldlum = newlum } end of loop
Here Vclg is the consistency of luminance value for the group and acl is a small positive constant value.
incon = 0 oldsize = BoundingSize(groupMember(1)) for i = 2 to number of group members { newsize = BoundingSize (groupMember(i)) if newsize > oldsize then incon = incon + newsize - oldsize oldsize = newsize } end of loop
Here Vcsg is the consistency of size value for the group and acs is a small positive constant value.
wv = MINIMUM(wg, wp)
hv = MINIMUM(hg, hp)
The measure of unity of display for the group is then given by ratio of the visible area to group area: U = (wv hv) / (wg hg)
wv = MINIMUM(wd, wp)
hv = MINIMUM(hd, hp)
And set the single window display measure to: Vswd = (wv hv) / (wd hd)
- C1: areaA-width < 300
- C2: areaB-width < 300
- C3: areaA -width = areaB-width, to be maximized (ranges from 0 to 1)
- C4: areaA-height = areaB-height, to be maximized (ranges from 0 to 1)
- f3 = 1 - |areaA-width - areaB-width| / (areaA-width + areaB-width)
- f4 = 1 - |areaA-height - areaB-height| / (areaA-width + areaB-height)
