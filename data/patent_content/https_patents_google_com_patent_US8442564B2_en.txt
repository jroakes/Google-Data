Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to wireless communications and, more particularly, to the avoidance or reduction of inter-modulation (IM) distortion in multimode wireless communication terminals and corresponding methods.
- IM inter-modulation
- the introduction of new wireless radio access technologies usually occurs in stages due to financial and logistical considerations. For example, it is common for evolved radio access technology (RAT) infrastructure to be implemented initially in areas with higher population density amidst existing radio access technology infrastructure. Such implementations often require multi-mode user terminals supporting the different radio access technologies.
- RAT evolved radio access technology
- the emerging 3GPP LTE radio access technology will be likely be implemented using multimode user equipment (UE) that supports OFDM and CDMA technologies operating simultaneously in neighboring frequency bands.
- UE multimode user equipment
- simultaneous activation i.e., uplink transmission
- simultaneous activation i.e., uplink transmission
- Exemplary cellular communication networks include 2.5 Generation 3GPP GSM networks, 3rd Generation 3GPP WCDMA networks, and 3GPP2 CDMA communication networks, among other existing and future generation cellular communication networks.
- Future generation networks include the developing Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks, Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) networks.
- the network may also be of a type that implements frequency-domain oriented multi-carrier transmission techniques, such as Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDM), DFT-Spread-OFDM (DFT-SOFDM), Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access (IFDMA), etc., which are of interest for future systems.
- OFDM Frequency Division Multiple Access
- DFT-SOFDM DFT-Spread-OFDM
- IFDMA Interleaved Frequency Division Multiple Access
- SC-FDMA orthogonal frequency division
- IFDMA IFDMA
- DFT-SOFDM frequency-domain related variant known as DFT-SOFDM
- User equipment operating in a cellular network operate in a number of ‘call states’ or ‘protocol states’ generally conditioned on actions applicable in each state.
- a UE may roam throughout a network without necessarily initiating or soliciting uplink or downlink traffic, except, e.g., to periodically perform a location update to permit efficient network paging.
- the UE may be capable of initiating network access via a specified shared channel, such as a random access channel (RACH).
- RACH random access channel
- a UE's ability or need to access physical layer resources may be conditioned on the protocol state.
- the UE may be permitted access to a shared control channel only under certain protocol-related conditions, e.g., during initial network entry.
- a UE may have a requirement to communicate time-critical traffic, such as a handover request or acknowledgement message, with higher reliability.

- each RAT generally includes corresponding radio access networks and in some implementations corresponding core networks.
- An access network typically includes one or more base stations that serve user terminals in corresponding cellular areas or regions, wherein the one or more access network communicably coupled to a controller.
- the core network generally provides switching and routing functionality for user traffic.
- multiple access networks may share a common core network and in other systems multiple core networks may share a common access network.
- Other networks could be configured differently.
- one RAT is OFDM based, for example, 3GPP LTE
- CDMA for example 1 ⁇ RTT (CDMA 1 ⁇ ).
- the different radio access technologies may be any technologies that operate in or on neighboring or overlapping frequencies that result in desense of one or the other radio access technologies.
- operation of a transmitter on one RAT may result in desense of a receiver of another RAT.
- a wireless communication network infrastructure scheduling entity located allocates or assigns radio resources to schedulable wireless communication entities, e.g., mobile terminals, in the wireless communication network.
- each base stations includes a scheduler for scheduling and allocating radio resources to mobile terminals in corresponding cellular areas.
- multi-carrier access or multi-channel CDMA wireless communication protocols including, for example, IEEE-802.16e-2005, multi-carrier HRPD-A in 3GPP2, and the Long Term Evolution (LTE) of UTRA/UTRAN Study Item in 3GPP (also known as evolved UTRA/UTRAN (EUTRA/EUTRAN)
- FS Frequency Selective
- each mobile terminal provides a per frequency band channel quality indicator (CQI) to the scheduler.
- CQI channel quality indicator
- a resource allocation is a frequency and time allocation that maps information for a particular UE to resource blocks as determined by the scheduler. This allocation depends, for example, on the frequency-selective channel-quality indication (CQI) reported by the UE to the scheduler.
- CQI channel-quality indication
- the channel-coding rate and the modulation scheme which may be different for different resource blocks, are also determined by the scheduler and may also depend on the reported CQI.
- a UE may not be assigned every sub-carrier in a resource block. It could be assigned every Qth sub-carrier of a resource block, for example, to improve frequency diversity.
- a resource assignment can be a resource block or a fraction thereof. More generally, a resource assignment is a fraction of multiple resource blocks. Multiplexing of lower-layer control signaling may be based on time, frequency and/or code multiplexing.
- the scheduler can allocate the radio resource based on the interference impact by assigning bandwidth based on power headroom of the schedulable wireless communication entity.
- the scheduler can find a bandwidth size that reduces required MPR and A-MPR enough such that operational maximum power (P MAX -MPR-AMPR) does not limit current power of the schedulable wireless communication entity.
- a scheduler may also control leakage into adjacent and non-contiguous adjacent bands by scheduling mobile terminals that are “close” to the serving cell in terms of path loss with bandwidth allocations that occupy the entire carrier band or a bandwidth allocation that includes resource blocks (RBs) that are at the edge of the carrier band (e.g., 5 MHz UTRA or LTE carrier) since due to power control it is very unlikely that such a terminal will be operating at or near to P MAX and therefore unlikely that its current power level would be limited by the operational maximum power (P MAX -MPR-AMPR).
- a scheduler may schedule terminals that have little or no power margin with bandwidth allocations that exclude resource blocks at the carrier band edge reducing the likelihood of the terminal being power limited by the operational maximum power.
- the scheduler supporting one radio access technology in one network operates independently of the scheduler supporting a different radio access technology in the other network.
- a multimode UE may then need to transmit over the two radio access technologies at the same time.
- the power radiated into an adjacent frequency band by a UE, and the distortion offered by a UE to a another UE is governed by several design criteria related to the implementation of mobile terminal transmitters, including oscillator phase noise, digital-analog converter (DAC) noise, power amplifier (PA) linearity (in turn controlled by power amplifier mode, cost, power consumption etc.), among others.
- oscillator phase noise digital-analog converter (DAC) noise
- PA power amplifier
- UE power amplifiers give rise to undesired adjacent band interference in broad proportion, for a given PA design, to the mean power offered to the PA input.
- the frequency at which interference occurs is at 3 or 5 times the frequency of the input signal components, or harmonics thereof.
- the power of such out-of-band components generally increases at 3 or 5 times the rate of increase of the input power level.
- mobile terminals may control their out of band emission levels by limiting the power to the PA.
- a mobile terminal Given a specific rated maximum output (or input) power level designed to achieve a given level of interference into an adjacent frequency band, or level of in-band distortion, a mobile terminal may elect to adjust, for example, reduce its input, power level in order to reduce such unwanted effects.
- the mobile terminal may also keep its power at a given level, but adjust its operating point (load, bias, supply, etc.) to effect adjustment of the emission levels.
- a decision to increase or decrease the input or output PA power may be subject to other criteria, including waveform bandwidth, location in a frequency band, waveform quality metric, among other considerations.
- a RAT is in an active state if the corresponding UE has been assigned a temporary identifier for communicating with a network on the RAT or if the UE has a context in the base station.
- the context includes the temporary identifier of the UE in the base station and information related to the traffic being supported through the base station such as protocol stack configuration, etc.
- the wireless communication terminal modifies a maximum transmit power limit of the first RAT based on a voice codec rate of a voice transmission on the second RAT, wherein the second RAT is conducting the voice transmission in the active state.
- the wireless communication terminal then transmits at a transmit power level on the first RAT based on the modified maximum transmit power limit. For example, the terminal transmits at the modified transmit power level when the voice transmission is conducted on the second RAT.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a multimode terminal or UE 200 comprising a first RAT transceiver 210 and a second RAT transceiver 220 communicably coupled to a controller 230 .
- the transceivers may implement any wireless communication protocols, as discussed above, and may be capable of conducting circuit or packet switched communications or both.

- the wireless communication terminal modifies a maximum transmit power limit of the second RAT when modifying the maximum transmit power limit of the first RAT, when the first RAT and the second RAT are in the active state at the same time.
- the wireless communication terminal changes the maximum transmit power limit of the first RAT during a silence period of the voice transmission relative to a non-silence period of the voice transmission, when the first RAT and the second RAT are in the active state at the same time.
- the maximum transmit power limit of the first RAT is increased during the silence period of the voice transmission.
- the terminal reduces the maximum transmit power limit of the second RAT during the silence period of the voice transmission.
- a silence period is characterized by no transmission due to a UE going into a quasi-idle state (e.g., a DRX state in LTE), which might occur between some packet transmissions, e.g., voice transmissions.
- a silence period can also reflect voice inactivity that occurs during talk spurts due, e.g., to pauses by the speaker or the speaker listening to the other caller.
- Some codecs e.g., AMR characterize this inactivity by sending a Silence Information Descriptor (SID) voice packet with relatively few bits (e.g., 39 bits including packet overhead) compared to a normal voice packet corresponding to speech (voice activity) which will typically carry 200 hundred bits or more.
- SID Silence Information Descriptor
- a much lower coding rate (e.g., 1200 bps) is used for the silence or inactivity period compared to the active period (e.g., 9600 bps).

- the terminal increases the maximum transmit power limit of the first RAT when the transmission type of the first RAT is a control transmission.
- the maximum transmit power limit of the first RAT is increased and the maximum transmit power limit of the second RAT is decreased when the transmission type of the first RAT is a control transmission.
- the maximum transmit power limit of the first RAT is decreased and a maximum transmit power limit of the second RAT is increased.
- the transmit power status of the second RAT is selected from a group comprising: a transmit power headroom of the second RAT; a transmit power level of the second RAT; and a maximum transmit power limit of the second RAT.
- the transmit power status of the second RAT could be a transmit power level of the second RAT, or a transmit power headroom of the second RAT, or a maximum transmit power limit of the second RAT.
- the modification of the maximum transmit power limit of the first RAT occurs over only a single slot of a sub-frame wherein only the single slot includes transmissions in frequency resources that desense the second RAT whereas one or more other slots of the sub-frame do not include transmissions in frequency resources that desense the second RAT.
- a multimode wireless communication terminal that communicates using a first radio access technology (RAT) and a second RAT determines, at 410 , whether the first RAT and the second RAT are in an active state.

- the PUCCH is used to convey CQI information, ACK/NACK information, etc.
- the UCI may piggy back over a PUSCH in case of simultaneous PUCCH and PUSCH allocations in the same sub-frame. This is necessary to preserve the single carrier nature of the uplink waveform. Simultaneous PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions over separate uplink allocations are generally allowed. In the case of a dual RAT supporting terminal, and the terminal is transmitting on both the RATs simultaneously, the uplink transmissions on the two RATs can create IM distortion products that fall in the resource allocations for the PUCCH.
- the service supported over one RAT is of higher priority than the service supported over the other RAT.
- a voice session may be supported over one RAT and the other RAT support a non-voice session.
