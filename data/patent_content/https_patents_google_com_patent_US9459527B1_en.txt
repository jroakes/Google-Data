Definitions
- This disclosure relates to information presentation.
- Video sharing websites may allow users to upload video content to a server for publication on the video sharing website. Users of the video sharing website may view videos uploaded by other users or upload their own videos to share with other users. In some instances, videos uploaded by a particular user may be grouped into a channel associated with the particular user, and other users may search for or browse videos in the channel. Specific users or videos may also be associated with a video advertisement such that when a user selects a video for viewing, the video advertisement associated with the particular user or the video is also automatically played before the selected video is played. Video advertisements may also be displayed based on association with other content on a page.
- the video sharing website may present video advertisements in a number of different ways, such as presenting the video advertisement as a static image with lines of text on a page or a as a static image with lines of text hovering over a selected video, as well as presenting video advertisements on pages other than the page where an associated video is playing.
- An advertiser may choose a specific video to which the advertiser attaches or otherwise associates a video advertisement.
- the advertiser's video advertisement may be related to a particular type of product, and the advertiser may attach the video advertisement to a video likely to be viewed by users within a certain demographic that are also likely to purchase products of that particular type.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of providing a search control associated with video content items, the search control for receiving search queries for identifying video content items in a repository of video content items where each video content item is associated with one or more channels in a video sharing environment.
- a search query is received from a user that is logged into one of the video sharing environment or a content distribution system.
- One or more matching video content items are located from the repository based on the search query.
- a selection of one or more of the video content items is received.
- a channel associated with the selected video content items is determined.
- Providing the search control further includes providing a pre-populated suggestion list for selecting a filter criteria for locating a video content item based on the stored historical channel selections associated with the user.
- the user can be logged into the content distribution system and the user can be presented with the search control so as to enable selection of the video content item for inclusion in a campaign associated with the user.

- each advertiser using the video picker client may be associated with a set of stored channels.
- the video picker tool 111 may determine that the advertiser has initiated a new search for additional shared videos to associate with advertisement videos. For example, the video picker tool 111 may detect that the advertiser has logged into an account for advertisers on the video sharing website or that the advertiser has selected an option for searching shared videos using the search control 181 . In some instances, the search control 181 is automatically presented to the advertiser after the advertiser logs into an account on the video sharing website. The search control 181 may include a stateful control for selecting video content items from a repository of video content items. In response to the determination that the advertiser has initiated a search for additional shared videos, the video picker tool 111 may send search options to the video picker client 165 for presentation to the advertiser at state (e).
- the search options may include a pre-populated suggestion list of the stored channels 124 associated with the advertiser or a list of individual videos in the stored channels 124 , for example.
- the pre-populated suggestion list of stored channels 124 may include options allowing the advertiser to select filter criteria for locating additional video content based on the stored historical channel selections associated with the advertiser.
- the search options presented to the advertiser may allow the advertiser to filter search results such that only videos within the stored channel associated with the shared video 151 are displayed.
- the various search options that may be presented to the advertiser through the search control 181 are described in further detail with respect to FIG. 2 .
- the search options presented to the advertiser are based on stored channels 124 associated with the shared video 151 previously selected by the advertiser (during state (b)). Accordingly, the advertiser may be presented with suggestions for shared videos to select for attaching/associating advertisement videos based on the advertiser's previous selections. The suggested videos may help the advertiser identify relevant videos while minimizing the time required to search for additional videos.
- the advertiser may then submit a query to search for videos within one or more of the stored channels 124 presented to the advertiser or to select one of the shared videos in the stored channels 124 to associate with an advertisement video.
- the video picker tool 111 may identify and present video content items responsive to the query received from the advertiser.
