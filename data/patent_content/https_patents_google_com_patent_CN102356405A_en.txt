System and user thereof
People can visually absorb the information from the appear medium of (printing and demonstration), comprising the information that provides with text, image, video and other forms.For instance, people can read newspaper, magazine, books and periodicals, blog, text message, billboard, receipt, brief note or the like; Can watch photo, drawing, object, advertisement or the like attentively; And can watch film, video, performance, other people or the like.In fact, people receive and picked-up information through the world of observing theirs on every side simply always.
Such observation or information pickup possibly be (user examines knowledge and usually engages in information) or passive (user are not examining the information that still receives under the situation of knowledge) initiatively.A people may for example painstakingly obtain said information through " pulling " information, perhaps maybe be when information be " pushed " acquired information (passive picked-up) unintentionally to them.In a sense, the people can imitate device (computing machine, mobile phone and other devices), and how it carries out mutual aspect pull information and receive the information that pushed with the world.
But device is not the people, and the performance of current device capturing information in its surrounding environment or in the contiguous with it environment is usually very poor.Technical description disclosed herein realize and promote the system and method for examining intellectual in the device.Said technology can promote about with the intellectual of examining of the contiguous text based information of device, about the examine intellectual based on the information of image contiguous, about examining intellectual or the like with the contiguous information of device shows (such as the document that is appeared) with device.Utilize disclosed technology, device can how with the world carry out mutual aspect the imitation people.
1.1,
Physics/digital, interactive
Almost the physics of each information shows all with perhaps and can be associated with additional numerical information.For instance, image can be associated with description (for example metadata), network (web) page or the like; Single word can be associated with definition, Wikipedia clauses and subclauses, advertisement or the like; Document can be associated with its electronics homologue, Webpage, slide show or the like; Geographic position (or object of this position) can be associated with metadata, image, the information about this position; Audio stream can be associated with slide show; Or the like.Under the situation that the physics that has information shows, said system only need identify said information demonstration (perhaps identifying the part aspect that information shows, the text in showing such as information) just can visit the information that is associated.Said system allows the physics demonstration of information to serve as platform, produces the abundant digital three-dimensional interactivity of encompasses users and content from said platform.
1.2,
The document that sign is appeared
In some cases, the document that sign is appeared can provide visit a large amount of additional informations for the reader, and said additional information constitutes the experience that replenishes and can enrich the reader to document itself.For the document that each part appeared with electronics homologue, each message part in the document that is appeared can be used to identify said electronics homologue.In some instances, said system acquisition and use identify and locate the electronics homologue of the document from the samples of text of the document that is appeared.In some cases, the required samples of text of system is very little, that is to say from several words of document or partial words usually just can serve as for the identifier of the document that is appeared and serve as the link that goes to its electronics homologue.In addition, said system not only can use said several word to identify document, but also can identify the position in the document.Therefore, utilize the system of being discussed to be associated the digital homologue of the document that is appeared and its through many useful modes here.
Therefore, utilize the system of being discussed to be associated the document that is appeared with its electronics homologue through many useful modes here.
In simple terms; When the several words in the document that scanning input presented, character or zone; Said electronics homologue document or its certain part can be retrieved by said system; Show said electronics homologue document or its certain part; Said electronics homologue document or the sub- mail of its certain a part of electricity consumption are sent to someone; Buy said electronics homologue document or its certain part; Print said electronics homologue document or its certain part; Said electronics homologue document or its certain part are posted on the Webpage, perhaps carry out making the user to carry out other mutual actions with the document or related content.For instance; The user is with the outstanding part top that is placed on newspaper or magazine article of his/her mobile device (and video camera); Make this user's mobile device on the touch-screen of this mobile device, show the electronic version of said article, and provide this user of permission and said article to carry out further mutual option to the user.In some cases, the outstanding said article top that is placed on can be so that mobile device switches to document be examined and know or interactive mode, during such as to a certain degree contiguous that detect when mobile device with article.
Said system need not change above-mentioned and many other instances of implementing " paper/numeral is integrated " under the situation of pre-treatment of working as of writing, print and publish document and the demonstration of other information, thereby is that document and the physical object that is appeared provides brand-new one deck digital function.
In case said system is one section text in the document that is appeared and the optional network specific digit entity associated of having set up, this system just can set up a large amount of functions in this association.
Increasing situation is that most of documents that appear have can be visited on WWW or can perhaps for example can or subscribe to and realize said visit from the electronics homologue of a certain other online databases or the visit of document information storehouse in response to paying.So under the simplest rank; When the user caught the several word in the document that is appeared, said system can retrieve this electronic document or its part, show this electronic document or its part, through Email this electronic document or its part are sent to someone, buy this electronic document or its part, print this electronic document or its part and/or this electronic document or its part are posted on the Webpage.As additional instance; Several words of catching the books and periodicals that a people reading when breakfast can be so that the audiobook version in his car begins to read from this point when he begins to drive to go to work, and perhaps catches the processing that sequence number on the printing machine print cartridge can begin to order replacement.
Use for the typical case of said system to start from using acquisition equipment from the document that is appeared, to catch text, but it is important to should be noted that the additive method of catching from the object of other types is suitable equally.Therefore, said system is described to catch or scan text from the document that is appeared sometimes, and wherein said term quilt is as giving a definition:
The document that is appeared is the document of printing or the document that on display or monitor, illustrates.It is the document that the mankind can perceive, and permanent form is still temporary transient to be shown no matter it has.It is the physical object that information is provided through presentation layer.Other physical objecies of the information that the document that is appeared comprises paper document, billboard, symbol, provided by the presentation layer of calculation element, the information (such as the audio or video information flow) propagated through ripple and/or expression or display message.
Catching or scanning is to carry out systematicness inspection so that from the processing of the document acquired information that appeared.Said processing can relate to the video camera that for example uses in cell phone or the hand-held optical scanner and carry out optical acquisition, perhaps it can relate to from the document reading aloud to the audio capturing device or on keypad or keyboard with its key entry.Save referring to the 15th about more instances.
Except catching the text from the document that is appeared; Said system can also be from other source capturing informations, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) label, QR code, bar code, other physical objecies (for example drawing, sculpture), directly from information of the presentation layer of calculation element or the like.Other sources can comprise the document based on audio frequency and/or video, such as the other guide on radio broadcast program and the radio channel; Other guide on video and the video channel, comprising TV program, TV commercial advertisement, film or the like, no matter its be appear from local medium (such as video disc) or give from remote server or the like stream.As an instance, said system can be from the audio-source capturing information, and the content of the information that is associated with said audio-source of demonstration or supplemental content or the audio stream that produced by this source.

System introduction
This joint is described and is constituted some of them device, processing and a system that is used for the integrated system of paper/numeral.In each instance, said system sets up various services and application providing on this bottom core of basic function.
2.1,
Handle
Figure 1A shows the data flowchart of the information flow in some instances of suitable system.Other instances maybe not can use shown all stages or element here, and some instances will use many more stages or element simultaneously.
Near document or information capture 100 texts and/or other information from this device show of acquisition equipment such as mobile device with video camera and/or voice recorder and so on from being appeared.Said device can handle 102 to the data of being caught, so that for example remove said pseudomorphism of catching processing, improves signal to noise ratio (S/N ratio), identifies or locate desired information in the said data or the like.Said system passes through recognizer component (such as OCR device, speech recognition equipment, auto-correlation device or other technologies as described herein) subsequently alternatively with 104 one-tenth one or more signatures of said data-switching, such as text fragments, text skew or other symbols or character.Replacedly, said system carries out a kind of replacement form of from the document that is appeared, extracting one or more document signature.In some cases, said signature is represented a possible text transcription set.In some cases, said processing may receive influence or the constraint from the feedback of the step of carrying out before or after other.For instance, if identified the said candidate documents that possibly be derived from wherein of catching before the said system, it just can narrow the possible explanation of raw captured.
Aftertreatment assembly can receive the data of self-identifying processing and said data are filtered 106, perhaps carries out other operations according to expectation.In some instances, said system can be for example infers, confirms, identifies and/or carries out direct action 107 immediately and need not proceed to the subsequent step in the routine when it captures the phrase that comprises the information that is enough to know by inference user view or symbol.In these cases, said system maybe not need identify or reference number homologue document is realized user's hope.
In step 108, said system can construct an inquiry or a query set subsequently, searches for and said electronics homologue or the other guide that is associated of catching being used to.Some aspect of said query construction can depend on employed searching disposal; And can in the step of back, carry out by said system (such as after carrying out search) they; But will there be certain operations to carry out in advance usually, such as removing identification or the incoherent character of apparent error by system.
Said system transmits 110 to said one or more inquiry to search and scenario analysis assembly.Said system can attempt identifying the document of therefrom having caught raw data.For this reason, said system can use search index and search engine 112, about user's knowledge 114 and/or about the knowledge 116 of the user context or the situation of wherein catching.For instance; Said system can carry out alternately with search engine 112, said search engine adopt and/or index especially in regard to the information of the document that is appeared, about the information of its digital homologue document and/or about having the information of the document that network (internet) exists.Said system can transmit information back and forth with these information sources, and can be with the feed information that identified in each other steps of said routine.For instance, said system can be based on the knowledge that receives during the step 110 about candidate documents and receives about language, the font of catching, plays up and the information of possible more ensuing words.
In step 120, the copy of a or many parts of documents of the electronics homologue that is identified as the document that is appeared in the early time can be retrieved by said system.Said system is access document source and thesaurus 124 (for example local filing system or the database or the webserver) directly, and perhaps said system can get in touch access services 122 to retrieve a or many parts of documents.Access services 122 can be implemented authentication, security or the paying to document, and other services perhaps can be provided, and for example document is converted to desired form or language, except other.
The application of said system can utilize the part of extra function or data and document or whole related.For instance, advertisement applications can be associated specific advertisement message or theme with the each several part of document, such as key word, phrase or with the adjacency of certain content.The function of this extra association or data show its specific part that should combine said document and available, and it can be regarded as the one or more coverings on the said document, and is known as mark here.Therefore, in step 130, said system banner goes out and data of being caught and/or the relevant any mark of electronics homologue that identified.In some cases, said mark is provided by the publisher of user, creator, document, other users of document or the like, and can be stored in 132 places, direct addressable source, is perhaps dynamically generated by mark service 134.In some instances; Said mark can be associated with the digital homologue of document that is appeared and/or the document that is appeared and with the digital homologue of said tag application in document that is appeared and/or the document that appeared, perhaps can be with said tag application in by any or whole two kinds of groups that constitute in the middle of these documents.
As above-mentioned some or result in steps, said system can take or carry out 140 the action.Said action can be the system default action, and such as writing down the information that is found simply, it can depend on data or document, perhaps can derive from said labeled analysis.In some cases, said system can arrive another system with data transfer simply.In some cases, the specified point place in the document that is suitable for being appeared catch possibly move and will be given the user as the menu on display that is associated (such as the display (touch-screen of mobile device) of acquisition equipment) or the display (user's laptop computer screens) that is associated.Said system can be in response to catching, being directed against the request of one of execution or multinomial action or time marking afterwards or carrying out one or multinomial action in response to the user.
As about can how to use an instance of acquisition equipment, the reader can utilize the video camera that is associated with its mobile device from newspaper article, to catch text.Said text is captured as bitmap images through video camera.Logic is stored in said bitmap images in the storer and to image and adds timestamp, and record with catch other data of being associated (such as the position of installing, geographic position data or the like).Said logic is also carried out optical character identification (OCR), and image transitions is become text.Said system uploads to said text and said newspaper associated content index, and identifies and retrieve the electronics homologue for said article.Acquisition equipment is subsequently through the said electronics homologue of the screen displaying that is associated and one or more multinomial action will carrying out; Such as downloading and watch relevant article or the article of additional background information being provided; Each term in the high bright demonstration article and the link of the definition that goes to these terms is provided, perhaps in article or project of being discussed around it watch advertisement or purchase information.
Can find in application for referencial use about other details aspect system handles, assembly and/or the device being incorporated in this.
Figure 1B shows the data flowchart of the information flow in the instance of suitable system.Acquisition equipment 155 from information source 150 and other sources (such as carrying out the source (not shown) of radio communication) with said device catch given information, such as text, audio frequency, video, gps coordinate, user's attitude, bar code or the like.In step 160, the information that information conservator assembly is collected and storage is caught by acquisition equipment 155.In step 165, said system will be delivered to the capturing information processing components from the information that acquisition equipment is collected.Capturing information processing components 165 is configured to detect the existence of the document that is appeared, from document, extracts text filed and analytical documentation information; So that identify document and text feature, such as the shade of absolute and relative layout information, paragraph, lines and word or profile, characteristic and the character code relevant with graphic character.In some instances, the capturing information processing components can be configured to handle the data type that is different from text, such as audio frequency, compass data, GPS, acceleration, history, temperature, humidity, body heat or the like.In some instances, said capturing information processing unit will be along with accumulated time information and compound information of accumulating, so that for example when acquisition equipment is caught or send more information, form the bigger and/or higher image of resolution of information source.In some instances, the capturing information processing components can utilize situation (referring to the 13rd and 14 joints) (such as being the information of before being caught by the user) for example to guide capturing information to handle through restriction or quantity and the guiding of expanding performed processing about the hypothesis in processed content just.For instance; If said system identifies the information that the user has caught from particular source recently; Then the back possibly need less processing to obtain the definite degree about the similar level of the information of newly catching; This is because the search in the limited possibility space can obtain coupling fast, if expectation can further be confirmed said coupling then.Said capturing information processing components can be verified the information that is identified, and such as through confirming automatically based on exploratory conclusion or refusing the prediction in the said information, perhaps through utilizing the gatekeeper to serve 170 (referring to the 19.8th joints), perhaps passes through the request user feedback.In step 175, the storage of said system catch and information processed with a part as system's history and situation.
In step 180, said system carries out search (referring to 4.2.2,13 and 14 joints) based on handled information and situation.In some instances; Can be correlated with along with the accumulated time Search Results and to it; For example based on the information subset interleaving search results of catching, so that solve ambiguity (such as a plurality of parts of the audio frequency that is write down, from the audio frequency of a plurality of frequency bands, multiple image or the like) along with the time.In some instances, can for example can come further verification search result to the principle of Search Results (the perhaps information of retrieving by document manager assembly 185) and the information and executing analyzing adjuncts of being caught by the capturing information processing components based on image processing modules.For instance, if search component generates 10 possible results, then the capturing information processing components can confirm wherein 6 unlikely and Search Results be complementary, such as the pattern of the vertical stroke in the text.In step 185, if identify document, then the document manager assembly of said system can be retrieved the expression of said document.In step 190, the marker assemblies of said system can calculate and/or retrieve with export from the text of capturing information treatment step and/or the document that is identified or the document retrieved represent relevant dynamically and/or static tay.About static and dynamically labeled more information, referring to the 5th joint.In some instances, in case identify text, marker assemblies just produces mark based on text that is identified and document identification concurrently.
In step 195, can give the user with information.In some instances, this information can comprise: feedback, move acquisition equipment so that the suggestion of Ju Jiaoing better such as being directed against; On the image of being caught, cover high bright demonstration to show possible area-of-interest, wherein possibly be included in the user said zone that acquisition equipment is outstanding will impliedly be selected when being placed on the area-of-interest; The clear version that newly appears of the text that is formed images, itself and graphical rule, layout are complementary, and modeling is carried out in current visual field of acquisition equipment or the like; Actions available tabulation based on current area-of-interest; Take the result of individual event action based on current area-of-interest, such as dialing phone number automatically; Utilization is suitable for being indicated as by the user the given audio frequency-visual material of template of information of one or more types of its area-of-interest; Providing information based on area-of-interest shows and/or audio frequency.In some instances, area-of-interest can be by the user impliedly or the zone that shows clearly and around bigger gradually zone (such as phrase, subordinate clause, row, section, row, article, page or leaf, periodical, publication or the like) formation of center area-of-interest.In some instances; Main area-of-interest is advised based on the position in the image (such as the screen center of acquisition equipment) by system; And can select through clear and definite user interactions; Perhaps through putting the short period section and select near said zone is outstanding; Perhaps through selecting with the user interactions of screen; Such as with the inswept area-of-interest of finger, perhaps knock the somewhere in the area-of-interest of being advised.

2.3.1
Information is examined the knowledge acquisition equipment
Said system can comprise and is used for confirming that acquisition equipment is adjacent to information (such as the document that is appeared) and based on the assembly of the operation of said definite change acquisition equipment.In some instances, acquisition equipment comprises video camera and adjacency assembly, and said video camera is caught document or other information images displayed that is appeared, the adjacency that said adjacency component detection and the document that is appeared or other information show.The adjacency assembly can be or can utilize the optical module in the video camera, perhaps can be the stand-alone assembly such as the adjacency sensor.Said system can know that text, document and/or other information show (such as the object of videotex) and shows that with text, document and/or other information (such as the object of videotex) carries out mutual pattern so that acquisition equipment changes to a kind of examining after definite acquisition equipment and information vicinity.For instance, under the document acquisition mode, said system can initiate to catch the document that appeared or information images displayed through acquisition equipment and carry out one or multinomial processing of action based on such catching.
The overview of the various aspects of second portion---system
Become more general along with paper-numeral is integrated, can many aspects of prior art be made a change, so that utilize this integrated or make it possible to realize more effectively this integrated better.This joint will be stressed the some of them problem.
3,
Search
For domestic consumer, searching documents data bank (even such as the big like this data bank of the WWW) nothing to be surprised at that become, the user uses keyboard to construct to be sent to the search inquiry of search engine.This joint and next joint will be passed through discussion from the document that is appeared and catch and the structure of the inquiry that produces, and the two the each side of search engine of handling this inquiry.
3.1,
Catch/talk/typewrite with as search inquiry
Usually start from utilizing in the middle of the several method any to catch several words for the use of described system, comprising those methods noted earlier from the document that is appeared.Carrying out certain explanation so that convert thereof under the situation of text to input, for example under the situation of OCR or phonetic entry, in said system, end-to-end feedback can be arranged, handle thereby can use the document information storehouse to strengthen identification.Can use end-to-end feedback through following content: carry out approximate to said identification or explanation; The set that sign is made up of one or more candidate matches documents, and the possible information matching that is used to subsequently in candidate documents is come further refinement or is limited said identification or explanation.Can come candidate documents is carried out weighting (so for example based on other number of users or its of having caught information from these documents in the popularity on the Internet) according to its possible correlativity, and can in this iteration identification is handled, use these weights.
3.2,
Phrase search
Owing under the situation of the relative position of knowing several words, can strengthen selective power greatly, therefore only need catch a small amount of text and just can identify the position of said text in data bank for said system based on the search inquiry of these words.Modal situation is that input text will be a continuous word sequence, such as a phrase.
3.2.1,
From the short position of seeking document and the document of catching
Except the document that phrase was derived from of location, said system can also identify the position in the document and can take action based on this knowledge.
3.2.2,
Seek the additive method of position
Said system can also adopt the additive method of finding document and position, such as watermark or other special markings on the document that is appeared through utilization.
3.3,
In search inquiry, merge other factors
Except the text of being caught; Other factors information of user identity, profile and situation (promptly about) also can form the part of search inquiry, such as capture time, user's identity and geographic position, about user's custom and knowledge of Recent Activity or the like.
Document identification and can form the part of search inquiry with other relevant information of previous catching (especially under it is very recent situation).
Can be from confirming user's identity with acquisition equipment associated unique identification symbol and/or biologicall test or other side informations (speech pattern, fingerprint or the like).
3.4,
Knowledge about the unreliability in the search inquiry (OCR mistake or the like) character
When the structure search inquiry, can consider the type of contingent mistake in employed specific catching method.An instance of this respect is the indication about the suspection mistake in the identification of concrete character; In this case, search engine can be treated these characters as asterisk wildcard, perhaps specifies lower priority for it.
3.5,
To what performance/off-line used index is carried out local cache
Sometimes, acquisition equipment possibly can't communicate with search engine or data bank when data capture.For this reason, can shift to an earlier date the helpful download of information that the off-line to device is used and arrive said device, perhaps download to a certain entity that said device can communicate with it.In some cases, can download and the whole of data bank associated index or most.In the 15.3rd joint, this proposition will be discussed further.
3.6,
Can and take action in the back according to any form record queries
The delay or the cost that if possible have and transmission inquiry or reception result to be associated, then this information that loads in advance can be improved performance, the reduction communications cost of local device and provide and help and user feedback timely.
Under the available situation of not communicating by letter (local device " off-line "), then can preserve the remainder that said inquiry and that time when communication recovery send it to system.
In these cases, possibly it is important to stab along with each bar inquiry transmitting time.Capture time possibly be a very important factor when inquiry is made an explanation.For instance, the 13.1st joint has been discussed capture time about not long ago the importance of catching.It is important should be noted that capture time will be always not identical with the time of carrying out inquiry.
3.7,
Parallel search
From performance reason, may catch and sequentially or concurrently start many inquiries in response to single.Can catch in response to single and send several inquiries, this for example is because in catching, added new word, or in order to inquire about a plurality of search engines concurrently.
For instance; In some instances, said system sends inquiry to the special index for current document, and the search engine on local machine sends inquiry; Search engine on enterprise network sends inquiry, and sends inquiry to the remote search engines on the Internet.
Can provide recently those higher priority for the result of particular search from other search.
Response to given inquiry possibly show that other inquiries undetermined are unnecessary; Can before accomplishing, cancel these unnecessary inquiries.
4,
Paper and search engine
Search engine that usually hope to handle traditional online query also process source from the inquiry of the document that is appeared.Can strengthen or revise traditional search engine according to multiple mode, use so that it more is applicable to described system.
Other assemblies of search engine and/or system can produce and keep the index with different or extra characteristic.Said system can revise the inquiry that derives from paper imported or change the mode of in resulting search, handling inquiry, thus with these inquiries that derive from paper with distinguish from keying in those inquiries web browser and other sources.With compare from those of other sources, when being derived from the search return results of paper, said system can take different actions or different options is provided.In the middle of these methods each will be discussed below.
4.1,
Index
Usually may utilize to be derived from inquiry paper or traditional and to search for identical index, but can strengthen said index in several ways so that be used in the current system.
4.1.1,
Knowledge about the paper form
Can add extra field to said index, this will offer help under the situation based on the search of paper.
Show the directory entry that the document of paper form can be used
First instance is the field that shows that known document exists with the paper form or distributed.If inquiry is from paper, then said system can provide more high priority for such document.
Knowledge about the popularity of paper form
In this instance; Be utilized for such document about the statistics of the popularity of paper document (and alternatively about the subregion in these documents) (distribution number that for example catch movable quantity, provides by publisher or other sources or the like) and provide more high priority, so that promote priority of digital homologue document (it for example is used for based on the inquiry of browser or web search) or the like.
Knowledge about the form that appeared
Another important example can be the information of record about the specific layout that appears of document.
For example for the particular version of books and periodicals, said index can comprise about branch and paging which font, any uncommon uppercase information take place wherein, used.
Said index can also comprise the information about the adjacency of the sundry item on the page, such as image, text box, form and advertisement.
Use original semantic information
At last, can infer the semantic information that does not appear at the paper document from source marking, relate to the project of confession sale or the fact that specific paragraph comprises program code such as one section particular text but can also in index, write down.
4.1.2,
Index in the knowledge of catching method
Second factor can revising the character of index is the knowledge of catching type about possibly using.If index is considered the character that in OCR handles, is easy to be confused or is comprised that then the search of being initiated by the text image of being caught may be useful about being used in certain knowledge of the font in the document.For instance, the sequence of letter " r " followed letter " n " may be obscured with letter " m " in OCR handles.Correspondingly, character string " m " or " rn " possibly be associated with identical collection of document in index.Similarly, if said inquiry is from speech recognition, then can be by much more efficient as to search for based on the index that sounds similar phoneme.As another instance, said document can artificially before document is retrieved blur in said system, so that reflect when the user catches file and picture through above document, moving acquisition equipment contingent fuzzy.Similar techniques can be so that system has holding capacity for relatively poor optics situation, noise or the like.An additive factor that may influence the use of index in described model is the importance of the iterative feedback during identification is handled.If search engine can provide the feedback from index when catching text, then can improve greatly and catch precision.
Utilize the index of side-play amount
Be utilized in if possible that the 9th joint describes based on side-play amount/auto-correlation OCR method comes search index, then in some instances, said system is stored in suitable side-play amount or signing messages in the index.
4.1.3,
A plurality of index
At last, in described system, possibly commonly on many index, implement search.Can keep index on several the machines in enterprise network.Partial index can be downloaded on the acquisition equipment, perhaps download to the close machine of acquisition equipment on.Can for have interests, custom perhaps can user or groups of users create independent index.Can there be an index for each file system on user's hard disk, each catalogue even each file.Index is announced and is subscribed to by user and system.So very important will be the index that structure can be distributed efficiently, upgrades, merges and separate.
4.2,
Handle inquiry
4.2.1,
Know that to catch be from paper
When identifying search inquiry is when being derived from paper document, and search engine can be taked different actions.Said engine for example can be according to handling said inquiry than the higher mode of type of error tolerance that possibly appear in the specific catching method.
Search engine possibly infer that search inquiry is to be derived from paper document by certain designator (sign that for example shows the character of catching) from be included in inquiry, perhaps can itself infer this point (for example it can identify typical fault or uncertainty that OCR handles) from said inquiry.
Replacedly, can arrive engine through being different from from the inquiry of acquisition equipment, and can be distinguished through this point from those channels of the channel in other sources or port or connection type or port or connection type.For instance, some instances of said system will be routed to search engine to inquiry through dedicated gateway.Thereby all inquiries that search engine is known through this dedicated gateway all are to be derived from paper document.
4.2.2,
The use of situation
The 13rd following joint has been described the outside multiple different factors of text itself of being caught, but it can help to identify document very much.Geographic position and the user that these factors for example comprise the recent more long-term reading habit of catching history, specific user, user is in the recent period to the use of particular electronic document.Such factor is known as " situation " here.
The some of them situation can be handled by search engine itself, and can be reflected in the Search Results.For instance, search engine can be followed the tracks of user's the history of catching, and this can be caught historical and traditional inquiry cross reference based on keyboard.Under these circumstances; Said search engine keep also using than most of traditional search engines do more about each individual consumer's status information, and can be considered alternately with each of search engine and to expand in several the search and expand to typical longer time period of time period than current institute.
The some of them situation can be sent to search engine (the 3.3rd joint) in search inquiry, and possibly be stored in said engine and sentence just and in the inquiry in future, play a role.At last, the some of them situation will be preferably in other places and be processed, thereby and become filtrator or the binary search that is applied to from the result of search engine.
Data stream input to search
A very important input in the searching disposal is how to carry out mutual more wide in range situation with the version that is appeared of document about communities of users, and for example which document is read and by whose reading the most widely.These aspects are similar to web search and return the page that is linked to the most continually, perhaps the most selecteed page from the Search Results in past.Further discussion to this proposition saves referring to the 13.4th and 14.2.
4.2.3,
The document subregion
Described system not only can send and use the information about unitary document, but also can send and use the information about the subregion of document, even little of independent word.Many existing search engines concentrate on simply locatees document relevant with ad hoc inquiry or file.The search engine that can on meticulousr granularity, work and identify a certain position in the document will provide suitable benefit for described system.
4.3,
Return results
Search engine can use its information that keeps now of other to influence the result who is returned.
The result that said system can also be only has a paper copies as the user just returns the particular document (the 7.4th joint) that said user can visit.
Except simple text retrieval, search engine can also provide new action or the option that is suitable for described system.
5,
Mark, note, enhancing, metadata
Except execution catch-search for-retrieval process, described system also is associated extra function with document, and the ad-hoc location or the fragment of the interior text of special and document are associated.Said additional functionality usually (but not exclusively) through being associated and being associated with the document that is appeared with its electronics homologue.As an instance, when catching the printout of Webpage, the hyperlink in the said Webpage has identical functions.In some cases, said function is not defined within the electronic document, but is stored elsewhere or generates.
The function that this layer added is known as " mark " here.
5.1,
Covering, static and dynamic
A kind of mode of considering mark is as " covering " on the document, and it provides the other information about said document or its certain part, and can specify the action that joins with said document or its a certain part correlation.Said mark can comprise human-readable content, but usually for the user invisible and/or intention be used for machine and use.Instance is included in the option in the popup menu that will be displayed on when text is caught in the specific region of user from the document that is appeared near the display, and the audio samples of the pronunciation of particular phrase perhaps is described.As another instance, said system can play and said advertisement associated advertisement ballad when the document that is appeared is caught advertisement the user.
5.1.1,
Maybe be from several layers in several sources
Any document can have a plurality of coverings simultaneously, and these coverings can be derived from a plurality of positions.Can create or supplemental tag data by author, user or other a certain sides of document.
Flag data may be attached to electronic document or is embedded into wherein.Can find flag data (such as still having different files name suffix) in traditional position in the place identical with document.Flag data can be included in the Search Results of the inquiry of having located original document, perhaps can be through finding to independent inquiry same or another search engine.Can utilize the urtext of being caught and other capturing informations or contextual information to find flag data, perhaps can utilize the information of having inferred to find flag data about document and catch position.Can in document, find flag data in the position of appointment, even when said mark itself is not included in the document, also be like this.
Said mark can be static and specific to document (usually be similar to the link on the Webpage of traditionally html is embedded in the mode in the html document as static data) to a great extent, but also can dynamically generate mark and/or be applied to large volume document.A dynamically labeled instance is the information that is attached to the up-to-date share price that is included in the company that is mentioned in the document on the document.An instance of the mark that is widely used is an auto-available translation information on a plurality of documents of language-specific or document section.
5.1.2,
Individual's " insertion " layer
The user can also install or subscribe to the specific markers data source, thereby personalization system is to specific response of catching.
5.2,
Key word and phrase, trade mark and logo
Some element in the document possibly have specific " mark " associated therewith or function, and said specific " mark " or function are based on the characteristic of said element itself rather than based on its position in particular document.Instance comprises and purely is printed on the special marking in the document for captive purpose, and can be linked to logo and trade mark about the further information of related tissue to the user.This point is suitable for for " key word " in the text or " key phrase " equally.Each tissue may be registered and be associated with it or it wants particular phrase associated therewith, and specific markers is attached on it, and said mark is just with available when this phrase is hunted down.
Any word, phrase or the like can have the mark that is associated.For instance, when the user captured title or the proposition relevant with book of " book " word or a book, said system can add specific project (for example going to the link of online bookstore) to popup menu.In some instances of said system; Digital homologue document or index are seeked advice from so that confirm to catch near the title that whether occurs in " book " word or a book or the proposition relevant with book, and according to revising system action with this adjacency of key word element.In the instance in front, should be noted that mark makes the data of catching from non-commercial text or document can trigger business transaction.
5.3,
The content that the user provides
5.3.1,
Consumers' opinions and note comprise multimedia
Note is the electronic information of the another kind of type that can be associated with document.For instance, the user can adhere to he about the audio file of the idea of particular document for retrieving as voice annotation afterwards.As another instance of multimedia note, the user can be attached to the photo in the place of being mentioned in the document.The user is generally document note is provided, but said system can related note from other sources (for example other interior users of work group can share note).
5.3.2,
From the mark of collating
An important example that is derived from user's mark is as the note of collating, edit or comment on the paper document of a part of handling.
5.4,
Third party's content
As previously mentioned, the third party possibly usually can provide flag data, provides such as other readers by document.Online discussion and comment are good instances, and the translation and the explanation of the information of the community management relevant with specific works, contribution voluntarily also are good instances.
Another instance of third party's mark is the mark that is provided by the advertiser.
5.5,
Dynamically labeled based on other user's data stream
Through analyzing the data of catching from document, can generate mark based on the activity of a community and interest by the several of said system or all users.An instance possibly be online bookstore, and user's mark or note told in its establishment, in fact " liking the people of this this book also to like ... "The anonymity of said mark can be lower, and can tell in his/her contacts list of user who also to read the document recently.Other instances of data-flow analysis are included in the 14th joint.
5.6,
Mark based on external event and data source
Mark will usually be based on external event and data source, such as from the input of enterprise database, from the information of public internet or by the statistics of local operation systematic collection.
Data source is localization more also, and the information about user's situation, i.e. his/her identity, position and activity can be provided especially.For instance, said system possibly communicate and provide mark layer with the components of mobile phone of user's acquisition equipment, thereby sends the option of document for the user provides someone that conversation arranged recently to this user on phone with it.

Authentication, individualized and security
In many cases, user's identity will be known.Said sometimes identity will be " an anonymous identity ", for example come under the situation of identifying user at the sequence number through acquisition equipment only.But as a rule, contemplated system will have the much detailed knowledge about the user, and it can be used to said system is individualized, and allows nominal executed activity and transaction with this user.
6.1,
User historical and " life storehouse "
But the simplest wherein a kind of the most useful again function that said system can carry out is to keep text that he caught and about this any other recording of information of catching, comprising the details of any document that is found, the position in the document and any action of as a result of being taked for the user.In some instances, said system can send the information of being caught to the e-mail address of user's appointment, and the user can be via the information of being caught in this place, address visit through email client such as email protocols such as POP3, IMAP.In addition, the information of being caught that is stored as Email can comprise the link that goes to the storehouse experience of more comprehensively living, as described in the 16.1st joint those.
The two all is useful to this stored historical for user and system.
6.1.1,
For the user
Can provide " life storehouse " for the user, i.e. the record of all the elements of reading and catching for him.This can be from personal interest simply, but for example also can in a storehouse, be used by the scholar who just is the bibliography collection material of its next chapter article.
In some cases, the user possibly hope to disclose said storehouse, such as through according to the mode that is similar to blog it being published on the network, thereby makes other people can see that he is reading and finding interested content.
At last; The user catches some texts and system and can't be immediately catches (for example because the electronic version of the document is still unavailable) under the situation of taking to move to said therein, can saidly catch to be stored in the storehouse and can automatically or in response to the user to ask handle in the back.The user can also subscribe to new mark service and be applied to previous catching.
6.1.2,
For system
User's the record of catching in the past also is useful for said system.Reading habit through knowing the user and historical many aspects that can enhanced system operation.The simplest instance is; Any catching that the user did all more likely is at recent document of therefrom having caught information in the past from this user; And is to carry out in a few minutes recently preceding once catching especially, then it very might be from a document.Similarly, situation more likely is just according to cephalocaudal order reading documents.Therefore, for english documents, also situation more likely is that the more depths in document takes place catching of back.Such factor can help to establish the position of catching under the situation of ambiguity, and can reduce the captive amount of text of needs.
6.2,
Acquisition equipment is as paying, sign and authenticate device
Therefore usually start from certain device owing to catch processing, said device can be used as identifying user and authorize the key of specific action.
6.2.1,
Acquisition equipment is associated with user account
Acquisition equipment can be associated with mobile telephone account.For instance, can be associated acquisition equipment with said account through being inserted into the SIM card that is associated with mobile telephone account in the acquisition equipment.Similarly, can be embedded into said device in credit card or other Payment Cards, perhaps make it have and be used for facility that such card is attached thereto.Therefore, said device can be used as the paying token, and can initiate business transaction through catching from the document that is appeared.
6.2.2,
Utilization is caught and is carried out authentication
Acquisition equipment can also be associated with specific user or account, and this is to realize through the processing of catching the token, symbol or the text that are associated with this user or account.In addition, acquisition equipment can be used to biometric identification, such as through catching user's fingerprint.Under situation based on the acquisition equipment of audio frequency, the voice mode that said system can be through match user or through requiring the user to say particular password or phrase comes identifying user.
For instance, catch quoted passage and be provided under the situation of the option of buying this book from online retailer from a book the user, the user can select this option and be prompted to catch his/her fingerprint subsequently to confirm transaction.
Also referring to the 15.5th and 15.6 joints.
6.2.3,
Safe acquisition equipment
When acquisition equipment is used to sign and authenticated and representative of consumer and initiates transaction, it is important to guarantee that the communication between other parts of said device and system is safe.Also it is important provides protection to following such situation: when another device is dressed up as acquisition equipment, and so-called " go-between " attacks (wherein said device and other communication between components are tackled).
Be used to provide the technology of this security to be known in the art; In each instance, the hardware and software in the other places in said device and the system is configured to implement such technology.
7,
Publish model and element
An advantage of described system is that the processing that need not change traditional establishment, printing or publication document obtains many benefits of said system.But the creator of document or publisher (being called " publisher " hereinafter simply) have reason possibly hope to create in order to support the function of described system.
This joint relates generally to the document of being published itself.For information (such as advertisement), be the 10th joint of " P commercial affairs " referring to title about other relevant business transactions.
7.1,
The electronics companion of document printing
The electronics that said system allows document printing to have and is associated exists.Traditionally, CD-ROM usually together loads and transports with books and periodicals in publisher, and it comprises other numerical information, mickey mouse and other multi-medium datas, sample code or document or other reference material.In addition; The website that some publisher's maintenance is associated with niche publication; Its provide said material and can be after the publication time updated information, other source of reference material, bibliography and related data such as errata, other suggestion, after upgrading and the translation of other language.Online forum allows the reader to contribute its suggestion about said publication.
Described system allows and will more closely relate to the document that is appeared before the said material ratio, and the permission user finds said material with being more prone to and carries out mutual with it.Through catch a part of text from document, said system can connect the user to the digital material (and being associated with this specific part of said document more in particular) that is associated with document automatically, and on acquisition equipment, shows these materials.Similarly, the user can be connected to the on-line communities that this joint text is discussed through acquisition equipment, perhaps is connected to other readers' note and notes and commentary.In the past, need find such information through searching for specific page number or chapters and sections usually.
A kind of exemplary application of this respect is the field (the 17.5th joint) of academic textbook.
7.2,
" subscription " is to document printing
If the reader hopes to be notified the publication time of the redaction of new relevant item or books and periodicals, some publishers can have the mailing list that said reader can subscribe to.Utilize described system, the user can register the interest for particular document or documentation section with being more prone to, just can so do in some cases even before publisher considers that any this type of function is provided.Reader's interest can be fed to publisher, thereby may influence it about when and where renewal, other information, redaction being provided or even about being proved to be the decision that in existing books and periodicals, becomes the brand-new publication of interested proposition.
7.3,
Have special implication or comprise the typographic(al) mark of special data
Can realize many aspects of said system simply through using text in the document Already in.If but said document is to produce knowing under its situation that possibly be used in combination with said system; Then can be through adding extra function with the extra information of the form printing of special marking; Said special marking can be used to more closely identify text or required action, perhaps otherwise strengthens the mutual of document and system.Simply the most most important instance is to show certainly and can visit document through said system to the reader.For example possibly use special icon to show that the document has online discussion associated therewith forum.
Such symbol can be to the reader purely, perhaps its can be when being hunted down by system identification and be used to initiate certain action.Can in said symbol, encode enough data so that not only identify this symbol: it for example can also be stored about the information of document, version and character position, and said information can and read by system identification.
7.4,
Authorize through having paper document
In some cases, have or the right to use with document printing will allow the user to have particular privilege, for example for the electronic copy of said document or the right to use of additional materials.For described system, can be simply as the user from document catch each textual portions or catch special printing symbol the result and authorize such privilege.Guarantee that in the said system of needs the user has under the situation of entire document, it can point out the user to catch specific project or phrase from specific webpage, for example " the 46th page of second row ".
7.5,
Expired document
If document printing is to lead to the extra material and the approach of function, then the right to use for such characteristic can also receive time restriction.After expiration date, possibly require user's defrayment or obtain the renewal version of document so that can have the right to use of said characteristic once more.Paper document certainly will be available, but will lose its some enhanced electron function.This situation possibly conform with expectation; This for example is because concerning publisher, receiving to aspect the usufructuary expense of electronic material or requiring the user to buy favourable getting aspect the redaction every now and then, or keeps the defective that circulates and be associated because exist with the expired version of document printing.Reward voucher is an instance that possibly have the business document type of expiration date.
7.6,
Decision is analyzed and published to popularity
The 10.5th joint discussion uses the statistics of said system to influence the price for author's compensation and advertisement.
In some instances, said system infers the popularity of publication from the movable of electronic communities associated therewith and from the use of paper document.These factors can help publisher to make about it will publish and so on decision in future.If for example prove that the chapters and sections in the existing book are very welcome, then probable value must be extended to it independent publication.
8,
The document access service
A very important aspect of described system is for the copy that is appeared for document has usufructuary user the ability for the visit of the electronic version of the document to be provided.In some cases, document is freely available on public network that the user can visit or private network.Said system uses that the text of being caught identifies, location and search file, and in some cases it is presented on the acquisition equipment or leaves in its email INBOX.
In some cases, document will can be used with electronic form, but can not be visited by the user for a variety of reasons.Only enumerate several possibilities; Do not exist enough connectivities to come search file; The user possibly have no right search file, possibly have the cost that is associated with the right to use that obtains for document, and perhaps document possibly be retracted and possibly substituted by new version.Said system provides the feedback about these situation to the user usually.
As mentioning in the 7.4th joint, had the right to use if know the specific user for the printed copies of document, the usufructuary degree or the character of then authorizing this user can be different.
8.1,
Document access through authentication
Visit for document can be limited to the specific user, perhaps is limited to the user who satisfies specific criteria, and is perhaps only available under specific circumstances, for example when the user is connected to safe network.The 6th joint has been described the some of them mode of the qualification that can set up user and acquisition equipment.
8.2,
Document is bought---copyright owner's compensation
Still can under the situation of defrayment, visit for the not free available document of general public, said expense is usually as the compensation to publisher or copyright owner.Said system can directly implement to pay facility or can utilize other payment methods that are associated with the user is comprising those methods described in the 6.2nd joint.
8.3,
Document third party keeping and initiatively retrieval
Electronic document usually is temporary; But the digital source version of the document that is appeared maybe be now available in the future unavailable.Said system can representative of consumer retrieve and the storage existing version, even also be so under the situation that does not have to ask the user, thereby under the situation that the user asks in the future, guarantees its availability.This also makes it can be used for system and uses, and for example is used to search for the part with as the following processing of catching of sign.
If require to pay with access document; Then " document third party keeping " service of trusted can for example paid moderate expense representative of consumer search file afterwards, thereby always under the situation of said service request document, guarantees that the copyright owner will obtain full remuneration in the future the user.
If when catching, can't obtain document, then can implement the modification of this theme with electronic form.The user can authorize said service to become in the date afterwards at electronic document to represent him to submit to the request of document or the request that the document is paid under the available situation.
8.4,
Subscribe to other and account related
Sometimes can exempt, reduce with the existing related of another account or subscription or satisfy and pay based on the user.For example possibly give the for example right of retrieve electronic version automatically to the subscriber of the printed copy of newspaper.
In other cases, said association maybe be so not direct: can based on the account who sets up by user's employer or based on it to authorizing this user's right to use as all the catching of printing copy of subscriber's friend.
8.5,
Utilization is caught and is printed to substitute and xeroxs
Catch text, sign electronic original part and print this original paper perhaps is directed against traditional photomechanical printing with said certain a part of processing formation of catching this original paper that is associated a kind of alternative from paper document, it has many advantages:
Paper document need not be in same position with final printout, and need be in this place simultaneously in no instance
Can avoid handling wearing and tearing and the damage that document is caused, particularly for ancient, fragile and precious document by xeroxing
The quality of copy is high usually a lot
Which can preserve about document or documentation section by the record of copy the most continually
Can pay with a part to the copyright owner as said processing
Can forbid unwarranted copy.
8.6,
The precious original paper from the photo-offset copy location
When document is precious especially, such as under the situation of legal documents with historic significance or other Special Significance or document, people can be usually in many years the copy from these documents carry out work, the while original paper then is stored in safe position.
Described system can be coupled to the database of position of record original document (for example in the file warehouse), thus make to copy have usufructuary someone be easy to locate the original paper document that is filed.

The information processing technology
Optical character identification (OCR) technology is concentrating on the image that comprises a large amount of texts traditionally, for example from the image of the flat-bed scanner of catching full page.The OCR technology usually need be trained and proofreaied and correct so that produce useful text by the user in a large number.The OCR technology usually need have great processing power on the machine that carries out OCR, though and many systems all use dictionary, usually these systems of expectation operate based in fact unlimited vocabulary.
In described system, the traditional characteristic of all fronts can be improved.But technology as described herein (detecting and other technologies such as text identification, document identification, information) certainly utilizes typical OCR technology to implement.
Many problems of being discussed all map directly on other recognition technologies, particularly speech recognition.As mentioning in the 3.1st joint, can be through the processing that by the user text reading aloud is realized in the device of capturing audio catching from papery.Those skilled in the art will recognize that the principle of discussing about image, font and text fragments usually also is applied to audio samples, user speech model and phoneme here.
The acquisition equipment that is used for using with described system usually will be small-sized, portable and power is lower, perhaps is not to be manufactured into only to catch text.It not is to be ideally suited for the optical element of OCR or possibly to lack the optical element that helps OCR that acquisition equipment possibly have.
Acquisition equipment is once only to catch several words; And even not once to catch whole character in some implementations; But catch the dropping cut slice that passes text, thereby many such sections are sewn to the discernible signal that text can be therefrom inferred in formation together.Acquisition equipment also possibly have very limited processing power or storage capacity; Though therefore it can be handled with self carrying out all OCR in some instances; But many instances will depend on and possibly be connected to the stronger device of ability in the time of back, so that the conversion of signals of being caught is become text.At last; Acquisition equipment possibly have the very limited facility that is used for user interactions; Therefore many acquisition equipments possibly need and will postpone till afterwards to any request of user's input, perhaps on than the bigger degree of common now situation, operate under " best-guess " pattern.
In some instances, said system handles the information of being caught through following operation: at first identify the existence of the information of interest that will discern, such as text or voice; Extract characteristic, such as word, row, section, row or the like the position in one page, perhaps for the specific teller's among the crowd frequency range corresponding to the position of the information of interest in the information of being caught; And the characteristic of identification information of interest; Such as the text layout in the document that is appeared or corresponding to the sign of the Unicode character of the letter that is identified in the document that is appeared, so that the source of the sign image of being caught or above the image of being caught, generate and the show tags layer for example.Though can be for these processing of information and executing of any kind, following instance will be described these processing about the document that text based appeared.
9.1,
Sign and extraction
Sign is to confirm that the image of being caught comprises the processing of the possibility of text.Because acquisition equipment can constantly be caught image, therefore said system can confirm at first before attempting from the information of being caught, extracting text feature or discerning text whether the image of being caught comprises text.In other words, said system is " text is examined knowledge ", that is to say that it can determine whether that text exists at any time.
In case said system confirms to exist text, this system just can begin to extract processing.Said extraction processing ID goes out the position of text in catching.For instance, said extraction is handled and can be generated the border corresponding to word in the image of being caught and paragraph.
There is Several Factors may influence said sign and extraction processing.For instance; When analyzing text; Said system can identify with text in the various characteristics that are associated of stroke, such as lacking change color (the for example background and foreground color that relatively exists in the stroke), consistent width (level, vertical or whole two kinds of situation), the existence of straight flange, existence of smooth edges curve or the like in the existence of high-contrast edges, the stroke.As another instance; Said system can identify the periodicity or the repetition of the characteristic of the potential text in the image of being caught; Existence such as existence, baseline, the altitude line of stroke edge, level and/or vertical stroke, the perpendicular line that occupies leading position and the angle between the baseline, graphic character or graphic character subcomponent (bridge joint between the each several part of corner, curve, diagonal line, graphic character for example is such as the narrow stroke between the wide stroke in the calligraphy letter, serif, consistent line cap and mitered or the like).Said system can also utilize motion blur to identify the existence of text based on the existence of the bright and dark color band on the direction of motion, is with such as under the situation of extreme motion blur, dividing with prospect along the background of the horizontal text of manuscript from left to right.
Admissible additive factor comprises in the sign of text and during extracting:
OK
Graphic character perpendicular line in the delegation
Graphic character horizontal line in the delegation
Baseline
The graphic character in the delegation or the height of symbol
Horizontal space between graphic character, word and/or the stroke
Vertical space in the ranks
Edge and surplus
Density
Stroke is to background ratio
Interior and the density in the ranks of row
The graphic character sequence
N metagrammar (N-grams) (sequence of N consecutive word)
Word
Capitalization
Punctuate
Sentence (capitalization, punctuate, fullstop)
Paragraph
Title
Summary
Based on the adjacency of image
Legend
Frame, icon or the like
Text on the figure
Short text
The contrast higher, periodicity or the like than background image
Logo
Company/product/service name
The main business logo
From background description (for example oval border)
It will be understood to those of skill in the art that said system is in execution contexts sign with extract and can use any or all characteristic of front when being in any analysis rank.For instance, during identification process, said system can only depend on the number of the horizontal space between the graphic character, during extract handling, then depend between the horizontal space distance and with the image of being caught in the relation at edge.
Said system can also for example carry out sign based on following factor to non-text message and extract: the big zone with smooth gradient; Randomness (the for example unevenness of the length of the orientation of high-contrast position, high-contrast edges, high-contrast edges); The existence of face, health or buildings in the image of being caught, inconsistent size of line or connection component or the like.
9.2, text identification
Based on the positional information that is extracted, said system can attempt discerning text or the text feature in the image of being caught.For instance, said system can send to text the OCR assembly or generate signature (for example last shape letter in the text and/or the pattern of stretching letter down) based on the text feature that is identified.Before execution contexts identification, said system can be for example standardizes or standardizes text through all italics or bold text being converted to standard format.
Said text identification is handled and can be depended on several characteristics and discern the characteristic of text or generate the signature for the document that is appeared, such as text feature or the like on graphic character characteristic (for example enclosure space, vertical and horizontal strokes or the like), punctuate, capitalization, character space, row characteristic, paragraph characteristic, row characteristic, title characteristic, summary characteristic, key word/legend characteristic, logo features, the figure.In addition, the word characteristic can help text identification to handle, such as word space and density.For instance, said system can use and be printed on the information that the space correlation between the word on the document joins, such as the width in the distance between the space (level, vertical, quadrature or the like), space or the like.Said system can also merge to the knowledge about branch in the analysis.For instance, when knowing branch, said system can depend on the perpendicular alignmnet of word location, and when not knowing branch, said system can depend on the approximating sequence of relative word length.As another example, said system can use the information that is associated with character density, such as the relative density between the character (level, vertical, quadrature or the like), in groups character between relative density or absolute density information.Some characteristic possibly be constant for font, font size or the like, such as Points And lines symmetry the auto-correlation of point and/or line (for example in the graphic character, around).Said system can dynamically be chosen in the image of being caught to analyze which characteristic.For instance, under the situation that has optics and motion blur, said system can use the less aspect of the details of text, such as relative word width.In some instances; Said system can be through confirming unknown or rare n-gram is that noise or high signal message (misspelling, e-mail address, URL or the like) utilize unique n-gram, and this for example is based on the determinacy of the character that departs from common n-gram, the length that departs from, matching rules representation (for example for e-mail address and URL) or the like and realizes.
Text in the document that said system can use the document resource external that is appeared to discern to be appeared, such as about the approximate number purpose knowledge of the graphic character in the word, dictionary (for example word dictionary) frequently, grammer and punctuate rule, in a data bank, find the probability of specific word grammer and character grammer, the regular expression method that is used to mate each character string (such as e-mail address, URL or the like).In addition, said system can use the resource such as dns server, address book and telephone directory to verify the text that is identified, such as URL, e-mail address and telephone number.As another instance, said system can use the font matrix to help identification and verify each graphic character.Can compare the identification character of the unknown character of given font and same font, so as based on be reflected in the font matrix unknown character and the relation between the identification character help it is discerned.For instance, be similar to the combination of " c " and " l ", then can Unidentified " d " be identified as " d " based on " c " that discerned and " l " if the font matrix shows the representation class of " d ".
Said system identifies the document of the image of being caught, being described in the middle of can using the text discerned or the document of characteristic in the document information storehouse.The quantity of the information that is used to identify and type can change based on many factors, such as Doctype, data bank size, document content or the like.For instance, one 5 word in the image of being caught or the sequence of 6 words or the relative position in the space between word can identify the respective document in the relatively large data bank uniquely.In some instances, said system can adopt conversion table to confirm perhaps will identify the probability of a document uniquely about the information combination of special characteristic about the information of special characteristic.For instance, said conversion table can show, one 5 word sequence of word identifies the probability of a document 3 word sequences different with two uniquely, the last shapes letter of 2 row/time stretch letter mode or the like probability of identifying a document uniquely is identical in succession.In some instances, said system can accumulation or " stitching " be compared the combination picture that more likely identifies the document that is appeared of respective document uniquely so that for example generate with the image that each is caught separately together automatically with each image of being caught.
In some instances, said text identification is handled can influence information capture.For instance, lose Jiao or imperfect if text is identified as, then said system can regulate the focusing of the video camera of acquisition equipment and perhaps point out user's reorientation or regulate acquisition equipment.Below the various technology that said system can be used for discerning text will be described in further detail.
9.2.1,
" uncertain " OCR
The main new features of OCR in the described system are, inspection are present in as the one of which other places and can be with the fact of the image of the text of digital form retrieval.Therefore, always need accurately not transcribe text from the OCR engine.The OCR system can export the set or the matrix (comprising probability weight in some cases) that possibly mate, and it still can be used to search for digital original paper.
9.2.2,
Iteration OCR---guess, elimination ambiguity, guess
Can when handling, get in touch document index if carry out the device of identification, then can when the OCR processing is carried out, come this OCR processing is notified, thereby the high considerable accuracy of identification that gets is provided potentially through the content in document information storehouse.
Such connection also will allow device when capturing the text that is enough to the reference numbers source, to notify the user.
9.2.3,
Utilization is about the possible knowledge that appears
When said system had the knowledge that possibly print the aspect that appears about document (is italic such as the font printed words that in press use or page layout or which joint), this also can help identification to handle (4.1.1 joint).
9.2.4,
Font cache---on main frame, confirm font, download to client
Along with the candidate's source text that identifies in the document information storehouse, font or its can be played up and download to device to help identification.
9.2.5,
Auto-correlation and character side-play amount
Though the composition character of text fragments can be the most generally accepted mode that representative can be used as the text fragments of document signature; But other text representations also can be worked enough well; Thereby when attempting locating the text fragments in digital document and/or the database or when thereby the ambiguity that the elimination text fragments is represented becomes readable form, the actual text of said text fragments will need not be used.Other expressions of text fragments can provide actual text to represent the benefit that is lacked.For instance, and can be used to search for and/or rebuild text fragments and need not to take for other expressions of the text fragments of being caught of the optical character identification of entire segment different, the optical character identification of text fragments usually is easy to make mistakes.Such method possibly be more suitable for some device of being used for using with current system.
Those skilled in the art will recognize that, have the mode of many description text fragments outward appearances.This sign for text fragments can include, but is not limited to word length, relative word length, character height, character duration, character shape, character frequency, token frequency or the like.In some instances, the side-play amount between the text token of coupling (promptly the number between the token of centre adds 1) is used to characterize text fragments.
Traditional OCR uses the character in the text of attempting confirming to be scanned about the knowledge of font, letter configuration and shape.Instance of the present invention is different; The several different methods that its text that adopts utilization to appear itself helps identification to handle.These methods use character (or token) to come " identification each other ".A kind of mode that is called this oneself's identification is " template matches ", and it is similar to " convolution ".In order to carry out such oneself's identification, the copy of said system said text of horizontal slip on itself, and the matching area of mark text image.Previous template matches and convolution technique comprise multiple relevant technologies.These technology in order to tokenization and/or identification character/token will be collectively referred to as " auto-correlation " here, and this is because when coupling character/token, use text to carry out relevant with each ingredient of himself.
When carrying out auto-correlation, interested for the complete continuous zone of coupling.This situation takes place when character (or character group) covers other instances of identical characters (or character group).The complete continuous zone of coupling provides automatically the text token is changed into the composition token.Along with two parts of copies of text slide past each other, mark out zone that Perfect Matchings wherein takes place (be in the terrace cut slice all pixels all mate).When character/token and himself coupling, the horizontal extent of this coupling (the for example continuous compatible portion of text) is also mated.
Should be mentioned that; Need not confirm actual identity particular letter, numeral or symbol or its group of token image (promptly corresponding to) of each token in this stage, only need to confirm with the text of being caught in the side-play amount of appearance next time of identical token.The side-play amount numeral is the distance (token number) that next time occurs to identical token.If token is unique in text string, then side-play amount is zero (0).So the token side-play amount sequence that generates is the signature that can be used to identify the text of being caught.
In some instances, comparing (4.1.2 joint) for a determined token side-play amount of the token string of being caught and an index that electronic document repository is carried out index based on the token side-play amount of electronic document.In other instances, the token side-play amount of confirming for the token string of being caught is converted into text, and its more traditional index with the index that carries out based on the content of electronic document and to electronic document repository is compared.
As noted earlier, when catching when handling the audio samples comprise the said word that goes out, can be to token relevant treatment like the sound bite application class.
9.2.6,
Font/character " oneself's identification "
Traditional template matches OCR compares scan image and character picture storehouse.Compare for each font memory word matrix and image and institute's image stored of new scanning, so that find characters matched in fact.Till identifying correct font, said processing has initial delay usually.After this, OCR handles very fast relatively, and this is because most of documents all use identical font always.Therefore can be through comparing with the fontlib that identifies recently and successive image being converted to text.
Character shape in the most frequently used font is relevant.For instance, in most of fonts, letter " c " is visually relevant with letter " e ", and " t " and " f " also is so, or the like.Through utilizing the template of this pass series structure for the letter that is not scanned as yet, OCR handles and is enhanced.For instance; If the reader from paper document, capture have the font that before do not run into than the short text string; Thereby said system does not have the image of being caught image template set by comparison; Then said system can utilize possibly concern between the specific character to construct the font template base, although it does not run into all letters in the alphabet as yet.Said system can use the font template base of being constructed to discern the text of subsequent captured and the fontlib that further refinement is constructed subsequently.
9.2.7,
Send any unidentified content (comprising figure) to server
In the time can't being transcribed into the form that is suitable for being used in the searching disposal to the image machine; Can preserve said image itself for being used for possible manual transcription by the user afterwards, handle the some day afterwards when perhaps being used for can obtaining different resource in said system.
10,
The P commercial affairs
Make that by said system becoming possible many actions causes taking place certain business transaction.Phrase p commercial affairs are used to describe the business activity of initiating from paper through said system here.
10.1,
Sell document from its physics printing copy
When the user when document is caught text, can buy the document for this user provide with papery or electronic form.Can also be for the user provide relevant document, such as the document of in said paper document, quoting or otherwise mentioning, perhaps about the document of similar theme, perhaps from same author's document.
10.2,
Initiate or the sale of any other content of helping through paper
Can in several ways catching of text be associated with other business activities.The text of being caught possibly be in the catalogue that clearly is designed to merchandising, in this case, and said text will quite directly be associated (the 18.2nd joint) with the purchase of commodity.Said text also possibly be the part of advertisement, and in this case, the back is contingent to be the sale of the commodity of institute's advertisement.
In other cases, the user catches other texts, therefrom can infer its potential interest to business transaction.The reader of the novel collection in the particular country for example maybe be interested in spending holidays at that.Someone of comment who is reading a new car possibly just consider to buy this car.The user can catch the particular text fragment with as a result of providing for it under situation of certain commercial opportunity knowing, and perhaps this can be that it catches movable spinoff.
10.3,
Catch label, icon, sequence number, bar code on the commodity, thereby cause selling
Sometimes text or symbol are packed at commodity or its by actual print.Instance is sequence number or the product id that usually finds at the back side or the label on the bottom surface of electronics.Said system can buy the convenient manner of or many identical goodses through catching the text for the user provides a kind of.Can also handbook, support or repair service be provided for the user.
10.4,
Contextual advertisement
Except directly catching the text from advertisement, said system also allows a kind of new adline, and it not necessarily clearly is in the document that is appeared, but the content of still reading based on people.
10.4.1,
Based on catching situation and historical advertisement
In traditional paper publication thing, advertisement takies big quantity space usually with respect to the text of newspaper article, and can only be placed with the limited number advertisement around certain articles.In described system, can be associated advertisement with independent word or phrase, and can select according to user's concrete interest, wherein user's interest is through catching the text and possibly considering it and catch history and show.
Utilize described system, purchase might be associated with specific document printing and make the advertiser obtain significantly more feedback about the validity of its advertisement in specific printed publication.
10.4.2,
Based on user context and historical advertisement
The otherwise bulk information that said system can collect about user's situation uses (the 13rd joint) for himself; Estimation for user's geographic position is a good instance.Such data can also be used to the advertisement that the user of the system that is adjusted into provides.
10.5,
The model of compensation
Said system has realized some the new models to advertiser and marketeer's compensation.The publisher that comprises the document printing of advertisement can receive some incomes from the purchase that is derived from its document.No matter whether said advertisement exists with original printing form, this point can be set up; Said advertisement possibly added through the electronics mode by publisher, advertiser or a certain third party, and the user possibly subscribe to the source of this advertisement.
10.5.1,
Compensation based on popularity
Can disclose the popularity (the 14.2nd joint) of the specific part of publication for the analysis of the statistics that generates by said system.For example in newspaper, it possibly disclose the reader and watch specific webpage or time quantum that article spent, perhaps specific columnist's popularity attentively.In some cases, maybe suitable situation being author or publisher receives compensation based on reader's activity, rather than based on the more traditional tolerance such as writing number of words or the copy number issued.In the contract in future, but compare, can consider that its works becomes the author's (also referring to the 7.6th joint) about the frequent authority who reads of quilt of a certain theme according to different modes with the identical author who is seldom opened of copy number of the books and periodicals of its sale.
10.5.2,
Advertisement based on popularity
Decision about in document, advertising can also be made based on the statistics about the reader.Advertising space around most popular columnist can be sold with concessionary rate.After document is published, sometimes even can charge or compensate the advertiser based on coming about the knowledge of the received situation of said document.
10.6,
The marketing based on the life storehouse
" life storehouse " described in the 6.1st and 16.1 joints or to catch history can be about user's the interest and the extremely valuable information source of custom.Under the situation of considering suitable allowance and privacy concern, such data can be to user notification providing about kinds of goods or service.Even under the form of anonymity, collected statistics is still extremely useful.
10.7,
Sale/the information on date (but time spent) afterwards
Maybe not can when catching, provide advertisement and other business transaction chances for the user immediately.For instance, when the user is just reading a novel, possibly can't obtain to buy the chance of this novel sequel, but said system can, sequel provide this chance for the user when publishing.
The user can catch and the data of buying or other business transactions are relevant, but when carrying out said catching, also can select not initiate and/or accomplish said transaction.In some instances, be stored in user's the life storehouse, and these life storehouse clauses and subclauses can keep " enlivening " (promptly can implement with follow-up mutual like the interactive class that when carrying out said catching, can use) with catching relevant data.Therefore, the user can catch in comment sometime afterwards, and catches based on this alternatively and accomplish transaction.Because said system can follow the tracks of raw captured and when and where take place, therefore all involved each side can obtain suitable compensation in said transaction.For instance; When the user visited its life storehouse, from history, selects specificly to catch and from popup menu (its menu that provides alternatively in the time of can being similar to and catching or identical with said menu), selects " at these commodity of Amazon purchase " after six months, can provide compensation for the author who writes out said story (and the publisher that publishes this story) who appears at by the advertisement that the user therefrom catches data.
11,
Operating system and application integration
Operating system now (OS) and other software packages have many characteristics of using with described system of can advantageously being used to, and can make amendment to it so that better platform is provided for its use according to multiple mode.
11.1,
To catch and print relevant information merges in metadata and the retrieval
The database that is about to the new file system of appearance and is associated usually has the ability of storing the multinomial metadata that is associated with each file.Traditionally, this metadata has for example comprised the following: user ID, date created, Last modification and last use of having created this document.The file system of upgrading allows the extraneous information of storage such as key word, picture characteristics, document source and consumers' opinions, and this metadata can at random be expanded in some systems.Therefore, file system can be used to store and will be useful on the information of implementing current system.For instance, can print the date of given document for the last time by the file system storage, and can store about when utilizing described system to catch details from the text of the document from paper by whom.
Operating system also begins to merge the search engine facility that allows the user more easily to find local file.These facilities can advantageously be used by said system.This means the 3rd with 4 joints in the many and relevant notion of search discussed not only be applied to now based on the Internet and similar search engine, but also be applied to each personal computer.
In some cases, specific software application will also comprise the support to said system that is higher than and surpasses the facility that is provided by OS.
11.2,
OS for acquisition equipment supports
Along with the use of the acquisition equipment of mobile communications device that for example has integrated video camera and microphone and so on becomes more and more common; According to the support for this device being building up in the operating system with providing for the very identical mode of the support of mouse and printer, this is because the application of acquisition equipment extends beyond single software application with hope.This point is set up for other aspects of system operation equally.Below some instances will be discussed.In some instances, whole described system (or its core) is provided by OS (for example Windows, Windows Mobile, Linux, Max OS X, iPhone OS, Android or Symbian).In some instances, provided by application programming interfaces (API) for the support of said system, said application programming interfaces can be used by other software packages, comprising direct those software packages of the each side of enforcement native system.
11.2.1,
Support for OCR and other recognition technologies
Great majority are caught text from the document that is appeared method all needs certain identification software to come source data (the normally image of being caught or some words of saying) is construed to the text that is applicable to said system.Some OS comprise the support for voice or handwriting recognition, and are then not too common but OS comprises for the support of OCR, and this is because be limited to very little range of application usually for the use of OCR in the past.
Along with recognizer component becomes the part of OS, it can utilize other facilities that provided by OS better.Many systems for example comprise speed dictionary, grammatical analysis instrument, internationalization and localized facility; For example all these facilities can advantageously be used for its identification processing by described system, and this is particularly because it possibly is customized to word and the phrase that comprises that he will run into usually to the specific user.
If operating system comprises the full-text indexing facility, then these facilities can also be used to notice identification and handle, as described in the 9.3rd joint.
11.2.2,
For catching the action that to take
If catch and it is given to OS, then it can have the default-action that will take under for said proprietorial those situation of catching there not being other subsystems statements.An instance of default-action is to select for the user provides replacement, perhaps the data of being caught are submitted to OS in build search facility.
11.2.3,
OS has the default-action for particular document or Doctype
If found the digital source of the document that is appeared, then OS can have its when catching particular document or such document with the standard operation of taking.Use the potential processor who catches that can on OS, be registered as particular type with other subsystems, its mode is similar to by the ability of using its processing particular file types of declaration.
Can comprise that with the document that is appeared or with the flag data that is associated from catching of document the instruction that is directed against operating system is so that start application-specific, delivery applications independent variable, parameter or data or the like.
11.2.4,
Integrated attitude also is mapped in the standard operation
In the 12.1.3 joint, the use for " attitude " has been discussed, specific the moving of wherein utilizing acquisition equipment to make possibly represented standard operation, beginning and finishing such as the retrtieval zone.
This with for example utilize cursor key select one text filed in by the shift on the lower keyboard or utilize the roll action of document and so on of roller on the mouse similar.This type of of user moves enough standards, thereby can be made an explanation to it with the mode of wide in range system by the OS of acquisition equipment, and then guarantees consistent behavior.Hope to realize this point equally for other actions relevant with acquisition equipment.
11.2.5,
Setting is to the response of standard (and non-standard) icon/text printing menu item
In a comparable manner, when being hunted down, particular text or other symbol items can cause taking place standard operation, and OS can provide the selection for these standard operations.An instance possibly be that the text " [print] " of catching in any document will cause the portion of OS retrieval and printing the document to copy.OS can also provide a kind of and register this type of action and with itself and the specific mode that is associated of catching.
11.3,
System's graphic user interface (User interface)
In the assembly for the support of the activity of typically catching initiation
Most of software application are based on test pattern user interface (GUI) assembly that is provided by OS basically.
Use these assemblies to help to guarantee the consistent behavior on a plurality of software packages by the developer, for example in any text editing situation, press left cursor key and all should be moved to the left cursor, independently implement identical functions and need not each programmer.
When catching by the text of described system or during the promotional activities of other aspects, in these assemblies, also hoping to have similar consistance.Provide some instances below.
11.3.1,
Be used to find the interface of certain text content
A kind of typical use of said system can be a zone of being caught paper document by the user; And in the software package that can show it or edit, open the electronics homologue by said system, and make the text that said bag is rolled to and high bright demonstration scanned (12.2.1 joint).The first of this processing (promptly find and open electronic document) is provided by OS usually, and on each software package, is standard.But second portion (promptly locate the particular text section in the document and make said bag be rolled to and the said text of high bright demonstration) is as yet by standardization, and usually implemented by different way by each bag.Can strengthen the operation of this respect of said system greatly for the availability of the standard A PI of this function.
11.3.2,
Text is mutual
In case text chunk in location in document, said system possibly hope the text is carried out multiple operation.As an instance, the text around said system may ask, thus the user can cause system's visit to comprise the whole sentence or the paragraph of said several words for catching of several words.Likewise, this function can serviceably be provided by OS rather than in the software of each processing text, implement.
11.3.3, situation (ejection) menu
The certain operations that said system realized will need user feedback, and this can be optimally asks in the situation of the application of deal with data.In some instances, said system uses the application popup menu that is associated with the right button of on some text, clicking the mouse traditionally.Said system is inserted into extra option in such menu, and it is shown as the result of activity such as a part of catching paper document.
11.4,
The gateway/network interface
In the world of current networking day by day, many functions available on independent machine also can visit through network, and the function that is associated with described system is no exception.As an instance, in office environment, possibly print by other users' on the same enterprise network machine by many paper documents that a user receives.Receiving under the situation of suitable permission control, the system responses on computing machine in catch possibly inquire about those other machines maybe be to search corresponding to this document of catching.
11.5,
Document printing causes preserving
A very important factor in paper document and digital document integrated is to keep the information about the transformation between the two as much as possible.In some instances, OS keeps the simple record when printed by whom about any document.In certain embodiments, OS takes or multinomial other action using with said system it more is applicable to.The example comprises:
The numeral of each part document of preserve printing presents version together with the information about the source of its printing
Preservation possibly help to catch future the useful information subclass about printing edition of explanation, such as employed font and branch where
Preserve the version of the source document that is associated with any printed copies
Automatic index file and event memory are for searching for future when printing.
11.6,
My (print/catch) document
OS usually keeps having the file or the file of the particular category of special meaning.Through convention or design, user's document can for example be found in " my document " file.The File Open dialogue of standard can comprise the lists of documents of opening recently automatically.
In the OS that optimizes to using, can strengthen or strengthen said classification according to the alternant way of the hard-copies of considering user and stored file with described system.Classification such as " my document printing " or " my nearest reading documents " possibly serviceably identified and merged in its operation.
11.7,
OS rank mark hierarchy
Because the importance of said system normally is utilized in " mark " notion of discussing in the 5th joint and provides; Therefore obviously favourable will be the support that has in the following manner to this mark that is provided by OS, and said mode can be visited by multinomial application and OS itself for making it.In addition, can by OS based on himself about the document under its control with and the knowledge of the facility that can provide each mark layer is provided.
11.8,
The use of OS DRM facility
The operating system of more and more numbers is supported " digital rights management " of certain form: promptly according to controlling the ability for the use of particular data by specific user, software entity or machine granted entitlements.It for example can forbid unwarranted copy or distribution for particular document.
12,
User interface
If acquisition equipment is very accurate and self have a very strong processing power (such as mobile phone or PDA); Then the user interface of said system can be on the acquisition equipment fully; If perhaps acquisition equipment is intelligent relatively and be connected to PC through cable, then said user interface can be on the PC fully.In some cases, some function resides in each assembly.
Therefore, below description of each joint be indication about content that maybe be desired in the specific implementation mode, but it not necessarily all is suitable for for all implementations, and can make amendment through several modes.
12.1,
About acquisition equipment
For most of acquisition equipments, user's notice usually will be on device and paper when catching.So conform with very much the situation of expectation and be as the required any input of a part of catching processing and feedback not the needs user notice elsewhere (such as on computer screen) exceed necessary situation.
12.1.1,
Feedback on the acquisition equipment
Acquisition equipment can have multiple mode provides the feedback about particular condition to the user.The most significantly type is the direct vision (wherein acquisition equipment merges the demonstration fully of captured images or pilot lamp) and the sense of hearing (wherein acquisition equipment can send beep sound, ticktack or other sound).Important alternative comprises tactile feedback (wherein acquisition equipment can vibrate, drum or otherwise stimulate the user sense of touch) and projection feedback (wherein acquisition equipment shows state through any content that projection on paper shows from coloured luminous point to complicacy).
The important immediate feedback that can on acquisition equipment, provide comprises:
Move about the feedback-user who catches processing that acquisition equipment is too fast, angle is excessive or drift about too high or too lowly
The content that is enough under the situation that has coupling, find coupling---the operation for disconnection is extremely important quite as to definitely for enough contents-caught
Situation is known-located the source of text
Unique situation is known-located a unique source of text
Content availability-show that content freely can be used for the user and still needs cost
Usually the many user interactions that are associated with the subsequent stages of said system also can occur on the acquisition equipment, if acquisition equipment has the ability that for example is enough to show a part or whole documents.
12.1.2,
Control on the acquisition equipment
Except basic text was caught, acquisition equipment can provide multiple mode to supply the user that input is provided, such as button, rolling/slow-action wheel, touch sensitive surfaces and/or be used for the accelerometer that pick-up unit moves.The some of them mode allows when still holding acquisition equipment, to provide abundant more mutual set.
For instance, in response to capturing some texts, acquisition equipment provides the set that is made up of several parts of possible coupling documents for the user.The user use acquisition equipment to touch sensitive surfaces a from tabulation, to select.
12.1.3,
Attitude
The main cause that on paper, moves acquisition equipment is in order to catch text, but some move and can be detected and be used to show other user views by device.Moving like this is known as " attitude " here.
As an instance, the user can catch through several words before in from left to right motion once, catching and in from right to left motion once the several words in back show one bigger text filed.The user can also be through moving down the vertical range that several row show interested text to acquisition equipment on the page.Reverse between trapping period is once caught operation before possibly showing cancellation.
12.1.4,
The on-line behavior
Many aspects of said system can depend on the network connectivity; Said network connectivity perhaps is between each assembly (such as acquisition equipment) and wireless network of system, or connection and the form of Internet search and being connected of the external world to go to enterprise database.But this connectivity possibly not be always to exist, and so this occasion that will have the part of said system or all can be regarded as " off-line ".Hope that the permission system continues serviceably to operate in these cases.
Acquisition equipment can be used to catching text when out of touch with other parts of system.Very simple device can be stored and said image or the voice data that is associated of catching simply, is ideally to have to show its when captive timestamp.Each can be caught the remainder that uploads to said system when getting in touch and handle at this moment when next acquisition equipment has with system.Acquisition equipment can also be uploaded and catch other data that are associated, such as voice annotation or positional information.
Even more Jing Mi device maybe be under the situation of breaking off can be by the part of self executive system operation or all.The various technology that are used to improve its this ability of doing like this have been discussed in the 15.3rd joint.Situation usually is, can when off-line, carry out the part of desired action but is not whole.For instance, text can be discerned, but the connection that goes to based on the search engine of the Internet maybe be depended on the sign in source.Therefore, in some instances, the storage of said device has proceeded to the enough information of which kind of degree about each operation, continues efficiently when recovering to connect for the remainder of system.
The operation of said system generally will be benefited from available immediately connectivity, but have such certain situation, and promptly wherein carrying out several, to catch and subsequently it is handled as one batch possibly be favourable.For instance, as following in the 13rd joint, discuss, other that made in the approximately uniform time by the user through inspection are caught and can be strengthened the sign for specific source of catching greatly.Therein the scene feedback is offered in user's the system, said system can only use catching of past when handling current catching.If but said catching is a collection of one of them of being stored when the off-line by said device, then said system is in that carry out can considering when it is analyzed can be from catching and in the early time any data of catching acquisition afterwards.
12.2,
About host apparatus
Acquisition equipment can communicate with certain other devices (such as PC) so that carry out many functions of said system, more detailed mutual comprising with the user.
12.2.1,
In response to the activity of catching execution
When host apparatus receives when catching, it can initiate multiple activity.Be below located with said catch the electronics homologue document that is associated and the position in the document after by said system carry out maybe movable incomplete tabulation.
Can be stored in the details of catching in user's the history.(the 6.1st joint)
Can store or the remote location search file from this locality.(the 8th joint)
Can upgrade metadata and other records with the document associated operating system.(the 11.1st joint)
Can check that the mark that is associated with document is so that confirm ensuing associative operation.(the 5th joint)
Software application can be started so that document is edited, checked or other operations.Can depend on content that source document is perhaps caught or a certain other aspects of catching for the selection of using.(11.2.2,11.2.3 joint)
Said application can be rolled to, high bright demonstration, the insertion point moved to or otherwise show catch position.(the 11.3rd joint)
Can revise the exact boundary of the text of being caught, so that for example select to center on whole word, sentence or the paragraph of the text of being caught.(11.3.2 joint)
Can provide the text copy of will be caught to the user and carry out other standard operation systems or specific to the option of the operation of using to clipbook or to it
Can be associated note and document or the text of being caught.These notes can perhaps can be (for example under the situation of the voice annotation that is associated with the image of being caught) of catching not long ago from instant user's input.(the 19.4th joint)
Can check mark so as to confirm one future possible operational set select for the user.
12.2.2,
The situation popup menu
The suitable action of being taked by system will be conspicuous sometimes, but need be made a choice by the user sometimes.A kind of good mode of doing like this is to appear at " popup menu " or so-called " situation menu " on the display of acquisition equipment through using near content.(referring to the 11.3.3 joint).In some instances, acquisition equipment projects to popup menu on the paper document.The user can utilize the classic method such as keyboard and mouse from such menu, to select, perhaps through using control (12.1.2 joint), the attitude (12.1.3 joint) on the acquisition equipment or selecting from said menu through utilizing acquisition equipment and graphoscope to carry out alternately (12.2.4 joint).In some instances, can be used as popup menu that the result that catches occurs and comprise that representative do not make the default item of the action that (if for example the user ignores this menu and carries out another time and catch) takes place under the situation of response the user.
12.2.3,
About eliminating the feedback of ambiguity
When the user begins to catch text, several parts of documents or other text positions that will have said text to mate at first.Along with capturing more text and considering other factors (the 13rd joint), the number of position candidate will reduce, till identifying physical location, perhaps till can not further eliminating ambiguity under the situation that is not having the user to import.In some instances, said system provides real-time demonstration for document that is found or the position form of tabulation, thumbnail image or text fragments (for example with), and continues to make that along with catching the element number in this demonstration reduces on number.In some instances, said system shows the thumbnail of all candidate documents, and its probability as correct match is depended in the size of wherein said thumbnail or position.
Identify far and away when catching when clear and definite, for example can utilize audible feedback to come to stress this fact to the user.
Sometimes the text of being caught will appear in many documents, and will be identified as one section speech.Said system will show this point on screen, for example become group through each sets of documentation that will comprise the quoted passage of being quoted around original source document.
12.2.4,
From screen capture
Some acquisition equipment possibly can be caught the text that is presented on screen and the paper.Correspondingly, the document that term appeared is used to here show that being printed onto on the paper is not only appearance form, and when text was displayed on the electronic console, catching text or symbol can be valuable equally for the use of said system.
Possibly need the user and the computer screen of described system to carry out alternately from multiple other reason, so that select from an option list.Other joints have been described physics control (12.1.2 joint) or attitude (12.1.3 joint) on the acquisition equipment with as input method, even it also possibly be easily from display equipment capturing information that replacement input method such as keyboard or mouse is associated the time.
In some instances, acquisition equipment can sense its on screen the position and need not to handle the text of being caught, this possibly realize by means of special hardware on the computing machine or software.
13,
Situation is explained
A very important aspect of described system is except also using other factors to help identify employed document for simply the catching of text string.Catch an amount of text and usually can identify document uniquely, but will identify several parts of candidate documents in many cases.A solution is to point out the user source of the information that affirmation is caught, but a kind of preferred alternative is to utilize other factors to narrow automatically possibility.Such side information can significantly reduce required amount of text of catching, and/or improve reliability and the speed can identify the position in the electronics homologue.This extra material is known as " situation ", and in the 4.2.2 joint, has done concise and to the point discussion.To carry out darker consideration to it now.
13.1,
System and the text of being caught
The possible most important instance of this information is user's the history of catching.
Highly possible situation be any given catch from the preceding identical document or of once catching from the document that is associated, especially at preceding once catch under the situation about occurring in nearest a few minutes (6.1.2 joint) especially like this.On the contrary, between catching for twice, change has taken place if said system detects font, then situation more likely is that the two is from different documents.
In addition usefully the user catch history and reading habit for a long time.These also can be used to develop user's interest and related model.
13.2,
User's real world situation
Another instance of useful situation is user's geographic position.The user who for example is in Paris compares more likely with reading Seattle Times and is reading Le Monde.Therefore, the timing of the printed copy of document, size and geographic distribution maybe be extremely important, and possibly from system operation, infer to a certain extent.
For example for reading one type publication and the user who on the lunchtime or the train of going home, reads dissimilar publications on the road that always is on duty, one day time also possibly be correlated with.
13.3,
Relevant digital situation
The user also can be useful designator to the use of electronic document (comprising those electronic documents of searching for or retrieve through more traditional mode) in the recent period.
In some cases, such as on enterprise network, can serviceably consider other factors:
Is which document printed in the recent period?
Is which document modified on corporate file server in the recent period?
Is which document sent out through Email in the recent period?
All these instances are hinting that all the user is more likely at the hard-copies of reading these documents.Relative therewith, if the thesaurus that document resides in wherein can confirm that the document is never printed or is sent to it and possibly printed Anywhere at this place, then can in any search that is derived from paper, remove the document safely.
13.4,
Other statistics---overall situation
The 14th joint has been contained the analysis of the data stream that obtains from the search based on paper; But should be mentioned that here all be the instance that can be of value to the other factor of searching disposal about document for the statistics of other readers' popularity, about the statistics of the timing of this popularity and about the statistics of captive documentation section the most continually.Said system is the possibility that the world of paper has brought the page ordering of Google type.
Use some other implementation of situation also to save for search engine referring to 4.2.2.
14,
Data-flow analysis
Use said system also to generate very valuable data stream as spinoff.This data stream is when to read and so on record for the user, and is the record that it is found what valuable especially content in the things of being read in many cases.Never really can be used for paper document before such data.
In the 6.1st joint, some modes that these data can be used for the user of said system and said system have been described.This joint concentrates on its purposes in other respects.Certainly all should consider basic privacy concern for any distribution of the relevant data of the content of reading with people, but the problem such as keeping the data anonymity is known in those skilled in the art.
14.1,
Document tracking
When system knew any given user and reading which document, whom it can also infer was being read any given document.This just allows to follow the tracks of document through tissue, when is reading the document so that whom allows for example to analyze, and how wide its scope of being distributed have, and how long the time that this distribution spent has, and who has seen current version and other people are from expired copy work.
For publication document,, but remain possible for the analysis of readership's distribution for each tracking difficulty more of copy separately with wider distribution.
14.2,
Read ordering---the popularity of document and subregion
Just catching under its interested especially text or other data conditions the user, said system can infer the popularity of the particular sub-area of particular document and these documents.This has just formed for valuable input of said system itself (4.2.2 joint) and the important information source (the 7.6th joint, the 10.5th joint) that is used for author, publisher and advertiser.These data also are useful in being integrated into search engine and search index the time, for example are used to help the Search Results from the inquiry of the document that is appeared is sorted, and/or be used to help the tradition inquiry to being keyed in web browser to sort.
14.3,
Analysis for the user---set up profile
Reading and so on the interest and movable quite detailed model that the user can create in the knowledge system that makes about the user.This possibly be useful on abstract statistical basis (35% the user who buys this newspaper also reads this author's a nearest book), but it can also allow to carry out with the individual user that other are mutual, as following discuss.
14.3.1,
Social networks
Instance be a user with have a related interests other people link to each other.Said other people possibly be the people that this user has known.Said system can inquire to a college professor: " you know that you have just also read this piece article the colleague of XYZ university? " Said system can be to a user's query: " you want with your residence near equally to read other people of " Jane Eyre " related? " Such association can be the basis that forms bookclub and similar social structure automatically, no matter be in physical world or on line.
14.3.2,
The marketing
The 10.6th joint has been mentioned the idea of coming to provide for the individual user products & services alternately based on itself and system.Current online bookman for example usually based on it previous and this bookman come alternately make recommendation for the user.When such recommendation based on actual books and periodicals mutual the time, they become much useful.
14.4,
The otherwise marketing based on data stream
We discussed said system can influence those and publish documents, those advertisements of doing through document and some modes (the 10th joint) of other sale of initiating from paper.Some business activity possibly still not influenced by it still may with paper document is directly mutual fully.For instance, spend the knowledge that to spend the time on the finance and economics version more than them in the time on the sports page of newspaper of reading may be interested for just wanting to set up someone of gymnasium about the people in the community.
14.5,
Can captive data type
Except the statistics of being discussed (when and where whom reads which part of which document such as), what possibility was interesting is the actual content of checking the text of being caught, and no matter whether said document is positioned.
In many cases, the user will be not only and catch some texts, but will make and as a result of cause taking place certain action.It for example possibly popularized and introduced the document to the acquaintance with Email.Even under situation not, think that about someone it also is very useful being worth sending with Email the knowledge of said document about the information of said user or Email recipient's identity.
Except being used to of being discussed infers that in some cases, the user will be through specifying grading show said value clearly for it the whole bag of tricks of value of particular document or text chunk.
At last, when known specific user gathered group of formation, for example when known its was the employee of specific company, the statistics of this group of being assembled can be used to infer the importance of particular document to this group.This point be applicable to according to about document, catch, group that user's or the like data are identified through machine sort technology (such as Bayesian statistics, classification, k nearest-neighbor (k-nn), svd (SVD) or the like).

The characteristic of image capturing
Below we will consider in acquisition equipment, possibly conform with especially some characteristics of expectation.
15.4.1,
Location and optical device flexibly easily
Paper continues welcome one of them reason and is that it all is being easy to use under many situation widely, and computing machine will be impracticable or inconvenient under these situation for example.The intention catch user and paper mutual very most device so should be easy to use similarly.Past is not this situation for scanner; Even minimum handheld apparatus also is not easy to use to a certain extent.Those scanners that are designed to contact with paper must be held to become accurate angle with paper, and very carefully move along the text size that will scan.This is an acceptable when the business report of scanning on the desk, but when waiting for train from novel the situation of scanning phrase next be unpractical.The acquisition equipment of operating at a distance of certain distance with paper based on video camera can all be useful similarly in many cases.
Some instances of said system use the scanner that scans in contact with paper, and its replacement lens use the image conduit that has a branch of optical fiber to come from the page to the optical sensor arrangement transmitted image.Such device can be shaped as and allow its position with nature to be held; For example in some instances, the part that contacts with the page is a wedge shape, thereby allows user's hand on the page, to move more naturally, and its move mode is similar to the use e-Pointer.Said image conduit directly contacts with paper or is close to it, and can have interchangeable clear tip, and it can protect said image conduit to avoid possible damage.As in the 12.2.4 joint, being mentioned, said scanner can be used to scan from screen and from paper, and the material at said tip can be selected to reduction causes damage to such display possibility.
At last; Some instances of said device will provide feedback to the user during catching processing, it will be used up through making, sound or tactile feedback show this user when acquisition equipment move too fastly, cross slowly, too inhomogeneous or catching and drifting about too high or too lowly on the row.
15.5,
Security, identity, authentication, individualized and charging
As described in the 6th joint, acquisition equipment can be formed for the sign of safe transaction, purchase and a pith of mandate and many other operations.Therefore except for such the role's circuitry needed and software, said acquisition equipment can also merge can make its safer various hardware characteristics, perhaps keys in the keypad of PIN thereon such as intellignet card fetch, RFID.
Acquisition equipment can also comprise that various biometric sensors are to help identifying user.Under the situation of the acquisition equipment with image capture capabilities, for example video camera can also read fingerprint.For voice recorder, can use user's voice mode.
15.6,
Device is related
In some instances, acquisition equipment can form with other near install related so that improve himself or near said function of installing other.In certain embodiments, the display of PC or phone provided the additional feedback about its operation near acquisition equipment for example utilized and uses, and perhaps used its network connectivity.On the other hand, the role that said device can be used as security and identity device operates, so that the operation that authentication is carried out by other devices.Perhaps it can form association simply so that serve as the peripheral hardware of this device.
An interesting aspect of this association is that it can utilize the capture facilities of said device to initiate and authentication.For instance, hope can use the capture facilities of said device to catch code or symbol on the specific region that is presented at this terminal screen to the user that public computer terminal security ground identifies himself, thus and enforcement key transmission.Can utilize by voice recording device picked up audio signals and carry out similar processing.
15.7,
Integrated with other devices
In some instances, the function of acquisition equipment is integrated in a certain other devices that have been in use.Said integrating device possibly can be shared power supply, data capture and storage capacity and network interface.Like this integrated can be simply for convenience, in order to reduce cost or in other cases disabled function to be carried out in order to realize.
Some instances of the device of integrated capturing function comprise therein:
Existing peripheral hardware is such as mouse, stylus, USB " web camera " video camera, Bluetooth
TMHeadphone or telepilot;
Another processing/memory storage is such as PDA, MP3 player, voice recorder or digital code camera;
The article that other usually carry or usually wear, only for convenience for the purpose of---wrist-watch, jewelry, glasses, cap, pen, an automobile key are buckled; Or the like.

The individual uses
16.1,
The life storehouse
Life storehouse (also referring to 6.1.1 joint) is the digital archives of subscriber's any important documents of wanting to preserve, and is an example collection of the service of this system.Important books and periodicals, magazine article, newspaper cutting or the like can be stored in the life storehouse according to digital form.In addition, can also be along with document storing subscriber's note, suggestion and mark.Can visit the life storehouse through the Internet and WWW.
Said system is created and managerial life database documents archives for the subscriber.The subscriber shows through the information of catching from document which document storing this subscriber hopes in its life storehouse, perhaps to show and should add particular document in this subscriber's the life storehouse to said system through other modes.The information of being caught still also can be bar code or other codes of sign document normally from the text of document.Said system accepts said code and uses said code to come the identification sources document.After identifying document, said system can copy the portion of the document in the life storehouse that is stored in the user or storage goes to the link that can obtain the source of said document at this place.
An instance of life storehouse system can check whether the subscriber is granted access to electronic copy.For instance; If the reader from New York Times (NYT) thus the portion copy of one piece of article catch text or identifier will add this article in this reader's the life storehouse, then said life storehouse system will verify whether said reader has subscribed to the online version of NYT to NYT; If then this reader obtains to be stored in the portion copy of the said article among its life storehouse account; If not, then the said document of sign and about the information stores how to order in its life storehouse account.
In some instances, said system keeps subscriber's profile for each subscriber, and it comprises access privileges information.Can come the Edit Document visit information according to several modes, wherein two kinds are: 1) subscriber provides document access information together with its account name and password or the like to life storehouse system; Perhaps 2) life storehouse ISP utilizes subscriber information to inquire about to publisher, and if life storehouse subscriber is authorized to visit said material then publisher makes response through providing for the visit of electronic copy.If life storehouse subscriber is not authorized to have the electronic copy of document, then publisher provides a price to life storehouse ISP, and said ISP provides the option of buying electronic document for client subsequently.If like this, the storehouse ISP or directly pay and chargeing to life storehouse client afterwards of then living to publisher, the storehouse ISP that perhaps lives charges to buy to client's credit card immediately.Life storehouse ISP will obtain the certain percentage or the less fixed expense of purchasing price for promoting said transaction.
Said system can have personal library and/or this subscriber that document is archived in the subscriber in any other storehouse of archives privilege to it.For instance, along with the user catches text from document printing, life storehouse system can identify document and the electronics homologue thereof that is appeared.After identifying source document, life storehouse system possibly be recorded in the information about source document in user's the personal library and be recorded in the subscriber to be had in the group storehouse of archives privilege it.The group storehouse is the cooperation archives such as repositories of documents, and it is used for: the group of on a project, working together, an academic researcher group, group's web blog or the like.
Can come the regular organization activity storehouse according to many modes: according to the time order and function order; Pass through theme; Interest rank through the subscriber; Type (newspaper, books and periodicals, magazine, technical article or the like) through publication; Read wherein; When read, through ISBN, perhaps through Dewey decade or the like.In a kind of alternative, how said system can classify to come learning classification to identical document based on other subscribers.Said system can advise classification or be the automatic classifying documents of user to the user.
In each instance, can directly be inserted into note in the document or can hold it in the independent file.For instance, when the subscriber caught text from newspaper article, said article was archived in text that its life wherein caught in storehouse by the bright demonstration of height.Replacedly, said article is archived in its life storehouse (thereby keeping filed document not to be modified) together with the comment file that is associated.The instance of said system can be preserved the copy of source document in each subscriber's storehouse, in the master library that many subscribers can visit, preserve copy, perhaps is linked to the copy of being held by publisher.
In some instances, the user is only stored to the modification (for example high bright demonstration or the like) of document and the link that goes to the online version of (being stored in other places) said document in the life storehouse.Afterwards during search file, said system or subscriber merge said change and document the subscriber.
If note is stored in the independent file, then source document and comment file be provided for subscriber and subscriber with their combinations to create document through revising.Replacedly, said system made up said two files before it being offered the subscriber.In another kind of alternative, comment file is the covering to document files, and can be covered on the document by the software in subscriber's computing machine.
The subscriber of life storehouse service pays monthly fee so that make said system keep this subscriber's archives.Replacedly, the subscriber is for each part document payment small charge (for example micropayments) that is stored in the archives.Replacedly, the subscriber pays to visit this subscriber's archives based on each interview expenses.Replacedly, the subscriber can edit the storehouse and based on allowing other people to visit said material/note with life storehouse ISP and copyright owner's income Share Model.Replacedly, life storehouse ISP receives the paying (with the income Share Model of publisher, the storehouse ISP that wherein lives obtains the central portion of income of publisher) from publisher when living storehouse subscriber's subscription.
In some instances, life storehouse ISP serves as the intermediary between subscriber and the copyright owner's (perhaps copyright owner's procurator such as copyright settlement center, is called CCC again), so that promote charging and payment for the material that receives copyright protection.Life storehouse ISP uses subscriber's charge information and other user account informations that this intermediary sevices are provided.In fact, life storehouse ISP utilizes the relation that is pre-existing in the subscriber to realize representing the subscriber to buy to receive the material of copyright protection.
In some instances, life storehouse system can store the summary from document.For instance, when the subscriber when paper document is caught text, take passages and center on the zone around the text of being caught and place it in the life storehouse, rather than entire document is filed in the life storehouse.This is particularly advantageous when document is longer because keep the situation of raw captured can prevent the subscriber again reading documents to find interested part.The hyperlink and summary material that certainly, can comprise the whole electronics homologue that goes to paper document.
In some instances; Said system also about the information stores of document in the life storehouse, such as author, publication autograph, publication date, publisher, copyright owner (perhaps copyright owner's accredited procurator), ISBN, go to the public note of document link, read ordering or the like.About in the middle of this additional information of document some are forms of paper document metadata.The third party can create public comment file so that visited by the people except himself (such as general public).Going to the third party is favourable about the link of the notes and commentary of document, and this is can strengthen the understanding of subscriber to document because read other users' comment file.
In some instances, said system files material through classification.This characteristic allows life storehouse subscriber's quick storage to be directed against the electronics homologue of whole one type of paper document and need not to visit each part paper document.For instance, when the subscriber caught some texts from the portion copy of national geography magazine, said system provided the option that all back numbers of national geography are filed for the subscriber.If the subscriber selects to file all back numbers, whether the storehouse ISP that then lives will be authorized to do so subsequently to this subscriber of national geography association validates.If not, the storehouse ISP that then lives can facilitate the right of buying filing national geography magazine intersection between two parties.
16.2,
Life conservator
A kind of modification or the enhancing of life storehouse notion are " life conservators ", and the text that the utilization of wherein said system is caught by the user is inferred other the movable more information about the user.Catch menu, catch program, catch timetable in specific railway station and perhaps catch article and allow said system to make from particular restaurant about user's the position and the deduction of social activities from local newspaper from the performance of specific theater; And can construct automatic diary for it, for example as a website.The user can edit and revise said diary, add the for example additional materials of photo and so on, and check the project of being caught in addition once more certainly.

17.1,
Children's books and periodicals
Obtain system through a character learning and monitor the mutual of children and paper document (such as a book), the particular instance set that system has adopted native system is obtained in said character learning.Children use with character learning and obtain the acquisition equipment that other elements in the system communicate.Except acquisition equipment, character learning is obtained system and is also comprised display and loudspeaker and the database that can be visited by acquisition equipment.When children saw the unknown word in the book, these children utilized acquisition equipment that it is caught.In an example, character learning is obtained system the text and the resource in its database of being caught is compared so that identify this word.Said database comprises dictionary, dictionary and/or multimedia file (for example sound, figure or the like).After identifying said word, said system uses loudspeaker to children pronounce this word and definition thereof.In another example, obtain system by character learning and on display, show word and definition thereof.Can also be through display and speakers broadcast multimedia file about the word of being caught.For instance, caught " bear " word, possibly pronounce " bear " word and on display, play short-sighted frequency of then said system about bear if read the children of " Goldilocks and three bears ".In this way, children learn this word of writing of pronunciation, and what the implication of teaching its this word with visual manner through multimedia presentation is.
System is obtained in character learning provides the instant sense of hearing and/or visual information so that strengthen learning process.Children use this side information to come to obtain fast understanding more deeply for written material.Said system can be used to instruction and begin to learn the reader and read, and obtains more large vocabulary or the like to help children.This system for children provide about its information of unfamiliar word, the information that will know the word of its more information about child wants perhaps is provided.
17.2,
Character learning is obtained
In some instances, said system compiles individual dictionary.If that the reader sees is new, interested word or word particularly useful or trouble, then the reader can be saved in computer documents with this word (together with its definition).This computer documents becomes reader's individualized dictionary.The size of this dictionary is usually less than general dictionary, thus the device that can be downloaded to movement station or be associated, even and also available when said system can't visit immediately.In some instances, individual dictionary entry comprises in order to audio file that helps correct word pronunciation and the information that identifies the paper document of therefrom catching this word.
In some instances, the spelling and the vocabulary test of customization created by said system for the student.For instance, when the students ' reading operation, this student can utilize acquisition equipment to catch unfamiliar word.The tabulation of said system storage all words that the student caught.Said system is afterwards in the spelling/vocabulary test (perhaps the printer that be associated on print such test) of management on the monitor that is associated for student's customization.
17.3,
Music teaching
Note on the music staff is arranged the letter layout that is similar in delegation's text.Acquisition equipment can be used to catch music symbol; And said works of catching have therefrom taken place to the similar processing of the search of the database of known musical works with allowing to identify in structure, can retrieve, play these works subsequently perhaps with its basis as certain other actions.
17.4,
Detect and plagiarize
The teacher can utilize said system to detect and plagiarize or the checking source, and this is through from student's article, catching text and the text of being caught being submitted to said system realize.For instance, the part of said quoted passage can be caught really in the quoted passage in the hope checking student article from the teacher in the source that this student quoted, and the autograph of the document that is gone out by said system banner and the autograph of the document that this student is quoted are compared.Likewise, whether said system can use to catch from the text of the operation of submitting to as student's original works and disclose said text and instead copy.
17.5,
The textbook that strengthens
In some instances, from academic textbook, catch text can student or teacher be linked to more detailed explanation, other exercise, about the student and the teacher of material discuss, the related example of the examination problem in past, about the other reading of theme, about record of the speech of theme or the like.(also referring to the 7.1st joint).
17.6,
Language learning
In some instances, said system is used to teach foreign language.For example catching a Spanish word possibly cause with this word of Spanish reading aloud together with reading its definition in English.
Said system provides the instant sense of hearing and/or visual information so that strengthen the newspeak acquisition process.The reader utilizes this side information to come to obtain fast understanding more deeply for material.Said system can be used to instruct beginning student to read foreign language, helps the student to obtain more large vocabulary or the like.Said system provides the information about the unfamiliar foreign language word of reader, and the information of wanting to obtain the foreign language word of its more information about the reader perhaps is provided.When catching a kind of text of language, acquisition equipment can show the text of being caught with the another kind of language that the user more is familiar with.As another instance; Acquisition equipment can show the text of being caught as it occurs in document, but allow the user for example through on the touch-screen of acquisition equipment, rap its institute be unfamiliar with or the unknown particular word come optionally to translate and show said word.Said translation can be carried out by acquisition equipment, perhaps is sent to another system to translate.
Reader by language skill system monitoring and paper document (such as newspaper or books and periodicals) is mutual.The reader has the acquisition equipment that communicates with said language skill system.In some instances, the language skill system comprises display and loudspeaker and can be by the database of acquisition equipment visit.When the reader saw the unknown word in the article, this reader utilized acquisition equipment that it is caught.Said database comprises foreign language dictionary, dictionary and/or multimedia file (sound, figure or the like).In an example, said system compares the resource in the text of being caught and its database so that identify the word of being caught.After identifying said word, said system uses loudspeaker to reader pronounce this word and definition thereof.In some instances, said word and define the two and all be displayed on the display.Can also be through display and the multimedia file of speakers broadcast about the grammer main points relevant with the word of being caught.For instance, if capture " saying (to speak) " word, the short audio montage of the correct Spanish pronunciation of demonstration play in then said system " hablar " word that can pronounce, and show the complete list of the various distortion of " hablar ".In this manner, the student learns the written word of pronunciation, through the spelling of multimedia presentation with its this word of visual manner church, and makes it learn how verb to be out of shape.Said system can also provide the grammer main points together with the correct use of common phrase about " hablar ".
In some instances, the user catches word or phrase from the document that is appeared under a kind of language different with this user's mother tongue (perhaps user know goodish certain other language).In some instances, the tabulation of the process prioritization of " preferably " language of the said maintenance user of system.The electronics homologue of the document that said system banner appeared, and confirm the said position that is captured in the document.Said system also identifies the second electronics homologue of the said document of the wherein a kind of Preferred Language that is translated into the user, and the position in the document after definite and the said corresponding translation in position that is captured in the original document.When accurately not knowing corresponding position, said system banner comprises the zonule (for example paragraph) of the relevant position of the position of being caught.Give the user position after the corresponding translation subsequently.So just for the user provides the accurate translation for the specific use of the position of being caught, comprising any slang or other usages that usually are difficult to accurately translate based on word-for-word.

The collection research material
The user who is studying specific proposition may run into printing with screen on the two the material of all kinds, it may want in a certain Profile, these stores records to be become relevant with said proposition.Said system will make it possible to as in any material, catching the result of phrase and automatically perform said processing, and can create and be suitable for being inserted into the bibliography about in the publication of said theme.
18,
Commercial application
It is obvious that, almost any processing of being discussed in the document all can be become business activity, but here we concentrate on several tangible income streams.
18.1,
Search and index based on expense
Traditional internet search engine provides the free search for electronic document usually, and for the content provider way that its content is included in the index also is free of charge.In some instances, the operation of this system of said systems incorporate and use provide for user's charge and/or for search engine and/or content provider's paying.
In some instances, the subscriber of system service is for the search defrayment of catching that is derived from paper document.For instance, the stock broker possibly read one piece of Wall Street Journal article about the new product that is provided by X company.Through the title and the agreement payment necessary fee of from paper document, catching X company, this stock broker uses said system to search for special use or proprietary database obtains the high value information about the said firm, such as analyst's report.Said system can also make arrangement having most possibly the priority index of the document of being read with the paper form, this for example be through all newspapers of guaranteeing to publish at specific one day thereon during the city all by index and available.
The content provider can defrayment so that be associated with specific project the search inquiry of submitting to from paper document.For instance, in an example, most preferred content provider selects based on the additional situation (said situation should be that the content provider has paid certain expense so that in the results list, move up in the situation) about the supplier in said system.In fact, the search supplier is just based on regulating the paper document Search Results with content provider's the financial arrangement that is pre-existing in.Also referring in the 5.2nd joint to the description of key word and key phrase.
Should be limited in the visit for certain content under specific crowd (such as client or employee's) the situation, such content can receive firewall protection, thereby and can not be retrieved by the third party usually.But the content provider possibly be desirable to provide the index for protected content.In this case, the content provider can pay to the ISP, so that content provider's index is offered system subscriber.For instance, lawyer's office can carry out index to all documents of client.Said document is stored in the fire wall rear of said lawyer's office.But lawyer's office hopes that its employee and client can pass through the acquisition equipment access document; Therefore it provides index (perhaps pointing to the pointer of said index) to the ISP, said ISP then the employee of said lawyer's office or client for ratification acquisition equipment catch search item the time search for the index of this lawyer's office.Said lawyer's office can provide an employee and/or customer list so that realize this function to ISP's system, and perhaps said system can be through inquiring about the authentication-access right to this lawyer's office before the index of search lawyer's office.Should be mentioned that in the instance in front that the index that is provided by lawyer's office only is the index of this client's document, rather than the index of all documents at said lawyer's office place.Therefore, the ISP can be only to authorize for this lawyer's office to the client of lawyer's office be the right to use of the document of said client's index.
Can obtain at least two independent income streams from the search that is derived from paper document: an income stream is from function of search, and another is from content delivery functionality.The function of search income can always be subscribed to from user's paying and produced, but also can produce about each search charge.Content is sent income can share (certain percentage that the ISP can obtain to sell is perhaps for the fixed expense of sending each time (such as micropayments)) with content provider or copyright owner; But also can produce through " introduction " model; Wherein said system obtains expense or number percent for each part commodity that the subscriber orders and sent by this system or contribute to some extent from line directory, and no matter whether the ISP facilitates said transaction between two parties.In some instances, the system service supplier obtains income for the subscriber from all purchases that the content provider carries out, and this or any follow-up time in a certain predetermined amount of time or when buying a product that has identified are realized.
