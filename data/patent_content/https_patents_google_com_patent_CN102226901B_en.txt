Technical field
The present invention relates to the information retrieval system of a kind of document produce index for the Large Scale Corpus to such as internet (Internet), search and classification.
Background technology
The so-called search engine of information retrieval system, nowadays they are a kind of for finding the basic tool of information such as extensive, the diversified and ever-increasing corpus of internet.In general, search engine creates index so that document (or " page ") is relevant to the individual malapropism existing in each document.Response one inquiry that contains multiple queries item carrys out searching document, and this is normally based on existing in the literature the query term of some to realize.According to other statistical measures such as the frequency ,Zhu territory occurring such as query term, link analysis, the document retrieving is classified.Then, conventionally by the order after graduation, the document retrieving is presented to user, and do not carry out any other grouping or enforced classification.In some cases, only present the selected part of document text to make user can understand roughly the content of described document.
Direct " boolean (Boolean) " coupling of query term has a plurality of restrictions of knowing, and especially None-identified those do not there is query term but there is the document of related words.For instance, in typical Boolean system, during search " Australian Shepherds (Australian shepherd dog) ", for example, the document about other herding dogs (shepherd dog) (, Border Collies (winning shepherd dog)) without definite query term will can not be returned to.On the contrary, described system may retrieve conventionally about the document of Australia (Australia) (and with dogs (dog) irrelevant) and document about " shepherds (shepherd dog) " simultaneously, and these documents are come to higher level.
The problem is here that traditional system is to work out literature index according to individual term rather than concept.Concept represents with phrase conventionally, as " Australian Shepherd (Australian shepherd dog) ", " President of the United States (US President) " or " Sundance Film Festival (Sundance Film Festival) " etc.Some existing system is to be at most just scheduled to and the incompatible establishment literature index of very limited " known " phrase book, and these " known " phrases are generally selected by human operator.Because perceive identification by (such as) all possible phrase that forms of three, four or five or more word need to calculate and storer, so generally can avoid phrase produce index.For instance, if suppose that any five words can form a phrase and a large corpus will have at least 200,000 uniquity, will there is about 3.2*10 so
26individual possibility phrase, this obviously exceeds any existing system can be stored in amount or its amount that can programme in addition and handle in storer.Another problem is that phrase is constantly inputted and can exceed its usage in dictionary, and this individual malapropism newer than invention is much frequent.New phrase always produces from sources such as technology, art, world's event and law.Other phrase will reduce use in time.
Some existing information searching system is attempted by providing conceptual retrieval by the pattern that a malapropism occurs simultaneously.In these systems, search for a word, for example " President (president) " will retrieve the document with other word (as " White (white) " and " House (house) ") occurring together with " President (president) " continually simultaneously.Although this method may produce the Search Results with document conceptually relevant in individual malapropism level, it generally cannot be trapped in the thematic relation existing between the phrase simultaneously occurring.
Therefore, need a kind of information retrieval system and method, it can identify phrase in Large Scale Corpus all sidedly, according to phrase establishment literature index, according to its phrase search document and document is classified and other the trooping and descriptive information about described document is provided.
Summary of the invention
The present invention relates to a kind of information retrieval system and method, its with phrase to the document produce index in document databse, search for, classify and illustrate.Described system is suitable for identifying those phrases in document databse with enough frequent and/or unique usages to indicate that it is " effectively " or " good " phrase.In this way, can identify multiword phrase, for example, by four, five or phrase that more form.This with regard to avoided necessary identification by give determined number word each possible phrase the problem to its produce index that likely sequence produces.
This system is also suitable for according to existing the ability of other phrase to identify the phrase being relative to each other in phrase prediction document.More particularly, utilize and make the actual while occurrence rate of two phrases and the expectation of these two phrases prediction measures that occurrence rate is relevant simultaneously.Prediction measures is an information gain, i.e. actual occurrence rate simultaneously and the ratio of expecting while occurrence rate.When prediction measures surpasses a predetermined threshold, two phrases are relevant.Under that situation, the second phrase has significant information gain with respect to the first phrase.Semantically, relevant phrases is by being those phrases that are jointly used for discussing or describing a given theme or concept, as " President of the United States (US President) " and " White House (White House) ".For a given phrase, relevant phrases can be carried out sequencing based on its prediction measures separately according to its correlativity or validity.
Information retrieval system is come the document produce index in document databse by effective or good phrase.For each phrase, charge to list for one and identify the document that those contain described phrase.In addition,, for a given phrase, by the second list, vector or other structure, store indication and in each document that contains described given phrase, also have the data of which relevant phrases of given phrase.In this way, described system not only can respond search inquiry and identify easily which document and contain which phrase, and can identify which document also contain relevant to query phrase and therefore more may be specifically about the phrase of the represented theme of query phrase or concept.
Use phrase and relevant phrases also to create and used trooping of relevant phrases, it represents the significant grouping of phrase semantically.The relevant phrases between the genitive phrase during trooping with very high prediction measures is identified and is trooped.Troop and can be used to organize Search Results, comprise and select Search Results to comprise which document and order thereof, and remove document from Search Results.
When being also suitable for searching for document in response inquiry, information retrieval system uses phrase.Process inquiry to be identified in any phrase existing in inquiry, thus retrieval and inquisition phrase charge to together list and relevant phrases information.In addition, in some cases, user can input incomplete phrase in search inquiry, as " President of the (... president) ".Can identify imperfect phrase like this and replace with expansion phrase, as " President of the United States (US President) ".This contributes to guarantee the most possible search of actual execution user.
System also can be identified or select Search Results to comprise which document by relevant phrases information.For a given phrase and a given document, relevant phrases information points out to exist which relevant phrases of described given phrase in described given document.Therefore, for an inquiry that contains two query phrases, first process the document that list contains the first query phrase with identification of charging to of the first query phrase, then process relevant phrases information and also contain the second query phrase to identify which document in these documents.Then, these documents are included in Search Results below.This does not just need system then to process separately the list of charging to of the second query phrase, and be provided search time faster thus.Certainly, the method also can expand to the phrase that has any amount in inquiry, thereby can significantly save, calculates and the time.
System also can be suitable for coming the document graduation in last set result by phrase and relevant phrases information.The relevant phrases information of one given phrase is better for the form storage such as bit vector, and it represents that each relevant phrases is with respect to the validity of described given phrase.For instance, relevant phrases bit vector all has a position for each relevant phrases of given phrase, and these for example, carry out sequencing according to the prediction measures of relevant phrases (, information gain).The most effectively position of relevant phrases bit vector is relevant to the relevant phrases with the highest prediction measures, and least significant bit (LSB) is relevant to the relevant phrases with minimum prediction measures.In this way, for a given document and a given phrase, relevant phrases Information Availability comes document to score.The value of bit vector (as a value) itself can be used as document mark, and in this way, the document of the senior relevant phrases that contains query phrase more may be relevant to inquiry on theme than the document with rudimentary relevant phrases.Bit vector value also can be used as the one-component in more complicated score function, and can weighting.Then, can come document to classify according to document mark.
Phrase information also can be used in information retrieval system so that user's search is personalized.User is modeled as to one and for example, from () described user's ever accessed, crosses the phrase set that the document of (for example, at screen, print, store etc.) obtains.More specifically, the document that given user accessed will be included in the relevant phrases existing in this document in user model or overview.At searching period subsequently, the phrase in user's model carrys out phrase the document mark weighting to the document retrieving of filtered search inquiry.
Phrase information also can be used in the document description that for example, is included in the document in last set result in information retrieval system to create ().A given search inquiry, described system identification go out the phrase that exists in inquiry with and relevant phrases and its expansion phrase.For a given document, each sentence of described document has a counting that has how many query phrases, relevant phrases and expansion phrase in sentence.Can come the graduation of document sentence by these countings (indivedual or combination), and select the sentence (for example, five sentences) of the highest ranking of some to form document description.When Search Results comprises described document, can then to user, present document description, make can understand better described document with respect to inquiring user.
Further improve the method for this generation document description, so that system can provide the personalization explanation at reflection user interest place.As mentioned above, user model has been stored the information of the interested relevant phrases of identification user.The phrase that this user model is relevant with query phrase to row intersects, to identify this two groups of total phrases.Then, according to relevant phrases information, come described total set sequencing.Then, with the set of gained relevant phrases, according to the instance number of these relevant phrases that exist in each document, carry out the sentence graduation to document.Selection has a plurality of sentences of total relevant phrases of maximum quantity as personalized document description.
When to document databse produce index (creeping) or when disposal search queries, repetition document be identified and be removed to information retrieval system also can with phrase information.For a given document, each sentence of described document has a counting that has how many relevant phrases in sentence.Can count document sentence is classified by this, and select the sentence (for example, five sentences) of a plurality of highest rankings to form document description.Then, the character string or the hash that for example, by this explanation storage () relevant to document, are described sentence.During produce index, the document that processing is newly creeped is in the same manner to produce document description.New document description can mate with previous document description (for example, hash), and if the coupling of discovery, this new document is exactly a repetition document so.Similarly, preparing between the fruiting period of search inquiry, the document that can process in search result set repeats document to remove.
The user interface that system of the present invention and software architecture, computer program and computer-implemented method and computing machine produce has other embodiment with presenting.
Only above information retrieval system based on phrase and some features of method.The technician of information retrieval field will understand, and the dirigibility of phrase information ubiquity can be widely used and apply in produce index, document annotation, search, graduation and other field of document analysis and processing.

Embodiment
I.
system survey
Referring now to Fig. 1,, it has shown the software architecture of an embodiment of search system 100 according to an embodiment of the invention.In this embodiment, system comprises a directory system 100, a search system 120, a display system 130 and a front-end server 140.
Directory system 110 is responsible for the phrase in identification document and is come document produce index with other document databse by access different web sites 190 according to its phrase.Front-end server 140 receives inquiry from the user of user side 170, and provides those inquiries to search system 120.Search system 120 is responsible for the document (Search Results) that search is relevant to search inquiry, comprises any phrase in identification search inquiry, then uses the phrase occurring to classify to affect rank order to the document in Search Results.Search system 120 provides Search Results to display system 130.Display system 130 is responsible for revising Search Results (comprise removing and approach the document repeating and the subject specification that produces document), and revised Search Results is returned to front-end server 140, is about to result and offers user side 170.System 100 further comprises that one for storing index 150 and about the index information of document for storing the phrase data storage 160 of phrase and ASSOCIATE STATISTICS information.
With regard to the application's case, " document " is interpreted as by the media of search engine produce index any type of retrieving, comprising file of web documents, image, multimedia file, text document, PDF or other picture format etc.A document can have the ingredient of one or more page, subregion, section or other applicable its contents and type.Comparably, document can be called " page ", and it is commonly used to refer to the document on internet.Use generic term " document " not mean category of the present invention is carried out to any restriction.Search system 100 can operate ，Ru internet and WWW to large document corpus, but it can be used in more limited set equally, as the document databse for library or the private enterprise.Under arbitrary situation, should be appreciated that, document is generally distributed in many different computer systems and website.So, do not lose generality, for example, no matter form or position (, which website or database) are referred to as corpus or document databse by document.Each document has the identifier together of a described document of unique identification; Described identifier is preferably URL, but also can use the identifier (for example, document number) of other type.In this announcement, suppose with URL and identify document.
II.
directory system
In one embodiment, directory system 110 provides the operation of three main functions: 1) identification phrase and relevant phrases, 2) about phrase to document produce index, and 3) produce and maintain the classification based on phrase.Person of ordinary skill in the field will understand, and under the support of traditional index function, directory system 110 also will be carried out other function, therefore be not described further these other operations herein.Index 150 and the data storage bank 160 of 110 pairs of phrase datas of directory system operate.Below further illustrate these data storage banks.
1.
phrase identification
" good " and " bad " phrase in the phrase identifying operation identification document databse of directory system 110, these phrases contribute to document produce index search.On the one hand, good phrase is that those often appear in document databse the phrase surpassing in the document of a certain number percent, and/or is expressed as and in described document, has different outward appearances, as delimited by putting mark label or other form, form or grammatical markers.Good phrase be that it can predict other good phrase on the other hand, and be not only the word sequence appearing in dictionary.For instance, phrase " President of the United States (US President) " is the phrase of other phrases such as a prediction such as " George Bush (George Bush) " and " Bill Clinton (bielke Islington) ".Yet, such as other phrase of " fell down the stairs " or " top of the morning ", " out of the blue ", do not have a predictability, this is often to occur together with many other different and irrelevant phrases from idiom because resemble these Chinese idiom.Therefore, phrase cognitive phase determines which phrase has been that phrase and which are bad phrase (that is, lacking predictive ability).
Referring now to Fig. 2,, phrase identifying has the following functions sexual stage:
200: collect possibility and good phrase, and the frequency of described phrase and the statistical value simultaneously occurring;
202: based on frequency statistics value, may be divided into phrase or bad phrase by phrase;
204: the predictability that the statistical value based on from occur simultaneously obtains measures to have simplified list of phrases.
Now will be described in further detail each stage in these stages.
First stage 200 is such processes, and by this process, the directory system 110 one group of document in (crawl) document databse of creeping, forms a plurality of repetition subregions of described document databse in time.A subregion of every around reason.Every document number all over creeping may change, and is preferably each subregion approximately 1,000,000 document.Goodly only process in each subregion the document of previously not creeping, until handle all documents, or meet a certain other stop criterion.In fact, because new document constantly adds in document databse, so creep, constantly continue.Each document after 110 pairs of directory systems are creeped is taked the following step.
With the phrase length of window of n, travel through each word of described document, wherein n is the maximum phrase length of expectation.The length of window is generally at least 2, is preferably 4 or 5 (words).The better all words that comprise in phrase window of phrase, comprise those otherwise can be characterized as being the word that finishes word, as " a ", " the " etc.The sign that phrase window can return to, put mark label or other guide or format change by end of line, paragraph stops.
Fig. 3 illustrates a part for document 300 during traversal, and it shows that phrase window 302 starts and expands 5 words to the right from word " stock ".First character in window 302 is candidate's phrase i, and each phrase in sequence i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4 and i+5 is similarly candidate's phrase.Therefore, in this example, candidate's phrase is: " stock ", " stock dogs ", " stock dogs for ", " stock dogs for the ", " stock dogs for the Basque " and " stock dogs for the Basque shepherds ".
In each phrase window 302, check successively each candidate's phrase with determine its whether Already in good list of phrases 208 or may list of phrases 206 in.If candidate's phrase has not appeared in list of phrases 208 or possibility list of phrases 206, that is just determined described candidate's phrase for " bad " phrase and is skipped.
If candidate's phrase has appeared in list of phrases 208, as an article or item in a contract g
j, that is new phrase g more just
jindex 150 an article or item in a contracts for example, to comprise described document (, its URL or other document identification symbol), to indicate this candidate's phrase g
jappear in current document.Phrase g
jindex 150 in an article or item in a contract (or) be called phrase g
jcharge to list.Charge to list and comprise a row document d (according with by its document identification, for example document number or URL) who wherein occurs phrase.
In addition,, as below further explained, upgrade and occur matrix 212 simultaneously.In initial first pass, good and bad list will be all sky, therefore tend to by most of phrases add to may list of phrases 206 in.
If candidate's phrase has not appeared in list of phrases 208, that is just added in possibility list of phrases 206, unless wherein there is described time phrase.Each an article or item in a contract p in possible list of phrases 206 has three countings together:
P (p): the document number that has possibility phrase;
S (p): all instance number of possible phrase; And
M (p): the instance number arousing attention of possible phrase.May phrase and document in the difference of adjacent content be grammer or form mark, for example black matrix or underscore or while being the anchor text in hyperlink or quotation marks, the example of possible phrase " arouses attention ".These (with other) difference outward appearance is indicated by various HTML markup language labels and grammatical markers.When a phrase has been placed in list of phrases 208, these statistical values of described phrase are still retained.
Except each list, when also retaining phrase, there is matrix 212 (G).Matrix G has mxm dimension, and wherein m has been the quantity of phrase.Each an article or item in a contract G (j, k) in matrix represents a pair of good phrase (g
j, g
k).Occur simultaneously matrix 212 logically (but physically not necessarily) retain every couple of good phrase (g
j, g
k) about three separate counts of secondary window 304, described window 304 be centered close to current word i and h word of expansion +/-.In one embodiment, for example as described in Figure 3, secondary window 304 has 30 words.Therefore, occur that matrix 212 retains simultaneously:
R (j, k): occurrence count in the time of original, i.e. phrase g
jwith phrase g
kappear at together the number of times in secondary window 304;
D (j, k): the separated counting arousing attention, i.e. phrase g
jor phrase g
kas special text, appear at the number of times in secondary window; And
C (j, k): the counting arousing attention of connection, i.e. phrase g
jwith phrase g
kas special text, appear at the number of times in secondary window simultaneously.The counting arousing attention use connecting is particularly advantageous in avoids phrase (for example, copyright notice) frequently to appear in sidebar, footer or header and the therefore situation of in fact unpredictable other text.
Referring to the example of Fig. 3, suppose that " stock dogs " and phrase " Australian Shepherd " and " Australian Shepard Club of America " have been positioned in list of phrases 208.Latter two phrase appears in secondary window 304 works as before phrase " stock dogs " around.Yet phrase " Australian Shepherd Club of America " occurs as the anchor text of the hyperlink (being indicated by underscore) of website.Therefore, described to { " stock dogs ", " Australian Shepherd " } original while occurrence count increase progressively, and { " stock dogs ", " Australian Shepherd Club of America " } original while occurrence count all increase progressively with the separated counting arousing attention, this is to occur as special text because of the latter.
Each document in subregion is repeated to the process with secondary window 304 each document of traversal with window sequence 302.
After document in having traveled through subregion, the next stage of produce index operation is exactly from may list of phrases 206 upgrading 202 good list of phrases 208.If possible the frequency of occurrences of the possibility of in list of phrases 206 phrase p indicates it to be enough used as semantically significant phrase with the document number that occurs described phrase, and that has just moved on to described phrase in list of phrases 208.
In one embodiment, its test is as follows.From may list of phrases 206 getting a possibility phrase p and place it in list of phrases 208, precondition is:
A) P (p) > 10 and S (p) > 20 (the document number that contains p is greater than 10, and the occurrence number of phrase p is greater than 20); Or
B) M (p) > 5 (instance number arousing attention of phrase p is greater than 5).
Document number in these threshold values and subregion is proportional; For example, if creep 2,000,000 document in a subregion, that threshold value approximately doubles.Certainly, person of ordinary skill in the field will understand, and the occurrence of these threshold values or the logic of testing it can change with the need.
If phrase p does not have qualification to enter list of phrases 208, check that it becomes the qualification of bad phrase.Phrase p is that the condition of a bad phrase is:
A) document that contains phrase is counted P (p) < 2; And
B) the instance number M arousing attention (p)=0 of phrase.
These conditions indicate described phrase neither frequent, can not be used to refer to effective content, similarly, these threshold values can with subregion in document number proportional.
It should be noted that as mentioned above, except multiword phrase, good list of phrases 208 will comprise that a malapropism is as phrase naturally.This is because each the first word candidate's phrase always in phrase window 302, and suitable example counting will be accumulated.Therefore, directory system 110 can be automatically to individual malapropism (that is the phrase, with single character) and multiword phrase produce index.Good list of phrases 208 is also short a lot of by the theoretical maximum likely combining than based on m phrase.In exemplary embodiments, good list of phrases 208 will comprise about 6.5x10
5individual phrase.Because system only need to understand the phrase of may phrase becoming reconciled, so do not need to store bad list of phrases.
By last, all over inspection document databse, the expection of using due to phrase in Big-corpus distributes, so the list of possibility phrase will be relatively short.Therefore, if for example, the 10th time (, 10,000,000 document), a phrase occurs for the first time, and it is extremely can not become a good phrase in that time so.It may be the new phrase of just having brought into use, and therefore in creeping subsequently, becomes more and more common.Under that situation, its corresponding counts will increase, and may finally meet the threshold value that becomes a good phrase.
The phase III of produce index operation is to use from occur that the predictability that matrix 212 obtains measures to simplify 204 good list of phrases 208 simultaneously.Without reducing the number of, although good list of phrases 208 probably comprises many reasonably appearing at, in dictionary, itself cannot fully predict the existence of other phrase or itself be the phrase of the subsequence of length language more.After removing these weak good phrases, more may effectively obtain phrase.In order to have identified phrase, use a predictability tolerance, it represents the existence of a given phrase, occurs that in the literature the possibility of another phrase increases.In one embodiment, this completes as follows.
As mentioned above, occur that matrix 212 is mxm matrixes of storing the data that are associated with good phrase simultaneously.Every row j in matrix has represented phrase g
i, and every row k has represented phrase g
k.For each good phrase g
j, calculation expectation value E (g
j).Expectation value E is that in storehouse, expection contains g
jthe number percent of document.For example, it is calculated as and contains g
jdocument Shuo Yu storehouse in the ratio of the document sum T that creeped: P (j)/T.
As mentioned above, work as g
jwhile occurring in the literature at every turn, upgrade and contain g
jdocument number.Each g
jcounting while increasing or during this phase III, renewable E (g
j) value.
Then, other good phrase g for each
k(for example, each row of matrix), determines g
jwhether predicted g
k.G
jpredictability tolerance determine as follows:
I) calculation expectation value E (g
k).If g
jwith g
kbe irrelevant phrase, its expectation while occurrence rate E (j, k) is E (g
j) * E (g
k);
Ii) calculate g
jwith g
kactual while occurrence rate A (j, k).Be about to original while occurrence count R (j, k) divided by document sum T;
Iii) it is said and to surpass expectation simultaneously during occurrence rate E (j, a k) critical quantity, g as actual occurrence rate A (j, k) simultaneously
jprediction g
k.
In one embodiment, predictability tolerance is information gain.Therefore, when at phrase g
janother phrase g in front
kinformation gain I while surpassing a threshold value, phrase g
jprediction phrase g
k.In one embodiment, this is calculated as follows:
I(j，k)＝A(j，k)/E(j，k)。
And when meeting following condition, good phrase g
jpredicted phrase g
k:
I (j, k) > information gain threshold.
In one embodiment, information gain threshold is 1.5, but better between 1.1 and 1.7.It is in order to reduce by two irrelevant phrases of script, to occur surpassing the possibility of stochastic prediction that threshold value is elevated to over 1.0 simultaneously.
As mentioned above, with respect to given row j, the calculating to every row k duplicate message gain of matrix G.After a line completes, if good phrase g
kin the information gain of none phrase surpass information gain threshold, this just means phrase g
junpredictable any other good phrase.Under that situation, from good list of phrases 208, remove g
j, it just becomes bad phrase substantially.Note, do not remove phrase g
jrow j because this phrase itself can be predicted by other good phrase.
After having assessed all row that simultaneously occur in matrix 212, finish this step.
Last step in this stage is to have simplified list of phrases 208 to remove imperfect phrase.Imperfect phrase is one and only predicts its expansion phrase and the phrase starting from the leftmost side (that is, the beginning of phrase) of described phrase." the expansion phrase " of phrase p is a supersequence starting with phrase p.For instance, phrase " President of " prediction " President of the United States ", " President of Mexico ", " President of AT& T " etc.Because all these phrases are below all to start and be its supersequence with " President of ", so they are the expansion phrases of " President of ".
Therefore, be retained in each the phrase g in list of phrases 208
jall will predict a certain amount of other phrase based on aforementioned information gain threshold.Now, for each phrase g
j, each phrase g that directory system 110 execution itself and its are predicted
kstring matching.Each prediction phrase g is tested in string matching
kwhether be phrase g
jexpansion phrase.If all prediction phrase g
kall phrase g
jexpansion phrase, g so
jjust imperfect, it is removed from good list of phrases 208 and add in imperfect list of phrases 216.Therefore if there is at least one, not, g
jthe phrase g of expansion phrase
k, that g
jbe exactly complete, and can be retained in list of phrases 208.So for instance, unique other phrase of predicting as " President of the United " is " President of the United States " and this prediction phrase while being the expansion phrase of described phrase, and " President of the United " is exactly an imperfect phrase.
216 of imperfect list of phrases are very useful in actual search process.When receiving search inquiry, itself and imperfect list 216 can be compared.If described inquiry (or its part) is mated with an an article or item in a contract in described list, that search system 120 just can be searched most probable expansion phrase (the given imperfect phrase of this imperfect phrase, there is the expansion phrase of high information gain), and advise this phrase or to expansion phrase automatic search to user.For example, if search inquiry is " President of the United ", that search system 120 can be from trend user suggestion " President of the United States " as search inquiry.
After completing the last stage of produce index process, good list of phrases 208 will contain a large amount of good phrase of finding in corpus.By prediction, at least one is not other phrase of its expansion phrase to each phrase in these good phrases.That is, each good phrase is used with enough frequencies, and independently represents significant concept or thought represented in corpus.The existing system of phrase of predetermined or artificial selection is different from using, and good list of phrases has reflected in corpus the actual phrase using.In addition, because adding in document databse, new document makes periodically to repeat above-mentioned creeping and produce index process, so directory system 110 automatically detects described new phrase when new phrase enters dictionary.

trooping of identification relevant phrases and relevant phrases
Referring to Fig. 4, relevant phrases identifying comprises following functions operation:
400: identification has the relevant phrases of high information gain value;
402: identify trooping of relevant phrases;
404: storage cluster bit vector and cluster number.
Describe now each operation in these operations in detail.
First recall, occur that matrix 212 has contained phrase g simultaneously
j, wherein other good phrase g of the information gain that at least one has the information gain threshold of being greater than predicted in each phrase
k.Then, in order to identify 400 relevant phrases, for every a pair of good phrase (g
j, g
k), information gain and relevant phrases threshold value (for example, 100) are compared.That is, when
I(g
j, g
k) during > 100,
G
jwith g
kit is relevant phrases.
When identifying with this high threshold the good phrase that surpasses well statistical expection rate, occur.In statistics, it means phrase g
jwith g
koccurrence rate is over 100 times of expectation while occurrence rate simultaneously.For instance, the phrase in given document " Monica Lewinsky ", if phrase " Bill Clinton " may occurrence rate be more its 100 times in same document, phrase " Bill Clinton " may appear in the document of random selection arbitrarily.Because occurrence rate is 100: 1, so another kind of form of presentation is prediction accuracy, be 99.999%.
Therefore, any an article or item in a contract (g of relevant phrases threshold value will be less than
j, g
k) zeroing, with referring expression g
j, g
kuncorrelated.Now, occur that in matrix 212, any residue an article or item in a contract is all indicated all relevant phrases simultaneously.
Then, by information gain value I (g
j, g
k) to there is each row g of matrix 212 simultaneously
jin row g
ksequence, makes first to list and has the relevant phrases g of high information gain
k.Therefore, this sequence is a given phrase g
jwhich identify according to information gain other phrase most probable relevant.
Next step is to determine that 402 which relevant phrases form together relevant phrases and troop.Trooping is the set of relevant phrases, and wherein each phrase has high information gain with respect at least one other phrase.The identification of trooping in one embodiment, is as follows.
Every row g at matrix
jin, will there is one or more and phrase g
jother relevant phrase.This set is exactly relevant phrases set R
j, R={g wherein
kg
l... g
m.
For R
jin each relevant phrases m, directory system 110 determines that whether each other relevant phrases in R also relevant to gj.Therefore, if I is (g
k, g
l) also non-zero, that g
j, g
kwith g
lit is a part of trooping.To the often a pair of (g in R
l, g
m) repeat this test of trooping.
For instance, supposed that phrase " Bill Clinton " and phrase " President ", " Monica Lewinsky " are relevant, this is because each these phrase surpasses relevant phrases threshold value with respect to the information gain of " Bill Clinton ".In addition, suppose that phrase " Monica Lewinsky " is relevant to phrase " purse designer ".So these phrases form set R.For determining, troop, directory system 110 gains to assess each phrase with respect to the information gain of other phrase by determining the corresponding information of these phrases.Therefore, directory system 110 is determined all to the information gain I of phrase (" President ", " Monica Lewinsky "), I (" President ", " purse designer ") etc. in R.In this example, " Bill Clinton ", " President " form one with " Monica Lewinsky " and troop, " Bill Clinton " forms second with " President " and troops, and " Monica Lewinsky " and " purse designer " form the 3rd and troop, and " Monica Lewinsky ", " Bill Clinton " form the 4th with " purse designer " and troop.Although this is that " Monica Lewinsky " still predicts this two phrases because " Bill Clinton " do not have enough information gains to predict " purse designer ".
For recording 404 cluster information, to each, troop and assign a unique cluster number (ID troops).Then, in conjunction with each good phrase g
jrecord together this information.
In one embodiment, cluster number is to be determined by the bit vector of trooping, and the bit vector of trooping is the orthogonality relation between referring expression also.The bit vector of trooping is that length is the sequence of the position of n, and wherein n has been the quantity of the good phrase in list of phrases 208.For one, give and reserve phrase g
j，Wei position is corresponding to g
jsequence after relevant phrases R.If the relevant phrases g in R
kwith phrase g
jin same trooping, set a position.More generally, this means if at g
jwith g
kbetween either direction on there is information gain, set the corresponding positions troop in bit vector.
So cluster number is exactly the value of gained bit string.This embodiment has such characteristic, and the relevant phrases with multidirectional or unidirectional information gain appears in same cluster.
An example that uses the bit vector of trooping of above-mentioned phrase as follows:
So summarize it, after this process, will be each good phrase g
jidentify one group of relevant phrases R, it is according to information gain I (g
j, g
k) order from high to low arranges.In addition, for each good phrase g
j, all will have the bit vector of trooping, its value be one for identifying phrase g
jthe affiliated cluster number of mainly trooping, and its quadrature value (being 1 or 0 for each position) is indicated which phrase and g in the relevant phrases in R
jin jointly trooping.Therefore, in above-mentioned example, the trooping in 14 of the value of " Bill Clinton ", " President " and " Monica Lewinsky " position in the row based on phrase " Bill Clinton ".
For storing this information, can use two kinds of basic representations.The first, as mentioned above, information can be stored in and occur in matrix 212, wherein simultaneously:
The capable j of an article or item in a contract G[, row k]=(I (j, k), cluster number, the bit vector of trooping).
Or, can avoid matrix representation, and all information has been stored in list of phrases 208, wherein every row represents a good phrase g
j;
Capable j=list [the phrase g of phrase
k, (I (j, k), cluster number, the bit vector of trooping)].
The method provides a kind of useful set of clusters weave.First, the method is not a theme strict and that conventionally define arbitrarily and the classification of concept, but the theme shown in approval relevant phrases forms a complicated relation table, wherein some phrase is relevant to many other phrases, and the scope of some phrase is more limited, and wherein each relation may be mutual (other phrase predicted in each phrase) or unidirectional (other phrase predicted in a phrase, otherwise but can not).It is " part " that result can characterize each good phrase in pairs by trooping, so some is trooped overlapping owing to having one or more common relevant phrases.
So for a given good phrase g
j, relevant phrases provides a kind of classification that named phrase troops that is used for according to the sequencing of information gain: the name of trooping is in trooping, to have the title of the relevant phrases of high information gain.
Said method provides a kind of and in reality is implemented, has been used in together the mode of nature in " trooping " for identifying the very strong mode of effective phrase of present document databse and these relevant phrases.Therefore, troop " editor " of any manual work guiding of the relational language of having avoided common in many systems and concept of this data-driven of relevant phrases selected to intrinsic deviation.
3.
with phrase and relevant phrases to document produce index
Givenly comprise the good list of phrases 208 with the information of trooping about relevant phrases, the next functional performance of directory system 110 be about good phrase with troop to the document produce index in document databse, and the information after upgrading is stored in index 150.Fig. 5 illustrates this process, comprising establishment literature index the following functional stage:
500: document is charged to charging in list of the good phrase found in the literature;
502: the example counting and relevant phrases bit vector that upgrade relevant phrases and secondary relevant phrases;
504: with relevant phrases information, annotate document;
506: according to charging to list size, come index an article or item in a contract again sequencing.
To describe in more detail these stages now.
As mentioned above, the literature collection that travels through or creep; This can be identical or different literature collection.For a given document d, from the i of position, the window sequence 302 that the length of take is n word for word travels through 500 documents in the above described manner.
At a given phrase window 302Zhong，Cong position i, start all good phrase in identification window.Each good phrase is expressed as g
i.Therefore, g1 is first good phrase, and g2 is second good phrase, and the rest may be inferred.
For each good phrase g
i(example g1 " President " with g4 " President of ATT "), (for example, URL) is logged into the good phrase g in index 150 by document identification symbol
icharge in list.This renewal identifies, and in this specific document, has occurred phrase g
i.
In one embodiment, phrase g
jthe list of charging to adopt following logical form:
Phrase g
j: list: (document d, [list: relevant phrases counting] [relevant phrases information]).
For each phrase g
j, have a document d list that occurs described phrase.For each document, there is a phrase g who appears at equally in document d
jthe count list of occurrence number of relevant phrases R.
In one embodiment, relevant phrases information is a relevant phrases bit vector.This bit vector can be characterized by " dibit " vector, and this is because for each relevant phrases g
k, You Lianggewei position: g all
k-1 and g
k-2.Whether first position storage one indication there is relevant phrases g in document d
klabel (that is, the g in document d
kcounting be greater than 0).Whether storage one indication in second position also there is phrase g in document d
krelevant phrases g
llabel.Phrase g
jrelevant phrases g
krelevant phrases g
lbe called in this article " g
jsecondary relevant phrases ".Described counting Yu Wei position is corresponding to the canonic ordering (arranging according to the order of the information gain of successively decreasing) of phrase in R.This sort order produces such effect, makes g
jthe relevant phrases g of topnotch prediction
krelevant to the Must Significant Bit of relevant phrases bit vector, and g
jthe relevant phrases g of minimum prediction
lrelevant to least significant bit (LSB).
More usefully notice for a given phrase g, with regard to all documents that contain g, the association between indivedual positions of the length of relevant phrases bit vector and relevant phrases and described vector is all identical.This embodiment has following characteristic, even if system easily relatively contains the relevant phrases bit vector of any (or all) documents of g, to observe which document, has given relevant phrases.This is conducive to promote search procedure response search inquiry to identify document.Therefore, given document will appear at the charging in list of many different phrases, and this type of is charged in list at each, and the relevant phrases vector of described document will be exclusively used in the phrase of charging to list described in having.This respect has kept the locality of relevant phrases bit vector with respect to indivedual phrases and document.
Therefore, next stage 502 comprises the secondary window 304 (as previously mentioned, the secondary window of +/-K item (for example 30)) of the current index position in traversal document, for example, from i-K to i+K.For the g appearing in secondary window 304
ieach relevant phrases g
k, directory system 110 makes g with respect to the document d in relevant phrases counting
kcount increments.If g
ioccur after a while again finding relevant phrases in the literature and in secondary window after a while, again increase progressively counting.
As mentioned above, based on counting, set corresponding first g in the mapping of relevant phrases position
k-1, if g
kcounting > 0, position is set to 1, if or described counting equal 0, be set to 0.
Then, in index 150, search relevant phrases g
k, at g
kcharge to an article or item in a contract of identifying document d in list, then check g
kthe secondary relevant phrases counting (or position) of any relevant phrases, thereby set second g
k-2.If set any these secondary relevant phrases counting/positions, also there is g in this indication in document d
jsecondary relevant phrases.
When handling document d completely in this way, directory system 110 will identify:
I) the good phrase g of each in document d
j;
Ii) be each good phrase g
jidentify and in document d, have its which relevant phrases g
k;
Iii) for being present in each the relevant phrases g in document d
kidentify and in document d, also have its which relevant phrases g
l(g
jsecondary relevant phrases).
A)
determine document subject
By phrase, to document produce index and use cluster information that another advantage of directory system 110 is provided, can determine based on relevant phrases information the theme of document.
Suppose for a given phrase g
jwith a given document d, charge to list an article or item in a contract as follows:
G
j: document d: relevant phrases counting :={ 3,4,3,0,0,2,1,1,0}
Relevant phrases bit vector :={ 11 11 10 00 00 10 10 10 01}
Wherein, relevant phrases bit vector is shown as dibit pair.
From relevant phrases bit vector, we can determine one-level and the secondary theme of document d.Main subject heading is indicated (1,1) by position, and secondary theme is indicated (1,0) by position.To there is the right relevant phrases g of institute's rheme in (1,1) indication document d simultaneously in relevant phrases position
kand secondary relevant phrases g
l.This can be interpreted as meaning author of document when writing described document d and use together some relevant phrases g
j, g
kwith g
l.To (1,0) indication, there is g in position simultaneously
jwith g
k, but there is not g
kany other secondary relevant phrases, so this is so effective theme.
B)
improve graduate document annotation
Directory system 110 be on the other hand can be in produce index process with making information annotate 504 each document d that the graduation of searching period improves subsequently.Annotation procedure 506 is as follows.
Given document d in document databse can have the outer link to other document of some.Each outer link (hyperlink) comprises the document identification symbol of anchor text and target literature.In order explaining, the current document d processing to be called to URL0, and the target literature of the outer link on document d is called to URL1.In order to wait a moment for the document graduation to Search Results, for each link of pointing in the URL0 of some other URLi, directory system 110 create described link with respect to the outer link mark of the anchor phrase of URL0 and described anchor phrase the internal chaining mark with respect to URLi.That is, each link in document databse has a pair of mark, i.e. an outer link mark and an internal chaining mark.Being calculated as follows of these marks.
On given document URL0, directory system 110 identifications each outer link to another document URL1, wherein anchor text A is a phrase in good list of phrases 208.Fig. 8 a schematically illustrates this relation, and the anchor text " A " in its Literature URL0 is for hyperlink 800.
Charging in list of phrase A, the outer link using URL0 as phrase A is charged to, and URL1 is charged to as the internal chaining of phrase A.For URL0, complete as mentioned above relevant phrases bit vector, to identify relevant phrases and the secondary relevant phrases of the A existing in URL0.By this relevant phrases bit vector as link mark link from URL0 to the URL1 that contains anchor phrase A.
Then, determine as follows internal chaining mark.For each internal chaining to the URL1 that contains anchor phrase A, directory system 110 scanning URL1, and determine in the main body of URL1, whether to occur phrase A.If phrase A not only points to URL1 (by the outer link on URL0), and appears in the content of URL1 itself, it is inner relevant to the concept of phrase A representative that this just shows that URL1 can be called.Fig. 8 b has illustrated this situation, and wherein phrase A appears in the main body of URL0 (as anchor text) and URL1.Under this situation, the internal chaining mark by the relevant phrases bit vector of the phrase A of URL1 as the link from URL0 to the URL1 that contains phrase A.
If anchor phrase A do not appear in the main body of URL1 (as Fig. 8 a), just take different steps to determine internal chaining mark.Under this situation, the relevant phrases bit vector (just looking like to have phrase A at URL1) that directory system 110 creates for the URL1 of phrase A, which relevant phrases of its referring expression A appears in URL1.Then, the internal chaining mark as the link from URL0 to URL1 by this relevant phrases bit vector.
For instance, suppose the following phrase of initial existence in URL0 and URL1:
(in above-mentioned and following table, not showing secondary relevant phrases).URL0 is capable is the outer link mark from the link of anchor text A, and URL1 capable be the internal chaining mark of described link.Here, URL0 contains the anchor phrase that target is URL1 " Australian Shepard ".In five relevant phrases of " Australian Shepard ", only one " Aussie " appears in URL0.So intuitively, URL0 is only weak relevant to Australian Shepards.By comparing, URL1 not only has the phrase " Australian Shepherd " being present in document main body, but also has a plurality of relevant phrases " blue merle ", " red merle " and " tricolor ".Therefore, because anchor phrase " Australian Shepard " appears in URL0 and URL1, so the outer link mark of URL0 and the internal chaining mark of URL1 are above-mentioned corresponding lines.
Above-mentioned the second situation refers to the situation that does not occur anchor phrase A in URL1.Under that situation, directory system 110 scanning URL1 also determine which phrase existing in URL1 in relevant phrases " Aussie ", " blue merle ", " red merle ", " tricolor " and " agility training ", and therefore produce a relevant phrases bit vector, for example:
Here, this shows that URL1 does not contain anchor phrase " Australian Shepard ", but contains relevant phrases " blue merle ", " red merle " and " tricolor ".
The method is conducive to prevent completely webpage (a class document) is carried out to the manipulation of the distortion Search Results of some type.The page in a large number by manual creation with the given anchor text that points to want page can " bombard " with the graduation algorithm that depends on the link number that points to given document to come the graduate search engine of described document.Therefore, when the search inquiry of anchor text is used in input, conventionally can return to want page, though in fact this page almost or completely it doesn't matter with anchor text.Relevant bits vector having been eliminated from target literature URL1 is input to the relevant phrases bit vector of phrase A of document URL0 to search system usings as the phrase A in the URL0 of the indication of validity or in URL1 and the dependence of the relation between anchor text phrases to pointing to URL1.
The frequency of occurrences of each phrase based in index 150 in corpus, also for a phrase number given in each phrase.Phrase is more common, and its phrase receiving in index number is just lower.Then, directory system 110 is charged to number listed document number of phrase in list according to each all in index 150 is charged to list descending sort 506, makes first to list the phrase the most frequently occurring.So, can search particular phrase with phrase number.
III.
search system
Search system 120 is for receiving the document that inquiry search are relevant to described inquiry, and the list (and link of these documents) of these documents is provided in search result set.Fig. 6 illustrates the main function operation of search system 120:
600: the phrase in identification inquiry;
602: retrieve the document relevant to query phrase;
604: according to phrase, the document in Search Results is classified.
The details of the every one-phase in these stages is as follows.
1.
phrase in identification inquiry and expansion inquiry
The first stage 600 of search system 120 is to identify any phrase of existence in inquiry to effectively search for its index.In this section, use following term:
Q: the inquiry of inputting and received by search system 120;
Qp: the phrase existing in described inquiry;
The relevant phrases of Qr:Qp;
The expansion phrase of Qe:Qp;
The union of Q:Qp and Qr.
From user side 190, receive inquiry q, described inquiry q has character or the word of a certain maximum quantity at the most.
Search system 120 is used size for example, to travel through the every of described inquiry q for the phrase window of N (5).Described phrase window first, from first of described inquiry, is then expanded N item to the right.Then, this window moves right M-N time, and wherein M is the item number of described inquiry.
At each the window's position, in window, all will there is N item (or still less).These form a possible query phrase.In good list of phrases 208, search possibility phrase, judge that it is a good phrase.If have this possibility phrase in good list of phrases 208, return to a phrase number to phrase so; Now, this may phrase be exactly candidate's phrase.
In testing each window likely phrase with the candidate's phrase that judges them and be whether after, search system 120 will be given one group of phrase number for the corresponding phrase in inquiry.Then, by number sequence (descending) of these phrases.
From the highest phrase as first candidate's phrase number, whether stationary digital distance in search system 120 lists of judgement after sequence is interior another candidate's phrase, and the difference between phrase number for example, in the critical quantity of () 20,000.If had, in selecting so to inquire about, leftmost phrase is as effective query phrase Qp.From candidate's list of phrases, remove this query phrase and all subphrases thereof, and described list is resequenced and repeated said process.The result of this process is one group of effective query phrase Qp.
For example, suppose that search inquiry is " Hillary Rodham Clinton Bill on the Senate Floor (senator Hillary Luo Dehan Clinton Bill) ".Search system 120 can be identified following candidate's phrase: " Hillary Rodham Clinton Bill on ", " Hillary Rodham Clinton Bill " and " Hillary Rodham Clinton ".Delete the first two, and keep last as effective query phrase.Then, search system 120 can be identified " senator Bill (Bill on the Senate Floor) " and subphrase " Bill on the Senate ", " Bill on the ", " Bill on ", " Bill ", and can select " Bill " as effective query phrase Qp.Finally, search system 120 can be decomposed " on the Senate Floor ", and identification " Senate Floor " is as effective query phrase.
Then, search system 120 is adjusted the initial caps of effective phrase Qp.When decomposition query, the potential initial caps in search system 120 each effective phrase of identification.This can for example, take grammer and complete as basic initial caps algorithm by utilize known initial caps table (, the initial caps of " united states " for " United States ") or utilizing.This produces the query phrase set of suitable initial caps.
Then,, while there is phrase and subphrase thereof in this set, search system 120 can check the phrase of initial caps second time, and only selects the Far Left letter of those phrases to be become capitalization simultaneously.For example, to the capitalization of the search of " president of the united states ", will be " President of the United States ".
In next stage, search system 120 identification 602 those documents relevant to query phrase Q.Search system 120 then retrieval and inquisition phrase Q charge to list, and make these lists intersect to judge that all (or some) which document appears at query phrase charge in list.If there is one group of expansion phrase Qe (hereinafter will further explain) in the phrase Q in inquiry, first search system 120 forms the union of charging to list of described expansion phrase so, then make its and these to charge to list crossing.As mentioned above, search system 120 is identified expansion phrase by search each query phrase Q in imperfect list of phrases 216.
Crossing result is one group of document associated with the query.By phrase and relevant phrases establishment literature index, phrase Q in identification inquiry, then by query expansion to comprising expansion phrase, thereby produce one group than the selected works of traditional search system document more associated with the query based on boolean, in traditional search system based on boolean, the document of only selecting those to contain described query term.
In one embodiment, search system 120 can with an Optimization Mechanism respond inquiry identification document and not necessarily make query phrase Q allly charge to list and intersect.Due to the structure of index 150, so for each phrase g
j, its relevant phrases g
kall know, and at g
krelevant phrases bit vector in identify.Therefore, this Information Availability is the phrase being relative to each other or the crossing process with common relevant phrases in simplifying wherein two or more query phrases.In those situations, relevant phrases bit vector can direct access then for then retrieving corresponding document.The method is below more fully described.
Given any two query phrase Q1 and Q2, have three kinds of possible relevant situation:
1) Q2 is the relevant phrases of Q1;
2) Q2 is not the relevant phrases of Q1, and its relevant phrases Qr1 and Qr2 non-intersect (that is, there is no common relevant phrases) separately; And
3) Q2 is not the relevant phrases of Q1, but its relevant phrases Qr1 and Qr2 separately intersects.
For every a pair of query phrase, search system 120 is determined suitable situation by searching the relevant phrases bit vector of query phrase Qp.
Search system 120 continues as the list of charging to of document that query phrase Q1 retrieval comprises that those contain Q1, and is each the literature search relevant phrases bit vector in these documents.Whether whether the relevant phrases bit vector of Q1 be the relevant phrases of Q1 and be present in the document referring expression Q2 (if having, also comprising each phrase in residue query phrase).
If the first situation is applicable to Q2, search system 120 scanning Q1 charge to the relevant phrases bit vector of each document in list so, so that whether judgement is wherein provided with the position of Q2.If the document d that Q1 charges in list does not establish this position, so just mean that Q2 does not appear in that document.Therefore, can immediately this document be got rid of outside considering.Then, can be to the score of residue document.This also means that search system 120 checks that without the list of charging to of processing Q2 which document it is also present in, thereby has saved computing time.
If the second situation is applicable to Q2, these two phrases are irrelevant each other so.For example, inquiry " cheap bolt action rifle (cheap manual rifle bolt rifle) " has two phrases " cheap " and " bolt action rifle ".None is relevant for these phrases, and in addition, the relevant phrases of each phrase in these phrases is not overlapping; The relevant phrases of " cheap " has " low cost ", " inexpensive ", " discount ", " bargain basement " and " lousy ", and the relevant phrases of " bolt action rifle " has " gun ", " 22caliber ", " magazine fed " and " Armalite AR30M ", so these lists are non-intersect.In the case, search system 120 intersects to obtain document for score the list canonical (regular) of charging to of Q1 and Q2.
If the third situation is applicable, although two phrase Q1 are uncorrelated with Q2 so, they have at least one common relevant phrases.For example, phrase " bolt action rifle " and " 22 " all can have " gun " as relevant phrases.In the case, search system 120 these two phrase Q1 of retrieval and Q2's charges to list and makes these lists intersect the list of documents that contains these two phrases to produce.
Then, search system 120 can be rapidly to each the document score in gained document.First, search system 120 is determined the mark adjusted value of each document.Mark adjusted value be in the relevant phrases bit vector at a document corresponding to query phrase Q1HeQ2 position position formed mask.For example, suppose that Q1 and Q2 are corresponding to the 3rd and the 6th dibit position in the relevant phrases bit vector of document d, and the place value of San Ge position is that the place value of (1,1) Qie Liuge position is (1,0), mark adjusted value is exactly bitmask " 000011000010 " so.Then, with mark adjusted value, shield the relevant phrases bit vector of document, then revised phrase bit vector is written into graduation function (as described below) for use in the body mark that calculates described document.
2.
graduation
A)
based on contained phrase, document is classified
Search system 120 provides the graduation stage 604, in this stage, by the bit vector of trooping of the phrase information in the relevant phrases bit vector of each document and query phrase, comes the document graduation in Search Results.The method is to classify according to phrase contained in document or informal " body hits ".
As mentioned above, for arbitrary given phrase g
j, g
jeach the document d charging in list have one for being identified in document d, to have which relevant phrases g
kwith which secondary relevant phrases g
itogether relevant phrases bit vector.The relevant phrases and the secondary relevant phrases that in one given document, exist are more, in the document relevant phrases bit vector of given phrase, just will more positions be set.The position arranging is more, and the numerical value of relevant phrases bit vector is just larger.
Therefore, in one embodiment, search system 120 is come the document sequence in Search Results according to the value of the relevant phrases bit vector of document.Contain with the document of the maximally related phrase of query phrase Q and will there is the relevant phrases bit vector of mxm., and these documents are by the document that is the highest ranking in Search Results.
Why more satisfactory the method is is that these documents are the most relevant to query phrase on theme because semantically.Note, the method can provide the document of height correlation, although these documents containing high-frequency input inquiry item q, this be because relevant phrases information not only for identifying pertinent literature, and then to these documents graduation.The document with low-frequency input inquiry item still can have a large amount of relevant phrases of query term, so it comparablely has high-frequency input inquiry item and phrase but more relevant without the document of relevant phrases.
In a second embodiment, search system 120 is come each document score according to the relevant phrases of the contained query phrase Q of each document in results set.This completes in the following way.
, will there is the phrase Qr relevant to described query phrase of a certain quantity N in given each query phrase Q, it can identify in phrase identifying.As mentioned above, according to relevant inquiring phrase Qr, from the information gain of query phrase Q, carry out the sequencing to relevant inquiring phrase Qr.Then, these relevant phrases are assigned and counted, be first the first relevant phrases Qr1 (, there is the relevant phrases Qr from the highest information gain of Q) assign N point, then be that next relevant phrases Qr2 assigns N-1 point, then for Q3 assigns N-2 point, the rest may be inferred, therefore last relevant phrases QrN is assigned as to 1 point.
Then, determine which the relevant phrases Qr that has query phrase Q, and give and be assigned to counting of each these relevant phrases Qr for described document, thereby to each the document score in Search Results.Then by described document according to mark sequence from high to low.
As another, improve, search system 120 can be from results set selected document.In some cases, document may be about many different themes; Especially all the more so for offering compared with long article.In many cases, than the document relevant to many different themes, the represented closely-related document of single theme during user prefers those and inquires about.
For selected rear a kind of document, search system 120 is used the cluster information of trooping in bit vector of query phrase, and removes any document of trooping wherein having more than critical mass.For example, search system 120 can be removed any document of trooping more than two that contains.This threshold value of trooping can pre-determine, or to be set by the user be a search parameter.
B)
based on anchor phrase, document is classified
Except the body hits based on query phrase Q come the document graduation in Search Results, in one embodiment, search system 120 query phrase Q and relevant inquiring phrase Qr that also the anchor based on to other documents occurs come document to classify.In one embodiment, search system 120 is calculated the mark of each document, and described mark is the function (for example, linear combination) of two marks (that is, body hit mark and anchor hits mark).
For example, the calculating of the document mark of a given document can be as follows:
Mark=.30* (body hits mark)+.70* (anchor hits mark).
.30 can adjust as required with the weights of .70.With the given query phrase Qp of mode as above, the body of a document hits the numerical value of relevant phrases bit vector that mark is exactly the mxm. of described document.Or search system 120 can directly obtain described value in the following way: search each the query phrase Q in index 150, access document, then access relevant phrases bit vector from the list of charging to of query phrase Q.
The anchor of document d hits the function that mark is the relevant phrases bit vector of query phrase Q, and wherein Q is the anchor item in the document of a citing document d.When directory system 110 is the document produce index in document databse, it is each phrase preservation list of documents, wherein said phrase is the anchor text in an outer link, simultaneously for each document is preserved the internal chaining (with the anchor text being associated) from other documents.The internal chaining of a document is quoting from other documents (citing document) to given document (for example, hyperlink).
Then in order to determine that the anchor of given document d hits mark, search system 120 use anchor phrase Q are in the upper iteration of the citing document R set (i=1-citing document number) of listing with index, then to following product summation:
Ri.Q. relevant phrases bit vector * D.Q. relevant phrases bit vector.
The product value here means the mark of the degree of anchor phrase Q and document D Topic relative.Here this mark is called " inbound minute number vector ".This product effectively by reference the relevant bits vector of the anchor phrase in document R carry out the relevant bits vector weighting to current document D.If citing document R itself relevant to query phrase Q the relevant phrases bit vector of high value (and therefore have), this can increase the validity of current document D mark so.Then, assembly hits mark and anchor hits mark to produce as mentioned above document mark.
Then, be each citing document R, obtain the relevant phrases bit vector of each anchor phrase Q.This is the tolerance to anchor phrase Q and document R theme correlation degree.Here this value is called to " departures minute number vector ".
Then from index 150, extract all (citing document, document is cited) right anchor phrase Q.Then by these right (departures minute number vector, inbound minute number vector) values that are associated, come these sequence.According to the difference of implementing, the arbitrary component in these components all can be used as main sort key, and another component can be minor sort key word.Then, the result after sequence is presented to user.The grade that can make those have the document that many phrases associated with the query hit as anchor to document sequence according to departures fractional component is the highest, thereby is " expert " document by these document representations.According to inbound document mark, sequence can make the grade of those documents that are often cited because of anchor item the highest.
3.
search based on phrase is personalized
Another aspect of search system 120 is carry out the graduation of self-defined Search Results or make its personalization 606 according to the model of user's special interests.In this way, the document that those more may be relevant to user's interest can come the higher level in Search Results.The personalization of Search Results is as follows.
As preparation, more just inquiry and document (these two available phrases represent) define user interest (for example,, for model).For an inputted search inquiry, an inquiry is to be represented by the relevant phrases of query phrase Q, Qr and the expansion phrase Qe of query phrase Qp.Therefore, this group term and phrase represent the implication of inquiry.Then, use the phrase being associated with page to represent the implication of document.As mentioned above, given inquiry and document, determine the relevant phrases of described document from the body mark (relevant bits vector) of the genitive phrase of described literature index indication.Finally, can subscriber's meter be shown as to the union of a group polling and one group of document according to the phrase that represents each element in these elements.The document that can select previous Search Results from user, or conventionally for example, by (browsing corpus, the document of access on internet), the user side instrument of usage monitoring user action and destination, determines the specific document of representative of consumer included in described set.
Construction and user's model are as follows to carry out personalized graduate process.
First, be a given user, last K the inquiry that preservation was accessed and the list of P document, wherein K and P are better is respectively approximately 250.These lists can be kept in user account data storehouse, and wherein user is by registration or carrys out identification by browser cookies.For a given user, these lists will be empty when user provides inquiry for the first time.
Then, from user, receive inquiry q.In mode as above, retrieve relevant phrases Qr and the expansion phrase of q.This forms interrogation model.
For example, in first pass (, if do not store any Query Information of user), after search system 120 runnings, just return in Search Results and inquire about relevant document to user, and not other self-defined graduation.
User side browser tool monitors user for example, by () which document in Search Results of having clicked document links and accesses in Search Results.For these the basic accessed documents as which phrase of selection, a part for user model will be become.This type of accessed document for each, the model of literature of the described document of search system 120 retrieval, it is a row phrase relevant to described document.Each phrase relevant to described accessed document is added in user model.
Then, the given phrase relevant to an accessed document, can determine and trooping that these phrases are associated from the bit vector of trooping of each phrase.For each, troop, by containing the relevant phrases list that cluster number or the bit vector of trooping as above represent, search phrase determine as described in each phrase of the group member that troops.Then, this cluster number is added in user model.In addition, for each this type of cluster, preserve a counter, and the phrase at every turn that being trooped add user model in time, counter is increased progressively.As described below, these technology can be used as power.Therefore, from user, by access, express the document of interest included phrase in existing trooping and set up user model.
Same universal method can focus on more accurately captures user and shows than only accessing the more high-grade phrase information of document (to this, user may be just be that judgement document is relevant at needs).For example, phrase is collected and in user model, may be limited to those users and print, preserve, be stored as and like or link, transfer by telegram to another user or in browser window, open the elongated segment time document of (for example, 10 minutes).These and other action all shows the more high-grade interest to document.
When receiving another inquiry from user, retrieval relevant inquiring phrase Qr.Phrase listed in these relevant inquiring phrase Qr and user model is intersected, to determine in described inquiry and user model have which phrase simultaneously.The masked bits vector of the relevant phrases Qr inquiring about described in initialization.As mentioned above, this bit vector is a dibit vector.For each the relevant phrases Qr that is present in the described inquiry in user model simultaneously, two positions of this relevant phrases are set in masked bits vector.Therefore, the representative of masked bits vector is present in the relevant phrases in inquiry and user model simultaneously.
Then, vectorial by making relevant phrases bit vector and the described masked bits vector of each document in current search results set carry out shielding described relevant phrases bit vector with operation (ANDing) by masked bits.This reaches the effect of hitting mark by masked bits vector adjustment body mark and anchor.Then, calculate as previously mentioned body mark and the anchor mark of document and be presented to user.The method mainly needs document to have the query phrase in the user model of being included in to be discharged to higher level.
As the alternate embodiment that can not force aforementioned strict constraint, masked bits vector can be lined up array, so that each can be used to the counting weighting of trooping to the relevant phrases in user model.Therefore, each counting of trooping is multiplied by 0 or 1, thereby effectively makes to be counted as 0 or keep former counting.Then, just as the right to use, with these countings, itself take advantage of the relevant phrases of each document of scoring.The benefit of the method is still to allow suitably to score which does not have query phrase as the document of relevant phrases.
Finally, user model can be limited to current dialogue, wherein dialogue is the time interval of duration of response in search, after this dialogue, and dump user model.Or, sustainable a period of time of user model of a given user, then make its weights decline or expired.
IV.
result shows
Display system 130 receives the Search Results through score and sequence from search system 120, and the operation of carrying out its hetero-organization, annotate and troop, and then result is presented to user.These operations are conducive to the content that user understands Search Results, remove reproducible results, and the more representational sampling to Search Results is provided.Fig. 7 illustrates the following main function operation of display system 120:
700: according to the theme document of trooping;
702: produce document description;
704: remove and repeat document.
Each operation in these operations adopts together with the revised Search Results 703 of output with inputted search result 701.As shown in Figure 7, the order of these operations is independently, and can change according to the needs of a given embodiment, therefore, and mode that can streamline rather than parallelly as shown in the figure carry these inputs.
1.
the dynamic cataloging showing produces
For a given inquiry, conventionally can return to individual, even possible several thousand documents that meet described inquiry of hundreds of.In many cases, although content is different each other for some document, it is enough relevant to form the significant pertinent literature of a group, is exactly substantially one and troops.Yet most of users can not see the document beyond first 30 or 40 in Search Results.Therefore, for example, if front () 100 documents are trooped from three, but ensuing 100 documents represent that other 4 are trooped, so without under further adjusting, user can not see these documents below conventionally, but in fact these documents may be very relevant to user's inquiry, because they have represented various different themes associated with the query.Therefore, need here for user provides the sample of trooping from each document, thereby represent the wider selected works from the different documents of Search Results to user.Display system 130 is carried out as follows.
As other aspects of homologous ray 100, display system 130 is utilized the relevant phrases bit vector of each document d in Search Results.In more detail, for each query phrase Q, and for each the document d in list that charges to of Q, in relevant phrases bit vector indication document, there is which relevant phrases Qr.Then in the literature collection in Search Results, for each relevant phrases Qr, by adding up to corresponding to the place value of QrWei position, determine the counting that represents that how many documents contain relevant phrases Qr.When to Search Results summation and sequence, the relevant phrases Qr that indication is the most frequently occurred, each relevant phrases Qr wherein will be that a document is trooped.The relevant phrases the most frequently occurring is first to troop, and gets its relevant phrases Qr as its title, and for the highest three to five, trooping, the rest may be inferred.Therefore, identify each the highest trooping, got phrase Qr as the title of trooping or title.
Now, in the future individual each document of trooping is presented to user in every way.In an application, can show the document of trooping from each of fixed qty, for example in each document score at front 10 document.In Another Application, can be shown as the document of trooping from each of ratio quantity.Therefore, if there are 100 documents in Search Results, wherein 50 from trooping 1,30 from trooping 2,10 from trooping 3,7 from trooping 4, and 3 from trooping 5, and wish only to show 20 documents, the selection of document is as follows so: 10 documents are from trooping 1,7 documents are from 2,2 documents of trooping from trooping 3, and 1 document is from trooping 4.Then, in the suitable name of trooping, be referred to as under title after grouping, each document is showed to user.
For example, suppose that search inquiry is " blue merle agility training (blue Gadamer Agility Training) ", receives 100 documents to this search system 120.Search system 120 will be identified " blue merle " and " agility training " as query phrase.The relevant phrases of these query phrases is:
“blue?merle”：“Australian?Sphepherd”、“red?merle”、“tricolor”、“aussie”；
“agility?training”：“weave?poles”、“teeter”、“tunnel”、“obstacle”、“border?collie”。
Then display system 130 determines the counting of the document number that expression contains described phrase for each above-mentioned relevant phrases of each query phrase.For example, suppose that phrase " weave poles " appears in 75 documents in 100 documents, " teeter " appears in 60 documents, and " red merle " appears in 50 documents.So, first troops is called " weave poles ", and has the document of trooping from this of selected quantity; Second troops is called " teeter ", and same existence selected quantity; The rest may be inferred.For fixing a demonstration, can select 10 documents of trooping from each.Show in proportion the document of trooping from each using with respect to the proportional quantity of total document number.
2. the document description based on theme
Second function of display system 130 is to create 702 document descriptions, and described document description can insert in the Search Results demonstration of each document.It is basis that existing relevant phrases in each document is take in these explanations, and what content therefore contributes to user to understand described document in mode associated with the query is in terms of content about.Document description can be general, also can be to user individual.
A)
general motif document explanation
As mentioned above, a given inquiry, search system 120 is first determined relevant inquiring phrase Qr and the expansion phrase of query phrase, is then inquiry identification pertinent literature.Each document in display system 130 access search results is also carried out following operation.
First, display system 130 is classified to document sentence by the instance number of query phrase Q, relevant inquiring phrase Qr and expansion phrase Qp, and then is the counting of each sentence preservation Zhe Sange aspect of document.
Then, by these, counted sentence is sorted, wherein the first sort key is the counting of query phrase Q, and the second sort key is the counting of relevant inquiring phrase Qr, and last sort key is the counting of expansion phrase Qp.
Finally, for example, by the individual sentence of front N (5) after sequence as document description.This can be organized to sentence format, and be included in the document demonstration in revised Search Results 703.The document of the some in Search Results is repeated to this process, and can be under each user's request carry out on request during one page result.
B)
the personalized document description based on theme
In the personalized embodiment of Search Results is provided, can make equally document description personalized to reflect represented user interest in user model.Display system 130 is carried out as follows.
First, as mentioned above, display system is by making to inquire about relevant phrases Qr and the crossing next definite and user-dependent relevant phrases of user model (it has listed the phrase appearing in the document of being accessed by user).
Then, display system 130 is carried out the stable sequence to this group user relevant phrases Ur according to the value of bit vector itself, the list after sequence is prepended in the list of inquiry relevant phrases Qr, and removes any Repetitive phrases.Stable sort has retained the existing order of the phrase of same grade.This generation and inquiry or user-dependent relevant phrases set, be called set Qu.
Now, to be similar to the mode of above-mentioned general document description method, display system 130 is used this orderly list of phrases as the graduate basis of sentence in each document in Search Results.Therefore, for a given document, display system 130 is classified to the sentence in document by the instance number of each user's relevant phrases and inquiry relevant phrases Qu, and comes the sentence sequence after graduation according to query counts, the last expansion phrase number sequence based on each this type of phrase.And former, the order of sort key is query phrase Q, relevant inquiring phrase Qr and expansion phrase Qp, but the order of the sort key is here user's relevant phrases Qr of grade from high to low.
Again, the document in Search Results is repeated to this process (on request or in advance).So for each this type of document, gained document description comprises the sentence from N highest ranking of described document.Therefore herein, these sentences will be the sentence with the highest user's relevant phrases Ur quantity, represent the critical sentence (at least according to the information of capturing in user model) representing in document with the maximally related concept of user and theme.

repeating document detects and removes
In the Big-corpus such as internet, it is very common wherein at many diverse locations, having the Multi-instance of same document or a plurality of parts of a document.For example, one piece of given news article that You Yi Information Bureau (for example, Associated Press (Associated Press)) produces may be replicated on a dozen or a dozen above website or each newspaper.Respond search inquiry and comprise that all these repeat documents and only can make the unnecessary information of burden for users, rather than usefully response inquiry.Therefore, display system 130 provides another for identifying those and may repeat each other or approaching the document repeating and only comprise the ability 704 of a document in these documents at Search Results.Therefore, user receives more diversified and more powerful results set, and those documents that repeat each other of needn't losing time.What display system 130 provided is functional as follows.
Each document that display system 130 is processed in search result set 701.For each document d, first display system 130 determines the list of the relevant phrases R being associated with described document.For each phrase in these relevant phrases, display system 130, to the sentence graduation in document, is then selected the sentence of N (for example, 5 to 10) highest ranking according to the frequency of occurrences of each phrase in these phrases.Then this group sentence is combined to storage with described document.A method of doing is like this to connect these selected sentences, then utilizes hash table to store document identification symbol.
Then, display system 130 compares the selected sentence of other documents in the selected sentence of each document d and Search Results 701, if these selected sentence couplings (in permissible error), so just think that described document repeats, and one of them document are removed from Search Results.For example, display system 130 can be done hash by the sentence after connecting, if had an article or item in a contract of described hashed value in hash table, this just shows current document and the document repetition of hash not long ago.Then, display system 130 can be upgraded this table with the document ID of a document in described document.Preferably, display system 130 keeps the document of that higher page grade with document validity or the irrelevant tolerance of other inquiries.In addition, display system 130 can be revised index 150 with except deduplication document, and it be there will not be in the Search Results of any inquiry in the future.
Directory system 110 can directly be applied identical repetition document removal method.When creeping a document, carry out above-mentioned document description method to obtain selected sentence, then these sentences are done to hash.If hash table is filled up, that again, the document of newly creeping is considered to be the repetition document of last document.Similarly, directory system 110 can then comprise that has the document of higher page grade or the irrelevant tolerance of other inquiries.
