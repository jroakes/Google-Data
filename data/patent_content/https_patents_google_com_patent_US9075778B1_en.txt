Aspects of the method 300 operate to identify one or more likely navigation destinations from a set of navigation indicators, and then prerender the identified navigation destinations.
- the method 300 may be performed by a computing device, such as the computing device 200 , to eliminate delays in the user web browsing experience by prerendering web pages that are identified as likely navigation targets by the user.
- the method 300 may be performed by elements of the browser 206 , the navigation prediction module 208 , and the prerender module 210 acting together. While aspects of the method 300 are described with respect to the computing device 200 , the method 300 may also be performed by the server 104 , or any device with hardware and/or software designed to accept instructions.
- the computing device 200 receives one or more indicators of navigational intent.
- Navigational intent may be any action that would tend to indicate that the user will generate a particular network request, such as a request for a particular web page.
- the indicators may provide metrics by which to determine what the particular request will be, such as a confidence value.
- the user may navigate to a certain web page, from which they generally navigate to another certain web page based upon their browsing history, or the user may move his mouse cursor towards a particular hyperlink embedded within a web page.
- the indicator is received from a remote server, such as a search engine that embeds an indicator within search results, indicating that most users that submit a particular search query select a particular search result.
- the computing device 200 attempts to predict the most likely navigation event. In short, the computing device 200 makes a best guess of to where the user is likely to navigate next, based upon the indicator. Methods of performing this prediction are described below. (See FIGS. 4-10 ).
- the computing device 200 prerenders the content from the predicted next navigation event as determined at stage 304 .
- the prerendering process may include storing a prerendered web page within a browser, such as the prerendered web page 218 .
- the computing device 200 may prerender a single web page predicted as the most likely navigation event, or the computing device 200 may prerender multiple pages.
- the computing device 200 determines the number of pages to prerender based upon one or more system capabilities of the computing device 200 , such as available system resources, available network bandwidth, processor speed, installed memory, and the like. In some aspects, the number of pages to prerender may be configurable in one or more user settings.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 400 for predicting a navigation event based on a client navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 400 provides for storing a navigation history for a user, and predicting a next navigation event based upon a navigation history of a particular user.
- the method 400 may be performed by a computing device such as the computing device 200 .
- the method 400 may be performed by a navigation prediction module executing on a processor, such as the navigation prediction module 208 .
- the computing device 200 tracks a user navigation history.
- the computing device 200 may store records of web pages visited by the user, such as the browsing history commonly maintained in web browsers.
- the browsing history may comprise the URLs of the web pages visited by the user, the order in which the URLs were visited, and the manner in which the user selected the URL (e.g. whether the URL was a clicked hyperlink, typed into an address bar, a redirect operation from another web page, etc.).
- the computing device 200 determines a most likely navigation event or events based upon the user navigation history.
- the most likely navigation events may be determined by identifying the globally most visited pages for the user, or the navigation events may be associated with one or more current criteria. For example, the computing device 200 may examine the user's navigation history to determine that, when the user is viewing a particular news web page, they almost always select a link to the top news story on that page, or that when the user first opens the browser in the morning, they are likely to navigate to their bank account page to check their daily balance.
- the computing device 200 may employ various rules, heuristics, and filters to determine the most likely navigation event from the user history.
- the computing device 200 may associate each navigation event with a particular confidence value, indicating the likelihood that the user will select each navigation event. These confidence values may then be used to sort the navigation events to determine the most likely navigation event. A method to determine a confidence value for a given navigation event is described further below (See FIG. 5 ).
- the computing device 200 reports the most likely navigation event as the predicted navigation event. For example, these predicted most likely navigation event may then be employed by the method described above (See FIG. 3 ) to facilitate prerendering of the web pages associated with the most likely navigation event.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 500 for generating a client navigation history comprising URL transitional pairs in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 500 creates a user navigation history that includes data that records source and destination URL pairs to determine a probability that a user intends to navigate to a particular destination page from a particular source page.
- the data may comprise a map of each source URL the user has visited along with the destination URLs visited from each source URL.
- the map data structure provides a straightforward way to estimate the probability that a user will navigate to a particular link based upon past navigation history.
- user navigation events such as hyperlink selection or URL entry within an address bar
- monitoring of user data is performed in an “opt-in” manner, and all navigation data is stored locally except where the user gives express consent to share the navigation data.
- a data entry is created at stage 504 .
- the data entry includes the source page (e.g., the page the user was viewing when the navigation event occurred), and the URL associated with the navigation event (e.g., the address associated with a selected hyperlink or the URL entered within the address bar).
- the data entry may be created within a map data structure, indexed by the URL of the source page.
- the map data structure may take the following format: [URL A] ⁇ [‘a’],3],[‘b’,4],[‘c’,1] ⁇ (Eq. 1)
- URL A describes the source URL.
- the entries for ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ each refer to destination URLs visited from the source URL A.
- the numbers after each of the destination URLs identify the frequency with which each destination URL was visited from URL A. Every time a new destination URL is visited from URL A, the new destination URL is added to the map (e.g., when a new URL ‘d’ is visited, the entry [‘d’, 1] is added). If a previously visited destination URL is visited from URL A, the frequency value for the destination URL is incremented (e.g., when URL ‘a’ is visited again, the frequency value is updated to 4).
- the frequency data may be used to determine a probability for each possible destination URL from each source URL, at stage 506 .
- the probability of visiting a particular destination URL from a particular source URL may be determined by dividing the frequency of visits to the destination URL by the total frequency of visits to the source URL.
- the map data structure may be sorted by the number of visits to each destination URL. For example, the map described in Eq. 1 might be ordered: [URL A] ⁇ [‘b’,4],[‘a’,3],[‘c’,1] ⁇ (Eq. 2)
- Ordering the map in this manner allows the map to track the most frequently visited destination URL without the need to recalculate the probability of each destination URL for every visit to the page.
- the probability values are used to predict the next navigation event.
- the next navigation event may be used to determine the target web page for prerendering.
- the prediction process may also include various heuristics, such as requiring a minimum frequency of visits to a destination URL before prerendering, prerendering all destination URLs with greater than a threshold probability value, or the like.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 600 for predicting a navigation event based on a client navigation history comprising URL transitional pairs in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- a web page is loaded within a web browser.
- the web page is associated with a particular URL, and this URL likely contains one or more destination links for navigation.
- this URL likely contains one or more destination links for navigation.
- any links are identified with the browser for lookup in the navigation history.
- the probability value for each link is looked up in the navigation history map data structure. For example, in a map data structure indexed by source URL (e.g., the URL of the loaded page), the method may immediately return the destination page associated with the source URL that has the highest probability value.
- the list of links currently available on the page is compared to the list of links within the map. For example, a dynamically generated web page may not always contain the same links. As it would not be suitable to prerender a web page that cannot be selected (e.g., a destination link that is in the history associated with the source URL with a high frequency, but not on the currently displayed web page), the destination link with the highest probability that is also displayed on the page may be identified as the most probably navigation event.
- the link or links with the highest probability value or values are identified as predicted navigation events. These predicted navigation events may be used for prerendering as described above.
- the method may identify multiple links as predicted links where system resources are sufficient to prerender multiple pages, or only the link with the highest probability may be identified where a single prerender instance is supported.
- various heuristics may also be applied to the prediction step, including only prerendering where there is a minimum frequency associated with the destination page, prerendering all destination URLs with greater than a threshold probability value, or the like.
- the systems and methods described above advantageously provide for an improved browsing experience.
- the browser can perform prerender operations to minimize the amount of time users wait for web pages to load.
- Multiple methods to perform the prerender operations provide a flexible and robust system for determining the next navigation event.
