This application claims priority to, and the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e), of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/897,206, filed 29 Oct. 2013, the entire contents and substance of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth below.
BACKGROUND
-
In recent years, there has been a proliferation of consumer digital cameras and camera-equipped mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). The cost of such devices and digital media storage continue to decrease, while usage continues to increase. Accordingly, there has been an explosion in the amount of digital image and video data produced and stored. However, much of this data consists of long-running or unedited content such as unsorted photo collections, home videos, or surveillance feeds.
-
A photo or video summary can provide a visual synopsis, or a “trailer” of sorts, to quickly reveal the subject matter of media content and highlight the more salient portions. When browsing digital content, for example, on a social content-sharing platform, being able to identify quickly the more interesting parts of a video can save significant time. Moreover, video summaries can provide a compact but rich feature set for activity-recognition heuristics.
-
To create compact summaries from unedited content, existing summarization techniques may prioritize selection of higher quality content or segments with significant motion or activity. However, conventional techniques may overemphasize these factors to the detriment of providing comprehensive coverage of the input content. Moreover, conventional techniques are generally too computationally intensive to be effectively implemented on computationally constrained mobile devices. Accordingly, content captured at a camera-equipped mobile device often must be offloaded to another computing device for effective summarization.
SUMMARY
-
Some or all of the above deficiencies may be addressed by certain implementations of the disclosed technology. Certain implementations include techniques for improved content coverage in automatically-generated content summaries Moreover, in some implementations, the techniques may be implemented effectively on computationally constrained mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and digital cameras. Accordingly, implementations of the disclosed technology may reduce time and user effort expended when browsing media content, or aid activity-recognition techniques.
-
According to an example implementation, a method is provided. The method may include receiving content to be summarized. The method may further include defining, based on the content, a plurality of content segments. The method may yet further include, defining, based on a determined similarity between content segments from the plurality of content segments, a plurality of content segment clusters. Each content segment cluster from the plurality of content segment clusters may be associated with one or more content segments from the plurality of content segments. The method may also include, determining a plurality of representative content segments including a representative content segment for each content segment cluster from the plurality of content segment clusters. For a first content segment cluster from the plurality of content segment clusters, a first representative content segment may be determined by calculating a diffusion value for each content segment associated with the first content segment cluster, and responsive to calculating the diffusion value for each content segment, selecting, as the first representative content segment for the first content segment cluster, the content segment with a highest calculated diffusion value. The diffusion value may be calculated based on a quality value associated with the respective content segment and a proximity of the respective content segment with other content segments associated with the first content segment cluster. The method may include selecting, to be included in a summary of the content, one or more representative content segments from the plurality of representative content segments, wherein a magnitude of the one or more representative content segments exceeds a predetermined threshold.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
-
Implementations of the disclosed technology include techniques for improved content coverage in automatically-generated content summaries. According to certain implementations, content coverage may be improved by grouping elements, e.g., subsets of images from a collection or segments of a video sequence, into clusters based on similarity between the elements; determining the diffusion in each cluster to reveal the optimal “representative” of each cluster; and selecting a subset of the cluster representatives providing a desired length or duration of summary while improving or maximizing secondary factors.
-
Various types of input content may be used with implementations of the disclosed technology, including groups of images, video clips, or other multimedia content such as text and audio. In some implementations, contiguous content may manually or programmatically be divided into discrete portions, for example, a lengthy video divided into a number of short clips.
-
In some implementations, the disclosed techniques may be implemented effectively on a computationally-constrained mobile device. In other words, the processing required may be computationally feasible for execution on a smartphone or similar device.

-
Research has shown that human users tend to maximize value along three principle axes when creating summaries of digital photo and video content: quality, diversity, and coverage. Conventional techniques for automatic generation of content summaries often fail to address these aspects sufficiently, and in particular, do not address content coverage. In contrast, implementations of the present disclosed technology include techniques for improved content coverage in automatically-generated content summaries.
-
When summarizing media content, it may be useful to consider the breadth of coverage of the summarized content in addition to other factors, such as intrinsic value (referred to herein as “quality” or “interestingness”) or diversity of the input content. For example, if a user has captured fifty images or videos, with twenty of those images or videos featuring a particular subject-matter or object, at least a portion of the twenty may be desirable to be included in a summary of the captured fifty images or videos—even if none of the twenty are determined to have a high quality or interestingness value when compared with the rest of the content. Thus, if a user has captured content disproportionately directed to a particular subject, that subject is likely inherently meaningful/interesting to that user and should be included in a summary of the content—even if conventional techniques for generating content summaries might indicate otherwise.
-
According to certain implementations, content coverage may be improved by grouping elements, e.g., subsets of images from a collection or segments of a video sequence, into clusters based on similarity between the elements; determining the diffusion in each cluster to reveal the optimal “representative” of each cluster; and selecting a subset of the cluster representatives providing a desired length or duration of summary while improving or maximizing secondary factors. In an alternate implementation, quality, diversity and coverage may be instead optimized in a single step using a global optimization technique, for example, Determinantal Point Process optimization. Such alternate implementations, however, may be too computationally intensive to run on computing devices with limited processing power, such as smartphones, tablets, and digital cameras.
Clustering Elements
-
In some implementations, the input content may be pre-divided into discrete elements, such as individual photos from a vacation or a series of short clips. In another implementation, the input content may be broken into smaller elements as a part of summarization, for example, dividing a fifteen-minute video into a number of five- to ten-second clips. The elements may then be clustered or grouped by similarity, according to various metrics such as quality, content similarity, temporal similarity, etc. Clustering the content elements may improve or ensure diversity in a generated content summary. In some implementations, the actual data embodying the content may not necessarily be altered. Instead, portions of content may be compared in-place. Techniques for dividing content into subsets and grouping the subsets into clusters by similarity are known in the art and are not further discussed herein. Quality may refer to any of a variety of factors determined to be interesting to human users, including detected motion, objects, or faces, color characteristics, content fidelity, or the presence of audio features, etc.
-
In some implementations, there is no condition on a minimum or maximum number of clusters. In another implementation, the number of clusters may be dictated by a desired target summary length or size, e.g., duration of summary or number of images. Accordingly, in such implementations, the number of clusters should be sufficiently large such that, after choosing a representative clip from one or more clusters, the total magnitude (e.g., duration, number of images, etc.) of the chosen representative elements will meet or exceed a target magnitude.
-
In another implementation, a particular stopping distance criterion may be specified. For example, a limit on the number of clusters may be specified as a percent of the total number of input images or clips. However, this approach may not work well with diverse albums. In another example, clustering may be stopped based on the distance or similarity between clusters. In such implementations, certain coverage as well as diversity may be ensured.
Selecting a Cluster Representative by Diffusion
-
Once content has been clustered, a next step is to choose a representative of each cluster to participate further in the selection processes. According to certain implementations, a quality diffusion may be used to select a representative for each cluster. FIG. 3 is a flow diagram 300 illustrating selection of representatives for content clusters based on diffusion, according to an example implementation. As shown in FIG. 3, a determined quality diffusion 321 for a segment may be based on a quality 311 of the segment, and a distance to 312 its neighbor elements in the same cluster. In some implementations, the segment with the highest or best diffused value may be chosen as a cluster representative 331.
-
An example procedure for such selection by diffusion follows:
-
|
For each element I |
For each neighbor j of i |
diffusion_constant = (dist[i][j] + |
normalization_parameter) * (dist[i][j] + normalization_parameter); |
diffused_qual[i] += qual[i] * qual[j]/diffusion_constant; |
end loop |
end loop |
representative = arg max diffused_quality[ ]. |
|
-
In some implementations, the normalization parameter may be chosen empirically and used to balance the coverage and quality. Intuitively speaking, each input element “diffuses” its quality to the neighbors and each element's resultant quality is the aggregated diffused values from all its neighbors. For example, if an element has very high quality and close-in-distance neighbors, then that element may be rewarded more. An element that has no high quality neighbors may be rewarded less. As a result, a representative element selected based on diffusion may represent a cluster with improved consideration of both quality and coverage. In one example, if a cluster contains five similar elements of quality 0.5 and a sixth element which is a little different than the five elements but has a quality is 0.6, the better representative may be from the first five elements.
Selecting Among Cluster Representatives
-
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram 400 illustrating selection among representative segments for inclusion in a content summary, according to an example implementation. In some implementations, once a representative has been selected for each cluster, as shown in FIG. 3, a subset of the cluster representatives may be chosen for inclusion in the content summary. An example procedure for such selection follows:
-
- 1. Each cluster representative's quality is weighted by a parameter that is determined by the size of the cluster that it represents, as shown in block 411. The larger the cluster, the higher the quality becomes. Thus, coverage may be rewarded.
- 2. An objective function is declared that when maximized will increase the quality and diversity of the elements, as shown in block 421.
- 3. A greedy optimization strategy is used to maximize the objective function, as shown in block 431.
-
In some implementations, the objective function may be defined to reward coverage and diversity as follows:
-
- For rewarding coverage: qualnew[i]=f (clustersize)*qual[i]. The larger the cluster, larger the value off
- For rewarding diversity, there may be two types of diversity defined:
- Type 0 may be based on distance from the nearest neighbor. diversity=ΣiεSminjεs\id (i,j)
- Type 1 may be based on aggregate distances from all the neighbors. diversity=ΣiεSΣjεS\id(i,j)
Based on these definitions, the objective function (take type 0 diversity, for example) may be defined as:
- maxsεSΣiεSminjεS\id(i,j)+λiεSqualnew[i],
where λ is a parameter to balance the quality and diversity. Note that the quality here is already weighted for coverage. The objective function may be maximized for the required number of subset elements.
-
In some implementations, a greedy elimination strategy may be used to find a solution. In other words, a worst element is eliminated from the pool until the desired number of elements needed is reached. An example procedure for such a greedy strategy follows:
-
- 1. S={1, 2, . . . , N}; II start with all the cluster owners;
- 2. while |S|>required number of elements, then:
- a. find the “worst” element that minimizes the loss,
-
Manual User Constraints
-
According to certain implementations, manually edited or user selectable constraints may be used with the disclosed techniques. Manually edited constraints may include two categories, inclusions and exclusions. Exclusions may be photos clips, or other elements that a user has explicitly removed or flagged for non-inclusion in a content summary. Inclusions may be elements that a user has marked or otherwise indicated for inclusion in a content summary.
-
In some implementations, further inclusions or exclusions may be made automatically based on manually edited constraints. For example, elements determined to be similar to a manually excluded element may also be excluded from a content summary. In another implementation, an exclusion or inclusion may be implied based on manual user activity. For example, clips that a user has explicitly added or manually edited may be automatically considered inclusions. In another example, photos tagged as containing nudity or inappropriate content may be automatically considered exclusions.
-
According to certain implementations, exclusions may be screened or removed from an input content set before clustering and thus exempt from the remainder of the content summarization process. Moreover, any clip or segment that overlaps with an exclusion element may also be left out. In another implementation, exclusions may be present for clustering. However, once clusters are determined, all other elements belonging to a cluster containing an exclusion element may also be excluded. Thus, elements determined to be similar to a manually excluded segment may also be excluded.
-
According to certain implementations, inclusion elements may be automatically made representatives of their respective clusters. Accordingly, duplicates or elements redundant to the inclusion element may be prevented from appearing in the summary without compromising coverage.
-
In some implementations, inclusion elements may be treated normally during clustering. However, if more than one inclusion element is grouped in a single cluster, then the single cluster may be divided into or redefined as several sub-clusters with each sub-cluster having one inclusion element. The other elements of the original cluster may be assigned to the sub-cluster with the nearest or most similar inclusion.
-
In another implementation, a first element that overlaps most with each inclusion element may be replaced by the inclusion element. The quality and distance metrics may be transferred to the inclusion element from the overlapping element being replaced.
-
In some implementations, during post-clustering selection, inclusion elements may be selected ahead of normal cluster representatives. Cluster representatives determined to be similar to inclusion clips also be less preferred over cluster representatives.
-
In another implementation, an inclusion element may be nonetheless excluded from a summary if it fails to meet certain criteria, such as a minimum length. In another implementation, global criteria such as a minimum required quality may not apply to inclusion elements. In another implementation, where an inclusion element and an exclusion element overlap, the inclusion element may override the exclusion.
-
In yet another implementation, both inclusions and exclusions may be enforced or ignored based on how they change a duration of a generated summary.

FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a method 500 for providing improved content coverage in automatically-generated content summaries As shown in FIG. 5, the method 500 starts in block 502, and, according to an example implementation, includes receiving, at a computing device, content to be summarized. In block 504, the method 500 includes defining, by the computing device, and based on the content, a plurality of content segments. In block 506, the method 500 includes defining, by the computing device, and based on a determined similarity between content segments from the plurality of content segments, a plurality of content segment clusters, each content segment cluster from the plurality of content segment clusters associated with one or more content segments from the plurality of content segments.
-
In block 508, the method 500 includes determining, by the computing device, a plurality of representative content segments including a representative content segment for each content segment cluster from the plurality of content segment clusters, wherein, for a first content segment cluster from the plurality of content segment clusters, a first representative content segment is determined by: calculating a diffusion value for each content segment associated with the first content segment cluster, the diffusion value calculated based on a quality value associated with the respective content segment and a proximity of the respective content segment with other content segments associated with the first content segment cluster; and responsive to calculating the diffusion value for each content segment, selecting, as the first representative content segment for the first content segment cluster, the content segment with a highest calculated diffusion value.
-
In block 510, the method 500 includes selecting, by the computing device, and to be included in a summary of the content, one or more representative content segments from the plurality of representative content segments, wherein a magnitude of the one or more representative content segments exceeds a predetermined threshold

Certain implementations of the disclosed technology are described above with reference to block and flow diagrams of systems and methods and/or computer program products according to example implementations of the disclosed technology. It will be understood that one or more blocks of the block diagrams and flow diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and flow diagrams, respectively, may be implemented by computer-executable program instructions. Likewise, some blocks of the block diagrams and flow diagrams may not necessarily need to be performed in the order presented, or may not necessarily need to be performed at all, according to some implementations of the disclosed technology.
-
These computer-executable program instructions may be loaded onto a general-purpose computer, a special-purpose computer, a processor, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a particular machine, such that the instructions that execute on the computer, processor, or other programmable data processing apparatus create means for implementing one or more functions specified in the flow diagram block or blocks. These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that may direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means that implement one or more functions specified in the flow diagram block or blocks. As an example, implementations of the disclosed technology may provide for a computer program product, comprising a computer-usable medium having a computer-readable program code or program instructions embodied therein, said computer-readable program code adapted to be executed to implement one or more functions specified in the flow diagram block or blocks. The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational elements or steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer-implemented process such that the instructions that execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide elements or steps for implementing the functions specified in the flow diagram block or blocks.
-
Accordingly, blocks of the block diagrams and flow diagrams support combinations of means for performing the specified functions, combinations of elements or steps for performing the specified functions and program instruction means for performing the specified functions. It will also be understood that each block of the block diagrams and flow diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and flow diagrams, may be implemented by special-purpose, hardware-based computer systems that perform the specified functions, elements or steps, or combinations of special-purpose hardware and computer instructions.
-
While certain implementations of the disclosed technology have been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and various implementations, it is to be understood that the disclosed technology is not to be limited to the disclosed implementations, but on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.
-
This written description uses examples to disclose certain implementations of the disclosed technology, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice certain implementations of the disclosed technology, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods. The patentable scope of certain implementations of the disclosed technology is defined in the claims, and may include other examples that occur to those skilled in the art. Such other examples are intended to be within the scope of the claims if they have structural elements that do not differ from the literal language of the claims, or if they include equivalent structural elements with insubstantial differences from the literal language of the claims.
