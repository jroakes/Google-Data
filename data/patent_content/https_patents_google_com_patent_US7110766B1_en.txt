Definitions
- Propagation conditions from cellular base stations to mobile stations can change rapidly given terrain, weather, the location of the mobile station, etc. If a mobile station cannot detect and establish contact with a new base station before the signal from the existing base station fades away, the call may get dropped.
- the current method of recognizing and establishing communication with a new base station uses a handoff list for each base station sector, where each handoff list contains handoff target sectors in all directions. When the mobile station has more than one handoff leg, the list from each sector is combined using a round-robin selection process to arrive at a handoff list usually containing 20 handoff candidates. The time required for this process is not trivial and the results can include handoff candidates that have an extremely low probability of ever being used given the current handoff state of the mobile station.

- Wireless communication systems are well known and consist of many types including land mobile radio, cellular radiotelephone (inclusive of analog cellular, digital cellular, personal communication systems (PCS) and wideband digital cellular systems), and other communication system types.
- cellular radiotelephone communication systems for example, a number of communication cells are typically comprised of one or more Base Stations (BS's) coupled to one or more Base Station Controllers (BSCs) and forming a Radio Access Network (RAN).
- the BSCs may, in turn, be coupled to a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) that provides a connection between the RAN and an external network, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), as well as interconnection to other RANs.
- MSC Mobile Switching Center
- PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network
- Each BS provides communication services to a mobile station (MS) located in a coverage area serviced by the BS via a communication resource that includes a forward link for transmitting signals to, and a reverse link for receiving signals from, the MS.
- FIG. 1 representatively illustrates a wireless network 100 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- Wireless network 100 includes a RAN 104 comprising multiple BSs 106 – 108 that are each coupled to a BSC 110 .
- RAN 104 may be coupled to an MSC 114 , and MSC 114 may in turn be coupled to an external network 116 and provide a communication link between the external network, or other RANs, and RAN 104 .
- RAN 104 is a CDMA network, but may also be a GSM network, and the like.
- Wireless network 100 may further include a mobile station 102 coupled to BS 106 via wireless link 120 .
- wireless link 120 may include a forward link for communications from BS 106 to mobile station 102 , and reverse link for communications from mobile station 102 to BS 106 .
- a wireless communication system Fundamental to a wireless communication system is the ability to maintain established communication connections while an MS moves in and between coverage areas.
- ‘soft-handoff’ techniques have been developed for code division multiple access (CDMA) communication systems whereby an MS is in concurrent, active communication with multiple BSs.
- CDMA code division multiple access
- Each BS in active communication with the MS is a member of an ‘active set’ of the MS and transmits bearer traffic to, and receives bearer traffic from, the MS.
- BSs are added to, or deleted from, the MS's active set so as to assure that the MS will always be in communication with at least one BS.
- Handoff is a process by which a network of base stations and a mobile station maintain their communication when the mobile station travels from one coverage area (cell) to another.
- the coverage areas in a wireless network are pre-defined by the geographical locations of its base stations, or may be defined in combination with the loading level of the base stations.
- Each coverage area is defined as a cell, which is normally served by a base station.
- each cell may be divided into several sectors such that each sector provides communication in a coverage area.
- a pilot channel on a specific code channel is transmitted from each base station. If the cell is divided into sectors, a pilot channel is also assigned to each sector.
- the pilot channels are used to direct the mobile stations handoff routines.
- a handoff candidate list of all cells and sectors that are in the communication system is transmitted to the mobile station.
- the list contains a list of pilot signals of many cells and sectors.
- the mobile station is constantly searching for pilot signals of the cells and sectors that are in the list.
- the mobile station measures the strength of pilot signals, which are then used as criteria to create a list of possible candidate pilot signals for future handoff. Since the list of all pilot signals is typically long (twenty is typical for CDMA), the mobile station spends a relatively long time scanning for all pilot signals.
- wireless communication system 100 may further include an MS 102 that concurrently is in active communication with each of BS 106 and 107 . That is, MS 102 is in ‘soft-handoff’ with each of BSs 106 and 107 and each of BS 106 and BS 107 is a member of an ‘active set’ of MS 102 . As members of the active set of MS 102 , each BS of BSs 106 and 107 concurrently maintains a respective wireless communication link 120 , 130 with the MS.
- Each BS 106 , 107 in the active set of MS 102 conveys the same bearer traffic to, and receives the same bearer traffic from, the MS.
- wireless network 100 enhances the likelihood that the MS will receive an acceptable quality signal from BS 106 and that the BS will receive an acceptable quality signal from the MS.
- a signal strength of a pilot signal received by MS 102 from BS 108 increases until MS 102 identifies the pilot signal from BS 108 as a viable communication link.
- a signal strength of a pilot signal received by MS 102 from BS 106 may deteriorate to the point that MS 102 determines that communication link 120 is no longer a viable communication link.
- MS 102 then requests that wireless network 100 add BS 108 to the MS's active set, that is, establish a communication link 140 associated with BS 108 , as an active communication link for transmitting data to, and receiving data from, MS 102 , and drop BS 106 from the active set, that is, terminate communication link 120 .
- the request to add or drop a BS is conveyed by MS 102 via a Pilot Strength Measurement Message (PSMM).
- PSMM Pilot Strength Measurement Message
- BS 106 is dropped from the active set of MS 102 and terminates, or drops, communication link 120 between MS 102 and BS 106 .
- PSMM's are also used to add BSs or sectors to the active set of the MS.
- the embodiments shown are directed toward a CDMA wireless network, the invention is not limited to a CDMA wireless network.
- the invention may be used in a GSM wireless network, and the like.
- FIG. 2 representatively illustrates a prior art method of generating a handoff candidate list in a wireless network 200 .
- the wireless network depicted in FIG. 2 includes any number of coverage areas (cells) 250 .
- each cell may be divided into any number of sectors 252 .
- a cell is divided into three sectors.
- cells may divided into any number of sectors.
- Mobile station 202 depicted in FIG. 2 is in a soft handoff state with three sectors 262 , 263 , 264 . This may be referred to as a multi-sector handoff state as explained above. Also as explained above, the mobile station is constantly checking all pilot signals from the handoff candidate list so as to enter a soft handoff state with any sectors or cells that have a relatively strong signal.
- the handoff candidate list is generated at the base station controller 110 . The list is generated using a separate list for each sector. That is, each sector has a separate list of handoff candidates prioritized with the most frequent (or most likely) handoff target from that sector or cell listed first, the second most frequent handoff target listed second, and so on.
- the prior art list for each sector is independent and only takes into account frequent handoffs from that sector only. Also, the list is long because it must contain all handoff target sectors in all directions from this one sector. A typical maximum length may be twenty handoff candidate sectors.
- a combined list (typically twenty) is built using a round-robin selection from the top entries from each of the lists from each of the sectors involved in the call.
- the round-robin approach will generate a list of handoff candidates based on frequency of use but for each individual sector.
- the list may contain candidate sectors in each direction from the present position of the mobile station even though a mobile station in such a handoff state may never or rarely use such handoff candidates. But since the handoff candidates are on the list, the mobile will waste time and battery power checking for their pilot signal anyway.
- the new combined list can include twenty entries. This means that in a prior art multi-sector handoff situation, building a handoff candidate list tends to guarantee a maximum length list. The longer the list, the less frequently a given sector candidate will be checked by the mobile station 202 to see if that sector now qualifies as a new handoff candidate. Since the use of a maximum length list slows down this search to the maximum possible extent, rapidly changing RF coverage can cause calls to be dropped before a handoff can complete to a new sector or BS capable of serving the call.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example of the prior art method described above.
- Mobile station 202 is a multi-sector handoff with three sectors 262 , 263 264 .
- Each active sector 262 , 263 , 264 in the multi-sector handoff will have its own list of handoff candidate sectors 266 that will include candidate sectors from all directions of each of the active sectors 262 , 263 , 264 .
- These lists are combined at the base station controller 110 to arrive at a prior art handoff candidate list, which includes candidate sectors 266 in all directions from mobile station 202 .
- the prior art handoff candidate list includes the maximum number of candidate sectors 266 .
- each candidate sector is checked for pilot signal strength by mobile station 202 , it takes mobile station 202 a relatively long time to check all of the candidate sectors 266 . Therefore, in a rapidly changing RF environment (such as hilly terrain, tall buildings, etc), the mobile station 202 may lose contact with active sectors 262 , 263 , 264 prior to establishing contact with a candidate sector 266 having the proper signal strength.
- FIG. 3 representatively illustrates a wireless network 300 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- the wireless network of FIG. 3 is similar to the wireless network of FIG. 2 except that the handoff candidate list in FIG. 3 is generated in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
- mobile station 302 is in a multi-sector handoff state 360 with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors 362 , 363 , 364 .
- mobile station 302 is in a soft handoff state with multiple sectors and the combination of sectors mobile station 302 is in communication with is a unique combination.
- mobile station 302 is shown in a multi-sector handoff state 360 with three sectors, the mobile station 302 may be in a multi-sector handoff state 360 with any plurality of sectors and be within the scope of the invention.
- mobile station 302 Since the mobile station 302 is in a multi-sector handoff state 360 with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors 362 , 363 , 364 , mobile station 302 is more likely to add one or more particular sectors to the multi-sector handoff state than other sectors. For example, since mobile station 302 is in the handoff state shown, it may be more likely that at least one target sector 370 , 371 , 372 are added to the multi-sector handoff state as an additional communication leg based on historical data of a mobile station 302 being in a multi-sector handoff state 360 with the unique combination of the plurality of sectors 362 , 363 , 364 .
- the target sectors 371 , 372 , 373 have the highest probability of actually being added to the multi-sector handoff state 360 for a given unique combination of plurality of sectors 362 , 363 , 364 .
- This may be, for example and without limitation, because the target sectors 371 , 372 , 373 were actually added to the multi-sector handoff state 360 in the past. This may be due for example to the handoff state with the particular combination of sectors being along a travel corridor where the target sectors are fairly constant given a limited direction of travel. Many other reasons may be present for target sectors having a higher probability of being selected, or have a history of being added, for a given multi-sector handoff state with a given unique combination of sectors.
- each time mobile station 302 is in the a multi-sector handoff state 360 with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors 362 , 363 , 364 , the one or more target sectors 371 , 372 , 373 that are actually added to the multi-sector handoff state may be recorded. Iteratively recording the one or more target sectors added for each multi-sector handoff state for each unique combination of plurality of sectors for any mobile stations in wireless network 300 may generate a list of the target sectors with the highest probability of actual use (or target sectors that are historically actually used) when mobile station 302 is in a multi-sector handoff state with any given unique combination of plurality of sectors.
- the list generated includes the only sectors that have actually been historically added.
- This data may be termed a historical data set and used to generate a handoff candidate list to communicate to a mobile station 302 in a particular multi-sector handoff state 360 with a corresponding unique combination of plurality of sectors 362 , 363 , 364 .
- a predictive algorithm for example and without limitation a network-planning and simulation tool known in the art, may be used to generate the at least one target sector 371 , 372 , 373 that has the highest probability of actually being used by a mobile station 302 in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors 362 , 363 , 364 .
- the network-planning tool may be used to create a predictive data set that can be used to generate a handoff candidate list to communicate to a mobile station in a particular multi-sector handoff state with a corresponding unique combination of plurality of sectors.
- the historical data set and the predictive data set may be used in any combination to create the handoff candidate list.
- handoff candidate list may not be generated in real-time, but calculated ahead of time and stored in memory as a look-up table. This relieves the base station and mobile station of the processing time and communication bandwidth required to generate these lists in real-time.
- the handoff candidate list may be significantly smaller than the maximum length of the prior art handoff candidate list. This allows the mobile station to scan for handoff sectors in the shorter handoff candidate list quicker, allowing the mobile station to acquire a pilot signal faster. This permits the mobile station to handoff quicker and results in fewer dropped calls.
- FIG. 4 representatively illustrates a block diagram 400 of a method of generating and providing a handoff candidate list in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- a base station controller may include a sector handoff recording algorithm 482 for recording target sectors actually used when a mobile station is in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors. Iteratively recording the one or more target sectors added for each multi-sector handoff state for each unique combination of plurality of sectors for any mobile stations in wireless network may generate a list of the target sectors with the highest probability of actual use when mobile station is in a multi-sector handoff state with any given unique combination of plurality of sectors.
- the target sectors actually used by mobile stations in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors may be ranked according to the probability of actual use by a mobile station in such a handoff situation.
- This data may be termed a historical data set 484 and be communicated to a handoff candidate list generator 488 , which may be used to generate a handoff candidate list 490 to communicate to a mobile station in a particular multi-sector handoff state with a corresponding unique combination of plurality of sectors.
- historical data set 484 may be used by handoff candidate list generator 488 to generate, for example and without limitation, a look-up table that corresponds to each multi-sector handoff state and any unique combination of a plurality of sectors. Subsequently, when a mobile station enters a multi-sector handoff state with any particular unique combination of plurality of sectors, the handoff candidate list 490 may be communicated to mobile station 402 via wireless link 494 . Since the handoff candidate list 490 is a list limited to those target sectors that have the highest probability of actually being used with the mobile station in communication with the unique combination of the plurality of sectors, the handoff candidate list 490 is likely to have fewer entries than the prior art handoff candidate list.
- the prior art method of generating handoff candidate lists may be reverted to in order to generate an updated historical data set.
- sector handoff recording algorithm 482 may also collect data on a signal quality metric 486 for the communication leg of each target sector in accordance with the above embodiment.
- Signal quality metric may include, for example, the signal to noise ratio, frame error rate, and the like, and may be collected for each target sector actually used in accordance with the above embodiment.
- historical data set 484 and signal quality metric 486 may be used to rank plurality of target sectors.
- historical data set 484 and signal quality metric 486 may be used by the handoff candidate list generator 488 to rank plurality of target sectors based on a weighted average of the probability of actually being used and the signal quality metric of each target sector.
- a predictive algorithm 481 may be used to create a predictive data set 483 .
- predictive algorithm may be any cellular network-planning tool as is known in the art.
- Predictive data set 483 may be used to generate the at least one target sector that has the highest probability of actually being used by a mobile station 402 in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors.
- the predictive algorithm 481 may be used to create a predictive data set 483 that can then be subsequently used to generate a handoff candidate list 490 to communicate to a mobile station 402 in a particular multi-sector handoff state with a corresponding unique combination of plurality of sectors.
- the historical data set 484 and the predictive data set 483 may be used in any combination to create the handoff candidate list 490 .
- the block diagram may include second handoff candidate list (not shown for clarity) in which the handoff candidate list generated from the predictive data set 483 is augmented with the historical data set 484 to create a more accurate and concise second handoff candidate list.
- FIG. 5 representatively illustrates a flow diagram 500 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention for handoff candidate list selection.
- a mobile station is in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors.
- the at least one target sector added to the unique combination of plurality of sectors is recorded, thereby creating a historical data set.
- Step 504 may be iteratively repeated for each mobile station in the wireless network in each multi-sector handoff state with each unique combination of a plurality of sectors.
- mobile station may start out in a one-way handoff state with a single sector and record the sectors that are actually added.
- the handoff candidate list originating from the one-way handoff state may not be optimized, it may include sectors that were generated from a predictive algorithm, even though the sectors are never actually added to the handoff candidate list in practice.
- At least one target sector that has a higher probability of actually being used, or has actually been used, by a mobile station in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors is defined based on historical data set.
- This may be a handoff candidate list.
- at least one target sector may be determined based on a signal quality metric or a weighted average of a signal quality metric of each of the at least one target sector.
- a handoff candidate list may have zero candidates. For example, in an embodiment for a unique combination of a plurality of sectors, a new sector may not be added, but only has handoff drops. In this case the handoff candidate list used for that unique combination of sections may have zero candidates in the handoff list sent to the mobile station.
- step 508 it is determined if subsequently a mobile station is in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors. If not, return to the beginning of step 508 . If so, the handoff candidate list is provided to mobile station in step 510 , where the handoff candidate list includes one or more target sectors, taken from a pool of available sectors, having a higher probability of actually being used by a mobile station in a multi-sector handoff state with the unique combination of the plurality of sectors.
- FIG. 6 representatively illustrates a flow diagram 600 in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention for handoff candidate list selection.
- a predictive algorithm may be used to generate a predictive data set that includes at least one target sector to be added to a unique combination of a plurality of sectors when a mobile is in a multi-sector handoff state.
- at least one target sector that has a higher probability of actually being used by a mobile station in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors is defined based on predictive data set.
- This may be a handoff candidate list.
- a handoff candidate list may have zero candidates. For example, in an embodiment for a unique combination of a plurality of sectors, a new sector may not be added, but only has drops instead. This situation may result in a handoff candidate list being sent that has zero handoff candidates.
- step 606 it is determined if subsequently a mobile station is in a multi-sector handoff state with a unique combination of a plurality of sectors. If not, return to the beginning of step 606 . If so, a handoff candidate list is provided to mobile station in step 608 , where the handoff candidate list includes one or more target sectors, taken from a pool of available sectors, having a higher probability of actually being used by a mobile station in a multi-sector handoff state with the unique combination of the plurality of sectors.
- mobile station may be in a one-way handoff state and generate a handoff candidate list based on the one-way handoff state.
- any method or process claims may be executed in any order and are not limited to the specific order presented in the claims.
- the components and/or elements recited in any apparatus claims may be assembled or otherwise operationally configured in a variety of permutations to produce substantially the same result as the present invention and are accordingly not limited to the specific configuration recited in the claims.
