- FIG. 4 is a diagram of example functional components of image management system 240 according to one or more implementations described herein.
- image management system 240 may include an image-centricity module 410 and a results management module 420 .
- one or more of modules 410 - 420 may be implemented as a combination of hardware and software based on the components illustrated and described with respect to FIG. 3 .
- modules 410 - 420 may each be implemented as hardware based on the components illustrated and described with respect to FIG. 3 .
- Image-centricity module 410 may provide functionality with respect to image-centricity. For example, results management module 410 may enable image management system 240 to receive image metadata corresponding to an image within a document, determine whether the document is image-centric based on the image metadata, and, based on the determination, designate whether the document is image-centric. When the document is image-centric, image management system 240 may create a data record identifying the image and/or document as image-centric. Image management system 240 may reference the data record later to determine image-centricity of a document in response to a request to provide the image. Whether the document is image-centric, with respect to an image, may depend on the image metadata corresponding to the image.
- Results management module 420 may provide functionality with respect to search results. For example, results management module 420 may enable image management system 240 to receive a request to display an image corresponding to a search result, determine whether the document corresponding to the image is image-centric, and respond to the request accordingly. For instance, if the document is image-centric, image management system 240 may respond to the request by providing the document corresponding to the image. However, if the document is not image-centric, image management system 240 may create an image overlay document corresponding to the image, and provide the image overlay document in response the request. As described herein, the image overlay document may include an underlay version of the document, a modified version of the image as an overlay to the document, and/or a navigation frame corresponding to the document and the image.
- image management system 240 may also, or alternatively, provide functionality as described elsewhere in this description. Further, while FIG. 4 shows a particular number and arrangement of modules, in some implementations, image management system 240 may include additional modules, fewer modules, different modules, or differently arranged modules than those depicted.
- FIG. 5 is a diagram of an example of image metadata 500 that may be considered by image management system 240 to determine whether a document is image-centric with respect to a particular image included in that document according to one or more implementations described herein.
- image metadata 500 may include click-through information 510 , image accesses information 520 , image quality information 530 , and image position information 540 . While FIG. 5 shows examples of image metadata 500 that may be used by image management system 240 , in some implementations, image metadata 500 may include additional information or different information than depicted in FIG. 5 .
- Click-through information 510 may include any type of information relating to a click-through event corresponding to an image overlay document—e.g., a scenario where a user is provided with an image overlay document and proceeds to click-through the image overlay document to access the corresponding document.
- click-through information 510 may include a rate of click-through events corresponding to an image overlay document corresponding to a particular image, a quantity of click-through events corresponding to the image overlay document corresponding to the particular image, an average amount of time between presentation of the image overlay document corresponding to the particular image until a click-through event occurs with respect to the image overlay document corresponding to the particular image, or another type of information that relates to click-through events.
- Click-through information 510 may be aggregated, for multiple users, in an anonymous manner and only with the users' permission. Click-through information 510 may be helpful in determining whether a particular document is image-centric with respect to a particular image since users may have a tendency to click-through an image overlay document if the particular document includes a version of the image that is larger, has a greater level of resolution, is readily visible, or has another quality-related characteristic that is superior to the version of the image that is presented in the image overlay document.
- Image accesses information 520 may include any type of information relating to an image being accessed by client system 210 .
- image accesses information 520 may include information regarding a frequency and/or quantity of times that a user is provided with an image overlay document from a list of search results, proceeds to click-through the image overlay document to access the corresponding document, and then returns to the list of search results.
- image accesses information 520 may include information regarding an amount of time that the user spent on the document before returning to the list of search results.
- Image accesses information 520 may be aggregated, for multiple users, in an anonymous manner and only with the users' permission.
- Image accesses information 520 may be helpful in determining whether a particular document is image-centric with respect to a particular image since, when presented with the particular document, users may have a tendency to stay on the particular document if the particular document includes a version of the image that is larger, has a greater level of resolution, is readily visible, or has another quality-related characteristic that is superior to the version of the image that is presented in the image overlay document.
- Image quality information 530 may include any type of information relating to the quality of a particular image.
- Image quality information 530 may include a visual characteristic of the image, such as an image size, an aspect ratio, an image resolution, a variability of colors corresponding to the image, etc., on a particular document. Additionally, or alternatively, image quality information 530 may include information regarding whether a content of the particular document is associated with a topic with which the image is also associated.
- Image quality information 530 may indicate that a particular document is image-centric with respect to a particular image when, for example, the image size, the aspect ratio, the image resolution, and/or another quality-related characteristic of the image, such as the topic associated with the image, exceed one or more image thresholds.
- Image position information 540 may include any type of information relating to the position of an image in a document.
- image position information 540 may include a set of coordinates, or another type of location information, that identifies a location of the image in the document.
- Image position information 540 may indicate that a particular document is image-centric with respect to a particular image when, for example, the image is located in a readily-visible location, such as at, or near, the top of the particular document.
- Image management system 240 may use any or all of the types of image metadata discussed above to determine whether a document is image-centric with respect to a particular image. For example, image management system 240 may calculate a quality score based on one, or a combination, of the types of image metadata discussed above, and may determine whether the quality score exceeds a particular threshold. In some implementations, each type of image metadata that is used to calculate the quality score may be factored into the quality score equally. In some implementations, however, image management system 240 may calculate the quality score in a manner that places greater emphasis on one type of image metadata, such as click-through information 510 , than one or more other types of image metadata, such as image accesses information 520 , image quality information 530 , and/or image position information 540 .
- image management system 240 may calculate the quality score in a manner that places greater emphasis on one type of image metadata, such as click-through information 510 , than one or more other types of image metadata, such as image accesses information 520 , image quality information
- image management system 240 may collect image metadata for a set of web pages associated with a particular web site. If image management system 240 determines that at least a threshold quantity, or ratio, of the web pages are image-centric for images on those web pages, then image management system 240 may determine that the web site, associated with those web pages, is image-centric for images. In this case, it may be inferred that all web pages, associated with that web site, are image-centric for images.
- Image-centricity record 550 may include a data structure, such as a record in a table, a database, a linked list, or another form or arrangement of memory, which indicates whether a particular document is image-centric with respect to a particular image.
- image-centricity record 550 may include a variety of information relating to the image-centricity of a document.
- image-centricity record 550 may include an identifier corresponding to the document, such as a URL of the document, an identifier of the image, such as a file name of the image, an indication of whether the document is image-centric, and/or a quality score corresponding to the image-centricity of the document.
- image-centricity record 550 may include additional information, such as a creation date that indicates the date that image-centricity record 550 was created, an expiration date that indicates when image-centricity record 550 is no longer valid for determining image-centricity and should be replaced or updated, etc.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram of an example process 600 for determining image-centricity according to one or more implementations described herein.
- process 600 may be performed by one or more components of image management system 240 .
- some or all of process 600 may be performed by one or more other components/devices, or a group of components/devices, including or excluding image management system 240 .
- process 600 may include receiving image metadata corresponding to an image (block 610 ).
- image management system 240 may receive image metadata relating to the image, such as information corresponding to the manner in which a user of client system 210 has interacted with the image and/or information regarding a quality or position of the image.
- image metadata may include click-through information 510 , image accesses information 520 , image quality information 530 , and/or image position information 540 .
- Process 600 may also include determining image-centricity based on the image metadata (block 620 ).
- image management system 240 may calculate a quality score corresponding to the image based on the image metadata received by image management system 240 .

- a process for determining image-centricity may include fewer operations, different operations, differently arranged operations, or additional operations than depicted in FIG. 6 .
- image management system 240 may create a record that associates the image with the quality score, and whether the score is sufficient for the corresponding document to be considered image-centric may be determined at another time, e.g., in response to a request to display the image.
- a process for determining image-centricity may not include an operation for designating that the document is not image-centric. For instance, if the quality score, corresponding to the document, does not satisfy the particular threshold, image management system 240 may simply not create an image-centricity record corresponding to the document.
