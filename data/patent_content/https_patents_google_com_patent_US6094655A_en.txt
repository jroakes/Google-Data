- the Web Server 72 passes request data to and invokes our control program 73 through the use of the CGI in accordance with our invention.
- the control program uses ODAS 74 in ODAS server 12 to set DIS capsule parameters and initiates the execution of a DIS capsule located in this embodiment in DIS capsule server 17 according to our preferred examples illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10.
- FIG. 7 shows the coupling within the Web server from ODAS 74 to a distributed DIS LAN 75 with heterogeneous connections to multiple databases DB2, Redbrick, Sybase and Oracle. Other sources of data can be linked to the LAN.
- the control program agent 73 in FIGS. 1 and 11 is illustrated in detail by way of the flowchart of FIG. 8. In our preferred embodiment, this program can be written in C or other suitable language but for general appreciation of the details, we will describe the steps in detail. These steps can be implemented by programmers of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation after understanding the steps described below.
- the control program agent 73 is located in a Web server and provides an interface and execution functions. Thus in FIG. 11 the function is provided between the Web Server 131 (corresponding to Internet WWW server 11 in FIG. 1) and DIS which is located in a DIS server 133 (corresponding to server 14 in FIG. 1) and for presentation of results according to the instructions of the Web browser 130 (corresponding to browser 10 in FIG. 1) according to the request command, which in default is a return to the Web browser home page.
- This interface utilizes in our preferred embodiment the Web Server CGI and the DIS ODAS.
- the Web Browser 130 will link to a Web Server 131 accessing it on the Internet though a unique ID called the uniform resource locater to access the node which we call the Web server 131.
- a unique ID called the uniform resource locater to access the node which we call the Web server 131.
- an HTML document is displayed by the Web server 131 to the Web browser 130, as shown in FIG. 2.
- the user makes his entries as described with respect to FIG. 2.
- the HTML document refers to the control program agent 73 and the Web server 131 through the use of the CGI invokes our control program agent 73.
- the Web server 131 retrieves data entered by the user from the HTML document and passes that data to our control program agent 73 upon invocation.
- the Web Server 131 has a gateway interface that allows the server to invoke a control program agent 73 running on it and to pass input parameters to the control program agent 73 (FIG. 8) that were returned from the Hypertext document of the Web Browser.
- the Hypertext document locates the particular Web Server that can support the request made by checking the details of the "hidden" defaults and those functions requested. Thus a menu request for a generalized search throughout the Internet may locate the particular service machine having an application processing agent which has the information desired.
- step 110 obtains a PATH -- INFO environment variable data.
- PATH -- INFO contains data from the HTML document that referred the Web Server to our program. Specifically the data contains the name of the DIS capsule to call, the name of the file containing the HTML statements to use when building the HTML document that displays the DIS capsule results to the Web browser, and the type of file that the DIS capsule will create. All off this information is the variable data which is stored in a buffer environment in step 112, and which is used in subsequent steps.
- QUERY -- STRING contains data from the HTML document that referred the Web Server to our program. Specifically the data contains values selected by the user and/or default values selected by the HTML document designer. These values are set in the DIS capsule by our control program prior to execution of the DIS capsule. This information is used to set variables in the DIS capsule. All off this information is the variable data which is stored in a buffer environment in step 112, and which is used in subsequent steps.
- the steps 112 through 125 include the utilization of an API set that provides a method of invoking executable programs located in a service machine which we denote as a sub-agent which executes in step 122 object capsules from our sub-agent DIS file server 14.
- This provides functions such as queue and update functions for databases on multiple platforms and allows the processing of data retried from a database to be performed, including executing calculations, doing formatting, charging of accounts and the storing of results as a file accessible to the control program agent.
- our control program agent 73 provides setups for API calls which occurs in steps WHAT ARE THESE STEPS.
- the control program agent will proceed as with an API set with step 113.
- step 113 the control program retrieves from a store, all of the DIS capsules that are used and the variable names associated with each DIS capsule and loads into memory associated with the control program the DIS capsule names available and the variable names associated with each DIS capsule.
- step 114 the control program is ready to and does initialize a connection between our control program and the ODAS through the use of an ODAS API.
- another API performing similar functions could be used.
- control program agent 73 in step 115 logs onto a DIS "desktop", our DIS file server 14.
- control program can and does in step 116 retrieve from its memory the DIS capsule variable names associated with the DIS capsule name passed to our control program in the step 110 where PATH -- INFO is provided.
- step 117 the control program creates a data array stored in the control program memory containing the DIS capsule variable names and the values for them that were passed to our control program in the QUERY -- STRING step.
- steps 116 and 117 should be done in order, even though steps 110 and 111 can have an arbitrary order.
- step 117 you are matching the DIS capsule variable names with the data that was passed to the control program in the QUERY -- STING environment variables.
- step 118 the program creates a unique filename which may include data originated by the HTML document's variables stored in step 112 (dotted line) to pass to the DIS capsule as a DIS variable for use in naming the report which will be created by the DIS capsule.
- the DIS capsule will create that file with the unique file name during its process.
- the values of variables used by the DIS capsule are obtained from the data array in the control program memory containing the DIS capsule variable names and the values for them that were passed to our control program in the QUERY -- STRING step. This is done in step 119 using the ODAS API to set the DIS capsule variable values.
- the capsule server 17 for the DIS server 133 attached to the Web Server 131 via network 132 will have a DIS capsule services queue.
- This queue is the queue of jobs being requested of the Dis Capsule Server 17.
- For the current job request (other like requests being perhaps still in the queue) we use the ODAS API to query the contents of the DIS Capsule Services queue. If the queue size is larger (>t) than a threshold level, then the process enters a wait state until the queue size is reduced to a tolerable level.
- the queue test of step 120 is a loop test which returns to test the queue size until a test answering "is the queue of a size that execution can proceed?" ( ⁇ t) is answered "YES".
- the ODAS API is used to submit a DIS capsule for execution in step 121.
- the control program After the ODAS API submits a DIS capsule for execution the particular request process being executed by the control program enters a wait state until completion of the DIS capsule execution. For this step of the process the control program uses the ODAS API to wait for completion of the DIS capsule execution performed by the DIS capsule execution 122. During a wait state other requests can be processed by the control program, as requests are fed through the control program as a pipeline, in this WAIT PIPE API step 123, so that the control program continually advances requests through the system.
- the ODAS API looks for a completion signal.
- the control program then in step 124 reads the file identified by the name passed to the control program in the first PATH -- INFO step that contains the HTML statements which are to be presented with the DIS report results.
- control program While in step 124 the control program reads the file identified, it dynamically creates new HTML statements to display the preformatted text to the Web browser.
- the new HTML statement include the information retrieved from the file in step 113 so that it can be displayed as a header 44 accompanying the report to be displayed, along with the filename 43.
- step 125 the control program tests for the kind of report to be created by obtaining information from stored variables and identifies output parameters, such as whether the report is to be a text report, or a graphical report. At this point the control program branches to the sequence applicable to the kind of report to be created. If the output is to be routed the the Web server 10, then the output is routed to the Web server in step 126.
- a text file report is created by the DIS capsule, that determines that a text display is to be reported and the the control program reads the file created by the DIS capsule and dynamically creates HTML statements to display the data lines to the Web browser.
- a graphics file is created by the DIS capsule, that determines that a graphics display is to be reported and the control program dynamically creates the HTML statement to display the graphics file to the Web browser.
- control program agent allows alternative output direction, and if the output is another type, or an additional output, as for broadcast, it can be routed to another destination.
- step 127 we illustrate how using the IBM Digital Server, output can be routed to a requester selected resulting output selected from a group of possible output units, comprising fax, printer, retail or banking installations, or provided as a series of full motion videos or still frames which are can be transmitted to display devices, such as a TV set under control of end users with a set-top box cable control.
- the output can be coupled to an auxiliary function, such as back-up or accounting processes 128 which allow for charging for system utilization and service charges for services and items requested.
- auxiliary function such as back-up or accounting processes 128 which allow for charging for system utilization and service charges for services and items requested.
- These processes will make use of hidden variables associated with the request, such as charge authorization.
- One of the hidden variables which may be associated with a request is a credit card number.
- the credit card number is preferably encrypted, with a DES or RSA encryption utility, and this along with access authorization variables, will allow access to sensitive databases which reside behind firewalls. If selected data according to the request is permitted to the access authorized user at the location inside or outside the Internet, the data can be included in the results reported by our system to the Web browser.
- an HTML document which is running on a web server, refers to the control program agent.
- the web server then invokes the control program agent.
- the control program agent has a to command files, which provide the preferred file command objects in the form of DIS capsule objects, or DIS capsules as they are known.
- the command file contains a list of available DIS capsules. Accordingly, there is not need for the HTML document to know how to get to the command file, as the control program supplies this access.
- a capsule object, as a DIS capsule can call other routines which may be written in well known programming languages such as Visual Basic or C.
- routines become part of the capsule object by the reference, and these routines perform such functions as account tracking, compression, calculation, handling specific custom outputs such as video, voice, translation, and enable programmability of tile capsule objects.
- the capsule objects also have standard object capability, and we will illustrate these by way of the specific examples described.
- the control program 73 acts in concert with DIS capsule execution.
- the DIS capsule is an object program with executable additions which we have created to interact with the control program.
- the DIS capsule object can perform programmable functions on data which is retrieved from databases. Not only can a DIS capsule get data, it can combine, reformat, and update, the data retrieved. It can act on the data to create new data and basically act as a dedicated processor processing data gathered or created during a Web browser request to output the end result to the user under programmable parameters determined by the creator of the DIS capsule, as they may be selected, if desired, by the user as part of the request.
- the user entered inputs as part of his request either free form or by selection of variables in the menus afforded to the user as illustrated by way of example in FIG. 5.
- DIS capsule objects are like some other objects.
- Microsoft's products an example being the Excel (trademark of Microsoft) spreadsheet
- the kind of action to be taken is illustrated by an object on the screen, and linking of routines is done by a succession of clicks on icons representing the object.
- a DIS capsule is used to invoke system resources. This is done by providing a list of commands, which may be those provided by a DIS processor itself, or written in Visual Basic or C by the programmer. The result is a command file, like an exec or command file in OS/2 or like a *.BAT file in DOS. These capsules perform the specific functions that are requested by the user from his initiation session. The user further qualifies the execution of the DIS capsule by providing parameters which are used in the invocation.
- the DIS server 133 supports DIS, the program processor which supports DIS capsules by processing commands contained in the DIS capsule, either directly, in the case of DIS functions, or by to other system or user supplied functions.
- the user supplied functions comprise mainly those DIS functions which are supplied by DIS and illustrated in the manual "Developing Applications with OpenDIS Access Service, Version 2.0 of the OPEN Access Service.” For those not familiar with command files, this manual is fully incorporated herein by this reference as available at the USPTO.
- An example of a system supplied function would be the base support for SQL queries of a specific database, which are invoked by the DIS capsule program.
- FIGS. 9 and 10 both illustrate linked objects according to a specified flow sequence within a DIS environment.
- the DIS environment contains numerous functions, including the Internetwork routing functions which the DIS capsules can invoke.
- a DIS object which queries a database invokes the Internetwork routing functions to query databases where they are located on the network.
- a similar environment with program environment means which supports reaching a destination on the Internet by a link between systems which routes data from one physical unit to another according to the applicable protocol should be supplied.
- the protocol will employ a URL address for Internet locations.
- FIG. 9 illustrates by way of example a DIS capsule that creates a text report file.
- the capsule represented by a series of linked objects, is supported by Internetwork processor support environment means 90.
- an integrated capsule creates a text report file as a result of the object 95, make text.
- This object result file is the file 43 according to FIG. 3 which is displayed at the browser.
- the multiple DIS capsule data retrieval command file 91(a) . . . 91(n) initiates as a first step multiple queries to different databases which are specified by the parameters of the request.
- multiple queries are initiates as SQL type search requests as multiple steps 91(a).
- 91(n) executed by the DIS capsule server 133 with the Database Gateway 134 to select data from DB26000 databases located inside the intranet 140 and on the Internet by Internetwork routing to database gateway 134' and its DB26000 databases by step 91(a).
- the data is stored in a DIS declared buffer.
- additional steps 91(b), 91(c), 91(d), and 91(n) retrieve data and store in their object buffer data retrieved from Sybase, Oracle, Redbrick, and IBM's Data Warehouse databases.
- object 91(a) will query DB26000 and bring data back to DIS.
- Object 91(b) will query Oracle and bring data back to DIS.
- Object 91(c) will query Sybase and bring data back to DIS.
- Object 91(d) (shown as a dot in FIG. 9) will query Redbrick and bring data back to DIS, and so on.
- the nth object 91(n) will query IBM's data warehouse and bring data back to DIS.
- data from the database queries in the first step is joined by joining object command file 92 and stored in a buffer related to this object.
- Object 92 will joint the data from the n locations searched in step 91.
- calculation object command file 93 on the joined data in the joined database result buffer of step 92, desired calculations performed in accordance with the parameters indicated by the request are done on the joined data.
- a make text command file 95 causes the formatted text to be created as a text file for the WWW server 131 to be stored in a file which is accessible to and can be retrieved and displayed by the control program agent 73, or directly displayed by the control program agent 73 in the form illustrated in FIG. 4 at the Web browser 130. It will be noted we have illustrated this process as object capsules in a DIS internetworking environment. These object capsules are a specialized form of a command file, which can encompass additional commands called by an object.
- FIG. 10 illustrates by way of example a DIS capsule that creates a graphical report file.
- Retrieval object command file 101 illustrates a step of retrieval of data from one or more databases as specified in the parameters of the request, performing these retrieval steps as did retrieval object command files 91(a) . . . 91(n). Thereafter, this data is plotted with the make plot object command file 102, with the results being stored in a buffer.
- the final step of creating a result-to-be-presented file, in this instance in the form of a bitmap ready for display to a Web browser 130 is created by the make bitmap (BMP) object command file 103.
- BMP make bitmap
- FIG. 11 illustrates an alternative configuration of the network system as it may be employed for permitting access to information available through homepages and in data warehouses where access to the homepage or database may or may not be restricted by a firewall.
- the web browser(s) 130 accesses an associated Web Server 131, 131', 131' either by a coupling or addressing with a uniform resource locator (URL) the Web Server 131 which may be selected with a Hyperlink.
- URL uniform resource locator
- This can be a direct coupling or an indirect coupling, as via a node locatable in a common access medium, such as provided by Internet resources accessible via a web browser, e.g. supporting Web Explorer, or Mosaic, NetScape, node 131 located somewhere on the Internet which utilizes our control program agent 73.
- node 131 which functions as a Web server is coupled via a token-ring network, SNA network, or other suitable network 132 (one of the any which may be used on the Internet as a transmission medium) with the facilities provided within what we will call our intranet, those facilities which are "proprietary" to the owner and which may be protected by firewalls at the intranet boundary 140.
- our control program 73 is resident within the Web Server 131 and functions as described in FIG. 8 to couple to a DIS server 133 located within the intranet 140, which is preferably located behind a firewall as indicated in FIG. 11.
- This DIS Server 133 is in turn coupled to our Database gateway 134.
- This database gateway is configured as illustrated also in FIG.
- databases coupled to it and located on servers for DB2, Oracle, Sybase, and Redbrick, as well as one for information warehouse functions.
- these database units are IBM mainframe systems, as available commercially today, but they could be AS400s, RISC/6000, RISC/6000 SP or other systems supporting the databases.
- the DIS Server is a server which supports DIS or similar decision support functions and the functions provided by our DIS capsules illustrated by FIG. 9 and 10.
- our Web browsers 130 can not only access information within the intranet, but can reach outside the intranet to gather information located elsewhere via the Internet.
- One example couples the database gateway 134 to another (a second) database gateway 134 via the Internet and it Internetwork routing (INR) protocol available from IBM as part of its current DIS product which can make use of UALs.
- the second database gateway 134' is coupled to its own (second) DIS server 133'.
- the Web browser 130 can access data not only intranet, but also via the Internet to gather data from a database supported by DIS server 133' located outside the intranet.
- the Database server 134' would be able to gather information from any database coupled to it, as illustrated, assuming access is public or accessible after processing of a hidden variable access authorization.
- Web Server 131 can also access via Web Server 131 (with our control program 73 illustrated in detail in FIG. 8) another Web server 131' which implements our control program 73.
- This Web server for example, Web server 131' can also be coupled via its own (second) network 132' (which supports functions equivalent to network 132 and as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 11) to an associated DIS Server 133' as illustrated to perform tasks like those we are describing from a request sent via the second network from its Web server 131'.
- second network 132' which supports functions equivalent to network 132 and as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 11

- Web server 131' with an appropriate API can access a directly coupled database available to the server, such as MicroSoft's Access 131a.
- a directly coupled database available to the server, such as MicroSoft's Access 131a.
- small databases which have not yet invested in being able to gather information from an intranet resource, can use their oven direct resources, and also be interrogated by the Web browser(s) 130, or another web browser 136.
- browser's 130 can also communicate with the Web server 131' across the Internet, just as can a Web browser 136 located on the intranet 140 inside of the firewall illustrated by the intranet 140 dashed line shown in FIG. 11. With a browser 136 in place at the Web Server 131' location, that browser 136 can make requests, if authorized across the intranet to the Web Server 131 which can then utilize the DIS capsules provided by the DIS Server 133.
- the network 132 will have its own access server 135 preferably in the form of a TCP/IP server 135 to make the physical connection across the Internet.
- This TCP/IP server supports the physical connections which are needed by the other logical higher levels of service supported on the network.
- ISR InterNetwork Routing Protocol

- a menu which say if "Art&Literature search", when selected in a Hyperlink setting, would index to a particular web server and a particular document within that web server's environment.
- This web server 134' besides being linked to its own application processing server 133' has a direct link, in the environment illustrated, to an MVS CICS, a transaction processing server for handling transaction processing.
- Such a solution allows CICS transaction processing to utilize the Internet to save transmission costs and still be located beneath a firewall for retention of data integrity.
- the outputs provided by the web server to the requested destination can be outside of the firewall, and in the form of results illustrated by the possible examples shown in FIGS. 3, 5 and 8.
- Domino.Decision groupware software can be developed first as an object system that allows actual transactions to take place in a secure and reliable manner between incompatible systems, and the system can then be used in an open environment with an internet user. For example, one computer could update a customer record housed on an incompatible machine by using the component software as an intermediary.
- Dominio.Decision's capability to use objects as STRINGBEANS as they do custom written Java applications problems associated with incompatible computers systems have been addressed, allotting various translations of data from one format to another.
- Note's documents are generated from the output of our capsule objects.
- the documents can contain text, rich text, graphics, voice, wk3 and wk4 of Lotus 123 that are generated by the our engine.
- Our engine provides an information generation mechanism, utilizing data mining and other IDS components combined into a capsule and applying business logic to relational data from many sources.
- Domino is the information delivery mechanism, providing the trigger to IDS, and the end user interface.
- the operation consists of Notes triggering IDS to execute a capsule (via LotusScript and the IDS API), and taking the output of the IDS execution to build Notes documents.
- the trigger cay be a scheduled agent, or a form entry by an end user from Notes or the web.
- the configuration, to match up our capsule output with Notes forms and fields, is handled through a Notes Administration database, similar in format to the current Lotus Notes Pump product (Activity records and connection documents).
- our IDS capsule conotes now an element, whether it be an script, spreadsheet, Java Bean, or other "STRINGBEAN" capsule that can be combined to create an executable object out of the capsule components with our method of combination of capsule elements.
- the IDS environment currently provides a framework where various IDS components, capsules in the form of applets or other objects can all be combined by stringing them together as we show in FIGS. 9 and 10 with drag and drop to form a capsule (executable program).
- the components are IDS capsules (preferably composed of a portable element, such as Java Beans.
- the framework allows capsule developers to "plug in" Java Bean components and develop applications without writing a line of Java code. With APIs for the back end integration our Domino.Decision can integrate component capsules as beans in a 100% pure Java implementation.
- each of the databases 121 that our IDS can operate on are illustrated, DB/2, Oracle, Sybase, Informix being illustrative of the range.
- the Domino.Decision application interfaces with our IDS with any of these database types.
- the IDS capsule component 122 is used to process any information from any or all of the items represented in FIG.
- the resulting output is a document or activity record 124 of a Domino.Decision control database which as a Domino.Decision application can now process each of the files created by the 123 processing for producing Lotus Notes documents.
- the capsules 131 are component based stringbeans which produce output files placed on the system in a Notes database, the Domino.Decision Control Database 132 which coordinates all of the connectivity of the Domino.Decision work desired by a user.
- control is provided to the Domino.Decision Lotus Notes Agents/API programs 133 that invoke the IDS capsules and process the appropriate output of the capsules using the information provided at step 132.
- the target form 134 is the final output of the process.
- the target form 134 is a document in a specified Lotus Notes database that will contain the information produced by the capsule and created by the process programs 133.
- a scheduled agent runs on a Notes server, as a push mechanism as that Notes server can initiate the created of a document on another Notes server's database(s) or the mail database, which, ich with database access control list authorization assumed would trigger the mailing of the document to one or more users automatically by the push created.
- our applications function with the capability of direct forward applets from server to client, as the typical applet provides a kernel for client execution, but also, via our API interface from client to server as a reverse applet capsules or command files are provided to a client for execution, which could be immediate or at timed intervals. Remebember also that no client request is needed.
- the Notes server uses its connection record to determine location of an IDS server, and it uses its activity record to determine how to pass parameters to an IDS capsule, and it also uses its activity record to determine how to take IDS output and create a Notes document and in what server and database (which includes a mail database) to place the document.
- Another alternative would be use use a scheduled agent running on an IDS server which provides the push mechanism, in that the IDS server creates Notes document w/o a client request, and this server uses its activity record to determine how to take an IDS output and create a Notes document and in what server and database (which includes a mail database) to place the document.
- a Notes client which will enable a user to request execution of an IDS capsule (assuming authorized to execute the requested capsule) and the user can view the resulting document (assuming Access Control List authorization).
- the software capsules executed by the IDS capsules are software "components" that will allow customers to tap into existing databases, payroll systems and information repositories and encapsulate this data in components that can be used to build new programs.
- the dominio.decision product will be initially a server based version.
- the server based version can be created as either an IDS/Java product or with Kona for the integration of our IDS decision support software.
- Notes documents are generated from the output of IDS capsule objects.
