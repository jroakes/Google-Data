Definitions
- Implementations described herein relate generally to information retrieval and, more particularly, to the providing of additional information in regard to a search result.
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Locating a desired portion of the information, however, can be challenging. This problem is compounded because the amount of information on the web and the number of new users inexperienced at web searching are growing rapidly.
- Search engines attempt to return hyperlinks to web pages in which a user is interested.
- search engines base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to provide links to high quality, relevant results (e.g., web pages) to the user based on the search query.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web pages. Web pages that contain the user's search terms are identified as search results.
- the search results include three pieces of information, such as a title, a snippet, and a link.
- the title identifies the corresponding web page.
- the snippet includes a small portion of the web page that often contains one or more of the search terms of the search query. Typically, the snippet includes no more than a sentence worth of text and might include one or more partial sentences.
- the link includes the address of the web page.
- the snippets may not provide enough information for a user to make a meaningful decision regarding which search result(s) to select.
- a method may include providing a list of search results, where a search result in the list of search results may include a text excerpt from a corresponding search result document; receiving selection of the text excerpt; and providing an expanded text excerpt based on the selection of the text excerpt, where the expanded text excerpt may include the text excerpt and additional text from the search result document but less than all of the text in the search result document.
- a system may include means for providing a list of search results, where a search result in the list of search results may include a snippet from a corresponding search result document; means for receiving selection of the snippet; and means for providing an expanded snippet based on the selection of the snippet, where the expanded snippet may include the snippet and other text from a subset of the search result document.
- a system may include a memory to store instructions and a processor to execute the instructions to present a list of search results.
- a search result in the list of search results may include a text excerpt from a corresponding search result document.
- the processor may determine a selection of the text excerpt and present an expanded text excerpt based on the selection of the text excerpt.
- the expanded text excerpt may include the text excerpt and additional text located in proximity to the text excerpt in the search result document.
- the additional text may comprise a portion of the search result document.
- a method may include receiving a search query; performing a search based on the search query to identify multiple search result documents; forming a list of search results based on the search result documents, where at least a subset of the search results may include a text excerpt from a corresponding subset of the search result documents; and providing the list of search results.
- the method may also include receiving a request for an expanded text excerpt in connection with one of the search results; generating the expanded text excerpt, where the expanded text excerpt may include the text excerpt and text in proximity to the text excerpt in the corresponding one of the search result documents, and the text may comprise a portion of the corresponding one of the search result documents; and providing the expanded text excerpt.
- a method may include receiving a search query; performing a search based on the search query to identify multiple search result documents; and forming a list of search results based on the search result documents, where at least a subset of the search results may include a text excerpt from a corresponding subset of the search result documents.
- the method may also include generating an expanded text excerpt for at least one of the search results, where the expanded text excerpt may include the text excerpt and text in proximity to the text excerpt in the corresponding one of the search result documents, and the text may comprise a portion of the corresponding one of the search result documents; and providing the list of search results and the expanded text excerpt.

- the processing may be performed by one or more software and/or hardware components within another device or a group of devices separate from or including server 220 and/or client 210 .
- FIGS. 5-9 are exemplary diagrams of information that may be presented to a user.
- Processing may begin with a search query being received (block 410 ).
- a search query For example, a user might provide one or more search terms of a search query to a search engine interface presented by browser 215 on a client 210 .
- the search engine interface might be provided within a document presented within a browser window provided by browser 215 or on a toolbar or in another place within the browser 215 .
- browser 215 may send the search query to a search engine, such as search engine 225 .
- search engine 225 As shown in FIG. 5 , assume that the user provides a search query “buffy hush” to the search engine interface.
- a search may be performed based on the search query to identify search result documents (block 420 ).
- the search result documents may include documents that satisfy the search query in some manner, such as by including a search term of the search query.
- search engine 225 may identify documents that include the search term “buffy,” the search term “hush,” or a combination of the search terms.
- a list of search results may be formed based on the identified search result documents (block 430 ). For example, scores may be determined for each of the search result documents.
- the score for a search result document may be based on an information retrieval (IR) score, a link-based score, or a combination of the IR and link-based scores.
- the IR score for a search result document may be based on the number of occurrences of the search term(s) in the document.
- the IR score may be adjusted based on where a search term occurs within the document (e.g., title, content, etc.) or based on a characteristic of the search term (e.g., font, size, color, etc.).
- the IR score may also, or alternatively, be adjusted based on the proximity of the search terms when multiple search terms are present. Yet other techniques for generating or adjusting an IR score for a document are known to those skilled in the art.
- the link-based score for a search result document may be based on the number and/or quality of links to or from the search result document. Several techniques exist for determining the link-based score of a document.
- the search result documents may be ranked (e.g., sorted) based on their scores and presented as a list of search results (block 430 ).
- the list of search results may be provided as a hypertext markup language (HTML) document, similar to search results provided by existing search engines.
- the search results may be provided according to another format, such as in the form of an extensible markup language (XML) document. As shown in FIG. 5 , assume that two of the search result documents correspond to documents entitled “Nothing But Buffy—Hush Episode” and “Buffy Episode Guide.”
- the list of search results may be presented to the user via, for example, a browser window of browser 215 .
- the information associated with a search result may include a title, a snippet, an address, and/or various links associated with the search result document corresponding to the search result.
- the title may identify the search result document or a portion of the search result document and, when selected, may cause the search result document to be presented.
- the title of one of the search result documents includes “Nothing But Buffy—Hush Episode.”
- the snippet may include a small text excerpt from the search result document.
- the snippet may include all or part of a sentence or all or part of two (or more) sentences.
- the snippet for the Nothing But Buffy—Hush Episode document includes two text excerpts from the document.
- the address may identify the network address (e.g., uniform resource locator (URL) address) of the search result document.
- URL uniform resource locator
- the address for the Nothing But Buffy—Hush Episode document includes “www.nothingbutbuffy.com/episode10.”
- the various links may permit other information to be presented or other action(s) to be performed.
- the various links may include a “Cached” link that may permit a cached version of the search result document to be presented, and a “Similar pages” link that may permit other documents similar to the search result document to be presented.
- the user may desire additional information regarding one of the search result documents that the user might not be able to get from the little amount of information contained in the snippet.
- the text excerpt of the snippet may contain an out-of-context text excerpt and if the snippet were a little longer it might be sufficient for the user to determine whether the corresponding search result document is what the user is seeking before investing the time to actually access the search result document.
- selection of a snippet might include clicking on the snippet using a pointing device, such as a mouse.
- selection of a snippet might include a mouse-over event, such as placing a cursor of a pointing device over the snippet for a predetermined amount of time. If the snippet includes multiple text excerpts, the user might select one of the text excerpts to obtain additional information (context) regarding that text excerpt. As shown in FIG. 6 , assume that the user selects the second text excerpt.
- an expanded snippet may be provided (block 450 ).
- An expanded snippet may include the text excerpt of the snippet with additional text located in proximity to the text excerpt in the search result document, such as text before and/or after the text excerpt.
- the additional text may include a predetermined amount of text, such as a predetermined number of terms, before and/or after the text excerpt in the search result document.
- the additional text may be more intelligently selected.
- the additional text may include all (or less than all) of the text preceding the text excerpt to a beginning or end of a structural component (e.g., paragraph, table entry, section, etc.) in which the text excerpt occurs in the search result document.
- the additional text may include a previous and/or following structural component based on the structural component in which the text excerpt occurs in the search result document.
- browser 215 may detect selection of the snippet. Browser 215 may generate a request for the expanded snippet and send the request to a server, such as server 220 . Server 220 generate the expanded snippet based on text from the search result document and send the expanded snippet to browser 215 .
- server 220 may provide expanded snippets for one or more of the search result documents when server 220 provides the list of search results to browser 215 . In this case, the expanded snippets may be generated and embedded within the list of search results and cached by client 210 .
- browser 215 may prefetch an expanded snippet for one or more of the search results before the user actually requests it.
- browser 215 may present the list of search results and automatically send a request for an expanded snippet for a set of the search result documents (without waiting for selection of a snippet by the user).
- browser 215 may detect a cursor associated with a pointing device moving over the snippet and automatically send a request for an expanded snippet for the corresponding search result (in anticipation that the user might actually select the snippet).
- the expanded snippet(s) may be cached in anticipation that the user might actually request it/them.
- An advantage of the first and third techniques is that the list of search results can be formed without the need to generate expanded snippets for one or more of the search results, which may never be requested by the user. Another advantage of the first technique is that the amount of bandwidth and processing needed for the search would be less than the second and third techniques because only expanded snippets actually requested by the users are generated/provided. An advantage of the second and third techniques is that an expanded snippet can be presented quickly to the user since it has already been cached. The particular technique that is implemented may be based on network and/or system constraints, but could be user-configurable.
- the expanded snippet may be presented within a snippet box associated with the list of search results.
- the snippet box may take the form of a small overlay that may be superimposed over the search results, such as shown in FIG. 7 .
- the snippet box may take the form of a frame that is presented in connection with the list of search results, such as shown in FIG. 8 .
- the text excerpt originally in the snippet might be visually distinguished in some manner (e.g., highlighted, bolded, etc.) to identify it within the expanded snippet.
- the expanded snippet may be presented inline within the list of search results.
- the list of search results may be represented such that the search result for which the expanded snippet was requested may be changed to include the expanded snippet in place of (or in addition to) the snippet originally presented with the search result, such as shown in FIG. 9 .
- the text excerpt originally in the snippet might be visually distinguished in some manner to identify it within the expanded snippet.
- the expanded snippet may permit the user to access the entire search result document.
- the expanded snippet might include a “view entire document” link that, when selected, may cause the corresponding search result document to be retrieved.
- the expanded snippet may permit the user to remove the expanded snippet and, thus, return to the original list of search results.
- the expanded snippet might include a “close” link that, when selected, may cause the expanded snippet to be removed.
- selection of the close link may cause the snippet box to disappear.
- selection of the close link may cause the original list of search results to be re-presented, such as shown in FIG. 5 .
- Implementations consistent with principles of the invention may selectively provide an expanded snippet to permit a user to more intelligently choose which search result document to access.
- exemplary user interfaces have been described with respect to FIGS. 5-9 .
- the user interfaces may include more, fewer, or different pieces of information.
