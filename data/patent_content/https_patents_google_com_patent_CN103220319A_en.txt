In this specification, term " software " is intended to comprise the firmware that is present in read-only memory and/or is stored in the application of magnetic storage, and it can be read in the internal memory, is handled by processor being used for.Similarly, in some implementations, a plurality of component softwares can be implemented to the subdivision than large program, keep distinguishing component software simultaneously.In some implementations, a plurality of software theme component also can be implemented to program separately.At last, describing separately any combination of program of implementing component software together here is in the scope of this subject technology.In some implementations, when being mounted when operating one or more system, the particular machine that described software process has defined one or more execution and carried out described software program operation is implemented.
Can use any type of programming language to write calculator program (also being known as program, software, software application, script or coding), comprise compiling or literal translation language, formula or cross program language, and it can use any form to carry out, and comprises as stand-alone program or as module, assembly, subprogram, object or other unit of being adapted at using in the computing environment.The calculator program can, but not necessarily, corresponding to the archives in the archives economy.Program can be stored in (for example possesses other program or data, be stored in the one or more scripts in the making language document) the part of archives in, in the single archives of the program that is used for considering or in a plurality of generic archives, (for example, store the archives of one or more modules, subprogram or part coding).The calculator program can be carried out, and with at a calculator or carry out on a plurality of calculators, described calculator position is at a place or distribute across many places, and is interconnected by communication network.
Some configurations are implemented as software process, described software process is included in the one or more API (API) in the environment, and described environment has by described one or more interfaces encodes with the calling order of called other program coding interaction.The calling (parameter that can comprise various kinds) and can between described calling order and called coding, shift of various function calls, information or other type via described API.In addition, the data type of implementing in the program coding that API can provide described calling order coding to use among the described API to define and called out or the ability of grade.
In some configurations, can use one or more API.API is the interface of being implemented by program coding assembly or nextport hardware component NextPort (" API implements assembly "), and described program coding assembly or nextport hardware component NextPort allow different program coding assemblies or nextport hardware component NextPort (" API Calls assembly ") to insert and use one or more functions, method, program, data structure, grade and/or described API to implement other service that assembly provides.One or more parameters that the API definable transmits between described API Calls assembly and described API enforcement assembly.
API allows developer's (it can be the 3rd people developer) of API Calls assembly to utilize API to implement the special characteristic that assembly provided.An API Calls assembly can be arranged, maybe can have more than a this assembly.API can be computing system or program library provides in order to support request to come the source addressable port of the service of self-application.Operating system (OS) can have a plurality of API, calls out one or more those API with the application that allows to carry out on described OS, and service (for example program library) can have a plurality of API, to allow the using application of described service to call out one or more API.When setting up application, API can come designated with the programming language that can be literal translation or compiling.
In some configurations, API implements assembly can be provided more than an API, and each provides different viewpoints or has had the functional different aspect that inserts different aspect, described functional by the enforcement of described API enforcement assembly.For example, the API that API implements assembly can provide first group of function, and can be exposed to the 3rd people developer, and another API that described API implements assembly can be hidden (not being exposed), and provide the subclass of described first group of function, and also provide another group function, for example test or debug function in described first group of function not.In other configuration, described API implements assembly itself can call out one or more other assemblies via the API of inherence, and therefore is that API Calls assembly and API implement assembly simultaneously.
When inserting and using API to implement the specific characteristic of assembly, API has defined language and parameter that the API Calls assembly uses.For example, the API Calls assembly is via the one or more API Calls that exposed by described API or call the specific characteristic that (for example call out by function or method and embody) inserts described API enforcement assembly, and via described API Calls or call and operation parameter is come Data transmission and control information.Described API implements assembly can be via described API to making a response from the API Calls of API Calls assembly and replying a value.When described API had defined the grammer of API Calls and result (for example, how to call API Calls and what API Calls done), it was how to finish the specified function of described API Calls that described API can not disclose described API Calls.Various API Calls are implemented to shift between the assembly in described calling (API Calls assembly) and API via described one or more API.Shifting described API Calls can comprise and send, begin, call, call out, receive, reply or respond described function call or information.In other words, transfer can be implemented assembly by described API Calls assembly or described API and describe action.The function call of described API or other call and can send or receive one or more parameters via parameter list or other structure.Parameter can be the tabulation or the index of constant, key, data structure, object, object grade, variable, data type, type, pointer, array, function or method, or will be via the data of described API transmission or the another way of other project in order to reference.
In addition, data type or grade can be provided by API, and implement assembly by API and implement.Therefore the API Calls assembly can be by using the definition that provides among the described API to declare variable, use pointer, using or illustrate the constant value of this type or grade.
Generally speaking, API can implement service or the data that assembly provided in order to insert API, or begins to carry out operation or the calculating that described API enforcement assembly provides.Utilize the mode of example, each can be operating system, library, device driver, API, application program or other module any one of them (will be appreciated that described API enforcement assembly and described API Calls assembly can be the module of the type that is same to each other or different to each other) described API enforcement assembly and API Calls assembly.In some instances, API enforcement assembly can embody in firmware, microcoding or other hardware logic at least in part.In some configurations, API can allow CLIENT PROGRAM to use software development cover group (SDK) service that the storehouse provided.In other configuration, the API that application or other CLIENT PROGRAM can use application framework to provide.In these configurations, function or the method that API that provide to described SDK and described provides can be provided into calling for described application or CLIENT PROGRAM, or the data type or the object that use among the described SDK definition and described API to provide.In these configurations, application framework can be provided for the part circulation of taking charge to the program of the variety of event reaction of various described framework definition.Described API allows described application to use described application framework to specify described incident and for the reaction of described incident.In some implementations, API Calls can be to using the ability or the state of report hardware unit, comprise those and for example input capability and state, fan-out capability and state, disposal ability, power rating, memory capacity and state, communication capacity, or the like relevant aspect, and described API can partly be implemented by firmware, microcoding or other low-level logic that part is carried out on described nextport hardware component NextPort.
The API Calls assembly can be on network via API implement component communication with API local component (promptly, implementing on the identical data treatment system of assembly as described API) or remote component (that is, implementing on the different pieces of information treatment system of assembly from described API).Will be appreciated that, API implements assembly and also can be used as API Calls assembly (that is, it can make API Calls to implemented the API that assembly exposes by different API) and API Calls assembly and also can be used as API by the API that implements to be exposed to different API Calls assemblies and implement assembly.
API can allow a plurality of API Calls assemblies of writing with different programming languages, with and API implement component communication (therefore described API can comprise that feature that translation is called out and described API implement the answer between assembly and the described API Calls assembly).Yet described API can implement about specific programming language.In a configuration, the API Calls assembly can be called out API from different suppliers, for example from one group of API of OS supplier, and from another group API of plug-in unit supplier, and from another group API(supplier of software library for example of another supplier) or the creator of described another group API.
