Definitions
- a computer-implemented method includes accessing audio data that includes encoded speech; accessing information that indicates a docking context of a client device, the docking context being associated with the audio data; identifying a plurality of language models; selecting at least one of the plurality of language models based on the docking context; and performing speech recognition on the audio data using the selected language model to identify a transcription for a portion of the audio data.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features.
- the information that indicates a docking context of the client device indicates a connection between the client device and a second device with which the client device is physically connected.
- the information that indicates a docking context of the client device indicates a connection between the client device and a second device with which the client device is wirelessly connected.
- the method includes determining, for each of the plurality of language models, a weighting value to assign to the language model based on the docking context, the weighting value indicating a probability that the language model will indicate a correct transcription for the encoded speech, where selecting at least one of the plurality of language models based on the docking context includes selecting at least one of the plurality of language models based on the assigned weighting values.
- the speech encoded in the audio data was detected by the client device, and the information that indicates a docking context indicates whether the client device was connected to a docking station while the speech encoded in the audio data was detected by the client device.
- the speech encoded in the audio data was detected by the client device, and the information that indicates a docking context indicates a type of docking station to which the client device was connected while the speech encoded in the audio data was detected by the client device.
- the encoded speech includes one or more spoken query terms
- the transcription includes a transcription of the spoken query terms
- the method further includes causing a search engine to perform a search using the transcription of the one or more spoken query terms and providing information indicating the results of the search to the client device.
- Determining weighting values for each of the plurality of language models includes accessing stored weighting values associated with the docking context. Determining weighting values for each of the plurality of language models includes accessing stored weighting values and altering the stored weighting values based on the docking context. Each of the plurality of language models is trained for a particular topical category of words. Determining a weighting value based on the docking context includes determining that the client device is connected to a vehicle docking station and determining, for a navigation language model trained to output addresses, a weighting value that increases the probability that the navigation language model is selected relative to the other language models in the plurality of language models.
- a computer-implemented method includes detecting audio containing speech at a client device; encoding the detected audio as audio data;
- the server system transmitting the audio data to a server system; identifying a docking context of the device; transmitting information indicating the docking context to the server system; and receiving a transcription of at least a portion of the audio data at the client device, the server system having selected a language model from a plurality of language models based on the information indicating the docking context, generated the transcription by performing speech recognition on the audio data using the selected language model, and transmitted the transcription to the client device.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features.
- the identified docking context is the docking context of the client device at the time the audio is detected.
- the information indicating a docking context of the client device indicates a connection between the client device and a second device with which the client device is physically connected.
- the information indicating a docking context of the client device indicates a connection between the client device and a second device with which the client device is wirelessly connected.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example of a system for performing speech recognition using a docking context of a client device.
- FIG. 2A is a diagram illustrating an example of a representation of a language model.
- FIG. 2B is a diagram illustrating an example of a use of an acoustic model with the language model illustrated in FIG. 2A.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a process for performing speech recognition using a docking context of a client device.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of computing devices.
- the docking context of a client device can be used to improve the accuracy of speech recognition.
- a speech recognition system can include multiple language models, each trained for a different topic or category of words.
- the speech recognition can also access information indicating a docking context associated with the speech.
- the docking context can include, for example, the docking context of a device that detected the speech, at the time the speech was detected.
- the speech recognition system can use the docking context to select a particular language model to use for recognizing the speech entered in that docking context.
- the docking context of a device can indicate the type of speech that a user of the device is likely to speak while the device is in that docking context. For example, a user speaking into a client device connected to a car docking station is likely to use words related to navigation or addresses.
- the speech recognition system can select a language model trained for navigation-related words and use it to recognize the speech. By selecting a particular language model based on the docking context, the speech recognition system can bias the speech recognition process toward words most likely to have been spoken in that docking context. As a result, speech recognition using a language model selected based on docking context can yield a transcription that is more accurate than speech recognition using a generalized language model.

- the docking context indicates information about docking stations that are physically coupled to the client device, for example, through a cable or a direct physical link.
- the docking context indicates docking stations 106 that are determined to be in geographical proximity to the client device 102 and are connected through a wireless protocol such as Bluetooth.
- a wireless protocol such as Bluetooth.
- the client device 102 may wirelessly connect to a docking station 106 that is physically connected to the vehicle. Even if the client device 102 is not physically connected to the vehicle docking station 106, the wireless connection can be included in the docking context.
- the docking context can indicate one or more other devices in communication with the client device 102, such as a wirelessly connected earpiece.
- the docking context can include any of the devices with which the client device 102 is in communication.
- the client device 102 generates docking context information 107 that indicates one or more aspects of the docking context.
- the docking context information 107 is associated with the audio data 105.
- the docking context information 107 can indicate the docking context of the client device 102 in which the speech encoded in the audio data 105 was detected by the client device 102.
- the client device 102 or another system can store the docking context information 107 in association with the audio data 105.
- the speech recognition system 104 accesses the docking context information 107.
- the speech recognition system 104 also accesses the audio data 105.
- the client device 102 can transmit the docking context information 107 and the audio data 105 to the speech recognition system 104.
- the docking context information 107, the audio data 105, or both can be accessed from a storage device connected to the speech recognition system 104 or from another system.
- the docking context information 107 can be accessed before the audio data 105, or even before the terms 103 encoded in the audio data 105 are spoken.
- the client device 102 can be configured to provide updated docking context information 107 to the speech recognition system 104 when the docking context of the client device 102 changes.
- the most recently received docking context information 107 can be assumed to indicate the current docking context.
- the speech recognition system 104 can use the docking context information 107 to select a language model to use to recognize the first word in a speech sequence.
- the speech recognition system 104 can select the language model based on the docking context information 107 even before the user 101 begins to speak.
- the speech recognition system 104 identifies multiple language models 11 la-11 Id.
- the language models l l la-l l ld can indicate, for example, a probability of an occurrence of a term in a sequence of terms based on other terms in the sequence.
- the language models l l la-l l ld can each be separately focused on a particular topic (e.g., navigation or shopping) or type of terms (e.g., names or addresses).
- language models l l la-l l ld can be specialized for a specific action (e.g., voice dialing or playing media) or for a particular docking context (e.g., undocked, connected to a car docking station, or connected to a media docking station).
- the language models l l la-l l ld can include a subset of the vocabulary included in a general-purpose language model.
- the language model 1 11 a for navigation can include terms that are used in navigation, such as numbers and addresses.
- the speech recognition system can identify even more fine-grained language models than those illustrated. For example, instead of a single language model 1 1 Id for media, the speech recognition system 104 can identify distinct language models (or portions of the language model 1 1 Id) that relate to video, audio, or images.
- the language models l l la-l l ld identified can be submodels included in a larger, general language model.
- a general language model can include several language models trained specifically for accurate prediction of particular types of words. For example, one language model may be trained to predict names, another to predict numbers, and another to predict addresses, and so on.
- the speech recognition system 104 can identify language models l l la-l l ld that are associated with the docking context indicated in the docking context information 107. For example, the speech recognition system 104 can identify language models 11 la-11 Id that have at least a threshold probability of matching terms 103 spoken by the user 101. As another example, a particular set of language models l l la-l l ld can be predetermined to correspond to particular docking context.
- the speech recognition system 104 can identify language models 11 la-1 1 Id based on previously recognized speech. For example, the speech recognition system 104 may determine that based on a prior recognized word, "play", a language model for games and a language model for media are the most likely to match terms that follow in the sequence. As a result, the speech recognition system 104 can identify the language model for games and the language model for media as language models that may be used to recognize speech encoded in the audio data 105.
- the speech recognition system 104 determines weighting values for each of the identified language models l l la-l l ld based on the docking context indicated in the docking context information 107.
- weighting values for each of the identified language models 11 la-11 Id are also based on other information, such as output from a language model based on already recognized terms in a speech sequence. The weighting values that are determined are assigned to the respective of the language models l l la-l l ld.
- the weighting values can indicate the probabilities that the terms 103 spoken by the user 101 match the types of terms included in the respective language models l l la-l l ld, and thus that the language models 1 1 la-1 1 Id will indicate a correct transcription of the terms 103.
- the weighting value assigned to the navigation language model 11 la can indicate a probability that the speech encoded in the audio data 105 includes navigational terms.
- the weighting value assigned to the web search language model 11 lb can indicate a probability that the speech encoded in the audio data includes common terms generally used in web searches.
- the speech recognition system 104 can select from among multiple sets 112, 1 13, 1 14, 1 15 of stored weighting values. Each set 1 12, 113, 1 14, 115 of weighting values can correspond to a particular docking context. In the example illustrated, the set 113 of weighting values corresponds to the vehicle docking station 106 . Because the docking context information 107 indicates that the client device 102 is connected to a vehicle docking station 106, the speech recognition system selects the set 1 13 of weighting values corresponding to a vehicle docking station 106. The weighting values within the set 1 13 are assigned to the respective language models l l la-l l ld.
- the weighting values in various sets 1 12, 1 13, 1 14, 1 15 can be determined by, for example, performing statistical analysis on a large number of terms spoken by various users in various docking contexts.
- the weighting value for a particular language model given a particular docking context can be based on the observed frequency that the language model yields accurate results in that docking context. If, for example, the navigation language model 11 la predicts speech correctly for 50% of speech that occurs when a client device 102 is in a vehicle docking station, then the weighting value for the navigation language model 11 la in the set 1 13 can be 0.5.
- An example of how a language model predicts speech is described below with reference to Figs. 2A and 2B.
- the speech recognition system 104 can determine weighting values for the language models l l la-l l ld by adjusting an initial set of weighting values. For example, a set 1 12 of weighting values can be used when the docking context information 107 indicates that the client device 102 is undocked, or when the docking context of the client device 102 is unknown. When docking context information 107 indicates the client device 102 is docked, individual weighting values of the set 1 12 can be changed based on various aspects of the docking context. Weighting values can be determined using formulas, look-up tables, and other methods.
- the speech recognition system 104 can use docking context to select from among sets of stored weighting values that each correspond to a key phrase.
- the sets 112, 1 13, 114, 115 of weighting values are not required to be associated directly to a single docking context.
- the set 112 may be associated with the key phrase "navigate to.”
- the set 1 12 is selected whether the docking context is known or not.
- the client device 102 is known to be in the vehicle docking station 106, the set 112 can be selected as if the user had spoken the key phrase "navigate to,” even if the user 101 did not speak the key phrase.
- Docking context can influence various determinations and types of weighting values that are ultimately used to select a language model, such as from a start state to a state associated with one or more key phrases, or from weighting values associated with a key phrase to the selection of a particular language model. Docking context can be used to determine weighting values used to select one or more states corresponding to key phrases, and the states corresponding to key phrases can in turn be associated with weighting values for language models l l la-l l ld.
- the vehicle docking context can be used to determine a weighting value of "0.6" for a state corresponding to the phrase "navigate to” and a weighting value of "0.4" for a state corresponding to the phrase "call.”
- Each key phrase state can be associated with a set of weighting values that indicates the likelihood of various language models from that state.
- docking context can be used to modify the weighting values.
- a state associated with the phrase "navigate to" may include weighting values that indicate that a navigation language model is twice as likely as a business language model.
- the docking context can be used to modify the weighting values so that, for recognition of the current dictation, the navigation language model is three times as likely as the business language model.
- the speech recognition system 104 selects a language model based on the assigned weighting values. As illustrated in table 116, weighting values 1 13 a- 1 13d from the set 113 are assigned to the language models l l la-l l ld. These weighting values 113 a- 113d indicate the probability that the corresponding language models l l la-l l ld match the terms 103 spoken by the user 101, based on the docking context indicated in the docking context information 107.
- the language model 11 la for navigation has the highest weighting value 1 13a, which indicates that, based on the docking context, the language model 11 la is the most likely to accurately predict the contents of the terms 103 encoded in the audio data 105. Based on the weighting values, the speech recognition system 104 selects the language model 11 la to use for speech recognition of the audio data 105.
- a single language model 11 la is selected based on the weighting values 1 13a-l 13d.
- multiple language models 1 1 la-1 1 Id can be selected based on the weighting values 1 13a-l 13d. For example, a subset including the top N language models l l la-l l ld can be selected and later used to identify candidate transcriptions for the audio data 105.
- the speech recognition system 104 can also select a language model using the weighting values in combination with other factors. For example, the speech recognition system 104 can determine a weighted combination of the weighting values 113 a- 113d and other weighting values, such as weighting values based on previous words recognized in the speech sequence or based on previous transcriptions.
- the speech recognition system 104 may transcribe a first term in a sequence as "play." Weighting values based on the docking context alone may indicate that either a navigation language model or a media language model should be used to recognize subsequent speech. A second set of weighting values based on other information (such as the output of a language model that was previously used to recognize the first term, "play") may indicate that either a game language model or a media language model should be used. Taking into account both sets of weighting values, the speech recognition system 104 can select the media language model as the most likely to yield an accurate transcription of the next term in the sequence. As described in this example, in some instances, different language models can be used to recognize different terms in a sequence, even though the docking context may be the same for each term in a sequence.
- the speech recognition system 104 performs speech recognition on the audio data 105 using the selected language model 1 11a.
- the speech recognition system 104 identifies a transcription for at least a portion of the audio data 105.
- the speech recognition system 104 is more likely to correctly recognize the terms 103 using the selected language model 1 11a than with a general language model. This is because the docking context indicates the types of terms most likely to be encoded in the audio data 105, and the selected language model 11 la is selected to best predict those likely terms.
- the speech recognition system 104 may narrow the range of possible transcriptions for the term 103 to those indicated by the selected language model 11 1a. This can substantially improve speech recognition, especially for the first word in a phrase. Generally, there is a very large set of terms that can occur at the beginning of a speech sequence. For the first term in the sequence, the speech recognition system does not have the benefit of prior words in the sequence to indicate terms that are likely to follow.
- the speech recognition system 104 still biases recognition to the correct set of terms because the selected language model 1 11a, selected based on the docking context, is already tailored to the likely content of the terms 103. Using the language model selected based on docking context can thus allow speech recognition as accurate or even more accurate than if the user had specified the topic of speech in a prefix phrase.
- the spoken terms 103 include an address, "10 Main Street," and there is no spoken prefix phrase (e.g., "navigate to") that indicates that the terms 103 include an address.
- the speech recognition system 104 selects a specialized language model 11 1a that is trained (e.g., optimized or specialized) for addresses.
- This language model 11 la can indicate a high probability that the first term encoded in the audio data 105 will be a number, and that the first term is then followed by a street name.
- the specialized vocabulary and patterns included in the selected language model 11 1a can increase the accuracy of the speech recognition of the audio data 105.
- terms that are outside the focus of the selected language model 11 1a can be excluded from the language model 11 1a, thus excluding them as possible transcriptions for the terms 103.
- those terms may be included as valid transcription possibilities in a general language model, which may include many terms that seem to be valid possibilities, but are in fact extraneous for recognizing the current terms 103.
- the speech recognition system 104 selects a transcription, "10 Main Street," for the audio data 105.
- the transcription can be transmitted to the search engine system 109.
- the transcription can also be transmitted to the client device 102, allowing the user 101 can verify the accuracy of the transcription and make corrections if necessary.
- the search engine system 109 performs a search using the transcription of the spoken query terms 103.
- the search can be a web search, a search for navigation directions, or another type of search.
- Information indicating the results of the search query is transmitted to the client device 102.
- the transcription is determined using a specialized language model 11 la that is selected based on the docking context. Accordingly, the likelihood that the transcription matches the query terms 103 spoken by the user 101 is greater than a likelihood using a general language model. As a result, the search query that includes the transcription is more likely to be the search that the user 101 intended.
- the transcription of the terms 103 is described as being used in a search, various other uses of the transcription are possible.
- the transcription can be used to, for example, retrieve a map or directions, find and play music or other media, identify a contact and initiate communication, select and launch an application, locate and open a document, activate functionality of the mobile device 102 (such as a camera), and so on.
- information retrieved using the transcription can be identified by one or more of a server system, the client device 102, or the docking station 106.
- a different language model l l la-l l ld can be selected and used to recognize speech in different portions of the audio data 105.
- FIG. 2A is a diagram illustrating an example of a representation of a language model 200.
- a speech recognition system receives audio data that includes speech and outputs one or more transcriptions that best match the audio data.
- the speech recognition system can simultaneously or sequentially perform multiple functions to recognize one or more terms from the audio data.
- the speech recognition system can include an acoustic model and a language model 200.
- the language model 200 and acoustic model can be used together to select one or more transcriptions of the speech in the audio data.
- the acoustic model can be used to identify terms that match a portion of audio data. For a particular portion of audio data, the acoustic model can output terms that match various aspects of the audio data and a weighting value or confidence score that indicates the degree that each term matches the audio data.
- the language model 200 can include information about the relationships between terms in speech patterns.
- the language model 200 can include information about sequences of terms that are commonly used and sequences that comply with grammar rules and other language conventions.
- the language model 200 can be used to indicate the probability of the occurrence of a term in a speech sequence based on one or more other terms in the sequence.
- the language model 200 can identify which word has the highest probability of occurring at a particular part of a sequence of words based on the preceding words in the sequence.
- the language model 200 includes a set of nodes 201a-201i and transitions 202a- 202h between the nodes 201a-201i.
- Each node 201a-201i represents a decision point at which a single term (such as a word) is selected in a speech sequence.
- Each transition 202a- 202h outward from a node 201a-201i is associated with a term that can be selected as a component of the sequence.
- Each transition 202a-202h is also associated with a weighting value that indicates, for example, the probability that the term associated with the transition 202a-202h occurs at that point in the sequence.
- the weighting values can be set based on the multiple previous terms in the sequence. For example, the transitions at each node and the weighting values for the transitions can be determined on the N terms that occur prior to the node in the speech sequence.
- a first node 201a that represents a decision point at which the first term in a speech sequence is selected.
- the only transition from node 201a is transition 202a, which is associated with the term "the.”
