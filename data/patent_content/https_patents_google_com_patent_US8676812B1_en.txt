Definitions
- This specification relates to information used by a search engine to score and rank resources.
- Internet search engines identify resources (e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content) that are relevant to submitted search queries and return search results corresponding to the identified resources in response to the submitted queries.
- resources e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content
- Some search engines rank the resources according to a score for each resource. These scores can be determined, for example, by combining multiple indicator values each measuring one or more characteristics of the resource. Some search engines weight each indicator value according to a fixed weight when calculating the score for a resource.
- a search engine generates scores for an item, e.g., a resource that can be the subject of a search or an author identity, by combining indicator values each measuring one or more characteristics of the item according to a formula or processes.
- An author identity is an identity of an author of resources. For example, an author identity can correspond to a particular screen name used by an author of resources.
- One or more of the indicator values are each weighted by a weight that is determined from an indicator-specific function and the value itself. This allows the search engine to emphasize different indicator values for different items. The search engine can then rank resources according to the generated scores or according to different scores derived from the generated scores.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating a score for each of a plurality of items, the generating comprising, for each item: obtaining a respective item-specific value of each of a plurality of indicators; determining a respective weight for the value of each of the plurality of indicators, wherein the respective weight for one or more of the plurality of indicators is derived from the value of the indicator; and generating the score for the item from the item-specific values, wherein generating the score comprises combining the item-specific values and weighting each item-specific value by the respective weight for the value; and providing the score for each item to a ranking engine implemented on one or more computers, wherein the ranking engine ranks resources based, at least in part, on the scores for the items.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the operations of the methods.
- the indicator specific function takes the value of the indicator as input and outputs the respective weight for the value of the indicator.
- the function takes a value of an indicator as input and outputs a respective weight adjustment for the value of the indicator; and determining the respective weight for the value of the indicator further comprises adjusting a base weight for the indicator by the respective weight adjustment.
- Each item is a resource.
- Each item is an author identity.
- a search engine can emphasize different indicator values for different items. This reflects the fact that different indicators best represent different items. This can be particularly useful when the set of indicators being used to score each item is large relative to the number of indicator values that are actually good indicators for any given item.
- Hand tuning the weight functions can be easier than hand tuning other functions when the indicators have a meaning that the humans tuning the weight functions understand.
- the weight functions used to determine the weights for each indicator value can be learned by the operation of computer systems performing machine learning processes that operate on smaller and sparser data sets than would be required to achieve the same level of granularity in a score generation function that uses fixed weights, i.e., weights that do not change with the indicator values.
- the resulting item scores for each item can have more variance than item scores generated using conventional techniques. This can reduce the chance that two items that are actually different will have the same score.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example search system.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example method for generating an item score for an item and providing the item score to a search engine.
- FIG. 3 is a graph of an example function that maps indicator values to weights.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example search system 100 for providing search results relevant to submitted queries as can be implemented in an internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment.
- the search system 100 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the search system 100 includes an index database 102 and a search engine 104 .
- the index database 102 stores index data for resources.
- Example resources include web pages, images, news articles, and social network posts.
- the search engine 104 includes an indexing engine 108 and a ranking engine 110 .
- the indexing engine 108 indexes resources and stores index information in the index database 102 .
- the indexing engine can index resources using conventional techniques.
- the ranking engine 110 ranks resources, for example, in response to user queries.
- the ranking engine 110 can rank the resources using conventional techniques.
- one input the ranking engine 110 uses to rank the resources is a respective item score associated with each resource.
- the ranking engine 110 can rank a set of resources according to their respective item scores or according to a score for each resource that the ranking engine 100 derives from the item scores.
- An item can be, for example, a resource or an author identity of an author of a resource.
- the description below describes the case in which the item score is a query-independent quality score that represents an overall quality of the item.
- the item score can be a query-dependent score that represents how well the item matches or satisfies a particular query.
- the item scores are generated by an item score generator 111 .
- the item score generator 111 generates the item score for an item from one or more values of indicators for the item.
- an indicator is a characteristic or combination of characteristics of an item
- an indicator value is a value that represents a measurement or an estimate of the characteristic or combination of characteristics.
- the item score generator weights one or more of the indicator values by a weight determined from an indicator-specific function of the indicator value.
- the value-specific weight for each indicator value reflects a confidence that the value accurately reflects the quality of the item. This is in contrast to systems that use fixed weights, where the weight reflects a confidence that the indicator itself, as opposed to the value, accurately reflects the quality of the item. This difference allows the item score generator 111 to place more importance on indicator values that more accurately represent the quality of the item, and to select different indicator values as more accurately representing different items. An example method for generating item scores is described in more detail below, with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the item score generator uses value-specific weights for all of the indicator values. In other implementations, the item score generator uses value-specific weights for the values of some, but not all, of the indicator values and uses fixed weights for the values of the other indicator values.
- a user 112 generally interacts with the search system 100 through a user device 114 .
- the user device 114 can be a computer coupled to the search system 100 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the search system 100 and the user device 114 are implemented on one machine.
- a user can install a search application on the user device 114 .
- the user 112 submits a query 116 to the search engine 104 .
- the query 116 is transmitted through a network, to the search system 100 .
- the search engine 104 identifies and ranks resources that match the query 116 .
- the search system then transmits search results 118 corresponding to the resources through the network to the user device 114 for presentation to the user 112 , e.g., in a search results web page to be displayed by a web browser running on the user device 114 .
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example method 200 for generating an item score for an item and providing the item score to a ranking engine.
- the item can be, for example, a resource or an author identity of an author of a resource.
- the method 200 is described with reference to a system of one or more computers running one or more programs that perform the method.
- the system can be, for example, the item score generator 111 described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the system obtains an item-specific value for each indicator in a group of indicators ( 202 ).
- an indicator for the particular resource can be the quality of the author of the resource and the indicator value can be a number that represents the quality of the author of the particular resource.
- an indicator for the author of the resource can be the number of positive reviews of resources authored by the author identity, and the value can be the actual number of positive reviews for the author identity.
- the system can obtain the item-specific value for each indicator in the group of indicators from one or more systems that analyze characteristics of the resource and generate item-specific values. These systems can generate the item-specific values using conventional techniques.
- the system determines a weight for each item-specific value ( 204 ).
- the weight is used by the system to represent the relative importance of the indicator values when determining a score representing the quality of the particular item.
- the quality of different types of items is best represented by different indicators.
- indicators A, B, and C might best represent the quality of the item
- indicators D, E, and F might best represent the quality of the item.
- the weight the system determines for each item-specific value represents a confidence that the value accurately represents the quality of the item.
- the values for indicators A, B, and C for an item of the first type would have weights higher than usual
- the values for indicators D, E, and F for an item of the second type would have weights higher than usual.
- the system determines the appropriate weight by applying a function that maps indicator values to weights.
- the function is indicator-specific.
- the system stores base weights for each indicator value. These base weights can be determined using conventional techniques, for example, using machine learning systems, human raters, hand tuning, or a combination of them. The system can then determine an appropriate weight adjustment to the base weight for each indicator value from the indicator value itself, for example, by applying an indicator-specific function that maps indicator values to weights or weight adjustments. The system can then adjust each base weight by the determined weight adjustment, and use the adjusted weight.
- the weights can be learned using machine learning techniques. Regardless of whether the function the system uses specifies the full value of the weight or a weight adjustment, the coefficients of the function for an indicator can be determined from an analysis of training data that includes indicator values for multiple training items. The system doing the training can analyze this data and determine the appropriate coefficients for each indicator-specific function using conventional methods, for example, using machine learning techniques, human raters, and hand tuning of the coefficients.
- Each indicator-specific function can have a pre-determined form, for example, a polynomial function, a logarithmic function, an exponential function, a sine function, or a step function. Other forms can also be used.
- the system receives data that includes indicator values for a number of items as well as a respective target score for each of the items.
- the target scores are obtained, for example, from human raters who rate the training items on a particular scale.
- the system learns the coefficients for each indicator-specific function that best map the indicator values for each item to the target score.
- the system learns the coefficients for all of the indicator-specific functions simultaneously. In other implementations, the system learns the coefficients for all of the indicator-specific functions individually, in sequence, and iterates over the functions until a convergence condition is satisfied.
- the convergence condition can be, for example, that a threshold number of iterations has been exceeded, or that less than a threshold change occurred in the coefficients of any function.
- FIG. 3 is an example graph 300 of an example relationship between indicator values for a particular indicator and weights for the indicator values. Indicator values on the high end or the low end have high weights, while indicator values in the middle have lower weights.
- FIG. 3 illustrates one example function, however other indicator-specific functions can also be used. For example, another example function could assign higher weights to indicator values in the middle than to indicator values on the low or high end. Another example function could assign higher weights to indicator values on one end, e.g., the high end or the low end, than to any other indicator values.
- the system generates a score from the item-specific values and the weights ( 206 ).
- the score is a combination of the item-specific values, each weighted by its corresponding weight.
- the score can be a sum of the values, each weighted by its corresponding weight, i.e.:
- v i the value for indicator i
- w i (v i ) the weight for the indicator value v i for indicator i
- I the set of indicators.
- the score can be a function of the sum.
- the score can be a calculated from a sum of the values for the good indicators, each weighted by its corresponding weight, and a sum of the values for the bad indicators, each weighted by its corresponding weight.
- the score can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the values for the bad indicators from the sum of the values for the good indicators, i.e.:
- G is the set of indicators that have been classified as good
- B is the set of indicators that have been classified as bad
- v g is the value of indicator g
- v b is the value of indicator b
- w g (v g ) is the weight for the indicator value v g for indicator g
- w b (v b ) is the weight for the indicator value v h for indicator b.
- the score can be a function of the difference.
- the score can be calculated by dividing the sum of the values for the good indicators by the sum of the values of the bad indicators, i.e.:
- G is the set of indicators that have been classified as good
- B is the set of indicators that have been classified as bad
- v g is the value of indicator g
- v b is the value of indicator b
- w g (v g ) is the weight for the indicator value v g for indicator g
- w b (v b ) is the weight for the indicator value v b for indicator b.
- the score can be a function of the quotient.
- bad indicators can be given negative weights and the score can be the sum, or a function of the sum.
- the indicators used in the calculations described above can be, but do not have to be, independent of each other.
- the system combines multiple dependent indicator values, i.e. indicator values for indicators that are not independent but instead influence each other's values, into one combined indicator value that is used instead of the multiple dependent indicator values.
- the system can learn appropriate weights to account for the dependencies between indicator values, for example, using conventional machine learning techniques.
- the system provides the score to a ranking engine ( 208 ), for example, the ranking engine 108 described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the ranking engine ranks resources based, at least in part, on the item scores, for example, as described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
