Definitions
- This specification relates to presentation of image search results responsive to a search query.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, webpages, image files, audio files, and videos. These resources include content for particular subjects, book articles, or news articles.
- a search system can select one or more resources in response to receiving a search query.
- a search query is data that a user submits to a search engine to find information to satisfy the user's informational needs.
- the search queries are usually in the form of text, e.g., one or more query terms, but other types of search queries can also be processed.
- the search system selects and scores content, such as images and resources, based on their relevance to the search query and on their importance relative to other resources, and provides search results that link to the selected content.
- the search results are typically ranked according to the scores and presented according to the ranking.
- an image may be scored based on one or more of the relevance of tags, e.g., captions associated with the image, to the query terms, the selection rate of the image, and other factors.
- tags e.g., captions associated with the image
- An images may not always depict content that closely corresponds to the underlying content of the resource in which the image is displayed. For example, an image of an artist performing with an iconic landmark in the background may be displayed in a web page that includes an article reporting on the performance. The underlying web page and the article, however, may provide no information about the famous landmark in the background. Regardless, many image processing systems will recognize the landmark in the background and tag the image as being relevant to the landmark. Furthermore, if the artist is relatively famous, the image and the resource may receive a relative high amount of traffic.
- the user may be presented with the image as one of many search results.
- the underlying resource which reports on the artist's performance, will likely not satisfy the user's informational needs regarding the famous landmark.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of, for each resource in a plurality of resources, wherein each resource includes one or more images and text that is separate from each of the one or more images: determining, by a data processing apparatus, and from the text of the resource, resource topics described by the text of the resource. For each of the one the one or more images, processing, by the data processing apparatus, the image to determine a set of image topics that describe topics to which content depicted in the image belongs. Determining, by the data process apparatus, one or topic match scores, wherein each topic match score is a measure of relevance one or more of the image topics of the image to one or more of the resource topics of the resource.
- the present systems and methods provide image search results based on topical similarity between the image and the resource that includes the image.
- the topicality similarity is used as a ranking signal to rank images responsive to a search query.
- the system provides image search results that link to images that are very likely to be topically relevant to the text of the resources on which the images are hosted. This better serves users whose informational needs are only partially satisfied by an image, and who may benefit from additional contextual information included in the resource. This results in fewer query revisions and searches, which, in turn, improves the overall system performance of a system that performs image searching operations.
- the present systems and methods also take into account the image's characteristics (e.g., size, location, type, etc.) when determining the topic match score for each image presented in an image search result. Taking into account the image's characteristics when determining the topic match score further refines the accuracy of the relevance of the image to the search query.
- the image's characteristics e.g., size, location, type, etc.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which image search results are processed.
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram illustrating components that score topics and topic relevance for an image.
- FIG. 2B is a flowchart of an example process for determining topic match scores by the system in FIG. 2A .
- FIG. 3A is a block diagram illustrating components for ranking image search results based on image topic match scores.
- FIG. 3B is a flow chart of an example process for ranking image search results by the system in FIG. 3A
- Image search results are presented to a user, typically in response to a search query, in an attempt to satisfy the informational need of the user.
- Image search results are generated by ranking images based on a relevance of the content depicted in the image to the search query, a relevance of the content in the image to the topicality of content within the resource that the image belongs, and, optionally, the prominence of the image within the resource.
- the relevance of the content in the image to the topicality of content within the resource that the image belongs and the prominence of the image within the resource are measures that may be stored in an index prior to query time.
- a search system selects resources, such as web pages, that include images. For each resource, the system determines resource topics described by the text of the resource. For each image in the resource, the system determines a set of image topics that describe topics to which content depicted in the image belongs. The resource topics and the image topics are compared to each other to determine a topic match score indicative of how similar the image content topics are to the resource topics.
- the system can also determine a prominence score for each image and use this prominence score to adjust the topic match scores.
- the prominence score describes how prominent the image is within the resource that it is presented in. For example, an image with a higher prominence score may be a larger image centrally displayed within the resource. Conversely, an image with a lower prominence score may be a thumbnail image located at the bottom or side of the resource.
- Each image's topic match score can be modified by incorporating the image's prominence score.
- the system can access previously determined resource topics, image topics, and topic match scores for particular candidate images by accessing information stored the index.
- the system can then determine, for each of the images, a search score based on these values.
- the search score is a measures of relevance of the image to the image seeking query.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which image search results are processed.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 (e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination of them), that connects web pages 104 , user devices 108 , and the search system 116 .
- the environment 100 may include many thousands of web pages 104 and user devices 108 .
- a web page 104 is one or more resources associated with a domain name, and each web page is hosted by one or more servers.
- An example web page is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, graphic images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each web page 104 is maintained by a publisher, e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web page.
- a web page 104 can include one or more images 106 that is presented with the resource. Each web page 104 and image 106 is associated with a resource address, such as a URL. Web pages 104 include text and may also include links to other types of resources that are rendered and displayed with the text of the webpage resource. In particular, images 106 are often rendered with web pages 104 . An image 106 is represented by image data that is used to render an image of a subject. While image data is typically included in web page data, they can also be hosted as separately addressable resources.
- the search system 116 identifies the resources by crawling the publisher web pages 104 and indexing the resources provided by the publisher web pages 104 .
- the indexes are stored in an image resource index 114 and a web page index 118 .
- the indexes 114 and 118 are shown as separate indexes.
- the indexes can be combined in a single index, and search for a respective corpus can be constrained to the portion of the combined index that is used to index the respective corpus.
- the web page index 118 is searched, and resources are ranked based on information retrieval (“IR”) scores that measure the relevance of the resource to the query, and optionally an authority score of each resource relative to other resources.
- the ranking of the search results is based on relevance scores that are a combination (e.g., sums, products, or other mathematical combinations) of the IR scores and the authority scores.
- the search results 122 are ordered according to these relevance scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- the search system 116 accesses the image resource index 114 .
- the search system 116 determines a search score for an image that measures the relevance of an image to an image seeking query.
- the user devices 108 receive the search results 122 , e.g., in the form of a listing of the results in a webpage, and render the pages for presentation to users.
- the search results are data generated by the search system 116 that identifies resources that are responsive to a particular search query.
- Each search result includes a link to a corresponding resource, e.g., a link to a webpage for a general search result, or link to an image for an image search result.
- An example general search result includes a webpage title, a snippet of text, and a URL of the webpage.
- An example image search result includes a thumbnail of an image, a URL of the webpage in which the image is referenced, and, optionally, labeled data describing the subject of the image.
- the search system 116 accesses topic match scores in an image topic match score index 120 .
- the image topic match scores define, for each image in each resource, a measure of relevance of one or more of image topics of the image to one or more of resource topics of the resource. These topic match scores are used, in part, to generate search scores for an image in response to an image seeking query.
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram illustrating components that score topics and topic relevance for an image.
- the components may be implemented in a data processing apparatus of one or more computers.
- An image/resource topic scorer 112 processes resources 104 that each include one or more images. Each resource also includes other information, such as text, that is separate from each of the one or more images. For each resource, the scorer 112 determines a topic match score(s) for each image in the resource. In particular, the topic match score for an image is based on the relevance of topics to which content depicted in the image belongs to the resource topics described by the text of the resource. Thus, the higher the relevance of the topics of the content in the image to the topics of content of the resource, the higher the topic match score.
- the image/resource topic scorer 112 includes an image topic identifier 202 , a resource topic identifier 204 , and a topic match scorer 206 , the operations of which are described with reference to FIG. 2B , which is a flowchart of an example process 250 for determining topic match scores by the system in FIG. 2A .
- the process 250 is performed for each resource 104 that includes one or more images.
- the resource topic identifier 204 determines, from the text of the resource, resource topics described by the text of the resource ( 252 ). In some implementations, the resource topic identifier determines the topics of the using one or more of semantic analysis of the text body of the resource, analyzing anchor text in the resource and the title of the resource, and/or any other appropriate technique for determining the topic of the resource. For example, the resource topic identifier 204 may identify which terms (e.g., words, common names, etc.) occur more frequently within the resource and consider those terms as being representative of topics and/or topic tags for the content within the resource.
- terms e.g., words, common names, etc.
- a resource 104 can have more than one image, e.g., 106 a and 106 b , presented within the resource 104 .
- the image topic identifier 202 processes the image to determine a set of image topics that describe topics to which content depicted in the image belongs ( 254 ).
- images 106 may have topic tags that are associated with each of the images 106 .
- the topic tags which are generally metadata tags, are descriptive of the image's content and categories to which the image belongs. For example, an image of the Empire State Building may have the following topic tags: Empire State Building, New York, sky scraper, tall building, Manhattan, etc. These tags may be used to determine the topics for the image.
- determining a set of image topics that describe topics to which content depicted in the image belongs can be done by submitting the image to an image annotation system and receiving for the image a set of annotations as the image topics.
- the image annotation system determines the labels based on computer image processing of the image that determines content depicted in the image, and the labels are descriptive of the determined content.
- An image content annotation system may use machine learned models to classify images into categories. After analyzing an image, the image annotation systems assigns metadata tags to the image.
- the topic match scorer 206 determines one or more topic match scores ( 256 ). Each topic match score is a measure of relevance of one or more of the image topics of the image to one or more of the resource topics of the resource.
- the topic match scorer 206 uses the image and resource topics identified by the image topic identifier 202 and the resource topic identifier 204 to determine the topic match scores.
- a first resource may describe the history, facts, and the current state of the Empire State Building, and contain an image, image A, of the Empire State Building.
- a second resource may also include an image depicting the Empire State Building (image B), but the second resource may describe photo editing techniques, and the image of the Empire State building is used to illustrate the end result of such techniques.
- image A the topic match scores will much higher than image B.
- the topic match scorer 206 may assign image A a nominalized topic match score of 0.99 and image B a nominalized topic match score of 0.10.
- a single topic match score may be generated for each image. For example, assume four topics are determined for the image—IT 1 , IT 2 , IT 3 , and IT 4 , and three topics are determined for the resource—RT 1 , RT 2 , and RT 3 .
- a topic match score for the image I may be generated by a generalized function:
- TM ( I ) f ( IT 1, IT 2, IT 3, IT 4, RT 1, RT 2, RT 3).
- scoring function can be used. For example, binary scoring may be used for matched topics between the image the resource, and the topic match score may be a summation of the positive binary matches.
- scoring based on topic similarity can be used, e.g., the topics of “baseball” for an image and “baseball” for a resource may result in a very high similarity score, while the topics of “baseball” for an image and “softball” for a resource may result in a moderate similarity score. Conversely, the topics of “baseball” for an image and “physics” for a resource may result in a very low similarity score.
- a topic match score may be generated for each image topic, e.g., a separate topic match score for each topic IT 1 , IT 2 , IT 3 and IT 4 .
- a topic match score for the image may be generated for each resource topic, e.g., a separate topic match score for each topic RT 1 , RT 2 and RT 3 .
- scoring algorithms can be used to determine the topic match scores.
- the topic match score is also determined by taking into account a measure of the prominence of the image within the resource.
- the image/resource topic scorer 112 determines one or more image prominence scores that collectively measure a prominence of a display of the image in the resource 104 .
- the prominence of the image considers characteristics of the image (e.g., the image's size, location, pixel count, etc.) within the resource 104 .
- an image 106 a that is a small thumbnail image displayed in the side of the display area of the resource will be given a lower prominence score than an image 106 b that is larger and located near the center of the resource.
- thumbnail images are not representative of the topic of the resource 104
- an image that is located at the center of a resource is generally representative of topic of the resource 104 .
- the one or more topic match scores determined for an image are based on measures of relevance of the image topics to the resource topics and the one or more image prominence scores.
- a topic match score can incorporate the prominence score by adjusting the measures of relevance of the image topics to the resource topics by the one or more prominence scores.
- a topic match score for the image I with a prominence score P(I) may be generated by a generalized function:
- TM ( I ) f ( IT 1, IT 2, IT 3, IT 4, RT 1, RT 2, RT 3, P ( I )).
- Some resources may have different images served for each loading of the resource.
- an image located at the center of the resource may depict a first animal (e.g., a panda bear).
- the text that is presented the image located at the center of the resource may depict a second animal (e.g., a hedgehog).
- the prominence of an image is determined to be very low, even if the image is otherwise prominently displayed (e.g., within the middle of a web page).
- the system when determining the one or more topic match scores, may load a resource multiple times to ensure that the same images load. Any location with images that differ for each reload may be determined to host dynamic images, and the relevance of any image in that location may be ignored or discounted by the system.
- the one or more topic match scores, resource topics for the resource associated with the one or more topic match scores, and image topics for the image associated with the one or more top match scores are stored in the image topic match score index 120 ( 258 ).
- the image topic match score index is a repository for previously determined topic match scores, image topics, and resource topics.
- the search system 116 retrieves topic match scores from the image topic match score index 120 when determining which image search results to present at a user device responsive to a search query. Further details regarding presenting image search results will be described in connections with FIGS. 3A and 3B .
- FIG. 3A is a block diagram illustrating components 300 for ranking image search results based on image topic match scores
- FIG. 3B is a flow chart of an example process for ranking image search results by the system in FIG. 3A .
- FIG. 3B will be discussed in connection with FIG. 3A .
- the search system includes an image scorer 304 , an image/resource topic scorer 112 , a search scorer 308 , and a ranker 310 , the operations of which are described below.
- the search system 116 receives an image seeking query ( 352 ).
- the system 116 may receive a search query from a user device.
- the search system 116 determines a relevance score that measures a relevance of the image-seeking query to the image topics of the image ( 354 ). For example, the image scorer 304 uses metadata describing the topics determined for the image to determine how relevant the images are to the image search query 110 .
- the relevance score may be determined not based on the topics identified for the image but on computer vision processes that determines semantic meanings from the image and then evaluates the relevance of the query to the semantic meanings. Other appropriate ways of determining a relevance score that measures a relevance of an image to a query may also be used.
- the search system 116 determines, from the relevance score determined for the query and the one or more topic match scores for the image stored in the index, a search score ( 356 ).
- the search score may be based on a scoring function that takes into account the topic match scores determined as described with reference to FIGS. 2A and 2B above.
- image scorer 304 determines a relevance score of 0.95 for Image A and a relevance score of 0.97 for Image B. Based only on these scores, Image B would be ranked higher than Image A. However, the assume the image/resource topic scorer 112 determined a topic match score of 0.92 for image A and a topic match score of 0.10 for image B. Recall that the topic match scores determined by the scorer 112 measures the relevance of one or more of the image topics of the image to one or more of the resource topics of the resource.
- the search scorer 308 may determine the search score for image A to be 0.91 and the search score for image B to be 0.20.
- Image B depicts content that appears to be slightly more relevant to the image seeking query
- Image B ultimately receives a lower search score than Image A because Image A is display on a page that is more topically related to the content depicted image, while Image B is displayed on a page that is less topically related to the content depicted in the image.
- the search system 116 ranks the images according the respective search scores for the images ( 358 ). Following the example, the search system 116 would rank image A as 1 and image B as 2.
- the search system 116 provides, to a user device from which the image search query 110 was received, a set of image search results that identify a subset of the images, which are selected according to the ranking of the search system 116 ( 360 ). Ranking and presenting the images based on the search scores provides a more accurate way to fulfill the user's informational need by providing images that belong to resources with the same or similar topicality as the topics of the content in the picture.

- This specification relates to presentation of image search results responsive to a search query.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, webpages, image files, audio files, and videos. These resources include content for particular subjects, book articles, or news articles. A search system can select one or more resources in response to receiving a search query. A search query is data that a user submits to a search engine to find information to satisfy the user's informational needs. The search queries are usually in the form of text, e.g., one or more query terms, but other types of search queries can also be processed. The search system selects and scores content, such as images and resources, based on their relevance to the search query and on their importance relative to other resources, and provides search results that link to the selected content. The search results are typically ranked according to the scores and presented according to the ranking.
- In the case of image searching, an image may be scored based on one or more of the relevance of tags, e.g., captions associated with the image, to the query terms, the selection rate of the image, and other factors. An images, however, may not always depict content that closely corresponds to the underlying content of the resource in which the image is displayed. For example, an image of an artist performing with an iconic landmark in the background may be displayed in a web page that includes an article reporting on the performance. The underlying web page and the article, however, may provide no information about the famous landmark in the background. Regardless, many image processing systems will recognize the landmark in the background and tag the image as being relevant to the landmark. Furthermore, if the artist is relatively famous, the image and the resource may receive a relative high amount of traffic. Accordingly, should a user that is seeking information about the famous landmark enter a query describing the famous landmark, the user may be presented with the image as one of many search results. However, the underlying resource, which reports on the artist's performance, will likely not satisfy the user's informational needs regarding the famous landmark.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of, for each resource in a plurality of resources, wherein each resource includes one or more images and text that is separate from each of the one or more images: determining, by a data processing apparatus, and from the text of the resource, resource topics described by the text of the resource. For each of the one the one or more images, processing, by the data processing apparatus, the image to determine a set of image topics that describe topics to which content depicted in the image belongs. Determining, by the data process apparatus, one or topic match scores, wherein each topic match score is a measure of relevance one or more of the image topics of the image to one or more of the resource topics of the resource. Storing in an index, by the data processing apparatus and for the image, data that describes the image topics for the image, resource topics for the resource, and the one or more topic match scores for the image. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. The present systems and methods provide image search results based on topical similarity between the image and the resource that includes the image. The topicality similarity is used as a ranking signal to rank images responsive to a search query. By considering the topicality similarity, the system provides image search results that link to images that are very likely to be topically relevant to the text of the resources on which the images are hosted. This better serves users whose informational needs are only partially satisfied by an image, and who may benefit from additional contextual information included in the resource. This results in fewer query revisions and searches, which, in turn, improves the overall system performance of a system that performs image searching operations.
- In some implementations, the present systems and methods also take into account the image's characteristics (e.g., size, location, type, etc.) when determining the topic match score for each image presented in an image search result. Taking into account the image's characteristics when determining the topic match score further refines the accuracy of the relevance of the image to the search query.

- Overview
- Image search results are presented to a user, typically in response to a search query, in an attempt to satisfy the informational need of the user. Image search results are generated by ranking images based on a relevance of the content depicted in the image to the search query, a relevance of the content in the image to the topicality of content within the resource that the image belongs, and, optionally, the prominence of the image within the resource. The relevance of the content in the image to the topicality of content within the resource that the image belongs and the prominence of the image within the resource are measures that may be stored in an index prior to query time.
- To build this index, a search system selects resources, such as web pages, that include images. For each resource, the system determines resource topics described by the text of the resource. For each image in the resource, the system determines a set of image topics that describe topics to which content depicted in the image belongs. The resource topics and the image topics are compared to each other to determine a topic match score indicative of how similar the image content topics are to the resource topics.
- The system can also determine a prominence score for each image and use this prominence score to adjust the topic match scores. The prominence score describes how prominent the image is within the resource that it is presented in. For example, an image with a higher prominence score may be a larger image centrally displayed within the resource. Conversely, an image with a lower prominence score may be a thumbnail image located at the bottom or side of the resource. Each image's topic match score can be modified by incorporating the image's prominence score.
- In response to an image seeking query, the system can access previously determined resource topics, image topics, and topic match scores for particular candidate images by accessing information stored the index. The system can then determine, for each of the images, a search score based on these values. The search score is a measures of relevance of the image to the image seeking query.
- These features and additional features of providing image search results based on topical relevance of an image and are described in more detail below. Additionally, while the description that follows uses images as an illustrative example, the systems and methods described below may also be used for other types of content, such as videos, audio, and any other non-textual content for which the topicality of the content can be determined and evaluated against the topicality of the content of the underlying resource in which the content is presented.
- Example Environment
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 in which image search results are processed. Theexample environment 100 includes a network 102 (e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination of them), that connectsweb pages 104,user devices 108, and thesearch system 116. Theenvironment 100 may include many thousands ofweb pages 104 anduser devices 108. - A
web page 104 is one or more resources associated with a domain name, and each web page is hosted by one or more servers. An example web page is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, graphic images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachweb page 104 is maintained by a publisher, e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web page. - A
web page 104 can include one ormore images 106 that is presented with the resource. Eachweb page 104 andimage 106 is associated with a resource address, such as a URL.Web pages 104 include text and may also include links to other types of resources that are rendered and displayed with the text of the webpage resource. In particular,images 106 are often rendered withweb pages 104. Animage 106 is represented by image data that is used to render an image of a subject. While image data is typically included in web page data, they can also be hosted as separately addressable resources. - To facilitate searching of
web pages 104, thesearch system 116 identifies the resources by crawling thepublisher web pages 104 and indexing the resources provided by thepublisher web pages 104. In some implementations, the indexes are stored in animage resource index 114 and aweb page index 118. Theindexes - For a search of textual content, the
web page index 118 is searched, and resources are ranked based on information retrieval (“IR”) scores that measure the relevance of the resource to the query, and optionally an authority score of each resource relative to other resources. The ranking of the search results is based on relevance scores that are a combination (e.g., sums, products, or other mathematical combinations) of the IR scores and the authority scores. The search results 122 are ordered according to these relevance scores and provided to the user device according to the order. - For a search directed to images, the
search system 116 accesses theimage resource index 114. In some implementations, thesearch system 116 determines a search score for an image that measures the relevance of an image to an image seeking query. - Often a search will return search results for both images and resources. When this occurs, the image search results are typically provided in a group in-line with the resource search results. Additional details describing image searching will discussed in connection with
FIGS. 2A-3B . - The
user devices 108 receive the search results 122, e.g., in the form of a listing of the results in a webpage, and render the pages for presentation to users. The search results are data generated by thesearch system 116 that identifies resources that are responsive to a particular search query. Each search result includes a link to a corresponding resource, e.g., a link to a webpage for a general search result, or link to an image for an image search result. An example general search result includes a webpage title, a snippet of text, and a URL of the webpage. An example image search result includes a thumbnail of an image, a URL of the webpage in which the image is referenced, and, optionally, labeled data describing the subject of the image. - To score the images in response to a search query, the
search system 116 accesses topic match scores in an image topicmatch score index 120. The image topic match scores define, for each image in each resource, a measure of relevance of one or more of image topics of the image to one or more of resource topics of the resource. These topic match scores are used, in part, to generate search scores for an image in response to an image seeking query. - Generation of the image topic match scores is described with reference to
FIGS. 2A and 2B below. Search processing that uses the image topic match scores is described with reference toFIGS. 3A and 3B below. - Image Topic Match Score Generation
-
FIG. 2A is a block diagram illustrating components that score topics and topic relevance for an image. The components may be implemented in a data processing apparatus of one or more computers. - An image/
resource topic scorer 112processes resources 104 that each include one or more images. Each resource also includes other information, such as text, that is separate from each of the one or more images. For each resource, thescorer 112 determines a topic match score(s) for each image in the resource. In particular, the topic match score for an image is based on the relevance of topics to which content depicted in the image belongs to the resource topics described by the text of the resource. Thus, the higher the relevance of the topics of the content in the image to the topics of content of the resource, the higher the topic match score. - In the example implementation of
FIG. 2A , the image/resource topic scorer 112 includes animage topic identifier 202, aresource topic identifier 204, and atopic match scorer 206, the operations of which are described with reference toFIG. 2B , which is a flowchart of an example process 250 for determining topic match scores by the system inFIG. 2A . The process 250 is performed for eachresource 104 that includes one or more images. - The
resource topic identifier 204 determines, from the text of the resource, resource topics described by the text of the resource (252). In some implementations, the resource topic identifier determines the topics of the using one or more of semantic analysis of the text body of the resource, analyzing anchor text in the resource and the title of the resource, and/or any other appropriate technique for determining the topic of the resource. For example, theresource topic identifier 204 may identify which terms (e.g., words, common names, etc.) occur more frequently within the resource and consider those terms as being representative of topics and/or topic tags for the content within the resource. - As illustrated in
FIG. 2A , aresource 104 can have more than one image, e.g., 106 a and 106 b, presented within theresource 104. For each image within aresource 104, theimage topic identifier 202 processes the image to determine a set of image topics that describe topics to which content depicted in the image belongs (254). In some implementations,images 106 may have topic tags that are associated with each of theimages 106. The topic tags, which are generally metadata tags, are descriptive of the image's content and categories to which the image belongs. For example, an image of the Empire State Building may have the following topic tags: Empire State Building, New York, sky scraper, tall building, Manhattan, etc. These tags may be used to determine the topics for the image. - In some implementations, determining a set of image topics that describe topics to which content depicted in the image belongs can be done by submitting the image to an image annotation system and receiving for the image a set of annotations as the image topics. The image annotation system, in some implementations, determines the labels based on computer image processing of the image that determines content depicted in the image, and the labels are descriptive of the determined content. An image content annotation system, for example, may use machine learned models to classify images into categories. After analyzing an image, the image annotation systems assigns metadata tags to the image.
- Other ways of determining topics to which content depicted in the image belongs can also be used.
- The
topic match scorer 206, for each image within a resource, determines one or more topic match scores (256). Each topic match score is a measure of relevance of one or more of the image topics of the image to one or more of the resource topics of the resource. Thetopic match scorer 206 uses the image and resource topics identified by theimage topic identifier 202 and theresource topic identifier 204 to determine the topic match scores. For example, a first resource may describe the history, facts, and the current state of the Empire State Building, and contain an image, image A, of the Empire State Building. A second resource may also include an image depicting the Empire State Building (image B), but the second resource may describe photo editing techniques, and the image of the Empire State building is used to illustrate the end result of such techniques. For image A, the topic match scores will much higher than image B. As an example, thetopic match scorer 206 may assign image A a nominalized topic match score of 0.99 and image B a nominalized topic match score of 0.10. - In some implementations, a single topic match score may be generated for each image. For example, assume four topics are determined for the image—IT1, IT2, IT3, and IT4, and three topics are determined for the resource—RT1, RT2, and RT3. A topic match score for the image I may be generated by a generalized function:
-
TM(I)=f(IT1,IT2,IT3,IT4,RT1,RT2,RT3). - Any appropriate scoring function can be used. For example, binary scoring may be used for matched topics between the image the resource, and the topic match score may be a summation of the positive binary matches. Alternatively, scoring based on topic similarity can be used, e.g., the topics of “baseball” for an image and “baseball” for a resource may result in a very high similarity score, while the topics of “baseball” for an image and “softball” for a resource may result in a moderate similarity score. Conversely, the topics of “baseball” for an image and “physics” for a resource may result in a very low similarity score.
- In other implementations, a topic match score may be generated for each image topic, e.g., a separate topic match score for each topic IT1, IT2, IT3 and IT4. In still other implementations, a topic match score for the image may be generated for each resource topic, e.g., a separate topic match score for each topic RT1, RT2 and RT3. Again, a variety of scoring algorithms can be used to determine the topic match scores.
- In some implementations, the topic match score is also determined by taking into account a measure of the prominence of the image within the resource. The image/
resource topic scorer 112 determines one or more image prominence scores that collectively measure a prominence of a display of the image in theresource 104. The prominence of the image considers characteristics of the image (e.g., the image's size, location, pixel count, etc.) within theresource 104. - For example, an
image 106 a that is a small thumbnail image displayed in the side of the display area of the resource will be given a lower prominence score than animage 106 b that is larger and located near the center of the resource. Often times, thumbnail images are not representative of the topic of theresource 104, while an image that is located at the center of a resource is generally representative of topic of theresource 104. - In some implementations, the one or more topic match scores determined for an image are based on measures of relevance of the image topics to the resource topics and the one or more image prominence scores. A topic match score can incorporate the prominence score by adjusting the measures of relevance of the image topics to the resource topics by the one or more prominence scores. For example, a topic match score for the image I with a prominence score P(I) may be generated by a generalized function:
-
TM(I)=f(IT1,IT2,IT3,IT4,RT1,RT2,RT3,P(I)). - Some resources may have different images served for each loading of the resource. For example, the first time a resource is presented at a user device, an image located at the center of the resource may depict a first animal (e.g., a panda bear). When the resource is reloaded, the text that is presented, the image located at the center of the resource may depict a second animal (e.g., a hedgehog). When this occurs, the prominence of an image is determined to be very low, even if the image is otherwise prominently displayed (e.g., within the middle of a web page). Alternatively, the system, when determining the one or more topic match scores, may load a resource multiple times to ensure that the same images load. Any location with images that differ for each reload may be determined to host dynamic images, and the relevance of any image in that location may be ignored or discounted by the system.
- The one or more topic match scores, resource topics for the resource associated with the one or more topic match scores, and image topics for the image associated with the one or more top match scores are stored in the image topic match score index 120 (258). As previously described, the image topic match score index is a repository for previously determined topic match scores, image topics, and resource topics. In some implementations, the
search system 116 retrieves topic match scores from the image topicmatch score index 120 when determining which image search results to present at a user device responsive to a search query. Further details regarding presenting image search results will be described in connections withFIGS. 3A and 3B . - Search Processing
- Images that are presented in an image search result page responsive to an image search query are ranked based on the image's topic match score.
FIG. 3A is a blockdiagram illustrating components 300 for ranking image search results based on image topic match scores andFIG. 3B is a flow chart of an example process for ranking image search results by the system inFIG. 3A .FIG. 3B will be discussed in connection withFIG. 3A . In some implementations, the search system includes animage scorer 304, an image/resource topic scorer 112, asearch scorer 308, and aranker 310, the operations of which are described below. - The
search system 116 receives an image seeking query (352). For example, thesystem 116 may receive a search query from a user device. - The
search system 116, for each image, determines a relevance score that measures a relevance of the image-seeking query to the image topics of the image (354). For example, theimage scorer 304 uses metadata describing the topics determined for the image to determine how relevant the images are to theimage search query 110. - In other implementations, the relevance score may be determined not based on the topics identified for the image but on computer vision processes that determines semantic meanings from the image and then evaluates the relevance of the query to the semantic meanings. Other appropriate ways of determining a relevance score that measures a relevance of an image to a query may also be used.
- The
search system 116, for each image, determines, from the relevance score determined for the query and the one or more topic match scores for the image stored in the index, a search score (356). The search score may be based on a scoring function that takes into account the topic match scores determined as described with reference toFIGS. 2A and 2B above. - Following the previous examples for images A and B, where image A is an image of the Empire State Building presented in a resource that describes the history, facts, and the current state of the Empire State Building, and image B is an image of the Empire State Building within a resource about photo editing, assume the
image scorer 304 determines a relevance score of 0.95 for Image A and a relevance score of 0.97 for Image B. Based only on these scores, Image B would be ranked higher than Image A. However, the assume the image/resource topic scorer 112 determined a topic match score of 0.92 for image A and a topic match score of 0.10 for image B. Recall that the topic match scores determined by thescorer 112 measures the relevance of one or more of the image topics of the image to one or more of the resource topics of the resource. Using the relevance scores determined by the search system and the topic match scores determined by thescorer 112, thesearch scorer 308, based on a scoring function that takes the relevance scores and topic match scores as inputs, may determine the search score for image A to be 0.91 and the search score for image B to be 0.20. Thus, even though Image B depicts content that appears to be slightly more relevant to the image seeking query, Image B ultimately receives a lower search score than Image A because Image A is display on a page that is more topically related to the content depicted image, while Image B is displayed on a page that is less topically related to the content depicted in the image. - The
search system 116 ranks the images according the respective search scores for the images (358). Following the example, thesearch system 116 would rank image A as 1 and image B as 2. Thesearch system 116 provides, to a user device from which theimage search query 110 was received, a set of image search results that identify a subset of the images, which are selected according to the ranking of the search system 116 (360). Ranking and presenting the images based on the search scores provides a more accurate way to fulfill the user's informational need by providing images that belong to resources with the same or similar topicality as the topics of the content in the picture. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
