Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to portable electronic devices and more particularly to a method and apparatus for charging a battery of a portable electronic device.
- Rechargeable batteries are currently the primary power source for cell phones and various other portable electronic devices.
- the energy stored in the batteries is limited. It is determined by the energy density (Wh/L) of the storage material, its chemistry, and the volume of the battery. For example, for a typical Li ion cell phone battery with a 250 Wh/L energy density, a 10 cc battery would store 2.5 Wh of energy. Depending upon the usage, the energy could last for a few hours to a few days. Recharging often requires access to an electrical outlet. The limited amount of stored energy and the frequent recharging are major inconveniences associated with batteries. Accordingly, there is a need for a longer lasting, easily recharging solution for cell phone power sources.
- One approach to fulfill this need is to have a hybrid power source with a rechargeable battery and a method to trickle charge the battery.
- Important considerations for an energy conversion device to recharge the battery include power density, size, and the efficiency of energy conversion.
- Energy harvesting methods such as solar cells, thermoelectric generators using a temperature gradient, and mechanical/kinetic generators using mechanical motion are very attractive power sources to trickle charge a battery.
- the energy generated by these methods is often small, usually only a few milliwatts to approximately a few hundred milliwatts depending on size, efficiency, nature of the energy source, etc. In the regime of interest, namely, a few hundred milliwatts to a few watts, this dictates that a sizeable volume or area is required to generate sufficient power for trickle charge.
- Such methods include coupling the battery to a solar panel (photovoltaic cell). See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,898,932 issued on 27 Apr. 1999.

- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of one possible portable communication device of FIG. 1 ;
- FIG. 4 is a partial cross section view of one exemplary embodiment

- FIG. 7 is a partial cross sectional view of yet another exemplary embodiment.
- Photovoltaic cells are well known for providing electricity from solar panels in both small scale distributed power systems and centralized megawatt scale power plants. Photovoltaic cells also have found applications in consumer electronics, e.g., portable electronic equipment such as calculators and watches. The cells operate without toxic or noise emissions, and require little maintenance. These cells may also be used as sensors for detection of a wide band of radiation.
- PV photovoltaic
- PV to trickle-charge the handset battery
- the first is the mechanical robustness. Most of the PV cells such as those made of single crystal semiconductors or thin films can break or scratch quite easily when exposed.
- the second is the handset appearance. Electrodes on PV cells, when placed at the handset exterior, make the overall appearance less attractive.
- the third issue is the PV cell performance on/in a handset. All three of these issues are resolved by the embodiments described herein.
- PV cells are placed inside a handset and mechanically reinforced.
- An over-layer embedded with fluorescent species as a fluorescent converter efficiently collects and down converts a broad spectrum of white (ambient) light into light with a much narrower spectrum distribution which is determined by the optical properties of the fluorescent species.
- the combined transparent shell/fluorescent layer obscure the PV cell so that its presence won't affect the overall handset appearance.
- Fluorescent species with quantum efficiency as least 80% or higher are preferred so that their presence will not substantially reduce the light intensity.
- Quantum dots (QDs) with quantum efficiency greater than one (multi-exciton behavior) so that one UV or near UV photon can be converted into multiple IR photons improves the PV cell performance when placed on phone shell or PV cells.
- the energy of the photons emitted from the fluorescent species must be at least equal to the energy gap of the PV material so that electron-hole pairs can be created in the PV cell upon irradiation.
- fluorescent species can be imbedded in phone shell and form a single layer fluorescent phone housing.
- Fluorescent species are imbedded in a transparent matrix placed outside the handset shell.
- the fluorescent species have strong quantum efficiencies and emit light preferably in visible or near the IR regime ( ⁇ 400-1000 nm).
- Example of fluorescent species are QDs, dye molecules, or other materials that exhibit a strong photo-fluorescent behavior with quantum efficiency of 80% or higher.
- the fluorescent species can emit single or multiple wavelengths.
- the matrix layer can be organic, inorganic, or a mixture of the two, and they are transparent in UV, visible regime and near IR regime. This layer can be applied on to the handset housing via coating, deposition, painting, etc. It can be in single-layer or multi-layers formation in either solid and/or porous form with appropriate pore size(s). This film can also have built-in desired periodic structures which act as a photonic material that enhances the reflection of the fluorescent light.
- the matrix layer preferably has a refractive index matched with the handset shell to maximize light transmission.
- the fluorescent species can be imbedded into the matrix layer by pre-mixing with the solution based matrix material prior to being applied to the handset housing, or imbedded into the matrix layer placed on handset housing using various solution or gas phase based impregnation processes.
- the fluorescent species can also be incorporated into the matrix layer via layering processes.
- the surface of the matrix layer is preferred to be covered with a coating layer that serves as a barrier layer which prevents oxidation/degradation of the fluorescent species.
- This layer has the correct refractive index and thickness so that it also helps to enhance the internal reflection of the lights emitted from the fluorescent species. Additionally, it is preferred that this layer has a greater mechanical hardness so that it also serves as an anti-scratch protecting layer. Part of this layer can further have periodic structures which serve as a photonic crystal for efficient reflection of the fluorescent light.
- the PV cells are placed at the opposite side of the handset shell (inside the phone) and are well exposed to the fluorescent light and the residual light not being absorbed by the fluorescent layer. In this configuration the presence of fluorescent species and the matrix layer largely obscures the PV cells, down converts the light to a narrower spectrum, and improves the PV performance. Additionally, having the PV cells placed inside the phone allows one to utilize various packaging methods to mechanically reinforce the PV cells without affecting the handset appearance.
- the PV cells can be in the form of single crystal or thin film.
- the handset shell is a transparent material and has an optional layer with matched refractive index disposed between the handset shell and PV cells so that the fluorescent lights can be transmitted to the PV cells without losing intensity.
- fluorescent species can be imbedded in the handset shell and form a single layer fluorescent housing.
- the light emitting species preferred in this embodiment are fluorescent dye molecules or free standing quantum dots (FSQDs) which are sometimes called semiconductor nanocrystallites, whose radii are smaller than the bulk exciton Bohr radius and constitute a class of materials intermediate between molecular and bulk forms of matter.
- FSQDs are known for the unique properties that they possess as a result of both their small size and their high surface area. Furthermore, the absorption and emission properties vary with the particle size and can be systematically tailored. It has been found that a Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) quantum dot, for example, can emit light in any monochromatic, visible color, where the particular color characteristic of that dot is dependent on the size of the quantum dot.
- CdSe Cadmium Selenide
- Fluorescent dye molecules or FSQDs are easily incorporated into or on other materials such as polymers and polymer composites because they can be made to be soluble in a variety of media and have little degradation over time. These properties allow them to reach almost 100% fluorescent quantum yield.
- Fluorescent dye molecules may comprise, for example, rhodamine B, rhodamine 6G, Coumarin 540.
- fluorescent dye molecules and quantum dots instead of fluorescent dye molecules and quantum dots, other inorganic fluorescent materials such as rare-earth doped fluorescent glasses, Cr doped sapphire, and Mg or Cu doped II-VI semiconductors can also be used for this purpose.
- fluorescent dye molecules and quantum dots other inorganic fluorescent materials such as rare-earth doped fluorescent glasses, Cr doped sapphire, and Mg or Cu doped II-VI semiconductors can also be used for this purpose.
- FSQD are semiconductors composed of periodic groups of II-VI, III-V, IV, or IV-VI materials, for example, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, GaAs, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, InAs, InP, InSb, AlAs, AlP, AlSb.
- Alternative FSQDs materials that may be used include but are not limited to tertiary microcrystals such as InGaP, which emits in the yellow to red wavelengths (depending on the size) and ZnSeTe, ZnCdS, ZnCdSe, and CdSeS which emits from blue to green wavelengths.
- Multi-core structures are also possible such as ZnSe/ZnXS/ZnS, where X represents Ag, Sr, Te, Cu, or Mn.
- the inner most core is made of ZnSe, followed by the second core layer of ZnXS, completed by an external shell made of ZnS.
- FSQDs range in size from 2-10 nanometers in diameter (approximately 10 2 -10 7 total number of atoms). At these scales, FSQDs have size-tunable band gaps, in other words there spectral emission depends upon size. Whereas, at the bulk scale, emission depends solely on the composition and defectivity of matter. Other advantages of FSQDs include high photoluminescence quantum efficiencies, good thermal and photo-stability, narrow emission line widths (atom-like spectral emission), and compatibility with solution processing. FSQDs are manufactured conventionally by using colloidal solution chemistry.
- FSQDs may be synthesized with a wider band gap outer shell, comprising for example ZnO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdO, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, MgS, MgSe, GaAs, GaN, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, HgO, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, InAs, InN, InP, InSb, AlAs, AlN, AlP, AlSb.
- the shell surrounds the core FSQDs and results in a significant increase in the quantum yield. Capping the FSQDs with a shell reduces non-radiative recombination and results in brighter emission.
- the surface of FSQDs without a shell has both free electrons in addition to crystal defects. Both of these characteristics tend to reduce quantum yield by allowing for non-radiative electron energy transitions at the surface.
- the addition of a shell reduces the opportunities for these non-radiative transitions by giving conduction band electrons an increased probability of directly relaxing to the valence band.
- the shell also neutralizes the effects of many types of surface defects.
- the FSQDs are more thermally stable than organic phosphors since UV light will not chemically breakdown FSQDs.
- the exterior shell can also serve as an anchor point for chemical bonds that can be used to modify and functionalize the surface.
- the FSQDs Due to their small size, typically on the order of 10 nanometers or smaller, the FSQDs have larger band gaps relative to a bulk material. It is noted that the smaller the FSQDs, the higher the band gap. Therefore, when impacted by a photon (emissive electron-hole pair recombination), the smaller the diameter of the FSQDs, the shorter the wavelength of light will be released. Capping ligands (molecules) on the outer surface of the shell allow the FSQDs to remain in the colloidal suspension while being grown to the desired size.
