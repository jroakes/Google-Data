The digital map includes features representing entities in a geographic area, each feature being displayed at the same magnification level. A geo-located point of interest is determined within a geographic area and a focal point of a map viewport is determined. For each indicator, the size of the indicator is changed according to a distance between the geographic location corresponding to the indicator and the geographic location corresponding to the focal point of the map viewport. The indicator is then displayed on the digital map.

Detailed Description
generally, for example, the geo software running on the computing device is configured to provide an interactive digital map of a geographic area and display indicators of places or events, for example, in response to a geographic query or an implicit request for suggestions.
An example system 10 in which these techniques can be implemented is shown in FIG. 1. the system 10 includes a user device 12, which may be, for example, a portable device such as a smartphone or tablet computer, a non-portable device such as a desktop computer, or a special purpose computing device such as a navigator. the user device 12 may include or more processors 14, such as or several Central Processing Units (CPUs) and/or several Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), a computer-readable memory 20, which may include permanent (e.g., flash drives) and/or non-permanent (e.g., Random Access Memory (RAM)) components, a user interface 22, which may include, for example, a touch screen or a display device along with an input device, a network interface 24 for sending and receiving data via wired and/or wireless communication links, and or more sensors 26, which may include positioning units such as a Global Positioning Service (GPS) module, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, or the like.
The memory 20 may store instructions executable on or the processors 14 that implement an operating system 40 and various software applications, such as a geographic application 42. the geographic application 42 may be a dedicated software application dedicated to generating geographic content, such as interactive digital maps, navigation directions, results of geographic queries, etc. in another implementation, a general browser application runs scripts and/or Application Programming Interface (API) functions for generating geographic content. although the functionality to provide interactive digital maps and indicators with variable visual attributes may be provided in the form of an API, library, plug-in, or another software component called by another software application, in this disclosure the software module 42 is referred to as a geographic application. as discussed below, the geographic application 42 may operate on map data stored locally in the memory 20, or receive geographic content from an online geographic service.
With continued reference to FIG. 1, the communication network 50 may be the Internet or any other suitable network including wired and/or wireless communication links, the user device 12 may generally communicate with any number of servers to receive various geographic content, such as map data, navigation directions, responses to geographic queries, etc. for simplicity, FIG. 1 shows only map data/geographic data servers 60 coupled to a map database 62, the map database 62 may store map data describing various natural geographic features (e.g., rivers, mountains, forests), as well as artificial geographic features (e.g., roads, buildings, parks), etc. the map data may include descriptions of map features, such as vector graphic formats, as a collection of interconnected vertices and/or bitmap images.
The system 10 may generally include or several servers 60 in any suitable configuration, including a multi-tier configuration (multi-tipped configuration) in which a front-end server processes user requests and a back-end server is configured to run batch jobs such as generating map tiles (map tiles). similar to the user devices 12, or several servers 60 may include processing hardware such as CPUs, GPUs, etc., and non-transitory computer readable memory storing instructions executable by the processing hardware.
In operation, the geographic application 42 may receive user input and retrieve map data from the server 60 to generate an interactive digital map based on the user input the geographic application 42 may also receive POI data from the server 60 for various points of interest (POIs) that may correspond to a place in or an event occurring in a geographic area represented by the digital map, in some cases at the geographic application 42 may retrieve the map data and/or POI data from a local cache in the memory 20.
In an example scenario, a user located near a modern museum of san francisco, california launches a geographic application on user device 12. the user positions a map viewport on the san francisco city, and geographic application 42 sends to server 60 the coordinates of the map viewport and an indication of the current zoom level (i.e., a zoom level (level of visualization)) of the digital map in the map viewport. in response, server 60 provides to user device 12 map data for generating a digital map of san francisco. then, the user types in the geographic query "second hand shop" and submits to geographic application 42 the geographic query "second hand shop" geographic application 42 forwards the query to server 60 with an indication of the current location and zoom level. server 60 obtains a plurality of search results using a location database 64 and sends these results to user device 12. each geographic search result includes the name of the shop, the address of the shop, the business hours, a brief description, and a rating of the geographic map, if the visual search results include a higher visual search result, a visual map zoom factor, a visual factor indicating that the visual search result is relatively low (with a visual factor of a visual search result), and a visual factor indicating that the visual search result is more difficult to be displayed if the user selects a visual factor, and the user selects a visual factor that the visual factor of a visual search result is less likely to be associated with a visual factor that the same visual factor that is less visual factor, and that the user selected, a visual factor that the user selected, and that the user selected visual factor that is less likely to be more likely to be less likely to be a visual factor, and that the same visual factor that the user is less likely to be more likely to be less likely to be more likely to.
Referring to FIG. 2, in another example scenario, the geographic application 42 displays a digital map 100 in a map viewport centered at a point 102. the digital map 100 may generally include a plurality of map features representing various natural entities (e.g., hills, mountains, forests, rivers, lakes) and artificial entities (e.g., roads, buildings, parks, bridges) located in a corresponding geographic area, or simply "features". the indicator management module 44 selects the point 102 as a focal point and selects visual attributes of the indicator 110 and 114 based at least in part on the distance to the point 102.
The indicator 110 corresponds to a geographic location that is close to a location corresponding to the point 102. thus, the indicator management module 44 generates the indicator 100 as a relatively larger point including a graphical symbol (knife and fork) representing the type of POI and a text label specifying the name of the restaurant. the indicator 112 corresponds to a geographic location that is farther (less popular) from the location corresponding to the point 102 than the location represented by the indicator 110. in this case, the indicator management module 44 produces a smaller point that includes a smaller graphical symbol and does not produce a label for the indicator 112. furthermore, the indicator 114 corresponds to a geographic location that is farther from the location corresponding to the point 102 than the location represented by the indicator 112 and is farther than the location represented by the indicator 110. the indicator management module 44 generates a smaller point that does not contain either a graphical symbol or a text label.
In the example of FIG. 2, the visual attributes that the indicator management module 44 selects by distance to the focus include size, presence of graphical icons, and amount of text more generally, the indicator management module 44 may select or more of any suitable number of visual attributes.
As the user repositions the viewport, indicator management module 44 can automatically adjust the visual attributes of some or all of the indicators as the distance to the focal point changes, thus, indicator management module 44 can effectively animate (animate) the content in the map viewport so that the indicators appear to increase and decrease in size as the map viewport moves relative to the underlying digital map.
In the scenario schematically illustrated in fig. 3A and 3B, the map viewport 152 is moved relative to the digital map 150 in the direction indicated by arrow 154. To avoid clutter, the digital map 150 is shown in fig. 3A and 3B without any map features. Movement of the map viewport 152 can be due to the user applying a gesture, such as a "swipe," to the map viewport 152 via the touchscreen displaying the digital map 150, submitting a typed command or voice command (such as "pan east"), moving in the direction indicated by arrow 154 while the geographic application 42 automatically advances (advacing) the map viewport 152 in accordance with the user's movement, and so forth. The zoom level of the digital map 150 remains the same as the map viewport 152 moves. Similar to the scenario discussed above, the focal point in this example is the geometric center of the map viewport 152.
The indicator management module 44 generates the indicators 160 and 164 independently of the presentation of the digital map 150 and adjusts their visual attributes according to the distance of the indicators 160 and 164 from the focal point. Thus, when the viewport 152 is positioned as shown in fig. 3A, the indicator management module 44 generates larger and more detailed indicators 160 for POIs that are closer to the focal point, generates smaller indicators 162A and 162B for POIs that are located further from the focal point than the POI represented by the indicator 160, and generates smaller indicators 164A-D for POIs that are located further from the focal point than the POI represented by the indicator 164. When the viewport 152 is repositioned as shown in FIG. 3B, the indicator management module 44 changes the visual properties of the indicators 160 and 162B so that the resulting indicators 160 'and 162B' appear similar to the indicator 164A, and changes the indicators 164B and 164C so that the resulting indicators 164B 'and 164C' are larger and more detailed, similar to the indicators corresponding to the indicators 162B and 160, respectively, of FIG. 3A.
In embodiments, the geographic application 42 maintains separate layers for the map data and the indicators of the POIs, and the indicator management module 44 dynamically changes the layers of the indicators, without changing the layers of the digital map FIG. 4, for example, shows how the geographic application 42 constructs the digital map of FIG. 2 by layering (layering) the indicator tiles 202 on the map tile 200. As shown in FIG. 4, the indicators are placed on the layers 202 and the indicator management module 44 changes their visual attributes by the distance of the indicators to the focal point FIG. 4 depicts contours (similar to a topographical map) to show the virtual height of the indicators relative to the "floor" of the indicator tile 202 for further clarity.
In embodiments and/or scenarios, the geographic application 42 may only dynamically change the visual attributes of certain categories of indicators, and not the visual attributes of other indicators, for example, when generating suggestions of geographic areas, the geographic application 42 may identify POIs corresponding to restaurants, and POIs corresponding to stores, museums, music venues, and so forth based on signals such as time of day (time of day) and user preferences , for example, the indicator management module 44 may decide to change the visual attributes of indicators representing restaurants while presenting the same or similar indicators for POIs belonging to other categories, thus, in the exemplary embodiment, the indicator management module 44 may dynamically change the size and/or detailed rating of indicators representing lunch spots between 11:30 am and 1:00 pm without dynamically changing the visual attributes of other indicators, and may dynamically change the size and/or detailed rating of indicators representing lunch spots between 9:00 pm and 1:00 pm without changing the visual attributes of other indicators, and may dynamically change the visual attributes of indicators representing bars representing lunch bars and/or levels between 6300 pm and 6300 pm without changing the visual attributes of the other indicators, and so forth, with the exemplary embodiment showing that the dynamic indicators of the dynamic map 220, and the exemplary embodiment with the same indicators being depicted in a high line drawing.
Referring now to FIG. 6, an example method 300 for displaying indicators on a digital map may be implemented as a set of instructions stored on a computer-readable medium and executable by or more processors the method 300 may be implemented in the indicator management module 44, in another suitable software module running in a user device, or in a software module running in a web server according to the latter embodiment, a web server, such as the server 60 of FIG. 1, generates map tiles in vector (vector) format or raster (raster) format, applies the presently disclosed techniques for dynamically changing visual properties of indicators, and provides the generated map tiles to the user device 12.
The method 300 begins at block 302, in block 302, a digital map of a geographic area is displayed via a user interface of a user device, wherein a map viewport defines a currently visible portion of the digital map.
In various scenarios, POIs correspond to search results responsive to geographic queries, locations near a navigation route responsive to direction requests, automatically generated suggestions, etc. POIs may represent long-term unchanging locations, such as businesses, stops and bus stops, museums, etc., as well as locations where temporary events occur.
More specifically, the geo-application may initially present the indicator in the manner of a unified , i.e., without changing the visual properties of the indicator, or in an uneven manner, wherein the geometric center of the map viewport defines the initial location of the focal point.
A geographic application running on a mouse-equipped desktop or laptop computer may run in a manner similar to , where the location of the mouse designation (mouse point) defines the focus.
In another embodiment or scenario, the focus point corresponds to a current location of the user device in a geographic area represented by the digital map more generally, the geographic application may use any suitable number of signals to determine the focus point.
In particular, at block 308, the distance between the indicator and the focal point may be measured in any suitable manner, calculate (number) screen pixels, the real-world straight-line distance between the physical objects represented by the indicator, the real-world travel distance (or time) between the physical objects represented by the indicator, etc. Using the determined distances, the visual attributes of the indicator may be selected, at some embodiments, visual attributes may be assigned to indicators belonging to certain distance bands, at the visual attributes may be assigned to indicators located at less than the threshold distance d1A second set of visual attributes may be assigned to a distance d located greater than d1But less than a second threshold distance d2In another embodiment, the geographic application determines each set of visual attributes as a function of the determined distance without limiting the number of sets for any particular number of bands.
Each set of visual attributes may include or more sizes of indicators, color intensity, transparency level, amount of graphical detail (e.g., simple graphical icon, more detailed graphical icon), amount of text (e.g., no text, only name, and address), visibility of additional controls (such as controls requesting navigation directions to a location), etc. at block 310, a set of visual attributes is selected according to the determined distance.
In cases, the geographic application 42 may generate a relatively large indicator (such as indicator 110 of FIG. 2 and 160 of FIG. 3A, respectively) for several nearby locations, as a result, large indicators may conflict (i.e., at least partially overlap). the geographic application 42 may resolve conflicts between indicators by comparing the relative importance, popularity score, and/or other parameters of the POIs represented by the conflicting indicators, and determining which indicator should be obscured (obscure) and another indicator as a function of the comparison.
Similar to the method 300 discussed above, the method 350 may be implemented as a set of instructions stored on a computer-readable medium and executable by or more processors the method 350 may be implemented in the indicator management module 44, another suitable software module running in a user device, or a software module running in a web server.
Method 350 begins at block 352 with displaying a digital map within a current viewport. Indicators of various POIs are displayed in the map viewport in respective distances to a focal point of the map viewport (block 354). At block 356, the viewport is repositioned according to the user command. For example, the user may apply a gesture such as a swipe or flick, type or speak a command, or the like. The geographic application may then change the visual attributes of the indicator. Depending on the implementation, the geographic application may apply the new visual attributes when the viewport stops moving, or the geographic application may apply the new visual attributes substantially in real-time as the viewport moves.
