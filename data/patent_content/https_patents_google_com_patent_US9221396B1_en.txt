Definitions
- An autonomous vehicle may use various computing systems to aid in the transport of passengers from one location to another.
- the autonomous vehicle may require an initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger.
- Other autonomous systems for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the autonomous vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the autonomous vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- the autonomous vehicle may be equipped with various types of sensors in order to detect objects in its environment.
- the autonomous vehicles may include such sensors as lasers, sonar, radar, cameras, and other sensors that scan and record data from the autonomous vehicle's environment. Sensor data from one or more of these sensors may be used to detect objects and their respective characteristics (position, shape, heading, speed, etc.). This detection and identification is a critical function for the safe operation of the autonomous vehicle.
- the autonomous vehicle may rely on a prior stored electronic representation of the environment (e.g., a roadway, a highway, etc.).
- the electronic representation of the environment may be considered a “map” that identifies such features as lane markings, lane edges, k-rail concrete barriers, lane dividers, road medians, traffic safety cones, and other such features.
- the autonomous vehicle may store the map for both complex and simple environments.
- the sensors on the autonomous vehicle may experience one or more problems, such as failure, inaccurate readings, or other such problems.
- the sensor may be unusable for determining whether there are objects, such as other vehicles, proximate to the autonomous vehicle. Having a sensor failure decreases the ability of the autonomous vehicle to navigate its environment confidently and precisely.
- the apparatus includes a first sensor configured to detect a vehicle in a driving environment, a second sensor configured to detect the vehicle in the driving environment, and a memory that stores detailed map information for the driving environment, first sensor parameters for determining whether the vehicle is present in a first image of the driving environment, and second sensor parameters for determining whether the vehicle is present in a second image of the driving environment.
- the apparatus may also include a processor in communication with the memory, the first sensor and the second sensor, the processor being configured to receive first sensor information from the first sensor, the first sensor information being used to produce the first image and receive second sensor information from the second sensor, the second sensor information being used to produce the second image.
- the processor may also be configured to determine whether the vehicle is in both the first image and the second image, determine a deviation value by comparing the first image with the second image when it is determined that the vehicle is present in the first image and the second image, and compare the determined deviation value with a deviation threshold to determine whether the first or second sensor has a problem detecting the vehicle.
- the first sensor is a first type of imaging sensor and the second sensor is a second type of imaging sensor, the first type of imaging sensor being different than the second type of imaging sensor.
- the processor is further configured to select the first sensor as a reference sensor for determining whether the second sensor has the problem detecting the vehicle.
- the processor selects the first sensor based on a predetermined time interval.
- the processor selects the second sensor for cross-validation with the first sensor based on an amount of time that has elapsed since the second sensor was last cross-validated.
- the memory further stores a multi-level failure threshold comprising a plurality of levels, wherein each level is associated with an action for the processor to perform, and a level of the plurality of levels is associated with a condition of the deviation value exceeding the deviation threshold.
- the processor may also perform the action of the level associated with the condition of the deviation value exceeding the deviation threshold when the processor determines that the deviation value exceeds the deviation threshold.
- the memory stores a failure count threshold that identifies an action to be performed when the failure count threshold is exceeded, the comparison of the determined deviation value with the deviation threshold causes the failure count threshold to be exceeded, and the action identified by the failure count threshold is performed.
- the first image comprises a plurality of images determined from the first sensor information, the first sensor information being received during a predetermined time interval
- the second image comprises a plurality of images determined from the second sensor information, the second sensor information being received during the predetermined time interval.
- the processor may also be configured to determine first state information about the vehicle from the first plurality of images, determine second state information about the vehicle from the second plurality of images, and compare the first state information with the second state information to determine the deviation value.
- the first state information comprises at least one of a first vehicle speed, a first vehicle position, or a first vehicle heading
- the second state information comprises at least one of a second vehicle speed, a second vehicle position, or a second vehicle heading
- the processor compares at least one of the first vehicle speed, first vehicle position or first vehicle heading with at least one of the second vehicle speed, second vehicle position, or second vehicle heading.
- the first image comprises a first object label encompassing the vehicle, the first object label comprising a first parameter that defines a characteristic of the first object label
- the second image comprises a second object label encompassing the vehicle, the second object label comprising a second parameter that defines a characteristic of the second object label
- the processor compares the first image with the second image to determine the deviation value by comparing the first object label with the second object label.
- the processor compares the first object label with the second object label by comparing the first parameter with the second parameter.
- the method includes receiving, with a processor in communication with a first sensor, first sensor information, the first sensor information being used to produce a first image of a driving environment, receiving, with the processor in communication with the second sensor, second sensor information, the second sensor information being used to produce the second image of the driving environment, and determining, with the processor, whether a vehicle is present in both the first image and the second image.
- the method may also include determining, with the processor, a deviation value by comparing the first image with the second image when it is determined that the vehicle is present in the first image and the second image, and comparing, with the processor, the determined deviation value with a deviation threshold to determine whether the first or second sensor has a problem detecting the vehicle.
- the first sensor is a first type of imaging sensor and the second sensor is a second type of imaging sensor, the first type of imaging sensor being different than the second type of imaging sensor.
- the method includes selecting, with the processor, the first sensor as a reference sensor for determining whether the second sensor has the problem detecting the vehicle.
- the method includes selecting, with the processor, the first sensor based on a predetermined time interval.
- the method includes selecting, with the processor, the second sensor for cross-validation with the first sensor based on an amount of time that has elapsed since the second sensor was last cross-validated.
- the method includes determining whether the deviation value exceeds a deviation threshold associated with a level of a multi-level failure threshold, wherein an action for the processor to perform is associated with the level, and performing the action of the level based on the determination that the deviation value exceeds the deviation threshold.
- the comparison of the determined deviation value with the deviation threshold causes a failure count threshold to be exceeded, the failure count threshold identifying an action to be performed when the failure count threshold is exceeded.
- the method may also include performing the action identified by the failure count threshold.
- the first image comprises a plurality of images determined from the first sensor information, the first sensor information being received during a predetermined time interval
- the second image comprises a plurality of images determined from the second sensor information, the second sensor information being received during the predetermined time interval.
- the method may also include determining, with the processor, the first state information about the vehicle from the first plurality of images, determining, with the processor, second state information about the vehicle from the second plurality of images, and comparing, with the processor, the first state information with the second state information to determine the deviation value.
- the first state information comprises at least one of a first vehicle speed, a first vehicle position, or a first vehicle heading
- the second state information comprises at least one of a second vehicle speed, a second vehicle position, or a second vehicle heading.
- the method may also include comparing, with the processor, at least one of the first vehicle speed, first vehicle position or first vehicle heading with at least one of the second vehicle speed, second vehicle position, or second vehicle heading.
- the first image comprises a first object label encompassing the vehicle, the first object label comprising a first parameter that defines a characteristic of the first object label
- the second image comprises a second object label encompassing the vehicle, the second object label comprising a second parameter that defines a characteristic of the second object label.
- the method may also include comparing, with the processor, the first image with the second image to determine the deviation value by comparing the first object label with the second object label.
- comparing the first object label with the second object label comprises comparing the first parameter with the second parameter.

- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may compare the position of the vehicle 604 determined from one or more camera images with the position of the vehicle 604 determined from one or more laser point cloud images, relative to the autonomous vehicle 102 or relative to the detailed map 502 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may compare the speed of the vehicle 604 determined from one or more camera images with the speed of the vehicle 604 determined from one or more laser point cloud images, relative to the autonomous vehicle 102 or relative to the detailed map 502 . Comparing the state information may also be in terms absolute values.
- the results of comparing the state information from the various sensors should indicate that the state information obtained from the sensors is substantially, or nearly, identical. Otherwise, deviations (i.e., differences) in the state information may indicate that a sensor (i.e., the laser 304 ) is experiencing a problem.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may employ one or more state information thresholds. For example, there may be a positional threshold (e.g., one meter), a speed threshold (e.g., 0.5 km/hr), a size threshold (e.g., height and/or width), a classification threshold (e.g., one size classification above or below), and other such state information thresholds.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may establish a multi-level failure threshold based on the compared state information.
- the multi-level failure threshold may include escalating levels of failure that indicate the extent to which a sensor being cross-validated (i.e., laser 304 ) is experiencing a problem.
- the multi-level failure threshold may have a first level of one threshold difference, a second level of two threshold differences, a third level of three threshold differences, and so forth.
- the compared state information indicates that the state information position threshold has been exceeded
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may record that the first level of the multi-level failure threshold was reached.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may record that the second level of the multi-level failure threshold was reached.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may take a variety of actions. For example, at the first level of the multi-level failure threshold, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may record in an electronic log that the first level was reached. At the second level of the multi-level failure threshold, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may display an error message. At the third level, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may request that a passenger take control of the autonomous vehicle 102 . In this manner, the multi-level failure threshold serves as a safety mechanism to alert a passenger when there is a problem with a sensor being cross-validated.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may also maintain a total failure count threshold.
- the total failure count threshold may be in addition to the multi-level failure threshold.
- the total failure count threshold may be a threshold based on the number of times a state information threshold has been exceeded, either during the cross-validation of a sensor, the lifetime of a sensor, or at any other time.
- There may be a global total failure count threshold i.e., a failure count threshold for all the sensors 146 of the autonomous vehicle 102 ), total failure count thresholds for each sensor of the autonomous vehicle 102 , or combinations thereof.
- each of the state information characteristics e.g., position, speed, heading, etc.
- the failure count threshold may be as low as five (or lower) or as high as ten (or higher).
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may take a variety of actions based on the value of the total failure count threshold (global or individual sensor), based on the values of the individual failure count thresholds for the state information, or a combination thereof. For example, each time the individual sensor total failure count is increased, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may record this fact in an electronic log. However, when the individual sensor total failure count is equal to or greater than a first predetermined value (e.g., fifty), the autonomous driving computer system 144 may display an error message regarding the failure (e.g., the fact that a sensor failed to cross-validate, that a specific state information characteristic was different, etc.). Moreover, when the individual sensor total failure count is equal to or greater than a second predetermined value (e.g., two hundred), the autonomous driving computer system 144 may request that a passenger take control of the autonomous vehicle 102 .
- a first predetermined value e.g., fifty
- a second predetermined value e.g., two hundred
- Each of the failure thresholds may be used to quickly identify different problems in the sensors of the autonomous vehicle 102 .
- the multi-level failure threshold may be used to identify a single, catastrophic failure in a sensor (e.g., the failure count may be low, but all of the state information thresholds may have been exceeded).
- a failure count threshold may be used to identify an intermittent problem, such as where a failure count threshold is increased at time t 0 , not increased at time t 1 (e.g., one minute from time t 0 ), but then increased again at time t 2 (e.g., two minutes from time t 2 ).
- the various failure thresholds for the compared state information serve as safety mechanisms to readily identify potential failures or problems in sensors being cross-validated.
- comparing determined state information may encompass one embodiment of the cross-validation algorithm 140 .
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may be configured to compare the object labels applied to the objects detected in the captured images (e.g., the camera image 702 and the laser point cloud image 802 ).

- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine a number of object label deviations.
- the number of object label deviations may be dependent on the number of sides of the object label.
- the object label is a polygon, such as a rectangular bounding box
- the object label deviations may include four deviations: a first height deviation 1104 , a second height deviation 1108 , a first width deviation 1106 , and a second width deviation 1110 .
- the number of deviations may be more where there are more sides to the object labels, such as in the case of pentagons, hexagons, or other multi-sided polygons, or the number of deviations may be less, such as in the case of triangles, circles, ovals, or other similar shapes.
- the object label deviations may be measured in physical units (e.g., centimeters, meters, etc.) or in electronic units (e.g., pixels).
- the deviations may be assigned values based on the physical characteristics of the object encompassed by the object label (e.g., vehicle 604 ) or the deviations may be assigned values based on the characteristics of the captured image in which the object appears.

- the object label deviations determined from the aggregation of comparisons may include one or more maximum deviations, one or more average deviations, and one or more average signed deviations. For example, there may be four maximum deviations, four average deviations, and four average signed deviations (i.e., a total of twelve deviations), where each deviation corresponds to a side of a rectangular bounding box, such as the object labels 902 , 1002 . There may be more or less maximum, average, and signed average deviations depending on the number of sides of the object labels being compared.
- the values of the maximum deviation(s), average deviation(s), and/or average signed deviation(s) may vary.
- the value of the maximum deviation may equal the value of the maximum difference for a compared set of deviations (e.g., thirty pixels, twenty pixels, fifty meters, etc.).
- the value of the average deviation may equal the average value of the differences for a compared set of deviations (e.g., two pixels, one meter, etc.).
- the value of the average signed deviation may equal the average value of the differences for a compared set of deviations and may also indicate whether a side of a object label is shifted to the left/down (where the average signed deviation is negative) or shifted to the right/up (where the average signed deviation is positive).
- values for the average signed deviation may include ⁇ 10 pixels, +10 pixels, ⁇ 2 meters, +2 meters, and other such values.
- the maximum, average, and average signed deviations may be based on all sides being compared, for a single side being compared, or combinations thereof.

- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may establish one or more deviation thresholds for a singular object label (e.g., a first height object label deviation threshold) and/or one or more deviation thresholds for the determined maximum deviation, the determined average deviation, and the determined average signed deviation.
- Comparisons of the deviations with their corresponding deviation thresholds may indicate whether the sensor being cross-validated is experiencing a problem and the extent of that problem. For example, a comparison of the maximum deviation with the maximum deviation threshold may indicate the magnitude of the problem being experienced by the sensor. Similarly, a comparison of the average signed deviation with the average signed deviation threshold may, not only indicate the magnitude of the problem being experienced by the sensor, but also the extent to which the sensor may be improperly calibrated (e.g., are the sensor readings too far to the left, too far to the right, too high up, too far down, etc.).
- the values of the one or more deviation thresholds may be different, or the same as, each other.
- a first width deviation threshold may have the same value as a second width deviation threshold.

- a first height deviation threshold may have the same or different value as a second height deviation threshold.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may establish a maximum deviation and maximum deviation threshold, an average deviation and an average deviation threshold, and an average signed deviation and an average signed deviation threshold.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may establish a multi-level failure threshold for monitoring when one or more of the height and/or width deviation thresholds have been exceeded, and the autonomous driving computer system 144 may establish a failure count threshold for monitoring the number of times one or more of the deviation thresholds for the object labels 902 , 1002 have been exceeded.

- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may compare the object labels applied to the common objects (Block 1214 ). Comparing the object labels may include comparing the object labels from images captured at approximately the same time and/or comparing the object labels from one or more images captured during a predetermined time interval. As with the comparison of the state information, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may determine various deviation values based on the comparison of the object labels.
- the autonomous driving computer system 144 may then determine whether the sensor being cross-validated is having a problem (Block 1216 ). As discussed previously, the autonomous driving computer system 144 may perform this determination by comparing one or more of the determined deviation values with one or more deviation thresholds. The autonomous driving computer system 144 may also establish one or more failure thresholds (e.g., the multi-level failure threshold, the failure count threshold, etc.) that may be exceeded when one or more of the deviation values exceed their corresponding deviation thresholds.
