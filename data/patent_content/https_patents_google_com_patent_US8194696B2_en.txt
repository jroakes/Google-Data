- the group of ATs that is, ATs 101 - 104 , share time slots 0 - 2 using one of multiple possible multiple access schemes.
- ATs 101 - 104 may share the three time slots depicted in FIG. 5 using a set of four orthogonal codes, such as Walsh codes.
- ATs 101 - 104 may share the three time slots using frequency division multiplexing (FDM), time division multiplexing (TDM), spatial division multiplexing (SDM), or using a multiple user packet.
- FDM frequency division multiplexing
- TDM time division multiplexing
- SDM spatial division multiplexing
- each of ATs 101 - 104 independently decodes its received data or the composite multiple user packet in time slots 3 - 4 .
- each AT of the group of ATs 101 - 104 waits a number, N, of time slots to transmit the AT's ACK/NAK information, where N may be different for each AT of the group ATs.
- N is an integer greater than or equal to zero (0), and is a function of the AT's position in the group of the ATs, that is, ATs 101 - 104 , sharing slots 0 - 2 .
- the function may be a modulus function, where one argument of the modulus function is a position of the AT, the other argument of the modulus function is a total number of time slots available for sending acknowledgment information, and the output of the modulus function is N, or a lookup table, where an input of the lookup table is a position of the AT and an output of the lookup table is N, which modulus function and/or lookup table are maintained in the at least one memory device 220 of the AT.
- the function may be based on a value maintained in the at least one memory device 220 of the AT and used for another purpose by the AT, for example, an electronic serial number, authentication code, a radio parameter, or the like, which value is not dependent on the AT's position in the group.
- the function may be a random number generator implemented by the processor 210 of the AT, or any other function dependent on the AT's position in the group of ATs.
- the AT may share the value of N with the AN in advance through the use of a message, code, control bit, or other means to communicate the information to the AN.
- the function used by the AT to determine the AT's position in the group may be maintained in the at least one memory device 220 of the AT or may be indicated to the AT by AN 110 via a transmission on a control channel of forward link 142 .
- the function is further maintained by AN 110 , that is, is maintained in the at least one memory device 124 , 134 of transceiver 120 , of network controller 130 , or of both.
- both AN 110 and the AT may agree in advance on the function, or algorithm, for determining N. In this way, the AT knows when to transmit an ACK/NAK information, and the AN knows then to expect ACK/NAK information from a given AT.
- AN 110 may attempt to receive the ACK/NAK from the AT in each possible time slot.
- N Mod(Position,Num_Possible_Locations), where the Position parameter, or argument, corresponds to the assigned position of the AT and the Num_Possible_Locations parameter, or argument, corresponds to the number of possible locations for transmitting the ACK/NAK information.
- the value assigned to the Position parameter may be determined based on an index value assigned to the access terminal, wherein the index value corresponds to the portion of the shared time domain resource assigned to the AT, or based on the unique identifier associated with the AT.
- the shared time domain resource may comprise a set of Walsh codes and the index value may correspond to a particular Walsh Code assigned to the AT or the shared time domain resource may comprise a set of subcarriers and the index value may correspond to a particular subset of subcarriers assigned to the AT.
- the value assigned to the Position parameter may be determined based on a position of the AT in a list of ATs included in the group of ATs, for example, where the list of ATs is a list of the unique identifiers associated with each AT in the group of ATs.
- index values and identifiers may be sent by AN 110 to the AT via a control channel of forward link 142 .
- ATs 101 and 104 will transmit their ACK/NAK information in time slot 5
- AT 102 will transmit its ACK/NAK information in time slot 6
- AT 103 will transmit its ACK/NAK information in time slot 7 , wherein each ACK/NAK is transmitted via reverse link 144 .
- the ACK/NAK indications for the group of ATs 101 - 104 are distributed uniformly in the time domain.
- the ACK/NAK information can be transmitted by each AT 101 - 104 using one of multiple available modulation schemes.
- the ACK/NAK information can be transmitted using binary phase shift keying (BPSK).
- BPSK binary phase shift keying
- the ACK/NAK information can be transmitting using on-off keying.
- different ATs could use different modulation schemes for transmitting their ACK/NAK information.
- the modulation used for ACK/NAK information may depend on whether multiple user packets are being used or not.
- AN 110 then schedules data transmissions for time slots 9 - 11 during time slot 8 . If an AT 101 - 104 sent a NAK in time slots 5 - 7 , then AN 110 may send a retransmission of the NAK'd transmission in time slots 9 - 11 . This pattern is repeated for subsequent transmissions.
- AN 110 may know that an AT may require M slots to decode a transmission and respond with an ACK/NAK indication. In these cases, AN 110 may assign an AT with limiting process capabilities a group position such that the AT is not required to transmit its ACK/NAK information until it has had sufficient time to decode the transmission. For example and again referring to FIG. 5 , if a particular AT requires three total time slots to decode a transmission and respond with an ACK/NAK indication, AN 110 may ensure that this particular AT is assigned to positions 1 or 2 in the group.
- FIG. 6 is an exemplary timing diagram 600 depicting a utilization of a time domain resources by communication system 100 in accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention.
- the operation of communication system 100 with respect to FIG. 6 is similar to the operation of communication system 100 described above with respect to timing diagram 500 , except that a shared time domain resource comprises the multiple contiguous time slots 0 - 1 and 6 - 7 , instead of times slots 0 - 2 and 9 - 11 , and time slots 4 and 5 , instead of time slots 5 - 7 , may be utilized by an AT for transmission of ACK/NAK information.
- a first AT 101 of the group of ATs 101 - 104 may be assigned position 0
- a second AT 102 of the group of ATs 101 - 104 may be assigned position 1
- a third AT 103 of the group of ATs 101 - 104 may be assigned position 2
- a fourth AT 104 of the group of ATs 101 - 104 may be assigned position 3 .
- ATs 101 and 103 will transmit their ACK/NAK information in time slot 4 and ATs 102 and 104 will transmit its ACK/NAK information in time slot 5 . Again, in this manner, the ACK/NAK indications for the group of ATs 101 - 104 are distributed uniformly in the time domain.
- communication system 100 By distributing the acknowledgment transmissions sent by each AT in a group of ATs 101 - 104 based on a determined position of the AT, communication system 100 provides for a distribution, in the time domain, of acknowledgment transmissions by the group of ATs, which group of ATs share a same time domain resource.
- the position of the AT may be determined by the AT and/or AN 110 , and when determined by the AT may be determined based on values maintained by the AT or conveyed to the AT by AN 110 and/or based on a function indicated by the AN.
- the AT determines a number of time slots corresponding to the AT's position and then transmits an acknowledgment transmission based on the determined number of time slots.
- the acknowledgment transmissions by the multiple ATs may be distributed over multiple time slots in the time domain, with the result that interference among the acknowledgment transmissions and received power at the AN is minimized.
- This sequence of instructions may include, but is not limited to, a subroutine, a function, a procedure, an object method, an object implementation, an executable application, an applet, a servlet, a shared library/dynamic load library, a source code, an object code and/or an assembly code.
Abstract
Description
N=Mod(Position,Num_Possible_Locations),
where the Position parameter, or argument, corresponds to the assigned position of the AT and the Num_Possible_Locations parameter, or argument, corresponds to the number of possible locations for transmitting the ACK/NAK information. The value assigned to the Position parameter, that is, to the position of the AT in the group of ATs, may be determined based on an index value assigned to the access terminal, wherein the index value corresponds to the portion of the shared time domain resource assigned to the AT, or based on the unique identifier associated with the AT. For example, the shared time domain resource may comprise a set of Walsh codes and the index value may correspond to a particular Walsh Code assigned to the AT or the shared time domain resource may comprise a set of subcarriers and the index value may correspond to a particular subset of subcarriers assigned to the AT. In another embodiment of the present invention, the value assigned to the Position parameter, that is, to the position of the AT in the group of ATs, may be determined based on a position of the AT in a list of ATs included in the group of ATs, for example, where the list of ATs is a list of the unique identifiers associated with each AT in the group of ATs. As described in detail above, such index values and identifiers may be sent by AN 110 to the AT via a control channel of
