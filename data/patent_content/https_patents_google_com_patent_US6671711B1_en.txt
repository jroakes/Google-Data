Definitions
- the present invention relates to the field of analysis and design of hypermedia linked collections of documents, and in particular to the prediction of user traffic flow in such a collection without relying on observed usage information.
- hypertext linked documents such as the World Wide Web
- hypertext links typically forage for information by navigating from document to document by selecting hypertext links.
- a piece of information such as a snippet of text is typically associated with each hypertext link.
- the snippet of text provides the user with information about the content of the document at the other end of the link.
- the structural linkage topology of collections of hypermedia linked documents is similar to a highway system.
- a traveler begins at some origin point and travels along the roads of the highway system in order to reach a desired destination.
- the traveler may see signs that indicate which roads he should take to reach his desired destination. For example, a traveler who wishes to go from his home to the local airport might travel along the roadways until seeing a sign with the words “international airport” or a sign with a picture of an airplane. Either sign could give traveler information about which highway ramp to take in order to reach the airport. If the signs do not exist or if they are confusing, the traveler would probably not be able to find his destination.
- a user on the Web might start from one web page and select links based on whether they look like they might lead the user to another web page that might satisfy his information need.
- the links are analogous to roadways that can take the user to his destination, the information need. How well these links will lead users to their desired destinations depends on a complex interaction of user goals, user behaviors, and Web site designs.
- An embodiment of the present invention provides a system and method for predicting user traffic flow in a collection of hypermedia documents by determining the association strength of hypermedia links.
- the association strength is a measure of the probability that a user will flow down a particular hypermedia link.
- the system and method of the present invention do not require collecting user interaction information in order to perform the prediction, because they take into account the content of the documents.
- An embodiment of the present invention includes a system and method for determining the association strength of hypermedia links in a document collection based on the user information need and content items that are contained in the documents. The system identifies the hypermedia linkage structure among the plurality of documents in the collection, where the documents include content items that may be relevant to a user information need.
- the system determines the distribution of the content items in the document collection.
- the system receives an information item as input and compares the information item to the content items. In response to the comparison, the system assigns an association strength to the hypermedia links.
- the system also uses a network flow model that predicts user traffic flow using the association strengths of the hypermedia links and applying them to an initial condition.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the structural linkage and content of a collection of hypermedia linked documents.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating steps that are performed in a method for determining the association strength of hypermedia links in an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating steps that are performed in a method for determining the association strength of hypermedia links in an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating steps that are performed in a method for predicting traffic flow in an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a system for predicting user traffic flow in an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 6 illustrates exemplary matrices that are used in an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 7 illustrates exemplary matrices that are used in an embodiment of the present invention.
- the present invention provides a system and method for predicting user traffic flow in a collection of hypermedia documents by determining the association strength of the hypermedia links.
- the system does not require collecting user interaction information in order to perform the prediction because it performs an analysis of the document contents and how they relate to a user information need item that is input to the system.
- FIG.1 is a block diagram 100 illustrating the structural linkage and content of a collection of hypermedia linked documents.
- Documents P 0 , P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , P 4 , P 5 and P 6 are indexed and shown as 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 , 112 and 114 .
- Documents P 0 -P 6 are linked as shown by hypermedia links 120 , 122 , 124 , 126 , 128 , 130 and 132 .
- the hypermedia links may be any type of linked from one document to another, including hypertext links.
- An example of the kind of document shown in P 0 -P 6 ( 102 - 114 ) is a web site.
- Content items 144 - 154 are located in documents P 0 -P 6 as shown.
- the content of documents associated with these hypermedia links is usually presented to the user by some proximal cue such as a snippet of text or a graphic. Web users that are foraging for information use these proximal cues to process the distal content of the document at the other end of the link.
- the association strength of these hypermedia links also referred to as “information scent”, is the imperfect, subjective, perception of the value, cost, or access path of information sources obtained from proximal cues such as Web links or icons representing the content sources.
- the association strength is a measure of the probability that a user will flow down a particular hypermedia link.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart 200 illustrating steps that are performed in a method for determining the association strength of hypermedia links in an embodiment of the present invention.
- the hypermedia links 120 - 132 of a plurality of documents P 0 -P 6 ( 102 - 114 ) are identified, step 202 .
- the distribution of the content items in the document collection is determined, step 204 .
- the distribution of the content items may be determined by standard information retrieval techniques such as TF.IDF to weight the content items by a frequency in the document collection, as discussed in “Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing”, C. Manning and H. Schuetze, 1999, MIT Press, p. 542, which is incorporated by reference herein. A variety of other weighting schemes may also be used.
- the information need item is compared to the content items in the document collection, step 206 .
- the information need item represents the information that the user wishes to find in the document collection.
- This information need item may be expressed as a query containing a list of keywords that are relevant to the user's information need.
- the list of keywords may be expanded to include synonyms or related words.
- the result of the comparison between the information need and the content items is used in conjunction with the content item distribution to determine the association strength of the hypermedia links, step 208 .
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart 300 describing the steps of the method described in FIG. 2 in more detail.
- the documents in the collection are indexed, step 302 .
- the seven documents shown in FIG. 1 are indexed as documents P 0 -P 6 .
- the hypermedia links between documents in the collection are then identified, step 304 .
- the hypermedia link and document information forms a graph that can be expressed as a (document x document) adjacency matrix which represents the topology of the hypermedia linked document collection.
- An example of such a topology matrix T is shown in FIG. 6 A.
- the rows and columns of T are indexed by document IDs 0 - 6 , and a “1” is represents that an outlink exists from one document to another.
- the “1” located in the first row, second column indicates that there is an outlink 120 from document P 0 102 to document P 1 104 .
- other values of “1” in the topology matrix T 602 also indicate outlinks.
- the unique content items in the documents are indexed, step 302 , as shown in FIG. 6 B.
- FIG. 1 there are eight unique items: “Java” 140 (contained in documents P 1 , P 2 , P 3 and P 5 ), “API” 142 (contained in document P 3 ), “Sun” 144 (contained in document P 0 ), “Home” 146 (contained in documents P 0 and P 4 ), “coffee” 148 (contained in document P 5 ), “support” 150 (contained in document P 2 ), “Petes” 152 (contained in document P 4 ) and “Tea” 154 (contained in document P 6 ).
- a word x document matrix W is created to reflect the frequency of occurrence of the content items, step 308 .
- Matrix 606 shown in FIG. 6C is an example of such a matrix.
- Matrix 606 reflects the content item distribution in the collection of documents P 0 -P 6 and is also referred to as the weight matrix W.
- row 1 of matrix 606 indicates that the word “Java” appears in documents P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , and P 5 by the placement of “1” values in columns 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 .
- the distribution of the content items may be determined by standard information retrieval techniques such as TF.IDF to weight the content items by a frequency in the document collection, cited above in connection with the discussion of FIG. 2 above. A variety of other weighting schemes may also be used.
- a query vector is created to express the user information need as a list of content items, step 310 .
- An example of a query vector 610 is shown in FIG. 6 D.
- the nth component of the query vector 610 corresponds to the nth indexed word.
- query vector 610 has values of “1” in the first to rows to represent the words “Java” and “API”, which are the two items in the set of keywords representing the information need.
- the list of keywords that may be used to express an information need may be expanded to include synonyms or related words.
- the query vector Q 610 is multiplied with the weight matrix W 606 in order to obtain a list of documents that roughly corresponds to the user information need, step 312 , according the following equation:
- the list of documents P 0 -P 6 is expressed as a relevance vector R.
- the relevance vector R is multiplied by the topology matrix T 602 in order to determine the association strength of each of the links connecting the documents in the collection, step 314 .
- the association strength is determined as follows.
- the exponent of the items in the relevance vector R is taken for practical and theoretical reasons such as Luce's Choice Theorem. Note that this is not necessary if the TF.IDF weighting scheme was used earlier.
- This relevance vector R is applied to each row T i of the topology matrix.
- Each row T i of the topology matrix corresponds to one document and specifies the links out from the document.
- the hypermedia links out from a node are represented by the rows of the topology matrix T.
- the outlinks for the document P 1 are extracted by transposing T and taking the first column 702 , shown in FIG.
- the association strengths may be proportionalized so that the all links sum to one.
- the reason for proportionalizing the association strengths is that the amount of users flowing through a link should stay constant.
- the association strength of each of the outlinks for example, S i 704 as shown in FIG. 7B, should be proportional to the sum of the association strength from all of the outlinks.
- the full document x document association strength matrix S 706 may be generated by repeating the above calculation for every document and outlinks.
- association strength matrix S 706 may then be used to simulate users flowing down different links any hypermedia links document collection.
- Association strength matrix S 706 specifies a network of association strengths associated with each hypermedia link, and indicate the amount of user interest flowing down each link.
- the association strength of the hypermedia links may be used in a method for predicting traffic flow.
- a method for predicting traffic flow according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown in flowchart 400 of FIG. 4 .
- the initial conditions that will be used in the method are determined, step 402 .
- the initial conditions specified an entry point such as a document, or web page, from which a user will begin to select links to satisfy his information need.
- These initial conditions may include a plurality of users starting from the same four different entry points.
- the initial condition may be represented as an entry vector E.
- an entry vector E [0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0] specifies that the initial condition is the document P 1 .
- the association strengths for the hypermedia links are obtained, step 404 .
- a network flow model is then applied, step 406 , to the initial conditions using the association strengths. Any traditional network flow model may be used in step 406 .
- a spreading activation algorithm may be used, for example as discussed in “System for Predicting Documents Relevant to Focus Documents by Spreading Activation Through Network Representations of a Linked Collection of Documents”, U.S. Pat. No. 5,835,905 by Pirolli, et al., which is incorporated by reference herein.
- A( 1 ) may be pumped through the association strength matrix S 706 to obtain A( 2 ) 708 as shown in FIG. 7 D.
- This determination may be based on a number of factors, including a predetermined number of steps, a proportion of users who continue to select hypermedia links, or the total number users is compared to a predetermined threshold.
- the proportion of users who continue to select hypermedia links may be determined by the function ⁇ (L), which is also known as “the law of surfing”, as described in P. Pirolli and J. E. Pitkow, “Distributions of surfers' paths through the World Wide Web: Empirical characterization”, 1999, World Wide Web (2): pp. 29-45 and Huberman, B. A., P. Pirolli, J. Pitkow, R.
- step 408 determines whether the simulation should continue. If the determination in the step 408 indicates that the simulation should continue, then processing continues for another iteration at step 406 . Otherwise, the simulation is complete and ends at step 410 .
- a system for determining the association strength of hypermedia links in an embodiment of the present invention is shown by the block diagram 500 of FIG. 5 .
- the system includes an identification component 502 .
- Identification component 502 responds to a hypermedia linked document collection input 508 , and identifies the hypermedia links of a plurality of documents. Identification component 502 may be used to perform methods steps 202 in FIG. 2 and step 304 in FIG. 3 .
- the identified links 510 are acted upon by distribution component 504 to determine the distribution of the content items in the documents, resulting in a set of weighted content items 512 .
- Distribution component 504 may be used to perform method steps 204 and 308 .
- Weighted content items 512 are then compared to an information need item 514 by a comparison component 506 , to produce association strength 516 associated with the hypermedia links.
- Comparison component 506 may be used to perform method steps 206 and steps 312 - 314 .
- the documents include a plurality of content items as described above.
- Association strength 516 may be used in a system for stimulating user traffic flow.
- a system for simulating traffic flow in a plurality of hypermedia linked documents in an embodiment of the present invention includes a simulation component 518 which responds to an association strength input 516 and an initial condition 520 to produce a predicted user path 522 .
- the simulation component 518 may be used to perform method steps 406 - 410 .
- the simulation component 518 applies a network flow model to the initial condition wherein the network flow model simulates traffic flow in response to a plurality of association strengths 516 representative of information need 514 .
- the initial condition represents the entry point or state of one or more users at the start of the simulation.
- the initial condition may be an entry web page. If multiple users are to be modeled, then the initial condition may be the entry points of a plurality of users.
- the network flow model may be any suitable traditional network flow model, for example a spreading activation algorithm as described above.
- the simulation component may operate in successive iterations and then stop when a particular condition is satisfied. For example, the simulation may continue for a predetermined number of steps or link traversals. The simulation may continue until a proportion of users who continue exceeds, reaches or drops below a desired level, as determined by the function ⁇ (L), as described above. Alternatively, the simulation may continue until a total number of users to continue drops below a predetermined threshold ⁇ .
