Definitions
- the present document relates to improved techniques for navigating among camera views in a multi-camera system.
- an improved interface for navigating among views in a multi-camera environment.
- such an interface also provides an overview of the scene represented by the captured video, by virtue of the positioning of various user interface elements representing different camera views.
- the navigation interface includes a number of selectable user interface elements, arranged in a fashion that approximates the physical positions of the cameras.
- Each element corresponds to one of the cameras. Tapping or clicking on one of the elements causes a main window to display a current view from the corresponding camera or video feed.
- each element identifies the camera to which it corresponds, for example by a label, icon, number, or the like.
- each element is a thumbnail image of a representative view from the corresponding camera.
- the thumbnail image can be a still image, or it can be a video stream displaying a view from the corresponding camera (which may be either a live view or a recorded view).
- the video stream can optionally be accompanied by identifying information, labels, captions, timing data, and/or the like.
- the navigation interface can be implemented in a live video capture system, so as to facilitate navigation among live video feeds during capture.
- the selectable user interface elements can represent live images from the cameras of a multi-camera rig, allowing the user to select and/or control cameras during capture operations.
- the user interface elements are arranged in a fashion that approximates the physical positions of the cameras from which the live views are being captured. Tapping or clicking on an element causes the main window to display the live video feed from the corresponding camera.
- multiple elements can be selected simultaneously, so that the main screen shows multiple views at the same time.
- the navigation interface can be implemented in a post-production system, so as to facilitate navigation among previously captured video feeds during capture.
- the selectable user interface elements can represent various video feeds captured from different cameras of a multi-camera rig, allowing the user to select among the various feeds during post-processing operations.
- the elements are arranged in a fashion that approximates the physical positions of the cameras from which the views were captured. Tapping or clicking on an element causes the main window to display the captured video from the corresponding camera.
- multiple elements can be selected simultaneously, so that the main screen shows multiple views at the same time.

- Camera system 200 includes a rig 101 , which in turn includes any number of cameras 102 configured to capture video representing a scene.
- Cameras 102 can be positioned according to any suitable arrangement; in at least one embodiment, they are positioned in a planar arrangement wherein they all point in the same direction but capture different views of the scene. In other embodiments, cameras 102 can be positioned in a non-planar arrangement. Examples of different arrangements for cameras 102 of rig 101 are set forth in the above-referenced related applications.
- the particular configuration depicted in FIG. 1A wherein cameras 102 are arranged in a planar grid to form a hexagon, is merely exemplary.
- cameras 102 are configured to capture various views of a scene for purposes of constructing a virtual reality environment or augmented reality environment.
- cameras 102 may be positioned so that the video streams they capture can be assembled in a manner that allows a user to interact and move within the environment, for example by changing his or her position and/or orientation.
- the view presented to the user is changed so as to simulate an actual physical environment through which the user can navigate.
- the system also includes computing device 103 , which includes various components for receiving images from camera system 200 , presenting such images to user 111 , and receiving input from user 111 to control the displayed view.
- Computing device 103 can be a computer, tablet, laptop, smartphone, kiosk, set-top box, and/or any other electronic device or combination of electronic devices, although for illustrative purposes it is depicted herein as a single device.
- computing device 103 operates under the control and direction of software run by processor 104 .
- the functionality described herein can be implemented as a stand-alone software application or as a plug-in for any software application for controlling a camera system.
- Computing device 103 also includes memory 105 that can be used by processor 104 in performing its operations and running software, and/or for buffering video data received from camera system 200 .

- FIG. 1B there is shown a block diagram depicting an overall architecture of a system for implementing a user interface for navigating among different camera views during post-production, according to one embodiment.
- the architecture depicted in FIG. 1B is similar to that of FIG. 1A , except that camera system 200 and rig 101 are omitted, as computing device 103 retrieves video data from video data store 112 rather than from camera system 200 .
- Video data in video data store 112 may include, for example, video and/or images previously captured by a camera system (such as camera system 200 ) and stored in data store 112 , or it can come from other sources.
- device 103 can be used for controlling playback and editing of data in a post-production context wherein video data was previously captured and stored.
- Such an embodiment may be used, for example, in editing of a virtual reality presentation, augmented reality presentation, or other type of immersive multi-camera presentation.
- the system is implemented as a plug-in for a visual effects software application such as Nuke (a compositing suite available from Foundry, of London, United Kingdom), or as a stand-alone software application or plug-in for any other post-processing system.
- FIG. 1C there is shown a block diagram depicting an overall architecture of a system for implementing a user interface for navigating among different camera views as implemented on a camera system, according to one embodiment.
- various components such as processor 104 , output device 108 , video processing module 110 , user input device 107 , and memory 105 are components of camera system 200 itself, rather than a separate computing device.

- user 111 interacts with user input device 107 to control the operation of camera system 200 .
- the architecture depicted in FIG. 1C operates similarly to that of FIG. 1A .
- Rig 101 includes a set of cameras 102 , which may be arranged to define a planar array having a generally hexagonal shape.
- Each of the cameras 102 may be a plenoptic light-field camera as described in the above-referenced related applications, or a conventional camera of any type known in the art.
- Video data and/or image data captured by cameras 102 may be combined to define a light-field even if cameras 102 are conventional cameras.
- each camera 102 may have a field-of-view encompassing an angle of 90°, both vertically and horizontally.
- Camera system 200 may optionally include a synchronization trigger (not shown) that can be used to automatically activate cameras 102 in rig 101 , audio recording equipment (not shown), and/or audio playback equipment (not shown) to facilitate synchronization of video captured by cameras 102 in rig 101 with audio and/or video captured by cameras 102 in rig 101 at different orientations.
- cameras 102 may be secured to a plate 230 , which may be rotatably coupled to a frame 240 .
- Plate 230 may be selectively angled relative to frame 240 to permit cameras 102 to be oriented horizontally as shown, or tilted upward or downward.
- Frame 240 may be rotatably coupled to a base 250 .
- a motor (not shown) may optionally be coupled to frame 240 to rotate frame 240 relative to base 250 . The rotation may be about an axis 260 .
- cameras 102 may be used to capture volumetric video and/or light-field volume data, permitting a view to be generated from any viewpoint within a viewing volume, as determined by the position and/or orientation of the viewer's head.
- camera system 200 may be used to facilitate video capture for virtual reality, augmented reality, and/or other interactive applications.
- video data and/or image data captured by rig 101 is transmitted directly to communications interface 109 of computing device 103 , and such data is used in the manner described herein to manipulate live video.
- video data and/or image data captured by rig 101 is stored at video data store 112 , and used at a later time during post-processing operations.
- camera system 200 may be used to capture video data representing a scene via sequential capture of five wedge-shaped portions of the scene. As described in the above-referenced related applications, the five captured videos may be combined to generate a combined video depicting a 360° view of the scene. Capture of five wedge-shaped portions is merely exemplary; one skilled in the art will recognize that a camera system may be used to capture a scene divided into a different number of portions, which may not necessarily be wedge-shaped. A camera system used to capture a different number of wedges (for example, two, three, four, six, seven, or eight wedges) may have a different field-of-view, or may have the same field-of-view as camera system 200 depicted in FIG. 2 .
- each wedge-shaped portion 320 may have a field-of-view 330 , which may include the fields-of-view of all of cameras 102 of camera system 200 .
- Cameras 102 at the left and right points of the hexagonal shape of the planar array of cameras 102 may define the horizontal extents of field-of-view 330 for each wedge-shaped portion 320 .
- each wedge-shaped portion 320 may have a safe action zone 340 that is a subset of field-of-view 330 for that wedge-shaped portion 320 .
- safe action zone 340 for a wedge-shaped portion 320 may be the portion of field-of-view 330 for that wedge-shaped portion 320 that is not included in field-of-view 330 of any other wedge-shaped portion 320 .
- each field-of-view 330 may include two overlapping portions 350 , each of which overlaps with field-of-view 330 of adjacent wedge-shaped portion 320 .
- camera system 200 may be rotated sequentially so that it captures video for each wedge-shaped portion 320 in sequence.
- camera system 200 may first be oriented to capture field-of-view 330 labeled “Capture 1”
- camera system 200 may be rotated such that camera system 200 is oriented to capture field-of-view 330 labeled “Capture 2,” and then rotated in like manner to capture fields-of-view 330 labeled “Capture 3,” “Capture 4,” and “Capture 5.”
- Such techniques are further described in the above-referenced related applications.

- User 111 can select 404 one of the displayed user interface elements, for example by tapping on it or clicking on it with an on-screen cursor. In at least one embodiment, this causes the display on output device 108 to switch 405 to a view of a camera 102 corresponding to the selected user interface element. In at least one embodiment, steps 404 and 405 can be repeated any number of types, allowing user 111 to repeatedly select different cameras 102 and see the video stream being captured from each selected camera 102 . In at least one embodiment, additional controls can also be provided to allow user 111 to control and/or manipulate the currently selected camera 102 , for example by changing its orientation and/or other parameters. In at least one embodiment, the sequence and timing of user's 111 selections of cameras 102 can be recorded, so as to provide an edit stream that can be used later in generating content.
