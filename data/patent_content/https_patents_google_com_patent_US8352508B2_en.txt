Definitions
- the present invention is related generally to computing devices and, more particularly, to visually displaying information on a computing device.
- search results include videos.
- a user may be able to quickly scan and evaluate still images, but he may have to actually spend time viewing each video to determine if it is of interest to him.
- various search engines provide multiple windows on the display screen of the user's device, where each window displays a small “thumbnail” of one video hit. This arrangement, however, often does not help the user to quickly scan through the videos: The multitude of simultaneous video thumbnails merely reinforces the user's sense of “information overload.”
- a search engine when a search engine retrieves a list of hits, it runs an algorithm to rank those hits according to some kind of relevance and then presents the hits to the user in an ordered ranking. With video results for example, the search engine may display thumbnails of only the “top” (that is, the most relevant as perceived by the search engine) four or five hits. However, the relevance-ranking algorithm used by the search engine may have little or nothing to do with the task that the user who requested the search is attempting to perform.
- list elements e.g., results returned by a user search
- Thumbnails of the top elements are then displayed on a screen of the user's device, with the size of each thumbnail related to that result's anticipated impact (generally, the larger the anticipated impact, the larger the thumbnail). This helps the user because his attention is drawn to the larger thumbnails that correspond to the elements with the greater anticipated impact.
- the arrangement of these thumbnails on the display screen is also based on the anticipated impacts. For example, the larger thumbnails (i.e., those corresponding to the elements with the larger anticipated impacts) are placed near the center of the screen, and successively smaller thumbnails are arranged farther and farther from the screen's center. Again, the user's focus, naturally drawn to the center of the display screen, is directed toward the elements with the highest anticipated impacts.
- Different embodiments may calculate the anticipated impacts differently.
- the impact can be related to the rank order as assigned by a search engine, for example.
- a commercial entity e.g., images of products for sale by that commercial entity
- that entity can assign a higher impact to products that provide a higher profit to the entity.
- Any information about the user's current situation e.g., the time of day or his present physical location
- the anticipated impact For example, if the user is searching for local restaurants, those restaurants that serve breakfast may be assigned a larger anticipated impact if the search is performed early in the morning. When the user is searching for information, longer video results may be assigned a larger anticipated impact because they are more likely to contain the wanted information.
- aspects of the present invention apply as well with still images, music, and any mixture of media.
- the actual display is tailored to the capabilities of the user's device including the size of the display screen and whether or not the device can display three-dimensional images.
- FIG. 1 is an overview of a representational environment in which aspects of the present invention may be practiced
- FIG. 2 is a generalized schematic of a device embodying aspects of the present invention
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of a method for using anticipated impacts when arranging images on a display screen.
- FIGS. 4 a and 4 b are exemplary screen shots illustrating the output of an embodiment of the present invention.
- a user 102 wishes to view a list of images on the display screen of his electronic device 104 .
- the list may be the result of, for example, an Internet search run by the user 102 .
- the list is provided by a commercial entity, such as a retailer listing goods for sale.
- the images themselves may come from any of a number of sources: They may be retrieved from a local storage on the device 104 or may be retrieved from one or more remote servers 106 , the retrieving facilitated by a communications network 100 .
- FIG. 2 shows a representative electronic device 104 (e.g., a cellular telephone, personal digital assistant, personal computer, digital sign, interactive kiosk, set-top box, or two- or three-dimensional television) that incorporates an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 shows the device 104 as a cellular telephone presenting its main display screen 200 to its user 102 .
- the main display 200 is used for most high-fidelity interactions with the user 102 .
- the main display 200 is used to show video or still images, is part of a user interface for changing configuration settings, and is used for viewing call logs and contact lists. To support these interactions, the main display 200 is of high resolution and is as large as can be comfortably accommodated in the device 104 .
- a larger external display can be connected to, and controlled by, the device 104 (e.g., through a docking station).
- the device 104 may have a second and possibly a third display screen for presenting status messages. These screens are generally smaller than the main display screen 200 .
- Embodiments of the present invention can be applied to these screens as well as to the main display screen 200 , but for the sake of brevity, these additional screens are ignored for the remainder of the present discussion.
- a typical user interface of the electronic device 104 includes, in addition to the main display 200 , a keypad and other user-input devices.
- the keypad may be physical or virtual, involving virtual keys displayed on a touch screen 200 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates some of the more important internal components of the electronic device 104 .
- the network interface 202 sends and receives media presentations, related information, and download requests.
- the processor 204 controls the operations of the device 104 and, in particular, supports aspects of the present invention as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 , discussed below.
- the processor 204 uses the memory 206 in its operations. Specific uses of these components by specific devices are discussed as appropriate below.
- FIG. 3 presents one embodiment of the present invention.
- the method of FIG. 3 begins in step 300 when the electronic device 104 receives a list of a plurality of images. Often, the list will be the result of a search performed by the user 102 .
- the images may be received from a remote server 106 , may be retrieved from a memory 206 local to the device 104 , or may come from a variety of such sources.
- the list may include both moving images and static images.
- step 302 at least some of the images on the list are assigned an anticipated impact.
- “anticipated impact” is often shortened to “impact” in the present discussion.
- Different embodiments use different methods for assigning an impact.
- the impact can mimic the relevance order assigned by a search engine.
- Relevance is a well known concept in the art. As one example of computing relevance, a user's query string is compared with audio transcripts that accompany video snippets. Audio transcripts that match more terms in the query are more relevant.
- the number of matching terms for a transcript is the “relevance” assigned to that transcript, and the accompanying video snippets are ordered accordingly.) That is, the first “hit” returned by the search engine is assigned the highest impact, the second hit is assigned the next highest impact, and so on.
- the relative size of the assigned impacts is more relevant to the present invention than are the actual values of the impacts.
- the assigned impacts reflect how much information each image may be able to provide to the user 102 .
- a longer video clip may be assigned a higher impact than a short clip.
- the assigned impact reflects the importance of that image to the provider of the image.
- the list of images may be the result of a search run by a retailer. Then, the retailer assigns higher impacts to images of products that produce greater profits for the retailer.
- the assigned impact reflects a rating of an image, the rating given by, for example, members of a social network that includes the user 102 .
- the impact can reflect a “situational awareness” such as the time of day when a search is performed, or the physical location of the user 102 when he performs a search. Items on the list that are deemed to be more appropriate to the current situation (e.g., pancake houses if a search for restaurants is performed early in the day) can be assigned a greater impact.
- the impacts may be received from the same source that sent the images themselves, or may come from a separate source.
- the electronic device 104 can receive a list of images from a search server 106 , and the device 104 then queries another server to assign impacts to at least some of the images.
- step 304 where at least some of the images are assigned a display size based, at least in part, on the assigned impact. Generally, an image with a larger impact is assigned a larger display size.
- Some embodiments consider other factors when assigning the actual display sizes, such as the number of images to be shown simultaneously and the size of the display screen 200 . Some embodiments consider the relative magnitudes of the assigned impacts and reflect these relative magnitudes in the relative sizes assigned to the images.
- step 306 some of the images are rendered to the display screen 200 of the electronic device 104 .
- the sizes of the images are as assigned in step 304 .
- the larger size images tend to draw the user's attention.
- the method of FIG. 3 directs the attention of the user 102 to those images which have larger anticipated impacts, rather than, as in the prior art, presenting all images on an equal footing.
- the method of steps 300 through 306 is enhanced by arranging the rendered images in a specific way on the screen 200 of the electronic device 104 .
- FIG. 4 a presents a first example of this.
- the images 400 through 408 are presented, left to right, then top to bottom, in the order of relevance as assigned by a search engine. This example shows that impact order may not match relevance order, as image 408 has the fifth highest relevance as determined by the search engine, but it has the highest impact ( 408 is the largest image).
- Another arrangement puts the images 400 through 408 in the order of assigned impact, left to right, then top to bottom. In this case, image 408 would be at the top left (at the beginning of the first row), and image 406 would be at the end of the second row (bottom right).
- FIG. 4 b shows the same images 400 through 408 as in FIG. 4 a but arranged around the center of the display 200 in order of decreasing impact.
- Image 408 has the largest anticipated impact, so gets pride-of-place: the center of the display 200 .
- Images 400 and 404 are the next larger and are put near to the center.
- Images 402 and 406 are smallest and are given “less desirable” locations. This arrangement, along with the different image sizes, draws the user's attention directly to the image with the largest anticipated impact.
- FIG. 4 b is just one example of placing the images with the greatest impact in the most “visually attentive” regions of the display 200 .
- Another embodiment employs the well known “rule-of-thirds” of visual composition.
- these images are preferentially placed at the intersections of an invisible grid that divides the display 200 into three equally sized horizontal rows and three equally sized vertical columns. This is an aesthetically pleasing arrangement that again draws the user's attention to the images with the greatest impact.
- the arrangements given above can include many more images than shown in FIGS. 4 a and 4 b .
