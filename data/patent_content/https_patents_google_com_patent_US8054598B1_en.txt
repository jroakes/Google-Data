- Various embodiments relate generally to electrical power distribution.
- power distribution systems receive high voltage and/or high current electrical power from a utility provider, generator station, or other source of power.
- the power distribution systems may transform the received power to electrically powered equipment, such as the computers and cooling equipment in a data center.
- Electrical power is generally conducted by high current conductors that may be split into two or more branch conductors to divide and distribute electrical power. Some of these branches may be split to further divide and distribute electrical power.

In addition, the electrical devices may only occasionally, if ever, draw their rated currents. In some instances, power distribution systems can be conservatively built to supply the devices' rated currents. The collective power of the devices connected to branches of the power distribution system may remain conservatively below the breaker limit for their respective branch, and the attached devices may not be drawing their maximum amount of power simultaneously. Overall, a power distribution system may leave some portion of the available power unused, and the amount of unusable power may increase as the number of power branches increases.

- Various embodiments may yield one or more advantages. For example, when current through an IPM approaches full (e.g., 100%) utilization of its present capacity allocation, some embodiments may automatically generate a request message asking IPMs at peer and/or parent nodes to reallocate a portion of each of their present power capacities to the requesting IPM. During periods when the IPM has substantial unused allocated capacity (e.g., less than 50%), some IPMs may, for example, respond to request messages from other IPMs by negotiating to reallocate at least a portion of its capacity to other IPMs to automatically adapt to changing load conditions, thereby avoiding or delaying at least some load interruptions.
- IPMs may, for example, respond to request messages from other IPMs by negotiating to reallocate at least a portion of its capacity to other IPMs to automatically adapt to changing load conditions, thereby avoiding or delaying at least some load interruptions.
- IPMs may negotiate branch current allocations to protect the source node against current overloads that substantially exceed the source node's predetermined capacity limit.

- the allocations for each node are configured to achieve improved utilization of electrical distribution infrastructure by allowing a network of current protection devices to intelligently negotiate power allocations in response to dynamic load conditions.
- the power distribution system 100 includes a number of such power limiters, or intelligent protection modules (IPMs), that negotiate power allocations to dynamically shift capacity to route power needed by various load circuits under variable load conditions, while protecting the source node against overloads that would exceed the source node's predetermined capacity limit.
- IPMs intelligent protection modules
- the IPM may generate a request message asking IPMs at peer, parent, and/or child nodes to reallocate a portion of their present power capacity to the requesting IPM.
- the IPM may, for example, respond to request messages from other IPMs by negotiating to reallocate at least a portion of its capacity to other IPMs. Accordingly, a number of IPMs can operate together to automatically negotiate a capacity sharing arrangement that adapts to the dynamic load conditions to achieve improved utilization of infrastructure power handling capability to distribute power to meet peak power demands at different loads.
- the power distribution system 100 includes a facility 102 that receives high voltage and/or current power from an electrical utility provider 104 .
- the facility 102 includes a power substation 106 .
- the power substation 106 transforms the high voltage and/or current power into usable voltages and/or currents for electrical loads in the facility 102 , and distributes the transformed power to a branch conductor 108 a and a branch conductor 108 b.

- the branch conductors 116 a and 116 b include an IPM 118 a and 118 b , respectively.
- the IPMs 118 a and 118 b provide over-current protection for a server computer rack 120 a and a server computer rack 120 b , respectively.
- the IPMs 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b are able to vary their over-current protection trip points and can communicate with each other to allocate power from a shared supply.
- the IPMs 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b can communicate in a peer-to-peer network.
- the IPM 110 a may send a message to the IPM 110 b to request that the IPM 110 b reduce its over-current protection trip point. If the request is granted, the IPM 110 a may then raise its own trip point by a substantially like amount.
- the IPMs 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b can communicate with an information management system 122 which includes a database 124 .
- the IPMs may communicate with the information management system 122 to request and/or receive power allocation settings, or to send and/or receive statuses, alarms, notifications, configurations, or other data that may be used by the IPMs 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b .
- the information management system 122 can access the database 124 to store and retrieve information relating to the IPMs 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b.

- the computer server racks 114 a and 114 b may host email services
- the server computer racks 120 a and 120 b may host video sharing services.
- Demand for these two different services can vary as the amount of traffic from the computers 126 varies. For example, demand for email services may increase in the daytime as users of the computers 126 access their email for work, but in the evening the demand for email services may decrease while the demand for video sharing services increases as people browse videos during their free time.
- the computing loads placed upon the server computer racks 114 a and 114 b may cause the server computer racks 114 a and 114 b to draw 60 A of electrical power in order to operate, while the server computer racks 120 a and 120 b draw 20 A.
- the server computer racks 114 a and 114 b may experience lower computing loads and therefore draw 40 A while the server computer racks 120 a and 120 b may experience increased computing loads and a 70 A draw.
- the branch conductors 108 a and 108 b share a 100 amp supply.
- the intelligent protection module 110 b is configured to allow a number of amperes of current, designated as “X”, to pass onto the conductors 116 a and 116 b
- the intelligent protection module 110 a is configured to allow the remaining number of amperes of current, designated by the value “100-X”, to pass along the conductor 112 .
- the value of “X” can vary as well.
- the loads connected to the IPM 110 b may draw approximately 75 A, leaving approximately 25 A of capacity available for use by the loads connected to IPM 110 a without exceeding the 100 A supply.
- the server computer rack 120 a may draw “Y” amps of current, leaving “X-Y” amps available for use by the server computer rack 120 b.
- IPMs 110 a and 110 b can be initially allocated 50 A each while the server computer racks 114 a and 114 b are drawing 10 A each, the server computer racks 120 a and 120 b are drawing 20 A each, and the IPMs 118 a and 118 b may be allocated 25 A apiece.
- the server computer rack 120 a may draw 40 A, exceeding the allocation given to the IPM 118 a .
- the IPM 118 a can request the IPM 118 b grant some or all of its excess 5 A capacity. If granted, the IPM 118 b can reduce its allocation to 20 A and the IPM 118 a can increase its own allocation to 30 A.
- the IPMs 118 a and 118 b have substantially maximized their use of the 50 A allocated to the IPM 110 b .
- the IPM 110 a can request and additional power allocation from the upstream IPM 110 b .
- the IPM 118 a can request an additional 10 A allocation from the IPM 110 b .
- the IPM 110 b is already passing 50 A of its 50 A allocation.
- the IPM 110 b can send a message to the IPM 110 a to determine if the IPM 110 a has any unused capacity that could be re-allocated to the IPM 110 b.
- the IPM 110 b may request a 10 A allocation from the IPM 110 a . Since the IPM 110 a has 30 A of excess capacity, the IPM 110 a may lower its own allocation by 10 A and grant that allocation to the IPM 110 b . The IPM 110 b can then raise its allocation by 10 A to a total of 60 A, thereby satisfying the power needs of the server computer racks 120 a and 120 b , and increase the utilization of the 100 A available from the substation 106 . Additional examples of intelligent power allocation are discussed in further detail in relation to FIGS. 2-9 .
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example intelligent power allocation process 200 .
- the process begins when an intelligent protection module (IPM) (e.g., the IPM 110 a of FIG. 1 ) receives a power allocation value 202 .
- IPM intelligent protection module
- the allocation value can be received from a source internal to the IPM.
- an allocation value can be received from a default startup value, an internally calculated value, a value determined from a lookup table, or other source of allocation values internal to the IPM.
- the allocation value is received from a source external to the IPM.
- the allocation value can be received from a user, from a database (e.g., the information management system 122 ), from other IPMs, or from other external sources of allocation values.
- the electrical current that passes through the IPM is measured 204 .
- the measured IPM current is compared to the maximum device rating of the IPM.
- the IPM may carry a maximum amperage rating that represents the number of amps that the IPM can carry before the IPM experiences physical damage.
- the IPM current is determined 206 to be greater than the present allocation, then the IPM current is interrupted 208 .
- interrupting the IPM current can prevent the IPM, or other devices or components connected to the IPM's circuit, from being damaged do to an over-current condition.
- a message can be sent to other IPMs or to an information management system to update them of the current interruption 208 .
- an upstream IPM can notify downstream IPMs of the current interruption 208 , and the downstream IPMs can respond by reducing their own allocations or interrupting their own currents to reduce the total current load that can be placed upon the upstream IPM to a level below the upstream IPM's maximum device rating.
- the information management system can be notified of the current interruption 208 , and the information management system can respond by alerting technicians to rectify the over-current condition, by automatically reducing the computing loads assigned to server computer racks (e.g., the computer server racks 114 a , 114 b , 120 a , and 120 b of FIG. 1 ) thereby reducing the racks' current draws, or by responding in other ways to rectify the conditions which caused the over-current to pass through the IPM.
- the current interruption 208 may be reversed. For example a technician can manually reset the IPM current protection components, or a message from the information management system or another IPM may signal the IPM to reset the current interruption 208 .
- the IPM current is determined 206 to be less than or equal to the present allocation, then the measured IPM current is compared to the IPM's allocation. If the IPM current is determined 210 to be greater than the IPM's allocation, then a capacity increase is negotiated 212 .
- the IPM can increase its own capacity by requesting and receiving additional electrical current allocations from other IPMs. An example process for negotiation of a capacity increase is discussed in the description of FIG. 4 .
- a determination 214 is made in response to the receipt of an allocation request from a peer. If no allocation request is determined 214 to have been received from a peer, then the process 200 measures 204 current passing through the IPM.
- a capacity reduction is negotiated 216 .
- the IPM can reduce its own capacity in response to a request from other IPMs. An example process for negotiation of a capacity reduction is discussed in the description of FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example capacity reduction negotiation process 300 .
- the process 300 may be the capacity negotiation process illustrated by step 216 of FIG. 2 .
- the process 300 begins when a capacity query message from a requesting IPM is received 302 .
- the IPM determines 304 its own status and excess capacity.
- status information can include electrical current measurements, device ratings, present allocation settings, load variability information, load trend information, and/or other information that can describe the status of an IPM.
- the requestor is then notified 306 of the status and available capacity.
- the requestor can use the notification 306 to determine if a request for capacity should be sent. This determination is discussed in the description of FIG. 4 .
- a request message for capacity is received 308 from the requesting IPM. If the requested capacity value is determined 310 to be unavailable to grant to the requestor, then the requestor is notified 312 of the capacity denial. Otherwise, if the requested capacity value is determined 310 to be available to grant to the requestor, then the IPM reduces 314 its own capacity by the requested capacity value in the capacity request message, and sends a message to notify 315 the requestor of the capacity grant.
- the IPM may have more excess capacity than is being requested, and the IPM may respond by reducing 314 its own allocation by the requested capacity value and notifying 316 the requestor that it may increase its allocation by the requested amount. In some examples, the IPM can have less excess capacity than is being requested, and the IPM can respond by reducing 314 its own allocation by an amount substantially equal to its excess capacity, and notifying 316 the requestor of the allocation that the IPM has granted.
- the IPM can make substantially its entire allocation available for other IPMs.
- the IPM can be allocated 50 A but if the current path has been interrupted the IPM passes zero amps, giving the IPM 50 A of excess capacity while the current is interrupted.
- the IPM can grant some or all of the excess capacity to other IPMs when requested to do so, thereby increasing the utilization of that available capacity.
- the IPM can negotiate an excess capacity before closing the breaker. For example, the IPM can be allocated 50 A but the IPM can request an additional 20 A. Once the 70 A excess capacity is reached, the IPM can close the breaker.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example capacity increase negotiation process 400 .
- the process 400 may be the capacity negotiation process illustrated by step 212 of FIG. 2 .
- the process 400 begins when an IPM sends a message 402 to request status and capacity data from one or more peer IPMs.
- the IPM receives 404 one or more status and capacity notifications from peer IPMs.
- status information can include electrical current measurements, device ratings, present allocation settings, time-temperature trip profile information, load variability information, load trend information, and/or other information that can describe the status of an IPM.
- the IPM determines 406 one or more capacity values to request from one or more peer IPMs and sends 408 requests for the determined capacity values to each peer IPM.
- the requesting IPM can determine 406 that a single peer IPM can allocate substantially all of the capacity needed by the requesting IPM. For example, the requesting IPM may need an additional 20 A of capacity, and a single peer IPM may have 25 A of excess capacity. The requesting IPM can request 408 substantially all of the needed additional 20 A from the single peer, leaving the peer with 5 A excess capacity.
- the requesting IPM can determine 406 that two or more peer IPMs can jointly allocate substantially all of the capacity needed by the requesting IPM. For example, the requesting IPM may need an additional 35 A of capacity. A first peer IPM may have 30 A of excess capacity, and a second peer IPM may be 25 A of excess capacity. The requesting IPM can determine to 406 request 408 20 A from the first peer IPM and 15 A from the second peer IPM. The requested 408 allocations can be combined to satisfy the requesting IPM's needed 35 A, and leave the peer IPMs with 10 A of remaining excess capacity each.
- the requesting IPM receives 410 capacity grant values from one or more peer IPMs.
- the requesting IPM determines 412 if the sum of the capacities granted from the peer IPMs is greater than or equal to a target allocation value (e.g., the difference between the allocated and measured currents used in step 210 of FIG. 2 ). If the sum of the granted capacities is greater than or equal to the target allocation value, then the requesting IPM increases 414 its own allocation by the sum of the granted capacity values.
- a target allocation value e.g., the difference between the allocated and measured currents used in step 210 of FIG. 2
- the requesting IPM can send 416 a message to update a database with the new allocation value.
- the requesting IPM can notify an upstream IPM of the updated allocation value.
- the requesting IPM can notify an information management system (e.g. the information management system 122 of FIG. 1 ) to store or update information about the requesting IPM's status.
- the sum of the granted capacities may be less that the current needed by the IPM.
- the requesting IPM may request 15 A from its peers, but only receive 410 capacity grant values totaling 10 A.
- the requesting IPM may receive 410 no capacity grant values.
- the IPM may receive no grants because the IPM has no peers, a communications link between the IPM and its peers may be unavailable, or none of the IPM's peers have excess capacity to grant.
- the IPM's sum of granted capacities can be considered to have the same effect as receiving 410 a grant value of 0 A.
- the requesting IPM sends 418 a capacity request message to an upstream IPM, and the requesting IPM receives 420 a capacity grant value from the upstream IPM.
- the requesting IPM sums the total of the capacity grant values received 410 from peer IPMs with the capacity grant value received 420 from the upstream IPM. If the total capacity is determined 422 to be greater than or equal to the additional current needed by the requesting IPM, then the IPM increases its own allocation 414 by the sum of the granted capacity values.
- the IPM interrupts 424 the current path.
- the requesting IPM may not receive a response from the upstream IPM.
- the requesting IPM may have no upstream IPM, or communications between the requesting and upstream IPMs may be interrupted.
- the lack of response from the upstream IPM can be considered to have the same effect as receiving 420 a grant value of 0 A.
- the requesting IPM can send a notification message when the current path is interrupted 424 .
- the requesting IPM can send a notification message to the information management system, to technicians (e.g., via a paging system, email), or to other personnel and/or systems to alert them to the current interruption 424 .
- the requesting IPM can make substantially all of its allocation available to other IPMs when the current path is interrupted 424 .
- the requesting IPM can be configured with an allocation of 50 A when the current is interrupted 424 .
- the interrupted 424 path can carry no current, therefore substantially all of the requesting IPM's 50 A allocation can be considered to be excess current, and the requesting IPM can offer substantially all of this excess current if/when requested (e.g., the request 308 of FIG. 3 ) by another IPM.
- the IPM can reduce its own allocation to more closely match a measured current draw.
- the IPM may be configured with an allocation of 40 A while the measured current flow is 10 A, resulting in 30 A of excess capacity.
- the IPM can reduce its own allocation to 10 A, 12 A, or another value that reduces the excess capacity while still satisfying the measured current draw.
- the IPM may be configured with an allocation of 40 A but has interrupted 424 the current path resulting in an excess current of 40 A.
- the IPM can reduce its own allocation to substantially zero amps to more closely match the zero measured current flow.
- the IPM can reduce its own allocation upon request from a user or a peer, or do so automatically on a timed interval (e.g., every minute, hourly, daily). In some implementations, the IPM can automatically reduce its own allocation in response to an excess current threshold. For example, when measured current drops, excess current goes up.
- the IPM can be configured to automatically reduce its own allocation to the measured amount or to a reduced value that is higher than the measured current (e.g., to leave a 5% excess capacity margin).
- a downstream IPM can notify an upstream IPM when the downstream IPM reduces its own capacity.
- the upstream IPM can be allocated 50 A to supply a first downstream IPM's 25 A draw and a second IPM's 25 A draw. If the first IPM reduces its allocation by 10 A, it may notify the upstream IPM of the reduction, in essence, giving the upstream IPM 10 A of excess capacity.
- the upstream IPM can retain some or all of the excess capacity. For example, by retaining excess capacity, the upstream IPM may be able to more quickly redistribute allocations among peer IPMs when requested to do so.
- the upstream IPM can detect excess capacity and request allocations from downstream IPMs so excess capacity is moved closer to the current source. For example, an upstream IPM can sense that it has 40 A of excess capacity (e.g., the downstream IPMs may not be drawing their allocated currents). The upstream IPM can request allocations from the downstream IPMs, and reduce its own allocation by and amount equal to or less than the sum of the granted allocations.
- the upstream IPMs can reduce their own allocations to migrate excess capacity closer to the current source.
- an IPM can reduce its own allocation, thereby allowing its parent IPM to reduce its own allocation, thereby allowing its grandparent IPM to reduce its own allocation, and so on.
- This reverse “trickle down” process can have the effect of pushing excess capacity closer to the current source and consolidating the excess capacity within IPMs that are closer to the top of an IPM hierarchy.
- by consolidating excess capacity closer to the current source excess capacity originating in one branch of the IPM hierarchy and be re-allocated more quickly to IPMs in another branch.
- FIG. 5 is depicts an example peer-to-peer interaction 500 among intelligent protection modules for the dynamic allocation of power capacity to power nodes.
- IPMs can negotiate distributions of power allocations in a peer-to-peer manner (e.g., without an information management system or central controller).
- a first peer IPM 502 needs to obtain additional power capacity allocations.
- the first peer IPM sends a capacity query 510 to a second peer IPM 504 , and sends a capacity query 512 to an Nth peer IPM 506 .
- the second peer IPM 504 and the Nth peer IPM 506 represent the first and last members of a collection of peer IPMs.
- the first peer IPM 502 can interact with any member of this collection in a manner substantially similar to the interactions it has with IPMs 504 and 506 .
- the second peer IPM 504 responds with a capacity offer 514 .
- the capacity offer can be some or all of the second IPM's 504 excess capacity.
- the Nth peer IPM 506 also responds with a capacity offer 516 that represents an amount of excess capacity that the Nth peer IPM has available for allocation to other IPMs.
- the first peer IPM 502 can interact with the peer IPMs 504 - 506 to obtain power allocation it needs by obtaining allocations from its peers. In some implementations, by obtaining allocations from peers, the total current allocation given to the peer IPMs 502 - 506 can remain substantially unchanged.
- the first peer IPM 502 also sends a capacity query 518 to an upstream IPM 508 .
- the first peer IPM 502 can request a power allocation from the upstream IPM 508 when the peer IPMs 504 - 506 do not have enough excess capacity to satisfy the first peer IPM's 502 requirements.
- the upstream IPM 508 responds be sending a capacity offer 520 of its own.
- the first peer IPM 502 uses the capacity offers 514 - 516 and 520 to determine 522 whether the new total current level exceeds total capacity.
- the total capacity can be the rated capacity of the first peer IPM.
- the total capacity can be the allocated and/or rated capacity of the upstream IPM 508 .
- the first peer IPM 502 can interrupt its current path to prevent an over-current condition.
- the first peer IPM 502 uses the capacity offer 514 - 516 and 520 to determine 524 which of the IPMs 504 - 508 to request capacity from. In the illustrated example, the first peer IPM 502 determines 524 to request capacity from the Nth IPM 506 and the upstream IPM 508 . The first peer IPM 502 sends a capacity request 526 to the Nth peer IPM 506 , and receives a capacity grant 528 for a portion of the needed capacity. The first peer IPM 502 then sends a capacity request 530 to the upstream IPM 508 for substantially the remainder of the needed capacity, and receives a capacity grant 532 .
- FIG. 6 is an example centralized interaction 600 of intelligent protection modules for the dynamic allocation of power capacity to power nodes.
- a database 610 can organize the distribution of power allocations among IPMs.
- a first IPM 602 needs to obtain additional power capacity allocations.
- the first IPM 602 sends a capacity request 612 to the database 610 .
- the database 610 may be the information management system 122 of FIG. 1 .
- the database 610 can query an internal table of current measurement and/or status information obtained from a second IPM 604 though an Nth IPM 606 , as well as an upstream IPM 608 which supplies power to the IPMs 602 - 606 .
- the database 610 determines 614 if the requested current level will exceed available capacity. For example, the capacity request 612 may be in excess of the upstream IPM's 608 device rating. The database 610 may deny the request 612 to prevent the upstream IPM 608 from an over-current condition.
- the database 610 determines 616 which IPMs to request capacity allocations from. In the illustrated example, the database 610 determines 616 that allocations from the Nth IPM 606 and the upstream IPM 608 can be combined to grant the capacity request 612 .
- the database 610 sends a capacity request 618 to the Nth IPM 606 , and the Nth IPM 606 responds with a capacity grant 620 .
- the database 610 then sends a capacity request 622 to the upstream IPM 608 .
- the upstream IPM 608 replies by sending a capacity grant 624 to the database 610 .
- capacity grants can cause the database 610 to update its records of IPM statuses. For example, receipt of the capacity grants 620 and 624 can trigger the database 610 to update its tables with the post-grant allocations of the IPM's 606 and 608 .
- the database 610 then sends a capacity grant 626 to the first IPM 602 , and the first IPM 602 responds by sending a status update 628 .
- the database 610 may use the status update 628 as a confirmation message that the capacity grant 626 was successfully received, and/or the database 610 may use the status update 628 to update its records of the first IPM's 602 status.
- a distribution system for the dynamic allocation of power capacity to power nodes can switch among the interactions 500 , 600 , and/or other power allocation negotiation processes.
- the system 100 can operate initially using the centralized interaction 600 , but if the information management system 122 becomes unavailable (e.g., server malfunction, network outage, server maintenance downtime), the system can switch over to the peer-to-peer interaction 500 for continuing operations.
- the information management system 122 becomes available again, the system 100 can revert back to the centralized interaction 600 .
- An example combination of peer-to-peer and centrally coordinated interactions is described in the illustration and description of FIG. 7 .
- FIG. 7 depicts a combination of centralized and peer-to-peer interactions 700 of intelligent protection modules for the dynamic allocation of power capacity to power nodes.
- initial requests for power allocations within a power distribution system may be directed to a database (e.g., the information management system 122 ) to determine which IPMs have excess capacity, and the requesting IPM can use that excess capacity information to directly query the IPMs that have capacity available for reallocation.
- the combined interactions 700 can provide the power distribution system with fault-tolerance against a centralized point of failure. For example, a failure of the database can cause the IPMs to interact in a peer-to-peer manner so allocation negotiation can continue until the failure is rectified.
- a first IPM 702 needs to obtain additional power capacity allocations.
- the first IPM 702 sends a capacity query 712 to a database 710 .
- the database 710 responds by sending capacity information 714 back to the first IPM 702 .
- the capacity information may include information about the excess capacities of some, all, or none of the first IPM's 702 peers.
- the capacity information 714 can include capacity information about every IPM connected to the first IPM (e.g., its parent IPM, child IPMs) as well as peer IPMs, such as a second IPM 704 through an Nth IPM 706 .
- the capacity information 714 can include information about only those IPMs that the database 710 has identified as having excess capacity that the first IPM 702 can request.
- the first IPM 702 sends a capacity query 716 to the second IPM 704 , and sends a capacity query 718 to the Nth IPM 706 .
- the second IPM responds with a capacity offer 720
- the Nth IPM 706 responds with a capacity offer 722 .
- the capacity offers may not satisfy the first IPM's requirements, so a capacity query 724 is sent to the upstream IPM 708 .
- the upstream IPM 708 responds by sending a capacity offer 726 .
- the first IPM 702 determines 728 whether the new current level exceeds a total capacity (e.g., the total available capacity, the device rating of the first IPM 702 , the device rating of the upstream IPM 708 ). In some implementations, if the new current level is determined 728 to exceed the total capacity, then the first IPM 702 can interrupt the current path.
- a total capacity e.g., the total available capacity, the device rating of the first IPM 702 , the device rating of the upstream IPM 708 .
- the first IPM 702 can use the capacity information to query only the IPMs 704 - 706 and 708 that have excess capacity available. In some implementations, the first IPM 702 may not receive the capacity information 714 (e.g., due to a communications failure or database outage), and respond by sending the capacity queries 716 - 720 and 724 to all the connected and peer IPMs 704 - 706 and 708 .
- the capacity information 714 e.g., due to a communications failure or database outage
- the first IPM 702 determines 730 which of the IPMs 704 - 706 and 708 to request capacity from. In the illustrated example, the first IPM 702 has determined that it will attempt to negotiate with the Nth IPM 706 and the upstream IPM 708 to obtain the additional capacity it needs. A capacity request 732 is sent to the Nth IPM, and a capacity grant 734 is returned. The Nth IPM 706 also sends a status update to the database 710 to notify the database 710 of the Nth IPM's 706 reduced allocation.
- a capacity request 738 is sent to the upstream IPM 708 , and a capacity grant 740 is returned.
- the upstream IPM 708 also sends a status update 742 to the database 710 to notify the database 710 that the upstream IPM 708 has changed its allocation.
- the first IPM 702 then sends the database 710 a status update 744 of its own to notify the database 710 of the first IPMs increased allocation.
- FIGS. 8A and 8B show an example power distribution system that dynamically allocates power due to changes in power load.
- FIG. 8A shows an example system 800 that receives power from a utility 805 .
- the utility 805 is capable of supplying 300 A to the system 800 .
- An over-current protection device 810 limits and distributes the power to an IPM 815 , an IPM 820 , and an IPM 825 .
- the IPM 815 provides over-current protection to an electrical load 830 (e.g., a rack of computing equipment).
- the IPM 820 protects an electrical load 835
- the child IPM 825 protects an electrical load 840 .
- the IPMs 815 - 825 each pass 80 A, are allocated 100 A, and have a device rating of 150 A apiece.
- the IPMs 815 - 825 are allocated a total of 300 A, and pass a total of 240 A to the electrical loads 830 - 840 .
- the over-current protection device 810 has a device rating of 300 A, which both satisfies the total amperage allocated to the IPMs 815 - 825 and limits the draw to the 300 A limit that the utility 805 can provide.
- the over-current protection device 810 passes the 240 A total drawn by the electrical loads 830 - 840 .
- FIG. 8B shows the system 800 with an additional electrical load 850 .
- the additional electrical load 850 is connected to the IPM 825 in parallel with the electrical load 840 , and draws an additional 50 A.
- the IPM 825 now needs to pass a total of 130 A to satisfy the current draw of the electrical loads 840 and 850 .
- the 130 A is in excess of the 100 A originally allocated to the IPM 825 in FIG. 1 , but is still below its own 150 A device rating.
- the IPM 825 negotiates with the IPMs 815 and 820 to obtain allocations of the IPMs' 815 and 820 excess capacity.
- the IPMs 815 and 820 reduce their own allocations by 18 A apiece, leaving 2 A of excess capacity remaining for each.
- the IPMs 815 - 825 can request excess capacity.
- the IPM 825 needed to obtain a total of 30 A from the IPMs 815 and 820 to satisfy the total 130 A draw of the electrical loads 840 and 850 . But instead, the IPM 825 requested and obtained a total of 36 A from the IPMs 815 and 820 .
- an IPM can request allocations of capacity to create a reserve of excess capacity. For example, by requesting 6 A more than the required 130 A draw, the IPM 825 can hold the 6 A as a buffer against current spikes that may exceed the 130 A draw and cause the IPM 825 to interrupt the circuit.
- the IPMs 815 - 825 can withhold excess capacity from being reallocated. As in the illustrated example, the IPMs 815 and 820 originally had 20 A of excess capacity each, but allocated 18 A each to the IPM 825 , leaving 2 A of excess capacity behind for each of the IPMs 815 - 820 . In some implementations, the IPMs 815 - 825 can withhold excess capacity to maintain a reserve of excess capacity. For example, by withholding 2 A while allocating capacity to the IPM 825 , the IPM 815 can maintain a margin of safety against current spikes that may come from the electrical load 830 .
- FIGS. 9A-9D show an example dynamic power allocation among a hierarchy 900 of power distribution nodes.
- allocation requests by lower-level IPMs in one branch of an IPM hierarchy system can be supplied by excess capacity in IPMs in another branch through a series of allocation negotiations among the nodes in a power distribution system.
- FIG. 9A shows the hierarchy 900 in an initial state.
- the hierarchy 900 includes a top-level IPM 910 that protects and distributes power to a mid-level IPM 920 and a mid-level IPM 930 .
- the mid-level IPM 920 protects and distributes power to a base-IPM 940 , a base-IPM 950 , and a base-IPM 960 .
- the mid-level IPM 930 protects and distributes power to a base IPM 970 and a base IPM 980 .
- Each of the IPMs 910 - 980 has a corresponding measured current and allocation.
- the top-level IPM 910 is passing 16 A out of a 22 A allocation.
- Each of the IPMs 910 - 930 distributes power to downstream IPMs, and is configured to allocate the power needed by downstream IPMs.
- the base-level IPMs 940 - 960 draw a total of 12 A
- the mid-level IPM 920 is passes the 12 A of an allocated 14 A.
- the mid-level IPMs 920 and 930 draw a combined total of 16 A through the top-level IPM 910 .
- FIG. 9B shows that the base-level IPM 940 is experiencing an electrical current draw of 8 A, which is 3 A over the base-level IPM's 940 present allocation.
- the base-level IPM 940 sends a message to the mid-level IPM 920 to request a 3 A allocation.
- FIG. 9C shows that the current passing through the mid-level IPM 920 has been pushed to 15 A, or 1 A over its present allocation.
- the mid-level IPM 920 responds by requesting a reallocation of power from its downstream, base-level IPM 960 which has 2 A of excess capacity.
- the mid-level IPM 920 also requests a 1 A allocation from the top-level IPM 910 .
- the mid-level IPM 920 can reallocate capacity allocations among the peer, base-level IPMs 940 - 960 before requesting an additional power allocation from the top-level IPM 910 .
- the mid-level IPM 920 can increase the utilization of current presently allocated to the mid-level IPM 920 , and reduce the amount of additional allocation that may be needed from the top-level IPM 910 .
- an upstream IPM can reallocate power among downstream IPMs to prevent an over-allocation of the upstream IPM.
- the top-level IPM 910 can receive its power from a source that has a maximum output of 22 A.
- the top-level IPM 910 can have its allocation set to match the 22 A maximum to prevent the IPMs 920 - 980 from drawing more current than the 22 A source can supply.
- the mid-level IPM 920 needs to increase its allocation to 15 A or higher. While the total current draw through the top-level IPM 910 is now 19 A, and below the 22 A allocation, the 15 A allocation needed by the mid-level IPM 920 combined with the 8 A allocation given to the mid-level IPM 930 will total a 23 A allocation, which is higher than the 22 A allocation of the top-level IPM.
- the top-level 910 prevents an over-allocation by requesting that the mid-level IPM 930 reduce its allocation by 1 A.
- the mid-level IPM 930 can query downstream IPMs (e.g., the IPMs 970 - 980 ) to recover excess downstream capacity.
- the mid-level IPM 930 can request a 1 A allocation from the base-level IPM 980 .
- the base-level IPM 980 can respond by reducing its own allocation, which can reduce the amount of current that is needed at the mid-level IPM 930 by a substantially similar amount.
- the theoretical draw on the top-level IPM 910 can be reduced from 23 A down to 22 A.
- FIG. 9D shows that the base-level IPM 980 and the mid-level IPM 930 have reduced their own allocations by 1 A, and have granted that 1 A to the top-level IPM 910 .
- the top-level IPM 910 re-allocates the 1 A to the mid-level IPM 920 , which allows the IPM 920 to raise its own allocation by 1 A to a 15 A total.
- the reallocated 1 A is combined with the 2 A granted by the base-level IPM 960 to create a 3 A allocation that is then granted to the base-level IPM 940 , allowing the base-level IPM to raise its allocation to 8 A.
- FIG. 10 shows a block diagram of an IPM 1000 .

- electrical conductors can be driven beyond their rated continuous capacities for short periods of time substantially without experiencing adverse effects (e.g., overheating of an electrical conductor, tripping the contacts of a circuit breaker).
- a circuit breaker can be rated to conduct 10 A of DC current continuously without tripping, but it may also be able to conduct 20 A for a tenth of a second, and/or 15 A for half a second.
- the higher the over-current the shorter the period of time that the over-current can be tolerated.
- the table 1100 of over-current tolerance values includes a collection of time and current pairs that can describe the over-current behavior of an IPM such as the IPM 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , or 118 b of FIG. 1 , or the IPM 1000 of FIG. 10 .
- the time and current pairs describe a range of a current values over which the IPM can conduct substantially continuously, a range of current values over which the IPM will interrupt current flow substantially immediately, and a range of increasing current and decreasing time values that describe the durations that the IPM can conduct over-currents before interrupting current flows.
- the table 1100 shows that in the range of currents from 0 A to 80 A the IPM is configured to operate substantially continuously (CONT), and to trip substantially immediately for amperages of 130 A or more.
- CONT substantially continuously
- the time and current value pairs describes the varying amounts of time that the IPM can tolerate over-currents before interrupting the current carrying circuit.
- the table 1100 shows that the IPM is configured to conduct 90 A for 0.95 seconds before tripping. The IPM is also configured to conduct 120 A for 0.4 seconds before tripping.
- the over-current tolerance values can be calculated by a mathematical formula or model.
- the over-current values between explicitly described values can be calculated from the explicitly described values.
- the chart 1110 shows that by interpolating the explicitly described time values for 120 A and 130 A, an over-current of 125 A can be tolerated for 0.2 seconds.
- a “best fit” curve can be calculated for the current and time pairs, and can be used to calculate the amount of time the IPM can conduct various amperages before interrupting the circuit.
- the IPM can be configured with an allocation that can be represented by collections of over-current tolerance values rather than a single point. For example, when the IPM discussed in FIG. 4 determines 406 one or more capacity values to request from one or more peer IPMs, the values can be a collection of time and current pairs such as those illustrated in the table 1100 .

- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a network, such as the described one.
- the relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- an IPM may request excess capacity allocation as it approaches full utilization of its present capacity allocation using a tiered request approach. For example, if the IPM capacity is from 85%-90%, a request may be sent with a low-priority code. Likewise, if an IPM capacity is from 90%-95%, a request may be sent with a medium-priority code. Similarly, if an IPM capacity is from 95%-100%, a request may be sent with a high-priority code. These codes may be used by other IPMs in the system or an information system to determine whether or not to grant a request.
