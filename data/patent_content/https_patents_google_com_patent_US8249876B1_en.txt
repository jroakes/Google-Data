Definitions
- the subject disclosure generally relates to voice search services, and, in particular, to improving the performance and usability of voice search.
- Voice search also called voice-enabled search
- Voice search allows the user to use a voice command to search the Internet, or a portable device.
- the user inputs a voice query and the system interprets the voice input by the user and provides the user with search suggestions according to the interpretation.
- the system may incorrectly interpret the voice input of the user. If the user's utterance is incorrectly understood by the system, the user's natural response is to just click the cursor within the search box and begin typing in the intended search criteria using text based search. It may be possible for the user to reenter their voice query, but this may require extra steps and users usually may be discouraged after trying the voice input option once and not receiving desired results.
- the disclosed subject matter relates to a computer-implemented method for providing alternative voice interpretations to a user, the method comprising receiving an indication of a request for a search from a user comprising a voice input of search criteria. The method further comprising determining an n-best list of a plurality of possible interpretations of the voice input in response to receiving the indication, each possible interpretation comprising a word or phrase corresponding to the voice input. The method further comprising providing a first possible interpretation of the plurality of possible interpretations for display to the user, wherein the first possible interpretation is the most likely interpretation of the.
- the method further comprising receiving an indication that the first possible interpretation does not correspond to the voice input search criteria and providing one or more alternative interpretations of the plurality of interpretations for display to the user within a suggestion display area in response to receiving the indication that the first possible interpretation does not correspond to the search criteria.
- the disclosed subject matter also relates to a system for providing alternative voice interpretations to a user, the system comprising one or more processors and a machine-readable medium comprising instructions stored therein, which when executed by the processors, cause the processors to perform operations comprising receiving a voice input from a user corresponding to search criteria.
- the operations comprising determining a plurality of possible interpretations of the voice input in response to receiving the indication, each possible interpretation comprising one or more words or phrases.
- the operations further comprising providing a first possible interpretation of the plurality of possible interpretations for display to the user, wherein the first possible interpretation is the most likely interpretation of the voice input.
- the operations further comprising receiving an indication that the first possible interpretation does not correspond to the voice input based on user activity and providing one or more alternative interpretations of the plurality of interpretations for display to the user within a suggestion display area in response to receiving the indication that the first possible interpretation does not correspond to the voice input.
- the disclosed subject matter also relates to a machine-readable medium comprising instructions stored therein, which when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform operations comprising receiving an indication of a request for a search from a user comprising a voice input.
- the operations further comprising identifying a plurality of possible interpretations of the voice input in response to receiving the indication, each possible interpretation comprising a word or phrase corresponding to the voice input, wherein each possible interpretation is associated with a likelihood of corresponding to the voice input.
- the operations further comprising selecting a first possible interpretation of the plurality of possible interpretations based on the likelihood associated with each of the plurality of possible interpretations, the first possible interpretation having the highest likelihood of the plurality of possible interpretations.
- the operations further comprising providing the first possible interpretation for display to the user within a search box display area configured to receive text entries of search criteria from a user.
- the operations further comprising receiving an indication of the user clicking within the search box display area and providing one or more alternative interpretations of the plurality of interpretations for display to the user within a suggestion display area in response to receiving the indication of the user clicking within the search box display area.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example client-server network environment, which provides for providing alternative interpretations of a voice input to a user.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process for providing search suggestions to a user performing a voice search.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a screen shot of an example user interface displayed to a user performing a voice search.
- FIG. 4 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented.
- Search by voice technology provides users with the ability to search by voice on a variety of electronic/digital devices, such as a mobile phone or PC.
- Voice search enabled devices and/or systems facilitate search for data upon the user entering information on what to search by speaking.
- the system interprets the voice input by the user and provides the user with search suggestions according to the interpretation (e.g., best hypothesis of what the user meant to say). If the utterance by the user is incorrectly understood by the system, the natural response of the user may be to just click the cursor within the search box and begin typing in the intended word or phrase and perform a text based search.
- the system may also allow the user to select a special button to receive other possible interpretations of the voice input uttered by the user if the interpretation is erroneous. However, after receiving an erroneous result, the user may be discouraged and unlikely to take the extra step to see if other interpretations are available and is more likely to attempt a text based search.
- the subject disclosure provides a method and system for providing alternative interpretations to a user performing a voice search in a way that is consistent with the user's natural response.
- the system interprets the voice input and presents the interpretation (e.g., phrase or word) with the highest confidence (e.g., the most likely interpretation) to the user within the search box.
- the system may also provide search phrase suggestions (e.g., auto-complete suggestions) within a suggestion box and/or search results based on the interpreted term or phrase for display to the user.
- the system may receive an indication that the provided interpretation does not correspond to the search criteria intended by the user. For example, the system determines that the user has clicked within the search box (e.g., as to modify or remove the word or phrase). In response, the system identifies an “n-best list” including one or more alternative interpretations of the voice input (e.g., a specific number of the best statistical guesses as words or phrases that the user may have uttered) and displays a selected number of alternative interpretations from the n-best list to the user within a “suggestion display area” (e.g., within the area usually displaying the search phrase suggestions for search items).
- a “suggestion display area” e.g., within the area usually displaying the search phrase suggestions for search items.
- the system may also display search phrase suggestions within the suggestion display area along with the n-best list.
- the search phrase suggestions may for example include, “Search for . . . ” (a search phrase causing a search for the word(s) or phrase(s) interpreted from the user voice input), “URL” (a URL matching the word(s) or phrase(s)), “Previous URLs” (a previous URL matching the word(s) or phrase(s)), “Nav Suggest” (A URL for searching the word(s) or phrase(s) using a default search provider), “Search Suggest” (suggested search terms corresponding to the word(s) or phrase(s) searched using the user's default search provider) and “History Results” (a number of entries in the user's history that match the word(s) or phrase(s)—selecting this item may take the user to the history results page for the word(s) or phrase(s)).
- the search phrase suggestions may be related to the next best word or phrase within the list of alternative interpretations (the word(s) or phrase(s) with the second highest confidence) since the refocusing suggests that the word or phrase with the highest confidence is not accurate.
- search phrase suggestions may be presented for multiple alternative interpretations (e.g., words or phrases) within the n-best list.
- the number of suggestions for each alternative interpretation within the n-best list may be based on the confidence score for each of the alternative interpretations (e.g., such that the highest alternative interpretation includes the highest number of suggestions and the number of suggestions for each alternative interpretation decreases down the list).
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example client-server network environment, which provides for providing alternative interpretations of a voice input to a user.

- the network 108 can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like.
- a user interacting with a client device may input a voice command including search criteria to perform a search for an item. For example, a user may select a special voice search button and may be prompted to input search criteria by speaking through a microphone or other voice input device at the user's client device (e.g., electronic devices 102 , 104 and 106 ).
- a data set including the voice input may be forwarded to the system and/or voice search service for interpretation and processing.
- the system e.g., through the voice search service
- identifies a listing of interpretations associated with the voice input e.g., an n-best list of possible interpretations).
- the system selects the best interpretation and provides the interpretation for display to the user within a search box at the user's client device.
- the system may further identify one or more search phrase suggestions.
- Search phrase suggestions consist of possible search queries corresponding to voice input search criteria received from the user.
- the search phrase suggestions may be provided for display to the user within a suggestion display area at the graphical user interface displayed at the client device of the user. If the interpretation is satisfactory, the user may receive search results according to the interpretation (e.g., based on the interpreted word(s) or phrase(s) or by selecting any of the search phrases presented to the user within the search suggestion box).
- the system assumes that the presented interpretation is not satisfactory and may select one or more alternative interpretations from an n-best list of search interpretations and present the alternative interpretations for example within the suggestion box which displayed the search phrase suggestions.
- the system may further provide one or more search phrase suggestions for each of the alternative interpretations being provided to the user.
- the user may select any of the suggestions (e.g., either an alternative interpretation or a search phrase suggestion).
- a search is performed (e.g., at the search engine or by the system) based on the selection of the user and search results corresponding to the selection are presented to the user.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process 200 for providing search suggestions to a user performing a voice search.
- the system receives an indication of search request form a user including a voice string corresponding to search criteria. For example, a user may select a special voice search button and may be prompted to input search criteria by speaking through a microphone or other voice input device at the user's client device (e.g., electronic devices 102 , 104 and 106 ).
- client device e.g., electronic devices 102 , 104 and 106 .
- the system determines a listing of n-best list of interpretations (i.e., word(s) or phrase(s)) matching the voice input.
- the voice input is analyzed (e.g., by the system or voice search service) and based on the result of the analyzing, a listing of the closest interpretations of the voice input is generated.
- Various methods and processes may be employed for interpreting the voice input and generating the n-best list of interpretations.
- the processes and systems described with respect to the present disclosure may be implemented in association with any system or process for interpreting the voice input and generating an n-best list of possible interpretations.
- the n-best list provides a list of likely possibilities returned by a voice recognizer (e.g., the voice search service).
- the n-best list of words or phrases may include various interpretations of the voice input and may further include a score or ranking of the interpretations such that the system is able to generate a sorted list of the n-best interpretations associated with the voice input received from the user.
- the ranking or score corresponds to the confidence or likelihood that the interpretation corresponds to the voice input.
- a first interpretation e.g., the most likely interpretation
- the n-best list may not be generated until later in the process (e.g., in step 206 ).
- the system provides the most likely interpretation (i.e., the most likely word or phrase corresponding to the user voice input) to the user in response to the search request and/or voice input by the user.
- the most likely interpretation is provided in text format for display within a “search box” displayed on the graphical user interface at the user client device.
- the search box may be a box used to enter text search criteria corresponding to a search request.
- the system may also provide a list of one or more suggested search phrases associated with the provided interpretation to the user.
- the search phrases may be displayed within a suggestion display area within the graphical user interface at the user's client device.
- the search phrase suggestions may for example include, “Search for . . . ” (a search phrase causing a search for the word(s) or phrase(s) interpreted from the user voice input), “URL” (a URL matching the word(s) or phrase(s)), “Previous URLs” (a previous URL matching the word(s) or phrase(s)), “Nav Suggest” (a URL for searching the word(s) or phrase(s) using a default search provider), “Search Suggest” (suggested search terms corresponding to the word(s) or phrase(s) searched using the user's default search provider) and “History Results” (one or more words or URLs in the user's history that match the word(s) or phrase(s)—selecting this item may take the user to the history results page for the word(s) or phrase(s)).
- the system determines whether the provided interpretation (e.g., the most likely interpretation) corresponds to the voice input provided by the user. For example, where the user clicks within the search box (e.g., within a predetermined window of time after the interpretation is provided for display to the user) such action may indicate that the user is seeking to edit the interpretation or enter a new text search criteria. In such instance, the system infers that the interpretation provided to the user in step 203 is not the correct interpretation of the user's voice input. Other user reactions such as user inactivity or clicking the voice search button again, may also trigger a similar determination of user dissatisfaction with the provided interpretation.
- the provided interpretation e.g., the most likely interpretation
- signals that may provide evidence that the user is satisfied with the provided interpretation may include a user selection of one of the search phrase suggestions displayed to the user or other selection indicating that the user wishes to view search results corresponding to the provided interpretation.
- step 204 the system determines that the provided interpretation corresponds to the user voice input, the process ends in step 205 .
- the user may be provided with search results based on the provided interpretation or one of the one or more search phrases presented to the user in association with the provided interpretation. Otherwise, when it is determined that the provided interpretation does not correspond to the voice input, for example when the user has indicated dissatisfaction with the provided interpretation, the process continues to the step 206 .
- the system provides one or more alternative interpretations (e.g., from the n-best list of interpretations determined in step 202 ) for display to the user.
- the alternative interpretations may include a listing of the next n interpretations most likely to correspond to the user's voice input (e.g., based on ranking or scores provided in association with each entry within the list of interpretations determined in step 202 ).
- the listing of alternative interpretations may be displayed within the suggestion display area usually displaying search phrase suggestions.
- the system generates the listing of one or more alternative interpretations (e.g., a specific number of the best statistical guesses as words or phrases that the user may have uttered) and displays the list to the user within a “suggestion display area” (e.g., within the area usually displaying the search phrase suggestions for search items).
- alternative interpretations e.g., a specific number of the best statistical guesses as words or phrases that the user may have uttered
- displays the list to the user within a “suggestion display area” e.g., within the area usually displaying the search phrase suggestions for search items.
- the system may also display search phrase suggestions within the suggestion display area along with the list.
- the search phrase suggestions may for example include, “Search for . . . ” (a search phrase causing a search for the word(s) or phrase(s) interpreted from the user voice input), “URL” (a URL matching the word(s) or phrase(s)), “Previous URLs” (a previous URL matching the word(s) or phrase(s)), “Nav Suggest” (a URL for searching the word(s) or phrase(s) using a default search provider), “Search Suggest” (suggested search terms corresponding to the word(s) or phrase(s) searched using the user's default search provider) and “History Results” (a number of entries in the user's history that match the word(s) or phrase(s)—selecting this item may take the user to the history results page for the word(s) or phrase(s)).
- the search phrase suggestions may be related to the word(s) or phrase(s) with the highest confidence (e.g., score or ranking) within the list of alternative interpretations since the refocusing suggests that the word or phrase with the highest confidence is not accurate.
- search phrase suggestions may be presented for multiple alternative interpretations (e.g., words or phrases) within the list.
- the number of suggestions for each alternative interpretation within the list may be based on the confidence score for each of the alternative interpretations (e.g., such that the highest alternative interpretation includes the highest number of suggestions and the number of suggestions for each alternative interpretation decreases down the list).
- FIG. 3 illustrates a screen shot of an example user interface displayed to a user performing a voice search.
- the most likely interpretation of voice input entered by the user may be displayed within the search box 301 .
- the system may then detect that the user has placed his/her cursor within the search box 301 , as illustrated.
- the phrase “Pies” is determined to be the most likely interpretation of a user voice input and is displayed within the search box 301 .
- the system determines a set of alternative interpretations and provides the alternative interpretations within the suggestion display area 302 .
- the suggestion display area 302 illustrates three alternative interpretations, “Prize”, “Spice” and “Flies”.
- the suggestion display area 302 further illustrates a set of search phrase suggestions for each of the alternative interpretations.
- Computer readable storage medium also referred to as computer readable medium.
- processing unit(s) e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units
- processing unit(s) e.g., one or more processors, cores of processors, or other processing units
- Examples of computer readable media include, but are not limited to, CD-ROMs, flash drives, RAM chips, hard drives, EPROMs, etc.
- the computer readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.
- the term “software” is meant to include firmware residing in read-only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage, which can be read into memory for processing by a processor.
- multiple software aspects of the subject disclosure can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject disclosure.
- multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs.
- any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject disclosure.
- the software programs when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
- a computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.
- a computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system.
- a program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code).
- a computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- FIG. 4 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented.
