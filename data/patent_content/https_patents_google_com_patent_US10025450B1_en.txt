The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/620,960, entitled “Generating Share Suggestions in a Social Network” filed on Apr. 5, 2012, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/663,347, entitled “Generating Activity Summaries” filed on Jun. 22, 2012, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/799,058, entitled “Generating Activity Summaries” filed on Mar. 15, 2013, which are all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
Social networks are becoming an increasingly popular way for people to stay connected. This increasing popularity of social networks has given rise to many social network services that have developed various ways users of the social network can communicate and share information. Users within a social network can send each other messages, monitor other users' activities on a daily basis and share personal information, including personal photographs and videos. Social networking services have provided a great forum for users to remain in close contact despite geographic distance or uncoordinated schedules. Further, the development of other online services that enable the general sharing of information has also increased. The ability for users to share information with others, and view information about others is available in many different venues.
Users of social networks also participate in many online activities, such as watching videos, posting pictures, posting notification of current user information or activity, or sharing location whereabouts. Within such venues of these social networks, users are able determine what information they chose to share and how and to whom that information is shared. Typically, the information may be shared on a social network portal of a user as the user decides to share the information, but the shared information is typically not organized in a meaningful way.
The present disclosure relates to social networks. In particular, the present disclosure relates to sharing content within social networks. Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to generating activity summaries in social networks.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that may include receiving user activity information. The user activity information may include activity information of a user's online activity. The method may further include categorizing the user activity information, generating an activity summary, wherein the activity summary includes the categorized user activity information, and sending the activity summary for display.
These and other implementations may provide one or more of the following features. The method may further include grouping the categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities. The method may also include determining the beginning of a grouping. The method may also include ranking the grouped user activity information according to relevance to the user and/or user's contacts. Further the method may include determining when the group is complete. The method may also include associating a verb identifier with a user activity and categorizing the user activity information according to the verb identifier. In some implementations, the activity summary includes more than one type of user activity. In some implementations, the method may include allowing the user to share the generating activity summary with other users.
These and other implementations may provide one or more of the following features. According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a computer program product comprises a non-transitory computer readable medium encoding instructions that, in response to execution by a computing device, cause the computing device to perform operations comprising receiving user activity information, categorizing the user activity information, generating an activity summary, wherein the activity summary includes the categorized user activity information and sending the activity summary for display. The user activity information includes activity information of a user's online activity.
These and other implementations may provide one or more of the following features. In some implementations, the instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform grouping categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities. In some implementations, the instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform ranking the grouped user activity information according to relevance to the user and/or user's contacts. The instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform determining when the group is complete. The instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform associating a verb identifier with a user activity and categorizing the user activity information according to the verb identifier. In some implementations, the instructions of the computer program product may further cause the computing device to further perform allowing the user to share the generating activity summary with other users. In some implementations the activity summary includes more than one type of user activity.
A system for generating activity summaries to users of a social network server is also disclosed. User activity information is received by a user activity information receiver module. The user activity information includes activity information of a user's online activity. The user activity information is then categorized by a categorization module, which in some implementations, also groups the categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information. In some implementations, the categorized user activity information is ranked according to relevance to the user by the ranking module or according to relevance to the user's contacts by the categorization module. An output generation module determines when the groupings are complete. Activity summaries are then generated by the output generation module. The activity summary includes the categorized user activity information. The activity summary is sent for display on a user device of a user.
These and other implementations may provide one or more of the following features. In some implementations, the categorization module further associates a verb identifier with a user activity, and categorizes the user activity information according to the verb identifier. In some implementations, the activity summary generation module allows the user to share the generating activity summary with other users.
These and other implementations may provide one or more of the following advantages. Activity summaries may be generated that summarize a user's online activity. In some implementations, activity summaries may be generated that summarize the user's real-world activity. In some implementations, a mobile application is implemented on a mobile device that is carried by the user, and that application has access to the phone's location, then activity can be directly inferred. These summaries may organize the user's online activity and group them into interesting stories that convey the user's online experiences, which may be helpful in conveying interesting life experiences.
The implementations are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.
A system and method for generating activity summaries is described. An activity summary may be a grouping of user activity information and content that represents the user's online activity. Users perform activity online. Examples of such activity include interacting with content, e.g., watching videos, posting pictures, posting notification of current user information or activity, sharing location whereabouts, or other activity performed online. This activity can be categorized and grouped according to commonality. For example, videos a user watched can be grouped together. As another example, the activity associated with a particular trip the user has taken (pictures taken on the trip, locations identified, or restaurants visited during the trip) may be grouped together. A suggestion to share this grouped activity information is created. This beneficially allows a user to display certain activity information in a way that is more interesting for the user's contacts to view.
In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the implementations. It will be apparent, however, that the implementations can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the implementations. For example, the present disclosure is described in one implementation below with reference to user interfaces and particular hardware. However, the present disclosure applies to any type of computing device that can receive data and commands, and any peripheral devices providing services.
Reference in the specification to “one implementation” or “an implementation” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the implementation is included in at least one implementation. The appearances of the phrase “in one implementation” in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same implementation.
Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers or the like.
It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as “processing” or “computing” or “calculating” or “determining” or “displaying” or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
Some implementations also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, flash memories including USB keys with non-volatile memory or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, each coupled to a computer system bus.
Furthermore, implementations can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.
The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk-read/write (CD-R/W) and DVD.
A data processing system suitable for storing and/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.
Input/output or I/O devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I/O controllers.
Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.
Finally, the algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general-purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present implementations are not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the implementations as described herein.
The illustrated implementations of a system 100 includes user devices 115 a, 115 b that are accessed by users 125 a, 125 b, a social network server 101 that is coupled to data storage 110 and an application server 107. In the illustrated implementation, these entities are communicatively coupled via a network 105. The user devices 115 a, 115 b, 115 n in FIG. 1 are used by way of example. While FIG. 1 illustrates three devices, the present disclosure applies to any system architecture having one or more user devices. Furthermore, while only one network 105 is coupled to the user devices, 115 a, 115 b, 115 n the social network server 101 and the application server 107, in practice any number of networks 105 can be connected to the entities.
Although only one social network server 101 is shown, it will be recognized that multiple servers may be present. A social network is any type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature. Examples include, but are not limited to, blogs, microblogs and Internet forums. The common feature includes friendship, family, a common interest, etc.
The network server 101 may be coupled to the network 105 via signal line 104. The social network server 101 also includes a social network module 209 (as will be shown in FIG. 2 ). Although only one social network server 101 is shown, persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that multiple servers may be present. A social network is any type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature. The common feature includes relationships/connections, e.g., friendship, family, work, an interest, etc. The common features are provided by one or more social networking systems, such as those included in the system 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form a social graph. In some examples, a social graph can reflect a mapping of these users and how they are related. Furthermore, it should be understood that social network server 101 and social network module 209 (FIG. 2 ) are representative of one social network and that there may be multiple social networks (not shown) coupled to the network 105, each having its own server, application and social graph (not shown). For example, a first social network may be more directed to business networking, a second more directed to or centered on academics, a third is more directed to local business, a fourth directed to dating and others of general interest or a specific focus.
As shown in FIG. 1 , social network server 101, may include, among various other modules, an activity summary generation module 220 a. More details describing the features and functionalities of these modules will be discussed further below in the detailed description of FIGS. 2 and 3 .

In another implementation, the entities can use custom and/or dedicated data communications technologies instead of, or in addition to, the ones described above. Depending upon the implementation, the network 105 can also include links to other networks.
In one implementation, the network 105 is a partially public or a wholly public network such as the Internet. The network 105 can also be a private network or include one or more distinct or logical private networks (e.g., virtual private networks, Wide Area Networks (“WAN”) and/or Local Area Networks (“LAN”)). Additionally, the communication links to and from the network 105 can be wireline or wireless (i.e., terrestrial—or satellite-based transceivers). In one implementation, the network 105 is an IP-based wide or metropolitan area network.
In the illustrated implementation, the user device 115 a is coupled to the network 105 via signal line 108. The user 125 a can interact with the user device. The user device 115 b is coupled to the network via signal line 112. The user 125 b is can interact with the user device 115 b as illustrated by signal line 114. The application server 107 is communicatively coupled to the network 105 via signal line 106. The social network server 101 is communicatively coupled to the network 105 via signal line 104. The social network server 101 is also communicatively coupled to data storage 110 via signal line 102.
A user device 115 a, 115 b, or 115 n may be an electronic computing device having a web browser for interacting with the social network server 101 via the network 105 and is used by user 125 a, 125 b, 125 n to access information in the system 100. The user device 115 a, 115 b, 115 n can be a computing device, for example, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile email device, a portable game player, a portable music player, a television with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, or any other electronic device capable of accessing a network. A server can also be a computing device.
The processor 206 may be any general-purpose processor. The processor 206 comprises an arithmetic logic unit, a microprocessor, a general purpose controller or some other processor array to perform computations, provide electronic display signals to display 218. The processor 206 is coupled to the bus 204 for communication with the other components of the user device 115 a/115 b. Processor 206 processes data signals and may comprise various computing architectures including a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, or an architecture implementing a combination of instruction sets. Although only a single processor is shown in FIG. 2 , multiple processors may be included. The user device 115 a/115 b also includes an operating system executable by the processor such as but not limited to WINDOWS®, MacOS X, Android, or UNIX® based operating systems.
The memory 208 holds instructions and data used by the processor 206. The instructions and/or data comprise code for performing any and/or all of the techniques described herein. The memory 208 may be a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, a static random access memory (SRAM) device, flash memory or some other memory device known in the art. In one implementation, the memory 208 also includes a non-volatile memory such as a hard disk drive or flash drive for storing log information on a more permanent basis. The memory 208 is coupled by the bus 204 for communication with the other components of the user device 115 a/115 b.
The storage device 214 is any device capable of holding data, like a hard drive, compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), DVD, or a solid-state memory device. The storage device 214 is a non-volatile memory device or similar permanent storage device and media. The storage device 214 stores data and instructions for processor 206 and comprises one or more devices including a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM device, a DVD-ROM device, a DVD-RAM device, a DVD-RW device, a flash memory device, or some other mass storage device known in the art.
The input device 212 may be a mouse, track ball, or other type of pointing device, and is used in combination with another input device 212, such as a keyboard to input data into the social network server 101. The graphics adapter 210 displays images and other information on the display 218. The display 218 is a conventional type such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) or any other similarly equipped display device, screen, or monitor. The display 218 represents any device equipped to display electronic images and data as described herein. The network adapter 202 couples the social network server 101 to a local or wide area network.
In one implementation, the social network module 209 is software and/or routines executable by a processor to control the interaction between the social network server 101, storage device 214 and the user devices 115 a, 115 b, 115 n. An implementation of the social network module 209 allows users 125 a, 125 b, 125 n of user devices 115 a, 115 b, 115 n to perform social functions between other users 125 a, 125 b, 125 n of user devices 115 a, 115 b, 115 n within the system 100. In some implementations, the social network module 209 may provide the user with an option to opt-in or opt-out of requesting the user activity data from the application server 107 or application service 109.
The activity summary generation module 220 is software and/or routines that, when executed by a processor, generate an activity summary to a user within the system 100. An activity summary may be a grouping of user activity information and content that represents the user's online activity. In some implementations, the activity summary is based on the user's activity online. More details describing the functionality and components of the activity summary generation module 220 will be described below in the description for FIG. 3 .
The social network server 101 can have different and/or other components than those shown in FIG. 2 . As is known in the art, the social network server 101 is adapted to execute computer program modules for providing functionality described herein. As used herein, the term “module” encompasses it plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to computer program logic utilized to provide the specified functionality. Thus, a module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software. In one implementation, program modules are stored on the storage device 214, loaded into the memory 208, and executed by the processor 206.
Implementations of the entities described herein can include other and/or different modules than the ones described here. In addition, the functionality attributed to the modules can be performed by other or different modules in other implementations. Moreover, this description occasionally omits the term “module” for purposes of clarity and convenience.
The activity summary generation module 220 may be configured to communicate with user devices 115 to receive input from the user devices 115, application servers 107 and/or application services 109. The activity summary module 220 may be configured to communicate with the user devices 115 to send activity summaries for display on the user devices 115. The input received from the user devices 115, application servers 107 and/or application services 109 may include user activity information, which may be activity that the user has performed online. The user activity information may be information associated with audio (for example, songs) that that user 125 has listened to, pictures that the user has uploaded to the social network server 101, videos that the user has watched, text posts that the user has input into the social network server 101, and other information associated with the activity of the user 125. In some implementations, the activity summary generation module 220 is also configured to communicate with storage device 214 and the data store 110 to send user activity information for storage and retrieval. In some implementations, the activity summary generation module 220 is also configured to communicate with the application server 107 to receive user activity on third party applications.
The user activity information receiver module 302 of the activity summary generation module 220 is software and/or routines for receiving a user activity information from a user device 115 and user activity information stored on storage device 214 or data storage 110. The user activity information receiver module 302 also receives user activity information from application servers 107 and application services 109. The user activity information may be any information associated with the activity of the user when the user is interacting with the application server 107 or application services 109. The user activity information may be information associated with audio (for example, songs) that that user 125 has listened to, pictures that the user has uploaded to the social network server 101, videos that the user has watched, text posts that the user has input into the social network server 101, and other information associated with the activity of the user 125. Additionally, user activity information may be information received from the application server 107 or application service 109 related to user activity on the application server 107 or application service 109. For example, if the application server 107 hosts a website that allows users to listen to music or watch videos, the user activity information regarding songs listened to or videos watch on the application server 107 may be sent to and received by the user activity information receiver module 302 of the activity summary generation module 220.
The request received from the user devices 115 may be a request to view information of a user 125. The request received by the user activity information receiver module 302 may include information identifying the user. The request receiver module is configured to communicate with the association module 304 and sends the information associated with the user 125 to the association module 304.
The categorization module 304 of the activity summary generation module 220 is software and/or routines for categorizing the received user activity information. The user activity information may be categorized or indexed according to various categories or criteria. The user activity information may be categorized according to a user identifier, a verb identifier associated with the user activity, a target associated with the user activity and a source. For example, a user identifier can be anonymized identifier that uniquely identified a particular user 125 of the system 100. The verb identifier associated with the user activity may be predefined according to the particular user activity. In some implementations, if a particular website or a particular application service 109 or application server 107 provides the user with the ability to perform more than one activity on that website, service or server, there may be more than one verb identifier associated with that website, service or server, and each verb identifier may be associated with a certain user activity. For example, if the user activity occurs on a website that hosts videos for viewing, a verb identifier associated with that website and activity may be “watch” or “watched” and the corresponding activity of watching videos that occurs on that website would be associated with “watched.” To extend the example, if the website also allows a user to listen to music, the verb associated with that corresponding activity of listening to songs other audio files may be “listen” or “listened.” In this example, the website may be associated with various user activities and therefore various corresponding verb identifiers. The target associated with the user activity identifies an item (such as a video in the previous example) that was a target of the user's activity. The target may include a title and a Uniform Resource Locator (ULR) where the target can be found.
The user activity information from multiple servers 107 may have the same associated verb. Similarly, user activity information from multiple application services 109 may have the same associated verb. For example, there may be multiple application servers 107 that allows users to listen to music. For the user activity associated with these application servers 107 the activity would be categorized using the same verb and therefore the activity would be categorized together, for example, under the verb “listened.” The categorization module 304 may also group the categorized user activity. For example, the categorization module 304 may aggregate the categorized based on the type of activity.
The categorization module 304 may also group the categorized user activity based on other criteria and these categorized groups may include different types of user activity or content. The categorization module 304 may also group the user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information. By grouping the user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information, the categorization module 304 helps to organize the user activity or online activity into interesting stories or comprehensive summaries of these activities. This categorized and organized user activity represents online experiences and may be helpful in conveying the user's life experiences when the experiences relate to a common theme. The categorization module 304 may group the user activity information based on relatedness (similar topic, similar content, etc.) of the user activity. Commonalities may include a location common to the user activity. Commonalities may also include an interest or topic common to the user activity. Groups of user activity created by the categorization module may therefore include different types of user activity. For example, the categorization module 304 may categorize and group together the user activity that the user performed online while the user was in Japan. Such example categorized and grouped user activity, which eventually becomes output or displayed as the activity summary, may include activity and content such as the pictures the user posted of the user's trip to Japan, the places that the user visited while in Japan, and the items the user purchased online while the user was in Japan.
Further, the grouping and categorization performed by the categorization module may be based on session determination and whether the user activity falls within a particular session. The categorization module 304 may also determine sessions of user activity. The categorization module 304 may determine sessions of user activity based on time the user activity was performed. The time may be based on a certain time frame, for example, every six hours, or based on certain times of the day, for example, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The categorization module 304 may determine sessions of user activity based on when the user signs off and/or signs in. The sign-on or sign-in may be associated with activity on the application server 107 or application service 109. The session may also be based on other factors, e.g., relatedness of the user activities. For example, relatively continuous user activities that are related to a particular topic or particular type of content can indicate a session.
The ranking module 306 of the activity summary generation module 220 may be software and/or routines for ranking the categorized user activity information. The categorized user activity information may be ranked 406 according to relevance to the user by the ranking module 306. The categorized user activity information may be ranked 406 according to relevance to the user's contacts by the ranking module 306.
The output generation module 308 of the activity summary generation module 220 is software and/or routines for generating the activity summaries based on the categorized user activity information. The output generation module 308 receives information from the categorization module 304 and the ranking module 306 and generates activity summaries based on the categorized user activity information. In some implementations, the user may share the generated activity summary with other users, for example, by posting the activity summary on the user's social network portal. The post may be a public post where other users can view the activity summary. The post may also be a private post where selected users may view the activity summary
Referring now to FIG. 4 , an example method 400 for generating activity summaries to a user 125 of the system 100 will be described. In some implementations, the method 400 is performed by the components of the social network server 101, and specifically, by the components of the activity summary generation module 220. In one implementation, the method 400 begins when user activity information is received 402 by the user activity information receiver module 302. The user activity information is then categorized 404 by the categorization module 304. In some implementations, the categorized user activity information is ranked 406 according to relevance to the user by the ranking module 306. In some implementations, the categorized user activity information is ranked 406 according to relevance to the user's contacts by the ranking module 306. Activity summaries are then generated 408 by the output generation module 308 of the activity summary generation module 220. The activity summary includes the categorized user activity information. The activity summary is sent 410 for display on a user device 115 of a user 125. In some implementations, the user may share the generated activity summary with other users, for example, by posting the activity summary on the user's social network portal. The post may be a public post where other users can view the activity summary. The post may also be a private post where selected users may view the activity summary.
Referring now to FIG. 5 , another example method 500 for generating activity summaries to a user 125 of the system 100 will be described. In some implementations, the method 500 is performed by the components of the social network server 101, and specifically, by the components of the activity summary generation module 220. In one implementation, the method 500 begins when user activity information is received 502 by the user activity information receiver module 302. The user activity information may be information associated with audio (for example, songs) that that user 125 has listened to, pictures that the user has uploaded to the social network server 101, videos that the user has watched, text posts that the user has input into the social network server 101, and other information associated with the activity of the user 125. Additionally, user activity information may be information received from the application server 107 or application service 109 related to user activity on the application server 107 or application service 109. In some implementations, the user activity information may also be photos that the user has taken and location information associated with those photos. In some implementations, the activity information may also include the user's location information (or location information of the user's device), the user's calendar information, or information related to events that the user will be attending or has attended, or other information related to the user's online activity. For example, if the application server 107 hosts a website that allows users to listen to music or watch videos, the user activity information regarding songs listened to or videos watch on the application server 107 may be sent to and received by the user activity information receiver module 302 of the activity summary generation module 220. In one implementation, a user's search history may also serve as a source for activity information.
The user activity information is then categorized 504 by the categorization module 304. In some implementations, the user activity information may be categorized according to a user identifier, a verb identifier associated with the user activity, a target associated with the user activity and a source. For example, a user identifier can be anonymized identifier that uniquely identified a particular user 125 of the system 100. The verb identifier associated with the user activity may be predefined according to the particular user activity. In some implementations, if a particular website or a particular application service 109 or application server 107 provides the user with the ability to perform more than one activity on that website, service or server, there may be more than one verb identifier associated with that website, service or server, and each verb identifier may be associated with a certain user activity. For example, if the user activity occurs on a website that hosts videos for viewing, a verb identifier associated with that website and activity may be “watch” or “watched” and the corresponding activity of watching videos that occurs on that website would be associated with “watched.” In some implementations, the user activity information may also be categorized according to
The categorization module 304 also groups 506 the categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information. By grouping the user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information, the categorization module 304 helps to organize the user activity or online activity into interesting stories or comprehensive summaries of these activities. This categorized and organized user activity represents online experiences and may be helpful in conveying the user's life experiences when the experiences relate to a common theme. The categorization module 304 may group the The user activity information may be grouped 506 based on relatedness (similar topic, similar content, etc.) of the user activity. Commonalities may include a location common to the user activity. Commonalities may also include an interest or topic common to the user activity. Groups of user activity created by the categorization module may therefore include different types of user activity. For example, the categorization module 304 may categorize and group together the user activity may be categorized 504 and grouped 506 together according to activity that the user performed online while the user was in Japan. Such In this example, categorized and grouped user activity, which eventually becomes output or displayed as the activity summary, may include activity and content such as the pictures the user posted of the user's trip to Japan, the places that the user visited while in Japan, and the items the user purchased online while the user was in Japan.
In some implementations, the categorization module 304 also groups 506 the categorized user activity information in accordance with commonalities identified among the user activity information to determine the beginning of a specific group in order to create a story from that grouping. In one implementation, a change in a user's location signals the beginning of a story. In one implementation, new photos signal the beginning of a story.
In some implementations, the categorized user activity information is ranked 508 according to relevance to the user by the ranking module 306. In some implementations, the categorized user activity information is ranked 508 according to relevance to the user's contacts by the ranking module 306.
The output generation module 308 determines 510 when the groupings are complete. Certain signals or activity information are monitored and analyzed to determine the completion of a grouping or ending of a story. Specifically, certain signals such as photos, location, calendar, events and other user's information (which is linked to the first user) serve as sources for activity information and indications of the completion of a grouping or ending of a story. In one implementation, a user's search history may also serve as a source for activity information. In one implementation, a change in a user's location signals the ending of a story. In one implementation, a time limit may signal the ending of a story.
Activity summaries are then generated 512 by the output generation module 308 of the activity summary generation module 220. In some implementations, a notification that activity information is being collected and categorized is generated. In such implementations, such notifications may include a notification that a story is being created. In other implementations, a notification of the completed version activity summary is generated. The activity summary includes the categorized user activity information. The activity summary or notification is sent 514 for display on a user device 115 of a user 125. In some implementations, the user may share the generated activity summary with other users, for example, by posting the activity summary on the user's social network portal. The post may be a public post where other users can view the activity summary. The post may also be a private post where selected users may view the activity summary.
As illustrated in this representation, user activity is organized and grouped by type of activity (verb) and displayed accordingly. In this example, the activity summaries 606 a, 606 b, 606 c also include checkbox 612 that may be used to allow the sharing or display of the information in the activity summary 606 a, 606 b, 606 c to other users. In other examples, another equivalent mechanism may provide this capability.
As illustrated in this representation, in activity summary 706 c, user activity is organized and grouped by relatedness or commonality and displayed accordingly. In this example, activity summary 706 c includes graphic representations 708 b and 708 c of different types of user activity that are related by a certain topic. The activity summaries 706 a, 706 b, 706 c also include checkbox 712 that may be used to allow the sharing or display of the information in the activity summary 706 a, 706 b, 706 c to other users. In other examples, another equivalent mechanism may provide this capability.
