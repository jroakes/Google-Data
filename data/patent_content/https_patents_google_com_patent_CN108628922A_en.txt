Body broadcast or flow of event, can export the user just in experience events may want during event one scanned for or
Multiple particular search queries.
SSS modules 166 can be enhanced or changed based on the supplemental information about particular event of the acquisition of SSS modules 166
Search inquiry.Supplemental information may include topic associated with event or keyword (for example, coming from language associated with event
Adopted text can be visited about the metamessage of event, the knowledge graph of event, online encyclopedia and RSS 160 and SSS modules 166
Other data asked).SSS modules 166 can identify topic associated with event or keyword, and use the identification
The text of topic or keyword generates search inquiry related with event.For example, if event is certain movie, SSS
Module 166 can be referred to as search inquiry using the name of film using search module 164 and execute search, be drilled to identify
Member, age, school, background and other topics related with the certain movie.SSS modules 166 can use be obtained about thing
The supplemental information of part reduces search inquiry (for example, by creating specified following search inquiry：Use the film of its name
The specific name of performer, the period in residing age, the position of setting and other topics related with event), rather than create
Build general search inquiry (for example, specifying the search inquiry of " performer " in general sense).
SSS modules 166 can inquire to create search inquiry based on determined by the rule by model, and reduce or carry
Refining inquiry related with the topic of event.Search inquiry can be stored in the memory of SSS modules 166 by SSS, and be utilized
The identifier of event marks stored search inquiry.In future, if SSS modules 166 determine the user of computing device 110
Just in experience events, then SSS modules 166 can retrieve stored inquiry, make search module 164 search for the search inquiry with
Obtain auxiliary information about event, and by auxiliary information be sent to computing device 110 in user just in experience events
Shi Jinhang is presented.
SSS modules 166 can be directed to each in multiple search inquiries of the subsequent searches during being determined for event
It is a come scheduling events during for searching for corresponding time or the subevent of corresponding search inquiry.As used herein " when corresponding
Between " can refer to sequential subevent (for example, timestamp, chapters and sections, some time in one day or some other times subevent) or
Non-sequential subevent is (for example, the generation with the relevant thing for being not necessarily limited to any specific time of event, the hair such as acted
Raw, specific subject appearance etc.).
Which subevent SSS modules 166 and its model can create specified response in which inquiry searched for
Rule.For example, the model of SSS modules 166, which may rely on, indicates following rules：It is sent out during the time of having a rest of sports tournament
The popular search inquiry for being sent to search module 164 is the search of the score for other matches that the time occurs.In Liang Ge teams
