- the applications can include, for example, gaming applications, electronic mail applications, text messaging applications, social media applications, music and video applications, and similar such applications.
- the applications can include associated intents that the respective applications are able to resolve. For example, when a user launches an intent on the device, the device attempts to find an application that is able to fulfill the intent.
- inventions described in this specification may be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving first user input, the first user input indicating a first intent; searching applications installed on the computing device based on the first intent; determining that none of the installed applications are capable of fulfilling the first intent; transmitting a request to a server system, the request requesting applications capable of fulfilling the first intent; receiving a list of one or more applications, each of the one or more applications being capable of fulfilling the first intent; downloading and installing a first application of the one or more applications; launching the first application; and fulfilling the first intent using the first application.
- one or more of the embodiments can further include receiving second user input, transmitting the request occurring in response to receiving the second user input; receiving second user input, downloading and installing the first application occurring in response to receiving the second user input; displaying the list of one or more applications on a display; searching applications installed on the computing device comprises comparing metadata associated with each application to the first intent; the metadata comprises a list of one or more intents that a respective application is able to fulfill; the first intent comprises an action field, a data field and a category field and searching comprises searching metadata of the installed applications in view of the action field, the data field and the category field; the request conveys an action field, a data field and a category field of the first intent; receiving second user input, the second user input indicating a second intent, searching the applications installed on the computing device based on the second intent, and determining that one or more of the installed applications are capable of fulfilling the second intent; receiving third user input, the third user input specifying a second

- FIG. 2 depicts a block diagram of a system that includes example components for fulfilling intents.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for fulfilling intents.
- an intent is a description of an operation to be performed or a description of an operation that has happened.
- a user can initiate an intent and associated action that is to be performed by a computing device (e.g., a mobile device). Initially, the computing device can search for locally stored applications that are able to fulfill the intent. However, when the computing device does not have a stored application that can resolve the intent (or a differing application is desired to fulfill the intent), the computing device can extend the search to other applications not stored on the computing device (e.g., applications available from a server system). In some examples, the computing device can issue a request to a search service.
- the search service can process the request to identify one or more applications that can be used to fulfill the intent.
- the computing device can download and install one or more of the applications (e.g., from the server system) and can execute the application(s) to resolve the intent.
- the computing device can access the one or more applications through a connected network (“cloud-enabled applications”).
- an email address can be displayed as a selectable object to a user of a computing device, and the user desires to send an email to the displayed email address.
- the user can select the displayed email address indicating the user's intent to compose and send an email to the displayed address.
- the computing device can search for locally stored applications that are able to resolve the intent of sending an email (e.g., an email application). If the mobile device includes an installed email application that can resolve the intent, the application can be instantiated and the user can compose an email. However, if the mobile device does not have such a locally stored application, the mobile device can issue a search request to a search service.
- the search service can receive the request and can identify one or more email applications that are available for the mobile device and that are operable to resolve the intent.
- the user can download and install applications (such as an email application) that are able to resolve the intent from a server system.
- the mobile device can execute the email application such that the email application fulfills the intent of sending the email.

Abstract
Description
-
- 1. An intent that contains neither a URI nor a data (MIME) type passes the data test only if the filter likewise does not specify any URIs or data types.
- 2. An intent that contains a URI but no data type (and a type cannot be inferred from the URI) passes the data test only if its URI matches a URI in the data field of the filter and the data field of the filter likewise does not specify a type.
- 3. An intent that contains a data type but does not contain a URI passes the data test only if the data field of the filter lists the same data type and similarly does not specify a URI.
- 4. An intent that contains both a URI and a data type (or a data type can be inferred from the URI) passes the data test only if its type matches a type listed in the data field of the filter. It passes the URI part of the data test either if its URI matches a URI in the filter or if it has a “content:” or “file:” URI and the data field of the filter does not specify a URI. In other words, an application is presumed to support “content:” and “file:” data if its data field of the filter lists only a data type.
