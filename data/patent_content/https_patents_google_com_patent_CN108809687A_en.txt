The only one online user interaction being such as attributable in online user's interaction of conversion is selected to be based only upon timestamp.Attribution takes
Be engaged in device can only attribution in time closest to the timestamp of conversion occur event.
Attribution server can send confirmation or the refusal to attribution to the first coordination service device and the second coordination service device.Example
Such as, if attribution server determines that the online events or activities that the first coordination service device executes should receive attribution, attribution service
Device can send the notice of attribution to coordination service device and send the notice of non-attribution to the second coordination service device.In this regard,
Two coordination service devices can more accurately update the data metric that they store and/or are presented to the user.First coordination service device
(or maintenance) user associated with coordination service device can be determined in response to receiving attribution notice from attribution server
Interaction is attributable to convert.However, the second coordination service device can be determined and the second coordination service device based on the instruction of no attribution
Associated user's interaction should not be regarded as causing to convert.

It is associated for the server of content item) and receive together with content item online user's activity.However, the two coordination service devices
It can be different and can be operated by different entities.If content provider uses the first coordination service device and second
Coordination service device provides a user content and receives User Activity, then when convert occur when, two coordination service devices can be
Customer incident activity associated with its content network is attributed to conversion.The method 400 that is described below and described herein
Other methods can by determine which activity should be attributed to conversion and which activity should not be attributed to conversion by duplicate removal
Attribution.
Method 400 is so that user data privacy is maintained and network bandwidth is saved mode executes.Specifically,
In method 400, the movable entire set of customer incident is not shared between servers, that is, the first coordination service device, the second association
It can be imputable data to adjust server and attribution server only shared, rather than all user event datas are aggregated in one
Get up determining event attribution.In addition, being sent to central server (for example, attribution service with by the user event data of big collection
Device) it is used compared to data reduction bandwidth needed for only transmission.In addition, user's online activity can be improved.Because of the first coordination service device
The activity of user is received across content network and the second coordination service device receives from the second content network the activity of user, institute
It can only be received by one in coordination service device rather than the two with customer incident.
In step 410 and 420, the first coordination service device and the second coordination service device can respectively receive event.Event
It can be user's correlated activation associated with the first coordination service device and the second coordination service device respectively.For example, for first
Content network, the first coordination service device can be received directly or in other ways from another device receiving event datas.For
Second content network, the second coordination service device can receive or in other ways from another device receiving event datas.
Second event can occur after event associated with the first coordination service device and the second coordination service device.?
In some embodiments, second event is conversion.Conversion may include downloading and/or installing mobile application, via online shopping
Buy product or booking service in website.Two coordination service devices can know second event and determination is coordinated to take with first
Business device and the second associated event of coordination service device should receive the attribution of the event.However, this can repeat attribution,
That is, one in only two coordination service devices should have the event for being attributed to second event.
In step 430, the first coordination service device and the second coordination service device are received from attribution server 150 to the second thing
