Definitions
- Content may be selected and delivered to users based on user demographics, allowing advertisers and content providers to provide content that users may be most interested in. While users may be explicitly identified in some instances, in many implementations, users may be implicitly identified as associated with a device or application session. When correct, such application sessions may be referred to as canonical or conforming to the association between user and session. However, the implicit identifications may be incorrect, particularly in instances where users loan devices to each other. Such sessions may be referred to as non-canonical or non-conforming. Content may be mis-selected in such instances, or selected for the wrong user.
- User devices such as smart phones, tablets, or desktop computers, are frequently associated with a single device identifier or cookie.
- the device identifier or cookie is used to represent the user operating the device, and may be associated with demographic data of the user, obtained either explicitly via user profiles or implicitly via search and browsing habits.
- content such as ads may be selected for presentation based on the demographics of the user associated with the device identifier or cookie.
- users share a device, and other users of the device may have radically different demographics (and correspondingly, content preferences). For example, a friend may allow another to use their laptop or tablet to view a video. Such non-canonical browsing sessions they should not be linked with the original user and demographics associated with the device identifier.
- demographics associated with the device identifier can be compared with demographics associated with the viewed content (e.g. video, website, etc.). If the demographics match above a threshold, then the session may be assumed to be canonical or associated with the original user. If the demographics of the content do not match the demographics of the user, then the session may be considered non-canonical.
- content selection based on demographics may be suspended until a timer expires or the session ends.
- Content providers such as advertisers, may be charged reduced rates for randomly selected advertising in many implementations.
- FIG. 1 is an illustration of an implementation of a system for content delivery to a client device used by multiple users
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of client and server devices shown in FIG. 1 , according to one implementation
- FIGS. 2B-2D are illustrations of implementations of databases and tables used by the systems illustrated in FIG. 2A ;
- FIG. 3A is a flow chart of a method for identifying non-canonical sessions and delivering content, according to one implementation
- FIG. 3B is a flow chart of a method for weighting demographic entry overlap, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 3C is a graph illustrating another method for weighting demographic entry overlap, according to another implementation.
- Media or other content may be provided to client devices, including desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets or smart phones, video game consoles, smart televisions, wearable computers, or any other type and form of client device capable of presenting content to a user.
- the content may be of any type and form, including text, audio, video, interactive applications, games, or other media.
- content may be created by publishers, generally referred to as content providers; and may be delivered to client devices by content distribution systems having infrastructure and bandwidth for delivering the content to thousands or millions of client devices simultaneously.
- Content may be associated with or selected for various demographic groups, which may reflect both demographics such as age, gender, or location, as well as interests (e.g. finance, sports, etc.).
- Requests for content may include a device identifier or a selection of content may be based on a device identifier associated with a user having various demographics.
- content may be selected appropriately.
- non-canonical sessions such as when the device is operated on behalf of another user, if content is selected based on the device identifier and associated demographics, content may be mis-selected, resulting in less user interest, lower click-through rates, fewer ad conversions, etc.
- a client device 100 such as a laptop computing device, desktop computing device, tablet computing device, smartphone, wearable computing device, set top box, smart television, video game console, or any other such device, may be typically used by or operated on behalf of a primary user 102 A.
- Client device 100 may operate an application 104 , such as a media application, web browser, game, or any other type and form of application.
- application 104 may display content, such as text, audio, video, images, and/or interactive content such as web pages, games, or other content.
- Application 104 may display both content requested by a user 102 of the device, as well as content selected by a content server or provider and delivered to the device (e.g. banner, pre-roll, post-roll, or interstitial advertising; featured or recommended content; or any other type and form of content).
- application 104 may be a media player playing user-requested or selected content, as well as interstitial advertising.
- Client device 100 may be associated with or comprise a device identifier 106 .
- Device identifier 106 may be an alphanumeric string, data string, serial number, media access control (MAC) address, internet protocol (IP) address, username or account name, globally unique identifier (GUID), cookie, random or pseudorandom number, or any other type and form of identifier, including combinations of these or other identifiers.
- the device identifier 106 may be fixed to the device or preconfigured in the device, such as a manufacturer serial number or MAC address, while in other implementations, the device identifier 106 may be dynamically set by a content provider, audience measurement server, application 104 , or other entity, such as a cookie or username.
- a unique or new device identifier 106 may be set for each communication to a content provider, while in other implementations, the device identifier 106 may not be changed, or may be changed periodically (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly, etc.) or at other intervals (e.g. on restart of the client device, login to an internet service, etc.).
- a device identifier 106 may be associated with one or more other device identifiers 106 (e.g., a device identifier for a mobile device, a device identifier for a home computer, etc.).
- a device identifier 106 may be generated and/or transmitted to the device 100 by a content provider.
- a client device 100 may request a device identifier or cookie 106 from a content provider, and may transmit the device identifier or cookie 106 to the content provider in association with requests for content.
- device identifier 106 may be associated with a specific user 102 , such as user A 102 A.
- device identifier 106 may comprise a user login or other user-specific identifier.
- device identifier 106 may be device-specific but associated with a user-specific identifier in a database or user profile storage 114 maintained by a content server 110 or other such entity.
- a client device 100 may request content of and/or receive content from a content server 110 .
- a content server or provider 110 may include one or more computing devices connected to network 120 and configured for providing content to a client 100 , either directly or via another content distribution system.
- Content provider 110 may be referred to variously as a content provider, server, web server, data server, publisher, service provider, or by other similar terms.
- content provider 110 may include a plurality of computing devices configured as a server farm or cloud, and may include routers, load balancers, network address translators, firewalls, or other such devices.
- Content providers 110 may be computer servers (e.g., FTP servers, file sharing servers, web servers, etc.) or combinations of servers (e.g., data centers, cloud computing platforms, etc.). Content providers 110 may provide any type and form of content, including text, images, video, audio, multimedia, or other data, or any combination of these. Content may include search results, blog or forum content, news articles, movies, television shows, podcasts, video games or other interactive content, advertising in any format, websites, social media, or any other type and form of content. Content provider 110 may be an online search engine that provides search result data to client device 100 in response to a search query. In another implementation, content provider 110 may be a first-party web server that provides webpage data to client device 100 in response to a request for the webpage. Content server 110 may be referred to as a content delivery system (CDS) or content management system (CMS).
- CDS content delivery system
- CMS content management system
- Network 120 may be any form of computer network or combinations of networks that relay information between client devices 100 and one or more content servers 110 , as well as other devices not illustrated.
- Network 120 may include the Internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, satellite network, or other types of data networks.
- Network 120 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computer, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) that are configured to receive and/or transmit data within network 120 .
- Network 120 may further include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections.
- a client device 100 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to other computing devices in network 120 .
- a network 120 may be a virtual network, such as a virtual network between a plurality of virtual machines executed by a single physical machine, or a abstract network such as an offline transfer of data via physically movable media (e.g. a Sneakernet, transferring data via tape media, CD-ROM, flash media, external hard drives, floppy disks, etc.).
- Content server 110 may communicate with or maintain a user profile storage 114 .
- User profile storage 114 may comprise one or more databases, tables, large data arrays, or other structures for storing device identifiers 106 , demographic information about a user 102 A associated with each device identifier 106 , and other such information.
- user profile storage 114 may store associations between multiple device identifiers 106 associated with a common user 102 A.
- Demographic data stored in a user profile storage 114 may be of any type and form, including alphanumeric strings or text; predetermined flags or binary data representing data having predetermined values or possibilities; numerical values; or other such data.
- demographic data may include user preferences or interests, such as a favorite sport or team, travel destinations, hobbies, or other such interests.
- different values of demographic data may be similar to or subsets of other data (e.g. different models of cars may be subsets of a brand, or different brands of cars are subsets of “cars”). Similarities or hierarchical relationships may be referred to as positive associations.
- demographic data may be disparate or disjoint from other data (such as options for which different values cannot simultaneously be true, or explicit negative preferences or dislikes of interests or hobbies). Such disparate relationships may be referred to as negative associations. Positive and negative associations between demographic data values or subsets may also be stored in user profile storage 114 .
- demographic information about users may be anonymized or disambiguated to protect the privacy of the device user.
- the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location) do so, or an opportunity to control whether or how to transmit measurement data to an audience measurement server and/or panel provider.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used by an audience measurement server, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters).
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by content providers.
- a primary user or owner of a client device 100 will allow another or secondary user B 102 B to use the device. While in some instances, the primary user may explicitly logout or end a session or the secondary user may explicitly log in or otherwise indicate that a new user is operating the device, in many implementations, no such explicit indication is made. Accordingly, a content server 110 may not realize that a different user, with different demographics or interests, is using the device, and may incorrectly select content for delivery during such non-canonical sessions. To avoid this, in some aspects of the systems and methods discussed herein, a content server may identify a session as non-canonical due to a mismatch between demographic data typically associated with audience members of content requested by an operator (e.g. user B 102 B) of a client device 100 and demographic data associated with the primary user (e.g. user A 102 A) of the device. This mismatch may be identified in various ways, discussed in more detail below, by analyzing correlations and overlaps between demographic data.
- an operator e.g. user B
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of client and server devices shown in FIG. 1 , according to one implementation.

- a user identification service 204 may maintain a database, table, or index of device identifiers and associated user identifiers.
- a single user may have a plurality of different devices, each associated with its own device identifier (e.g. tablet, laptop, smartphone, etc.).
- each device identifier may be associated with a single user identifier.
- user identification service 204 may identify the corresponding user identifier from the database.

- an item of content such as an advertisement
- criteria may include Boolean operators (e.g. “trait 1 AND trait 2” or “trait 1 OR trait 2”) to provide further flexibility.
- content selector 206 may select content for delivery to a client based on demographic traits associated with the device identifier of the client device (and associated with the presumed or primary user of the device). Such content may be in addition to content requested by the user, such as featured content or advertising.
- an item of content may have no selection criteria; such content may be selected by content selector 206 for delivery regardless of demographic traits of the user or associated with the device identifier.
- a user may be using the client device that is not associated with the device identifier of the client device, during a non-canonical session. Selecting content for such users based on demographic traits associated with the device identifier may result in mis-selected content that the user is not interested in. This may result in user frustration or annoyance, reduced click-throughs or conversions, or other such consequences.
- the content provider 110 may identify non-canonical sessions and may disable demographic personalization for the session or stop selecting content based on demographic traits associated with the device identifier.
- the content selector 206 may select content based on its similarity to other content requested by the user during the non-canonical session. In other implementations, the content selector 206 may select random content or content associated with no selection criteria, as discussed above.
- the alternate or non-primary user may request content for delivery to the client device.
- This requested content may be used to identify non-canonical sessions.
- the requested content may be associated with one or more demographic traits or audience profiles, representing a likely audience for the requested content.
- Such profiles may be stored in content metadata storage 208 .
- Content metadata storage 208 may comprise a database, flat file, table, array, or other data structure for storing metadata about content in content storage 112 . Referring briefly to FIG. 2C , illustrated is one such implementation of a content metadata storage 208 .
- Content metadata storage 208 may comprise an entry for each item of content 260 A- 260 N (referred to generally as entries 260 ).
- Each entry may comprise an identifier 262 of the item of content; a title 264 of the item of content; and any other information about the item of content, including type, length, storage location or uniform resource locator (URL), genre, or any other such information.
- Each entry may further identify one or more likely audiences and corresponding percentages 266 A- 266 N, referred to generally as audience percentages 266 .
- Each audience percentage 266 may correspond to a demographic trait or set of demographic traits (e.g. a combination or Boolean AND of a plurality of demographic traits) and may have an associated percentage likelihood that a user requesting the item of content has the corresponding demographic trait or traits. For example, a first trait may have a percentage of 60%, indicating that 60% of users requesting the content have that first trait.
- Audience percentages 266 may also apply to combinations of demographic traits, such as a location and interest or gender and age. Audience percentages 266 may be populated by content providers, measurement services, or other entities. In some implementations, audience percentages 266 may be determined based on requested content during sessions explicit identified as canonical (e.g. following a user login); on surveys presented before, after, or during presentation of the content; on lookups to external data sources; or on evaluations based on other content metadata title, description, keywords, genre, etc.). Although shown in a single database, in many implementations, each entry in content metadata storage 208 may be stored as metadata with the corresponding item of content (e.g. as ID3 tags or similar metadata, in associated files or manifests such as XML data or M3U playlists, or in any other such format). Accordingly, such entries may be retrieved with retrieval of the corresponding items of content.
- ID3 tags or similar metadata e.g., in associated files or manifests such as XML data or M3U playlists,
- a session may be identified as non-canonical based on a mismatch or disagreement between a demographic profile associated with a device identifier of a client device or demographic lists 250 including a UID 252 of the device or primary user, and audience percentages 266 associated with a requested item of content.
- a mismatch may imply that the user operating the client device is not associated with the device identifier, and accordingly, selection of additional content based on demographics associated with the device identifier should be disabled, at least temporarily.
- the content provider 110 may execute an override service 210 .
- Override service 210 may be an application, service, server, daemon, routine, or other executable logic for comparing or correlating demographic profiles associated with device identifiers 106 and audience percentages 266 associated with requested content. For example, the client device may transmit a request for an item of content and the device identifier 106 . The override service 210 may retrieve a demographic profile or compile an identification of demographic lists 250 including the corresponding UID. The override service 210 may also retrieve audience percentages 266 for the requested content from content metadata storage 208 .
- the override service 210 may compare traits of the demographic profile and audience percentages and calculate an overlap score, indicating a likelihood that the user of the client device is the user associated with the demographic profile or not, and accordingly, whether or not the session is canonical. If the session is not canonical, the override service may add an entry to a session override table 212 . Prior to selecting additional content, a content selector 206 may consult override session table 212 to determine if an entry for the session exists. If so, then the content selector 206 may disable personalization and/or select additional content that has no selection criteria or is only associated with requested content, rather than the demographic profile.
- Override session table 212 may comprise a database, flat file, data array, or other data structure for storing entries 270 A- 270 B associated with a UID, referred to generally as override entries 270 .
- personalization may be only overridden temporarily for any device identifier or corresponding UID, as the secondary user may return the device to the primary user and subsequent requests may be canonical.
- each override entry 270 may include a session start time 272 A- 272 B (referred to generally as a session start time 272 ) and/or a session end time 274 A- 274 B (referred to generally as a session end time 274 ).
- an override entry 270 may include a start time and duration, or just an end time for the override. The duration and/or end time may be extended based on further requests from the client device that are identified as non-canonical as discussed above. For example, upon identifying a first non-canonical request for content from a client device, an override service may generate an entry with a session end time 274 ten minutes in the future.
- each override entry 270 may include an override list 276 A- 276 B, referred to generally as override lists 276 .
- Each override list 276 may identify demographic lists 250 or demographic traits or values associated with the UID or device identifier for which content personalization should be disabled. In some implementations, personalization may not be disabled for all demographic traits.
- the override service may determine that the location demographic of the user profile overlaps the location demographic of the audience of the requested content, and accordingly not override or disable content selection of localized content.
- override service 210 may comprise a correlator 214 .
- Correlator 214 may comprise a subroutine, service, server, daemon, or other executable logic for comparing multivariate demographic profiles and audience percentages.
- Correlator 214 may comprise a bitwise comparator for comparing integer values or bit strings, a mathematical comparator, an analog comparator, or any other type and form of hardware or software for comparing values to each other and/or to thresholds.
- correlator 214 may use any type and form of algorithm to determine a correlation between a statistical value for presence of a characteristic in aggregated device measurement data and presence of the characteristic in demographic data.
- Correlator 214 may use a Pearson correlation algorithm to compare a frequency of a characteristic in data with a frequency of the characteristic in other data. The resulting correlation coefficient may be compared to a threshold, and a confidence score associated with the characteristic may be increased or decreased responsive to the coefficient being above or below a threshold.
- Override service 210 may, in some implementations, maintain a timer 216 .
- Timer 216 may be used to determine whether override entries in override session table 212 are still active, and/or whether they should be cleared or deleted.
- timer 216 may be executed by an operating system of the server 110 .
- FIG. 3A is a flow chart of a method 300 for identifying non-canonical sessions and delivering content, according to one implementation.
- a content provider or server such as content server 110 may receive a request for an item of content from a client device 100 .
- the request may be on the behalf of a user, such as a primary user of the device associated with the device identifier, or may be on the behalf of an alternate or secondary user not associated with the device identifier.
- the request may be in any type and form of protocol, including HTTP GET or POST requests, FTP requests, remote procedure call or API requests, or any other type and form of request.
- Receiving the request may comprise establishing a communication session with the client device, such as a transport layer session.
- receiving the request may comprise performing a handshaking protocol or other functions.
- the request may comprise an identifier of a requested item of content (e.g. name, URL, keyword, genre, etc.), and may comprise a user identifier, device identifier, cookie, or other such identifier that may be associated with a primary user (regardless of whether the primary user is using the client device).
- the request may be a search request, such as a keyword search or search for a web page, video, audio file, or other such search.
- the content server may receive the request via a network interface over a network, such as network interface 226 and network 120 .
- a front end, gateway, or load balancer may receive the request and forward the request to a content server.
- a user identification service of the content server may determine if a user profile is available in a user profile storage or database corresponding to a device identifier, user identifier, or cookie in the request. If not, then no demographic profile may be obtained for the primary user. Accordingly, at step 306 , a content selector of the content server may select additional random content for delivery to the client device, such as advertising or featured content with no selection criteria, in some implementations. Although referred to as “random” content, in many implementations, such content may be selected without use of demographic traits, but may be selected according to an ordered list, auction system, or any other criteria.
- random content may simply be content not selected via a personalization system, and thus ‘random’ in association to or connection with demographic traits of a user.
- the content selector may select additional content based on the additional content having selection criteria matching audience percentages for the requested content. For example, if the request is for a video relating to cars, the content selector may select additional content with selection criteria matching a demographic group having an interest in cars.
- the content server may deliver the requested content and selected content.
- delivering the requested content and selected content may comprise generating a playlist or manifest identifying both items of content, such that the client device or an application of the client device may transmit further requests for the requested content and selected content (e.g. a manifest identifying URLs of a plurality of blocks or chunks of the content for streaming playback, and including the selected content as pre-roll, post-roll, or interstitial content).
- delivering the requested content and selected content may comprise generating a webpage comprising the requested content and selected content (e.g. as banner advertising, pop-up or pop-under advertising, as featured search results, or any other type and form of delivery).
- delivering the requested content and selected content may comprise generating instructions for an application on the client to retrieve, receive, and/or render the requested content and selected content.
- an override service of the content server may determine if an entry for the device identifier or UID is present in an override session table. Determining if an entry is present may comprise retrieving the table and/or searching the table for the UID or device identifier, retrieving an entry stored at an index of the device identifier or UID, or any other such function. If an override entry is present, then at step 312 , the override may be extended. The override service may extend the override by adding time to a session duration or session end time, or any other such function. The added time may be one minute, five minutes, ten minutes, one hour, or any other such time.
- the override service may set a “don't clear” flag or otherwise mark the entry.
- the override service may periodically remove any entries in the override table that lack a “don't clear” flag, and remove “don't clear” flags on entries that have them. This may be more efficient, at the expense of less customization for session timing.
- the content selector may select random content at step 306 and deliver the content at step 308 , as discussed above.
- the override service may perform steps 314 - 320 , discussed in more detail below, to determine whether to remove the override early.
- the override service may retrieve a user demographic profile corresponding to the UID or device identifier from a user profile storage or database.
- the demographic profile may comprise a set of demographic identifiers or values, and may be stored as a database entry, a vector, an array, a string with predetermined positions, or any other such format.
- the override service may retrieve a content profile for the requested content or content previously delivered to the client device from content metadata storage.
- content metadata or profiles may be stored in a database, or may be stored with or as part of the content, such as in metadata or headers of the file, in a manifest or playlist, or otherwise. Accordingly, the override service may retrieve the profile from various locations, depending on implementation. In some implementations, the override service may search through a database to identify an entry or entries corresponding to the requested content.
- the override service may first compare a core or primary demographic from the user demographic profile to the content profile for the requested content to determine whether the core demographic is present above a predetermined threshold. If so, then the override service may determine that no override is necessary at step 320 . This may save time and processing resources if, for example, a large percentage of the audience of the requested content matches the core demographic of the user profile, indicating that the session may likely be canonical.
- core demographics may be a narrowest set of demographic traits or combination of all of the traits identified in the user profile.
- a core demographic may be “trait A AND trait B AND trait C”. If the content profile shows that this combination occurs at a high audience percentage, then the session is likely canonical, and traits need not be compared individually; if the narrow combination of all three traits is present in the audience percentages at a high level, then by definition, each individual trait must also be present at a high (if not higher) level.
- the threshold be set to any value, such as 10%, 20%, 50%, or any other value.
- the override service may remove any override in an override session table for the device identifier or user identifier. For example, in such implementations, even if an override is identified as present for the device identifier or user identifier within the override session table at step 310 , the override service may perform steps 314 - 320 to determine whether to remove the override early.
- the content selector 206 may select additional content based on the demographic profile of the user. As discussed above, selected content may be identified with demographic criteria. Content selector 206 may select such content based on criteria including the demographic traits of the user profile. In some implementations, content selector 206 may apply other selection policies or rules, such as selecting content not provided recently, selecting content also sharing demographic criteria with the content profile of the requested content, based on an auction system for payments by third party content providers, or any other such methods. The content may be delivered at step 308 , as discussed above.
- a next (e.g. first) audience percentage or entry of the content profile may be selected by the override service.
- the override service may select a first entry having a highest percentage, and on repeated iterations of steps 324 - 332 , may select each next entry or next lowest percentage until complete.
- the override service may determine if the selected audience percentage entry has a percentage above a predetermined threshold, and discard the entry at step 328 if the percentage is not above the threshold. This may be done to remove outliers for which a canonical or non-canonical inference may be weak.
- the threshold may be set to any level, such as 10%, 20%, or any other value.
- the override service may weight the percentage or calculate a weighted score for the audience demographic based on a correlation with a corresponding demographic trait of the user profile. For example, if the audience demographic overlaps with the user demographic, then the weight of the percentage may be increased or a positive weighting applied or an increased score calculated; while if the audience demographic does not overlap with the user demographic or contradicts the user demographic, then a negative weighting may be applied or a decreased score calculated.
- a correlation between a demographic trait of the user and the corresponding audience percentage may be calculated. If the correlation is above a threshold, a score for the correlation may be increased or the percentage may be given an increased weight (e.g. by increasing the percentage or a score corresponding to the percentage by a predetermined amount). If the correlation is below a second threshold, the score or percentage may be decreased. Between the thresholds, in some implementations, the score may not be adjusted.
- step 330 is illustrated in the flow chart of FIG. 3B .
- Such implementations may be used for demographics with disparate or disjoint values, such as “likes sports” or “dislikes sports”.
- the override service may determine if the user profile includes a corresponding entry to the demographic of the audience percentage entry. If so, at step 352 , a score for the entry or the percentage may be increased by a predetermined amount (e.g. 10 percent, 15 percent, or any other such amount). Similarly, at step 354 , the override service may determine if the user profile includes an opposing entry to the demographic of the audience percentage entry.
- the score for the entry or the percentage may be decreased by a predetermined amount (e.g. 10 percent, 15 percent, or any other such amount). If the profile includes neither a corresponding nor opposing entry, then in some implementations, the percentage may not be adjusted. The method of FIG. 3A may then resume.
- a predetermined amount e.g. 10 percent, 15 percent, or any other such amount.
- FIG. 3C is a graph illustrating examples of such implementations for weighting demographic entry overlap.
- the override service may calculate a difference between a value of the demographic trait for the audience entry and the value of the demographic trait for the user profile, such as a difference between two ages. This may represent an x-value 360 for a weighting function 364 a - 364 c , referred to generally as a weighting function 364 .
- the override service may then determining a corresponding y-value 362 for the function, which may be positive or negative, and may be applied as a score or weight to the audience percentage. For example, given function 364 a and a difference in values near zero, a high positive weight may be applied to the audience percentage. As shown in function 364 c , the functions need not be symmetrical around either axis. Similarly, as shown in function 364 b , the function may be a stepwise function. This may be particularly useful with demographic ranges for audience percentages (e.g. ages 45-54).
- the override service may determine if there are additional audience percentages in the content profile. If so, steps 324 - 332 may be performed for each additional percentage (in some implementations, steps 324 - 332 may be performed in parallel for each audience percentage).
- the override service may calculate an average of the scores or weighted percentages for the content profile. As noted above, based on overlap between the content profile and user profile, some percentages may be increased while other percentages are decreased. Still other percentages may discarded from the calculation if too low.
- the average score or percentage may be compared to a threshold representing the weighted average likelihood of overlap between the user profile and content profile. If the score or percentage is above the threshold, then the session may be inferred to be canonical and no override may be applied at step 320 . If the score or percentage is below the threshold, then the session may be inferred to be non-canonical, and an override entry may be added to the override table at step 338 , as discussed above. In some implementations, the override service may add a session start time, session end time, duration, and one or more demographic categories (such as the demographic categories corresponding to the audience percentages of the content that were included in the weighted average at step 334 ). Random content may be selected at step 306 and delivered at step 308 , as discussed above.
- step 334 may be skipped or an average not calculated of the scores across various demographics.
- steps 336 and 338 may be performed for each demographic trait or score individually and separate overrides generated. For example, given a user with traits A, B, and C, and requested content having audience percentages of 20% for A, 10% for B, and 90% for C, the override service may adjust these percentages or generate weighted scores at step 330 as discussed above, and may then compare each score separately to a threshold (such as 50%, for example, although any value may be used). The override service may determine that selection for traits A and B should be disabled but selection for trait C may be used. The content provider may then either select content at step 322 for trait C or random content at step 306 , as discussed above.
- the systems and methods discussed herein provide automatic inference and identification of non-canonical user sessions, and may dynamically enable and disable personalized content selection. This may reduce user frustration and instances of low conversions or click-throughs for mis-selected content based on false demographic inferences.
