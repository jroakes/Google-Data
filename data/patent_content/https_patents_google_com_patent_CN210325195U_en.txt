Detailed Description
While the digital revolution has provided many benefits from sharing information publicly to a sense of community worldwide, emerging new technologies often cause confusion, doubt and fear to consumers, preventing them from benefiting from the technology. The electronic device is conveniently used as a voice interface to receive voice input from a user and to enable voice activated functions, thereby providing a hands-free and hands-free solution to approach existing and emerging technologies. In particular, voice input received at the electronic device may carry instructions and information even if the user's line of sight is obstructed and the hands are full. To achieve a hands-free and hands-free experience, the voice-activated electronic device listens to the environment constantly or only when triggered (i.e., constantly processes audio signals collected from the environment). The user identity, on the other hand, is linked to the user's voice and the language used by the user. To protect user identity, these voice-activated electronic devices are commonly used in protected, controlled, non-public and private spaces (e.g., homes and cars).
According to some embodiments, the voice-activated electronic device identifies a speaker of the voice input as one of the one or more associated or registered users. For the identified speaker, a response to the speaker output by the electronic device is personalized. The speaker is identified by comparing the speaker's speech input to a set of trained speech models or speech fingerprints. In some implementations, the words and phrases used by the speaker to train the speech model are not necessarily predefined and need not match words later spoken by the speaker in order for the electronic device to recognize the speaker.
Further, according to some embodiments, the plurality of voice-activated electronic devices negotiate with a leader among them in response to a voice input from the user. The negotiation may be based on which device best detects the voice input, or which device is closest to the user. Additionally, if the voice input is specifically associated with one of the devices, then that device may be selected to respond, even though it would not have been selected to respond; in determining which device will be the leader, consideration is given to the relevance of the command included in the speech input to the particular device (e.g., "stop music" shall refer to a device that plays music) and the state of the device receiving the speech input (e.g., "screen on" versus "screen off").
Further, according to some embodiments, the voice-activated device determines whether ambient noise is sufficient to interfere with the detection of a spoken hotword for waking up the device (in some embodiments, a "hotword" is a user-defined or predefined word or phrase used to "wake up" or trigger the voice-activated device to focus on/respond to a spoken command issued after the hotword) or the detection of other spoken voice inputs. If the noise is sufficiently disturbing, the device will indicate this and provide a prompt to the user to use an alternative to waking up the device or other noise reduction measures.
Voice assistant operating environment
FIG. 1 is an exemplary operating environment, according to some embodiments. Operating environment 100 includes one or more voice-activated electronic devices 190 (e.g., electronic devices 190-1 through 190-N). One or more voice-activated electronic devices 190 may be located in one or more locations (e.g., all in a room or space of a building, throughout multiple spaces within a building, or throughout multiple buildings (e.g., one in a house, and one in a user's car)). Environment 100 optionally includes one or more devices (e.g., media devices, smart home devices) (not shown) in communication with voice-activated electronic device 190.
The electronic device 190 is communicatively coupled to a voice assistant server 112 of a voice assistant service through the communication network 110. One or more of electronic devices 190 are communicatively coupled to local network 104, and local network 104 is communicatively coupled to communication network 110 (e.g., electronic devices 190-1 and 190-2). In some implementations, the local network 104 is a local area network implemented at a network interface (e.g., a router). Electronic devices 190 communicatively coupled to local network 104 may also communicate with each other over local network 104.
Optionally, one or more of electronic devices 190 are communicatively coupled to communication network 110 and not at local network 104 (e.g., electronic device 190-N). For example, these electronic devices 190 are not on a Wi-Fi network corresponding to the local network 104, but are connected to the communication network 110 through a cellular connection. In some implementations, communication between electronic device 190 on local network 104 and electronic device 190 not on local network 104 is accomplished through voice assistant server 112. The electronic device 190 is registered in the device registry 118 of the voice assistant service and is thus known by the voice assistant server 112.
The environment 100 also includes one or more content hosts 114. The content host 114 may be a remote content source that streams or otherwise obtains content in accordance with a user voice request. The content host 114 may be an information source from which the voice assistant server 112 retrieves information according to a user's voice request.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 can be associated with multiple users having respective user accounts in the user domain. Any of these users, as well as device-independent users, may generate speech input to the electronic device 190. The electronic device 190 receives these speech inputs from these users 102-1 through 102-M (including related and unrelated users), and the electronic device 190 and/or the voice assistant server 112 continue to recognize the user that generated the speech input for the speech inputs. Through user recognition, the response to the speech input may be personalized to the recognized user.
In some implementations, environment 100 includes multiple electronic devices 190 (e.g., devices 190-1 through 190-N). The devices 190 are distributed throughout the environment 100 (e.g., all within a room or space in a building, throughout the building, some within the building, and some not within the building). Each device 190 receives input or does not receive input when the user 102 makes a voice input (e.g., if the device is too far from the user). The device receiving the input receives the input at different quality levels; the quality of the samples of speech input at the device is based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the distance of the user from the device and the noise surrounding the device. The plurality of devices 190 negotiate leaders among themselves to respond to the user based on the quality of the sample of voice input and receive further voice input from the user 102.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 determines a noise level around the device and determines whether the determined noise level is high enough to interfere with recognizing hotwords in the speech input, thereby interfering with waking up the device through speech, or with recognizing a speech request. If the noise level is determined to be high enough to be disruptive, the electronic device 190 indicates to the user that the noise level is disruptive and gives the user an indication that the user should use another way to wake up the electronic device 190 (e.g., activate a button). The indication of the interference noise level and the prompting to wake up the device using another way (e.g., illuminating a wake-up button) may be done in the same presentation.
In some implementations, one or more media devices are provided in the operating environment 100 to provide media content, news, and/or other information to one or more occupants. In some implementations, the content provided by the media device is stored in a local content source, streamed from a remote content source (e.g., content host 114), or generated locally (e.g., through a local text-to-speech processor, reading customized news bulletins, emails, text, local weather reports, etc. to one or more occupants of the operating environment). In some implementations, the media devices include a media output device that outputs media content directly to an audience (e.g., one or more users), and a cast device for streaming media content connected to the media output device over a network. Examples of media output devices include, but are not limited to, Television (TV) display devices and music players. Examples of presentation devices include, but are not limited to, set-top boxes (STBs), DVD players, TV boxes, and streaming media devices, such as Google's ChromecastTMA streaming media device.
In some implementations, the media device includes one or more voice-activated electronic devices 190 that receive, process, and respond to voice commands of an occupant. In some embodiments, the voice-activated electronic device 190 responds to the voice command by: generating and providing a spoken response to the voice command (e.g., responding to the question "time now", saying the current time); streaming user-requested streaming media content (e.g., "play Beach Boys songs"); reading news stories or daily news bulletins customized for the user; playing a media item stored on the personal assistant device or the local network; changing states or operating one or more other connected devices within the operating environment 100 (e.g., turning on/off lights, instruments or media devices, locking/unlocking locks, windowing, etc.); or to issue a corresponding request to the server via the network 110.
In some implementations, one or more electronic devices 190 are disposed in the operating environment 100 to collect audio input for initiating various functions, including media playback functions of the media device. In some implementations, these voice-activated electronic devices 190 (e.g., devices 190-1 through 190-N) are placed in proximity to the media device, e.g., in the same room as the presentation device and the media output device. Alternatively, in some implementations, the voice-activated electronic device 190 is placed in a room with one or more smart home devices but no media devices. Alternatively, in some implementations, the voice-activated electronic device 190 is placed in a location without a networked electronic device. Further, in some implementations, a room or space in a building may have multiple electronic devices 190.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 includes at least one or more microphones, a speaker, a processor, and a memory storing at least one program for execution by the processor. The speaker is configured to allow the electronic device 190 to communicate voice messages and other audio (e.g., audible tones) to a location where the electronic device 190 is located in the operating environment 100 to broadcast music, report the status of audio input processing, talk to or instruct a user of the electronic device 190. As an alternative to a voice message, visual signals can also be used to provide feedback to the user of the electronic device 190 regarding the status of the audio input process. When the electronic device 190 is a mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone or tablet computer), its display screen is configured to display notifications regarding the status of audio input processing.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 is a voice interface device that is networked to provide voice recognition functionality with the help of the voice assistant server 112 and/or optionally a cloud service server (not shown). For example, the electronic device 190 includes a smart speaker that provides music to the user and allows hands-free and hands-free access to voice Assistant services (e.g., Google Assistant). Optionally, the electronic device 190 is one of: desktop or laptop computers, tablet computers, mobile phones including a microphone, presentation devices including a microphone and optionally a speaker, audio systems including a microphone and a speaker (e.g. stereo systems, speaker systems, portable speakers), television sets including a microphone and a speaker, and user interface systems in automobiles including a microphone and a speaker and optionally a display. Alternatively, the electronic device 190 is a simple and low cost voice interface device. In general, electronic device 190 may be any device capable of network connectivity and including a microphone, a speaker, and programs, modules, and data for interacting with the voice assistant service. Assuming a simplified and low cost electronic device 190, the electronic device 190 includes an array of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) rather than a full screen display, and a visual pattern is displayed on the LEDs to indicate the status of the audio input process. In some embodiments, the LEDs are full color LEDs, and the color of the LEDs may be used as part of the visual pattern to be displayed on the LEDs. U.S. provisional patent application No.62/336,566 entitled "LED design Language for Visual afforance of Voice User Interfaces," filed on 5/13/2016, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes examples of using LEDs to display Visual patterns for communicating information or device status. In some implementations, a visual mode indicating a status of a speech processing operation is displayed using a feature image displayed on a common display associated with an electronic device that is performing the speech processing operation.
In some embodiments, LEDs or other visual displays are used to communicate the overall voice processing status of the plurality of participating electronic devices. For example, in an operating environment where there are multiple voice processing or voice interface devices (e.g., multiple electronic devices 400 as shown in FIG. 4A of the '566 application and reproduced in FIG. 8A below; multiple electronic devices 190), a colored LED group associated with the respective electronic device (e.g., LED 404 as shown in FIG. 4A of the' 566 application) can be used to communicate which electronic device is listening to the user, and which listening device is the leader (where the "leader" device is generally responsible for responding to verbal requests made by the user).
More generally, the' 566 application describes (e.g., see paragraphs [0087] - [0100 ]) an "LED design language" for visually indicating various speech processing states of an electronic device, such as "hotword detection state and listening state", "thinking mode or operating mode", and "response mode or speaking mode", using a set of LEDs. In some embodiments, groups of LEDs are used to represent unique states of speech processing operations described herein, according to one or more aspects of the "LED design language" of the' 566 application. These visual indicators can also be combined with one or more audible indicators generated by the electronic device that is performing the speech processing operation. The resulting audio and/or visual indicators will allow a user in a voice interaction environment to understand the state of the various voice processing electronic devices in the environment and effectively interact with these devices in a natural, intuitive manner.
When speech input from the electronic device 190 is used to control the media output device via the presentation device, the electronic device 190 effectively implements a new level of control over the presentation-enabled media device. In a particular example, the electronic device 190 includes a recreational entertainment speaker with far-field voice access and functions as a voice interface device for voice assistant services. The electronic device 190 can be placed in any area of the operating environment 100. When multiple electronic devices 190 are distributed in multiple rooms, they become presentation audio receivers that are synchronized to provide speech input from all of the rooms.
Specifically, in some embodiments, the electronic device 190 includes a Wi-Fi speaker having a microphone connected to a voice activated voice Assistant service (e.g., Google Assistant). The user can issue a media play request via the microphone of the electronic device 190 and request the voice assistant service to play media content on the electronic device 190 itself or on another connected media output device. For example, a user can issue a media play request by speaking "OK Google" to the Wi-Fi speaker, playing a cat video on the living room television. The voice assistant service then completes the media play request by playing the requested media content on the requesting device using the default or designated media application.
In some implementations, the user can issue a voice request via the microphone of the electronic device 190 regarding media content that has been played or is playing on the display device (e.g., the user can query for information about the media content, purchase the media content through an online store, or compose and post social posts regarding the media content).
In some implementations, as the user traverses the premises, the user may wish to engage in a current media session with one or more electronic devices 190 and request such services therefrom. This requires the voice assistant service to transfer the current media session from the first presentation device to a second presentation device that is not directly connected to the first presentation device or is unaware of the existence of the first presentation device. After the media content transfer, the second output device coupled to the second performance device continues to play the media content previously played by the first output device coupled to the first performance device from the precise point within the music track or video segment, wherein the media content is forgotten to be played on the first output device. In some implementations, the electronic device 190 that receives the request to transfer the media session can satisfy the request. In some implementations, the electronic device 190 that receives the request to transfer the media session relays the request to another device or system (e.g., hub device, voice assistant server 112) for processing.
Further, in some implementations, a user may issue a request for information or for performing an action or operation via a microphone of the electronic device 190. The requested information may be private (e.g., the user's email, the user's calendar events, the user's flight information, etc.), non-private (e.g., sports scores, news stories, etc.), or in between (e.g., scores for a user's preferred team or sports, news stories from a user's preferred source, etc.). The requested information or action/action may involve accessing personal information (e.g., purchasing a digital media item, purchasing a physical good via payment information provided by the user). The electronic device 190 responds to the request with a voice message response to the user, where the response may include, for example, a request for additional information to complete the request, an acknowledgement that the request has been completed, a notification that the request cannot be completed, and so forth.
In some implementations, the operating environment 100 can include one or more smart home devices (not shown) in addition to the voice-activated electronic device 190 and media devices (e.g., output devices and presentation devices). Integrated smart home devices include smart, multi-sensor networked devices seamlessly integrated with each other and/or with a central server or cloud computing system in a smart home network to provide a variety of useful smart home functions. In some implementations, the smart home devices are placed in the same location in the operating environment 100 as the presentation devices and/or output devices, and thus are placed in close proximity or at a known distance relative to the presentation devices or output devices.
Smart home devices in operating environment 100 may include, but are not limited to, one or more intelligent, multi-sensing, networked thermostats; one or more intelligent, networked multi-sensory hazard detectors; one or more intelligent, multi-sensing, networked entryway interface devices (hereinafter "smart doorbells" and "smart door locks") and one or more intelligent, multi-sensing, networked alarm systems; one or more intelligent, multi-sensing networked camera systems and one or more intelligent, multi-sensing networked wall switches and one or more intelligent, multi-sensing networked power outlets. In some embodiments, the smart home devices in operating environment 100 of fig. 1 comprise a plurality of smart, multi-induction networked devices (hereinafter "smart appliances"), such as refrigerators, stoves, ovens, televisions, washing machines, clothes dryers, lights, stereos, intercom systems, garage door openers, floor fans, ceiling fans, wall air conditioners, pool heaters, irrigation systems, security systems, space heaters, window AC units, powered vents, and the like. In some embodiments, any of these smart home device types may be equipped with a microphone and one or more of the voice processing capabilities described herein to respond, in whole or in part, to voice requests from occupants or users.
In some implementations, each of the performance device and the voice-activated electronic device 190 can communicate and share information with other performance devices, voice-activated electronic devices 190, smart home devices, central servers or cloud computing systems, and/or other networked devices (e.g., client devices). Data communication may be performed using any of a variety of custom or standard wireless protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, Thread, Z-Wave, Bluetooth Smart, isa100.11a, WirelessHART, MiWi, etc.) and/or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols (e.g., ethernet, HomePlug, etc.) or any other suitable communication protocol, including communication protocols not yet developed at the date of filing of this document.
The presentation devices, electronic devices 190, and smart home devices may communicate with a server system (also referred to herein as a central server system and/or a cloud computing system) over a communication network (e.g., the internet) 110. Alternatively, the server system may be associated with a manufacturer, a support entity, or a service provider associated with the presentation device and the media content displayed to the user. Thus, the server system includes a voice assistant server 112 that processes audio input collected by the voice-activated electronic device 190, one or more content hosts 114 that provide displayed media content, a cloud-cast service server that creates a virtual user domain based on distributed device terminals, and a device registry 118 that maintains records of distributed device terminals in the virtual user environment. Examples of distributed device terminals include, but are not limited to, presentation devices, media output devices, electronic devices 190, and smart home devices. In some implementations, these distributed device terminals are linked to user accounts in the virtual user domain (e.g., Google user accounts). It should be appreciated that the processing of audio input collected by the electronic device 190 can be performed locally at the electronic device 190, at the voice assistant server 112, at another smart home device (e.g., a hub device), or at some combination of all or a subset of the above.
It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the electronic device 190 also functions in an environment without smart home devices. For example, even in the absence of a smart home device, the electronic device 190 may respond to user requests for information or to perform actions, and/or to initiate or control various media playback functions. The electronic device 190 may also function in a wide range of environments, including but not limited to, a vehicle, marine, commercial, or manufacturing environment.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 is "awakened" (e.g., to activate an interface for a voice assistant service on the electronic device 190 to place the electronic device 190 in a state in which the electronic device 190 is ready to receive voice requests for the voice assistant service) by a voice input that includes a hotword (also referred to as a "wake word"). In some embodiments, if the electronic device 190 is idle for at least a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5 minutes) relative to receiving the voice input, the electronic device 190 needs to wake up; the predetermined amount of time corresponds to an amount of idle time allowed before the voice interface session or dialog times out. The hotword may be a word or phrase, and may be pre-default and/or customizable by the user (e.g., the user may set a nickname for a particular electronic device 190 as the hotword for the device). In some implementations, there may be multiple hotwords that can wake up the electronic device 190. The user may speak the hotword, wait for a confirmation response from the electronic device 190 (e.g., the electronic device 190 outputs a greeting), and then make a first voice request. Alternatively, the user may combine the hotword and the first speech request in one speech input (e.g., the speech input includes the hotword, and the speech request after the hotword).
In some implementations, the speech input spoken by the user into the electronic device 190 can be generally free form or natural language speech. That is, the speech input need not be strictly limited to a predetermined set of words and phrases within a predetermined syntax, with some exceptions possible (e.g., the user needs to speak a hotword first to wake up the device).
In some implementations, in addition to speaking the hotword to the electronic device 190, the electronic device 190 includes one or more additional ways or affordances (affordances) to wake the device. Additional ways or alternatives can include, for example, activating a predefined button or touch sensor (e.g., a touch sensitive array) on the electronic device 190.
In some implementations, the voice-activated electronic device 190 interacts with a presentation device, client device, or server system of the operating environment 100, according to some implementations. The voice-activated electronic device 190 is configured to receive audio input from an environment proximate the voice-activated electronic device 190. Optionally, the electronic device 190 stores the audio input and processes the audio input at least partially locally. Optionally, the electronic device 190 transmits the received audio input or the partially processed audio input to the voice assistant server 112 via the communication network 110 for further processing. The presentation device is configured to obtain media content or internet content from one or more content hosts 114 for display on an output device coupled to the presentation device. In some implementations, the presentation device and the voice-activated electronic device 190 are linked to each other in the user domain, and more particularly, are associated with each other via a user account in the user domain. The presentation device information and the electronic device 190 information are stored in the device registry 118 in association with the user account. In some implementations, there is a device registry for the presentation device and a registry for the voice-activated electronic device 190. In some implementations, the cloud services server manages a studio device registry and the voice assistant server 112 manages a voice-activated electronic device registry. The studio device registry may reference devices in the associated voice-activated electronic device registry in the user domain, or vice versa.
In some implementations, one or more of the electronic devices 190 (and one or more presentation devices) are authorized to the voice assistant service via a client device (not shown). In some implementations, the voice-activated electronic device 190 does not include any display screen and relies on a client device to provide a user interface during the authorization process, and similarly for the presentation device. In particular, the client device is installed with an application that facilitates a user interface to authorize a new voice-activated electronic device 190 disposed in proximity to the client device. The user may send a request on the user interface of the client device to initiate an authorization process for a new electronic device 190 that needs to be authorized. Upon receiving the authorization request, the client device establishes a short-range communication link with the new electronic device 190 that needs to be authorized. Optionally, the short-range communication link is established based on Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or the like. The client device then transmits wireless configuration data associated with a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), such as local network 104, to the new or electronic device 190. The wireless configuration data includes at least a WLAN security code (i.e., a Service Set Identifier (SSID) password) and, optionally, an SSID, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a proxy configuration, and a gateway configuration. Upon receiving the wireless configuration data via the short-range communication link, the new electronic device 190 decodes and retrieves the wireless configuration data and joins the WLAN based on the wireless configuration data.
In some implementations, additional user domain information is entered on a user interface displayed on the client device and used to link the new electronic device 190 to an account in the user domain. Optionally, the additional user domain information is transmitted to the new electronic device 190 via the short-range communication link along with the wireless communication data. Optionally, after the new device joins the WLAN, the additional user domain information is transferred to the new electronic device 190 via the WLAN.
As long as the electronic device 190 has been authorized to enter the user domain, other devices and their associated activities may be controlled via multiple control paths. According to one control path, applications installed on the client device are used to control other devices and their associated activities (e.g., media playback activities). Alternatively, the electronic device 190 is used to implement hands-free and hands-free control of other devices and their associated activities according to another control path.
Voice activated media playback on a media output device
In some implementations, after both the presentation device and the voice-activated electronic device 190 are authorized and linked to a common user domain, the voice-activated electronic device 190 can be used as a voice user interface to enable hands-free and hands-free control of media content streamed to the presentation device, client device, or other second screen device that does not contain a remote control. For example, the user may give a voice command such as "play Lady Gaga on the living room speaker". The Lady Gaga music tracks or video clips are streamed to the presentation device associated with the "living room speakers". Neither the client device nor any presentation device application or media playing application loaded on the client device.
In some implementations, the proxy service (e.g., voice assistant service, cloud casting service) communicatively links the voice-activated electronic device 190 to the presentation device and can cause the presentation device to perform the presentation without involving any applications on the client. In particular, voice messages are captured and recorded by the electronic device 190 and configured to request media playback on a media output device. Optionally, the electronic device 190 processes the voice message locally in part. Optionally, the electronic device 190 transmits the voice message or the partially processed voice message to the voice assistant server 112 via the communication network 110 for further processing. The voice assistant server 112 or the cloud service server determines that the voice message includes a first media play request, and the first media play request includes a user voice command to play media content on the media output device and a user voice designation to the media output device. The user voice command further includes at least information of the first media playing application (e.g., YouTube and Netflix) and media content that needs to be played (e.g., LadyGaga music).
Based on the voice specification for the media output device, the voice assistant server 112 or the cloud services server identifies, in the device registry 118, a presentation device associated with the electronic device 190 in the user domain and coupled to the media output device. The presentation device is configured to execute one or more media playback applications for controlling the media output devices to play media content received from one or more media content hosts 114. Then, the cloud broadcast service server sends a second media playing request including the information of the first media playing application program and the media content needing to be played to the presentation device. After receiving the information sent by the cloud broadcast service server, the presentation device executes a first media playing application and controls the media output device to play the requested media content.
In some implementations, the user voice designation of the media output device includes a description of the destination media output device. The voice assistant server 112 or the cloud service server identifies a destination media output device of the plurality of media output devices in the device registry 118 based on the description of the destination media output device. In some implementations, the description of the destination media output device includes at least a brand ("samsung tv") or a location of the media output device ("my living room tv").
Voice activated media transfer between media output devices
In some implementations, the operating environment 100 includes a first presentation device (not shown) and a first output device (not shown) coupled to the first presentation device. The operating environment 100 also includes a second presentation device (not shown) and a second output device (not shown) coupled to the second presentation device. The presentation devices are optionally located in the same location (e.g., a living room) or in two different locations (e.g., two rooms) in the operating environment 100. Each presentation device is configured to obtain media content or internet content from the content host 114 for display on an output device coupled to the respective presentation device. Both the first presentation device and the second presentation device are communicatively coupled to a voice assistant server 112, and optionally, to a cloud service server and content host 114.
While playing media content on a first output device, a user may send a voice command to any electronic device 190 to request that the playing of the media content be transferred to a second output device. The voice command includes a media play transfer request. In one case, the user issues a voice command to an electronic device 190 placed near the first presentation device before the user moves to the destination location. Alternatively, in another case, after the user reaches the destination location, the user issues a voice command to the electronic device 190 placed near the second device.
The voice command is transmitted to the voice assistant server 112. The voice assistant server 112 sends a media display information request to the first presentation device requesting instant media play information for media content currently being played on a first output device coupled to the first presentation device. The first presentation device then returns the requested instant play information to the voice assistant server 112, the instant play information including at least information of the first media playing application (e.g., YouTube), the media content currently being played (e.g., "Lady Gaga-National Anthem-Super bow 2016"), and a time location associated with the playing of the media content. The second presentation device then receives a media display request including instant play information from the voice assistant server 112 and, in accordance with the instant play information, executes a first media play application that controls the second output device to play media content from the time location.
For example, when playing a music playlist on a first output device, the user says "play on my living room speakers". The first output device stops playing the currently playing song and resumes the stopped song on the living room speaker. When the song is completed, the living room speakers continue to play the next song on the music playlist previously played on the first output device. Thus, as the user moves about the operating environment 100, the playback of the media content will seamlessly follow the user while involving only limited user intervention (i.e., giving voice commands).

The electronic device 190 transmits the captured speech input to the speech assistant server 112 for processing or pre-processes the speech input first and transmits the pre-processed speech input to the speech assistant server 112 for processing. In some implementations, the voice assistant server 112 and the electronic device 190 have some shared and some separate responsibilities with respect to processing of voice input and noise reduction, and the programs, modules, and data structures shown in fig. 2A-2B may be included or distributed in the voice assistant server 112 and the electronic device 190. Other programs, modules, and data structures (e.g., speech model data 550, speech model training module 554) shown in fig. 2A-2B, or the like, may also be included in the voice assistant server 112.
Each of the identified elements may be stored in one or more of the memory devices and correspond to a set of instructions for performing the functions described above. The above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures, modules, or data structures, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or rearranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 706 optionally stores a subset of the modules and data structures described above. Further, memory 706 optionally stores additional modules and data structures not described above.
Exemplary device leader negotiation
Fig. 4A-4B illustrate an example of device leader negotiation between multiple electronic devices (e.g., electronic device 190) according to some embodiments. In an operating environment (e.g., operating environment 100) having a plurality of electronic devices 190, one or more of the plurality of electronic devices 190 detects and receives voice input when a user in the environment makes a voice input. The electronic devices 190 determine their own leaders in response to the user's voice input and detect further voice input from the user.
FIG. 4A illustrates three voice-activated electronic devices 1002-1 through 1002-3 (e.g., electronic device 190) in an operating environment (e.g., operating environment 100). They are all in the same space, e.g. in the same room, as the user (not shown). A user makes a voice input (e.g., an utterance) (not shown), and the three electronic devices 1002-1 through 1002-3 detect and capture samples of the voice input at different quality levels or levels. The quality of the samples of speech input captured at the electronic device may be affected by one or more factors including, but not limited to, ambient noise, device capabilities, distance and location of the device relative to the user, location of the device within space.
In some implementations, each electronic device determines a level of quality of a respective sample of speech input captured by the electronic device. The quality level may be expressed as a score or some other value. For example, in fig. 4A, each electronic device 1002 has captured a respective sample of the user's voice input and has determined a score for the respective sample; the sample at electronic device 1002-1 was scored as 0.98 (on a scale of 0 to 1,1 corresponds to the highest quality), the sample at electronic device 1002-2 was scored as 0.37, and the sample at electronic device 1002-3 was scored as 0.61. In some implementations, an identification quality module 566 (fig. 2B) at the electronic device 1002 determines the quality level of each captured sample. In some embodiments, the criteria for assessing the quality of a speech sample include, for example, the volume or amplitude of the sample, the presence or absence of noise (e.g., crosstalk, hiss) and corresponding levels, the presence or absence of distortion (e.g., echo) and corresponding levels, the frequency distribution of the sample, and so forth.
The electronic devices 1002 cause each other to communicate their quality scores. Thus, for example, electronic device 1002-1 receives quality scores from electronic devices 1002-2 and 1002-3. Electronic device 1002-2 receives the quality scores from electronic devices 1002-1 and 1002-3. Electronic device 1002-3 receives the quality scores from electronic devices 1002-1 and 1002-2. If all of the electronic devices 1002 are on the same local network (e.g., local network 104 of fig. 1), then the electronic devices 1002 exchange scores over the local network. For example, the electronic device 1002 may transmit its quality score to other electronic devices 1002 by sending a multicast message within a local network. If at least one of the electronic devices 1002 is not on the local network, a score is transmitted to the server system 140 and the device leadership arbitration module 780 of the voice assistant server 112 distributes the score to the electronic devices 1002. Alternatively, the device leadership arbitration module 780 determines which device is the leader based on the received scores and sends the results of the determination to the devices. In some implementations, the electronic devices 1002 discover each other and their locations through the voice assistant server 112 and the device registry 118 (e.g., the devices 1002 periodically check-in at the voice assistant server 112 and are notified of other devices associated with the same user account based on information in the device registry 118).
In some implementations, if only one of the plurality of electronic devices 1002 captures a sample of the voice input (e.g., the other electronic devices 1002 are too far from the user to detect the voice input), the device that captured the voice input sample is determined to be the leader. In some implementations, if the electronic device 1002 fails to capture a sample of the speech input (e.g., the device is too far away from the user to detect the speech input), then for the speech input, the quality score for the device is 0.00 or null; devices with "0.00" or empty spaces were excluded from being a leader.
When the electronic device 1002 receives a score from the other electronic device 1002, the electronic device compares its quality score to the scores from the other devices. If its score is not the best (e.g., highest) of the scores, the electronic device discards the response to the voice input output (e.g., the response generated by the server system 140) (e.g., by powering off or "turning off" the speaker 520). If its score is best among the scores, the electronic device outputs a response to the speech input and subsequent speech inputs; the device is determined to be the "leader". In some embodiments, the leader continues to detect and process or pre-process subsequent speech inputs from the user (whether it is the leader that processes the speech input and generates a response, the leader that pre-processes the speech input to transmit it to the speech assistant server 112 that generated the response, or simply transmits the speech input to the leader of the speech assistant server 112 that generated the response), and the non-leader forgoes receiving, detecting, and processing subsequent speech inputs from the user.
In some implementations, the leader determination is performed in response to a user's voice input (e.g., a voice input that includes the hotword) to wake up the device. In some implementations, the leader determination can be performed in response to each voice input from the user or at intervals of a predetermined number of voice inputs from the user (e.g., at every 5 voice inputs from the user). In this manner, the leader determination can be updated to account for changing conditions (e.g., the user is moving around, noise level changes around the device, etc.).
In some implementations, leader determinations based on quality scores can be overridden based on additional criteria. That is, even if a device is not determined to be a leader based only on the quality score, the device may be determined to be a leader. Additional criteria may include, for example, the type of request or command in the voice input and the status of the device. For example, if the voice input includes a request to start or stop playing a video, the request is particularly relevant to the electronic device 1002 capable of playing the video (e.g., smart tv, presentation device), and not particularly relevant to the electronic device 1002 that is an audio only device (e.g., sound system, portable speaker). When a request is particularly relevant to the electronic device 1002, the electronic device 1002 can be determined to be a leader even if the quality score of the device is not the highest. In some implementations, if the request is particularly relevant to multiple electronic devices in the space, the electronic device with the best quality score among the devices specifically relevant to the request is determined to be the leader. As another example, if the command in the voice input is a command to change a state of a device (e.g., "screen off"), a device in a state to which the command is applicable (e.g., a smart tv whose screen is currently in an on state) may be determined as a leader, although the quality score is low, and a device in a state to which the command is not applicable (e.g., a smart tv whose screen has been off) is not considered as a leader. Further, if the request/command is not specifically related to any of the devices 1002 (e.g., device 1002 is an audio-only voice interface device that communicates with a presentation device of the non-voice interface through the voice interface server 112, and the command is a request to play video via the presentation device), a leader determination is made based on the quality score described above. In some implementations, multiple leader determination criteria (e.g., quality scores, relevancy of commands, and status of devices, as described above) can be implemented as a multi-step leader determination (e.g., determining relevancy of commands and device status to narrow leader candidates, then determining a leader based on the quality scores; determining the device with the highest score, then checking whether command relevancy or device status criteria apply to other devices) or as a weighted determination (e.g., each criterion is considered and weighted by a weighted score).
Fig. 4B illustrates the results of device leadership negotiation between electronic devices 1002 in fig. 4A. Electronic device 1002-1 determines that its quality score is the best of the three electronic devices 1002 and assumes that the response is output to the user's leader. The electronic devices 1002-2 and 1002-3 determine that their quality scores are not the best among the three electronic devices 1002 and power down their speakers 520 and forgo outputting a response to the user.
In some embodiments, the electronic device 1002 that is not the leader also powers off its microphone 516, and thus, does not detect further voice input from the user; the leader device is also the leader involved in detecting and processing further speech input from the user. In some implementations, the electronic devices 1002 that are not the leader maintain power to their microphones 516 and provide an assistant to re-detect further speech input from the user. For example, the leader device and the non-leader device receive and record respective samples of the voice input and transmit them to the voice assistant server 112, and the voice assistant server 112 can use multiple samples together to better process the voice input (e.g., aggregate the samples, select the best sample for processing, compare the samples to obtain the best portion of each sample).
In some implementations, the electronic device 1002 repeats the leader determination process as described above upon receiving each voice input from the user. In some implementations, after a predetermined number of intervals of voice inputs, the electronic device 1002 repeats the leader determination process as described above (e.g., determines the leader again at every fifth voice input or at every 10 voice inputs).
In some implementations, upon determining the leader, one or more of the electronic devices 1002 output a visual response (e.g., along with an audio response to the voice input, the determined leader displays a notification that it is the leader or a predetermined LED light pattern).
In some implementations, each electronic device 1002 outputs a visual indication (e.g., a predetermined LED light pattern) of being listened to whenever the user is listening (e.g., receiving and detecting the user's voice input), and then, only the leader device outputs a response to the voice input, as determined by the leader. For example, when a user is speaking a voice input, the electronic devices 1002-1 through 1002-3 display visual indications to indicate that they are listening while receiving the voice input, after which, as determined by the leader, only the leader device 1002-1 outputs a response.
In some implementations, the electronic device 1002 indicates that it is listening by displaying a unique visual pattern, such as one of the patterns shown in fig. 4G of the' 566 application (as shown in fig. 8D below), using a set of LEDs. The visual pattern can be static (constant) or dynamic (giving the impression of movement by variations in color, brightness, duty cycle, etc. of the individual LEDs). In some implementations, the electronic device 1002 indicates that it is a leader of the plurality of listening devices by displaying another distinctive visual pattern using its LEDs. Similarly, multiple listening devices participating in the negotiation to determine which device should be the leader can indicate that a negotiation is in progress by displaying another distinctive visual pattern using their respective LEDs
Exemplary Process for Multi-user personalization
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 1100 of responding to a user's voice input, according to some embodiments. The method 1100 is implemented at an electronic device 190 having one or more microphones, a speaker, one or more processors, and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors.
Electronic device 190 receives a first voice input from a user via one or more microphones 516a (1102). The electronic device 190 captures and records a sample of the first voice input via the microphone 516. In some implementations, the first speech input is a free-form speech input, which may be, for example, a speech input in a natural language, in the sense that the speech input need not be strictly limited to a set of predetermined words and phrases within a predetermined syntax.
The electronic device 190 compares the first speech input to a set of speech models associated with a plurality of users associated with the electronic device 190 (1104), wherein the speech models are trained for the electronic device. User recognition module 560 compares the recorded sample of the first speech input to speech models in speech model data 550. The speech model data 550 includes speech models or speech fingerprints of one or more users in the user domain associated with the electronic device 190 (e.g., users registered with the electronic device 190). In some embodiments, speech models are trained for the electronic device by speech model training module 554.
Based on the comparison, the electronic device 190 determines that the first speech input corresponds to a first user of the plurality of users (1106). For example, user recognition module 560 recognizes a speech model in speech model data 550 that best matches the first speech input and, based on recognizing a match, determines that the user speaking the first speech input is the user corresponding to the matching speech model. In some implementations, the user recognition module 560 also determines some other similar measure of confidence or quality or closeness of match between the speech model and the speech input, and only recognizes a match if the match is best and the confidence is above a predetermined threshold.
The electronic device 190 presents a response according to the determination (1108). In some implementations, the electronic device 190 generates a response based on the determination and the first speech input. The response includes an indication of the identity of the identified first user to let the first user know that he has been identified. The response also includes a response to any voice request in the first voice input. For example, in response to a hotword voice input waking up the electronic device 190, the electronic device 190 generates and presents (e.g., outputs) a voice greeting that includes the first user's name (e.g., "Hello, David", "morning, mary (good morningmary)"). The response may include a voice output and/or instructions for another device to perform the operation. Instructions to perform an operation, including an indication of the identity of the identified user, cause the operation to be performed with respect to the identified user. For example, if the operation is playing music from a music subscription, the device plays music from the music subscription of the identified user.
In some implementations, the response is an audible speech output, and presenting the response includes outputting the audible speech output. The electronic device 190 outputs audible speech through the speaker 520.
In some implementations, the electronic device determines a user request based on the first voice input and generates a response according to the determined user request. In some embodiments, generating a response from the determination and the first speech input includes these determining and generating operations. In addition to identifying the speaker of the voice input, the electronic device 190 determines a user request in the voice input (e.g., a media playback request, a request for a news headline, a request for an email to be read, etc.) and generates a response in response to the request (e.g., an audible confirmation of the request, an audible query to the user to obtain more information needed to fulfill the request).
In some implementations, the determined user request includes a request to wake up the electronic device, and the response includes an audible greeting, wherein the greeting includes an indication of the determined identity of the first user. If the voice input includes a hotword (i.e., the voice input is a request to wake up the electronic device 190), the generated response includes an audible greeting containing the identity of the first user (e.g., "good morning dave"). The greeting indicates that the electronic device 190 has been awakened and indicates the identity of the user identified by the electronic device 190.
In some implementations, the determined user request includes a request for information, and generating a response according to the determined request includes obtaining the requested information with respect to the first user. If the request is a request for information (e.g., a request to read the user's email, a request to speak the user's upcoming calendar event aloud), the electronic device 190 accesses the identified user's information (e.g., the user's email, the user's calendar) to generate a response. In some embodiments, obtaining the requested information includes, with respect to the determined first user, accessing an account associated with the first user; to obtain information for the identified user for the response, the electronic device 190 accesses an account of the user (e.g., an email account of the user, a calendar account of the user). At the electronic device 190, the user account information may be stored in the voice device settings 546.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 receives a second speech input, compares the second speech input to the set of speech models, determines, based on the comparison, that the second speech input corresponds to a second user of the plurality of users, and presents the response in accordance with the determination that the second speech input corresponds to the second user. In some implementations, the electronic device generates a response based on the determination and the second speech input. If a different user associated with the electronic device 190 speaks a voice input to the electronic device 190, the electronic device 190 identifies the different user in a manner similar to the manner in which the first user is identified-compares the voice input of the different user to the voice model and finds the best match. By identifying the different users, the electronic device 190 can generate a response based on the new identification. Thus, the electronic device 190 can switch between related users by comparing the speech input to the speech models and identifying the speaking user based on the comparison, such that the user does not have to explicitly speak a command to switch the focus of the electronic device 190 from one user to another.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 receives a third speech input, compares the third speech input to the set of speech models, determines, based on the comparison, that the third speech input does not correspond to any of the plurality of users, and limits the functionality of the electronic device in accordance with the determination that the third speech input does not correspond to any of the plurality of users. If a user not associated with the electronic device 190 makes a voice input to the electronic device 190, the electronic device 190 receives the voice input and attempts to identify the user. Since the user is not associated with the electronic device 190, there is no associated speech model in the speech model data 550, and the electronic device 190 determines that the user is an unrecognized user. For the unidentified user, the electronic device 190 may limit its functionality to prevent access to personal or private information. For example, the electronic device 190 may only act on requests from users of unknown identity that relate to non-private or non-personal information (e.g., requests for sports scores, news, stocks, weather). In some implementations, the electronic device 190 can deny the unrecognized user access to any functionality and voice assistant services of the electronic device 190 (e.g., by ignoring the unrecognized user's voice input or responding with a response indicating that the user is unauthorized). In some implementations, the restriction on functionality of the unrecognized user is based on the device's settings (e.g., voice device settings 546). The device owner may set, for example, whether to limit functionality to unidentified users entirely, or only to functionality that does not involve personal or private information.
In some implementations, the electronic device includes a display and displays an indication of the determined identity of the first user on the display. If the electronic device 190 includes the display 524, the electronic device 190 may display the identity of the identified user on the display 524 (e.g., display the name of the identified user, display a greeting with the name of the identified user, display a photograph, avatar, or other image associated with the identified user of the identified user) to indicate that the electronic device 190 has identified the speaker of the voice input, and give the user an opportunity to verify the identification.
In some implementations, the electronic device includes a display and displays a visual user interface associated with the determined first user on the display. If the electronic device 190 includes the display 524, the electronic device 190 may display a visual user interface identified by the identified user (e.g., a user interface having a theme associated with the identified user is applied). In some implementations, the electronic device 190 displays a pattern associated with the identified user on the LED 522.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 receives the speech input (e.g., captures a sample of the speech input), as at step 1102, and sends the speech input to the voice assistant server 112. The voice assistant server 112 compares the voice input to a set of voice models (e.g., voice models in the user's voice profile 744) associated with the plurality of users associated with the electronic device 190 and, based on the comparison, determines the identity of the user that spoken the voice input, similar to steps 1104 and 1106. The voice assistant server 112 generates a response to the voice input and transmits the generated response to the electronic device 190, and the electronic device 190 outputs the response. In some implementations, the voice assistant server 112 identifies the user and transmits the user identification result to the electronic device 190, and the electronic device 190 generates and outputs a response from the identification result received from the voice assistant server 112.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 receives the speech input (e.g., captures a sample of the speech input), performs pre-processing on the speech input, as in step 1102, and sends the pre-processed speech input to the voice assistant server 112. The pre-processing may include identifying the speaking user, as in steps 1104 and 1106, and the recognition results are accompanied by the speech input to the voice assistant server 112. Alternatively, user recognition is performed by the voice assistant server 112. The voice assistant server 112 receives the pre-processed speech input, identifies the speaking user if the electronic device 190 has not executed (similar to steps 1104 and 1106), generates a response to the speech input, and transmits the generated response to the electronic device 190, which the electronic device 190 outputs.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 receives the speech input (e.g., captures a sample of the speech input) and sends the speech input to the voice assistant server 112, or performs pre-processing and sends the pre-processed speech input to the voice assistant server 112. The voice assistant server 112 compares the voice input to a set of voice models (e.g., voice models in the user voice profile 744) associated with the plurality of users associated with the electronic device 190 and, based on the comparison, determines the identity of the user that spoken the voice input, as in steps 1104 and 1105. The voice assistant server 112 generates a response to the voice input and transmits the generated response to the electronic device 190, and the electronic device 190 outputs the response. In some implementations, the voice assistant server 112 identifies the user and transmits the user identification result to the electronic device 190, and the electronic device 190 generates and outputs a response from the identification result received from the voice assistant server 112.
As described above, a speaking user is identified by matching a speech model or speech fingerprint to the speech input. In some implementations, the electronic device 190 is configured to perform a process for capturing and training a speech model or speech fingerprint. For example, when a user is to be associated with (e.g., registered with) the electronic device 190, the electronic device 190 (e.g., the speech model training module 554) may initiate and guide the user in association with 190 the electronic device through a step-by-step process to capture and train the user's speech model. In this process, the electronic device 190 may prompt the user to speak one or more words or phrases (e.g., hotwords, phrases, or sentences including a plurality of different phonemes) in order to generate and train a speech model. The speech model training module 554 may instruct the LED control module 540 to illuminate various visual patterns on the LEDs 522 to indicate to the user the status of the speech model capture and training process. In some implementations, the electronic device 190 stores the trained speech models in the speech model data 550 and, optionally, transmits the trained speech models to the speech assistant server 112 for storage (e.g., in the user speech profile 744).
In some implementations, the specified user has a speech model for each electronic device 190 associated with the user. For a particular device, the speech models are trained at the respective devices 190 to account for the particular device and the environment surrounding the respective device.
In some implementations, the speech model training process is performed by the speech assistant server 112 in conjunction with the electronic device 190. For example, when a user is to be associated with electronic device 190, a speech model training module (not shown) at speech assistant server 112 transmits instructions and audio output to electronic device 190. Electronic device 190 executes the instructions and outputs audio output to guide the user through a training process similar to the training process performed by speech model training module 554 described above. The electronic device 190 captures user speech input to the training process and transmits the captured speech input to the voice assistant server 112, which generates speech models and stores them in the user speech profile 744. In some implementations, the voice assistant server 112 transmits the speech models of the user associated with the electronic device 190 to the electronic device 190 for storage (e.g., in the speech model data 550) and local use.
In some implementations, when generating and training a speech model for a user, an authentication token is also generated for the user. The authentication token authenticates the user to the voice assistant server 112. The speaker's speech input is matched to speech models associated with different users. When a matching voice model is found for the speaker voice input, the authentication token for the user account associated with the matching voice model is used. In some implementations, the authentication token is pre-generated, but is not initially associated with any speech model. The training process associates a speech model trained as a result of the training process with a pre-generated authentication token. In some implementations, after the electronic device 190 identifies the speaker of the voice input, the voice input (or data including the user request and related parameters determined from the voice input) is communicated to the voice assistant server 112 along with an authentication token associated with the speaker; the authentication token authenticates the speaker to the voice assistant server 112. In some implementations, a speaker may be associated with an authentication token that has been authorized for a user of any speaker. For example, a user associated with the electronic device 190 may configure his account to allow anyone to log in credentials using his music service so that other users may access any connected output devices (e.g., speakers) near the user device 190.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 identifies the speaking user by detecting nearby critical devices associated with the speaking user (e.g., using bluetooth low energy or ultrasonic RF).
In some implementations, the content host computer 114 generates an audible response to the voice input. For example, the voice input may include a request for a balance in a bank account associated with the user (e.g., "what is the balance in my Chase account. For such voice input, the electronic device 190 or the voice assistant server 112 identifies the speaking user, as described above. Upon identifying the user and obtaining bank account information (e.g., from user data 742), electronic device 190 or voice assistant server 112 transmits a query (e.g., through an Application Programming Interface (API)) of the account balance to a content host 114 (e.g., a database system of a bank) associated with the bank in which the bank account is located. The bank content host computer retrieves the balance from its database and generates an audible response in response to the request. The bank content host transmits an audible response to the electronic device 190 or the voice assistant server 112 (the voice assistant server 112 then transmits the audible response to the electronic device 190), and the electronic device 190 outputs the audible response. In this way, the transmission and storage of account data in digital form on networks and devices is reduced, which improves the security and privacy of user data.
Exemplary Process for device leader Negotiation
FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 1200 of negotiating a device leader among a plurality of voice interface devices, according to some embodiments. The method 1200 is implemented at an electronic device (e.g., device 1002-1,1002-2, or 1002-3) of two or more electronic devices 190 (electronic devices 1002), where each of the two or more electronic devices includes one or more microphones, a speaker, one or more processors, and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors.
The electronic device 190 detects a voice input (1202). The electronic device 190 captures and records a sample of the voice input from the user via the microphone 516.
The electronic device 190 determines a quality score of the detected speech input (1204). The electronic device 190 determines a score, rating, or some other metric of the quality of the captured voice input sample. The quality of the sample may be affected by a number of factors, including the distance of the user from the device, the volume at which the user speaks the speech input, the surrounding environment and noise, the capabilities of the device, and the like. In some embodiments, the criteria for assessing the quality of a speech sample include, for example, the volume or amplitude of the sample, the presence or absence of noise (e.g., crosstalk, hiss) and their respective levels, the presence or absence of distortion (e.g., echo) and respective levels, the frequency distribution of the sample, and so forth.
The electronic device 190 transmits the quality scores to other devices of the plurality of electronic devices (1206), and receives the quality scores generated by the other devices of the plurality of electronic devices to detect speech input by the other devices (1208). The electronic device 190 communicates the scores of its voice input samples to the other devices of the plurality of electronic devices and receives the scores of their respective voice input samples from the other devices.
In accordance with a determination that the quality score generated by the first electronic device for the voice input is highest in the generated quality score and the received quality score, the electronic device outputs an audible response and/or a visual response (e.g., a notification or an LED light pattern) to the detected voice input, and the other of the plurality of electronic devices forgo outputting the audible response to the detected voice input (1210). In some implementations, with respect to the devices of the speech input, the device with the highest score (or more generally, the best score) optionally preprocesses its respective speech input sample and transmits the speech input sample or preprocessed speech input sample to the speech assistant server 112, the speech assistant server 112 generates a response to the speech input, including an audible output (e.g., a user requested voice confirmation, reading the user requested information), and transmits the response to the device. Alternatively, the device with the highest score generates a response to the speech input. In either case, the device with the highest score (e.g., device 1002-1) outputs the response, and the other devices with lower scores (e.g., devices 1002-2 and 1002-3) do not output the response. In some implementations, the electronic device that is the leader (e.g., the device with the highest score in the examples herein) is also the leader with respect to processing or pre-processing subsequent speech inputs from the user.
In accordance with a determination that the quality score generated by the first electronic device is not the highest among the quality scores of the voice inputs generated by the plurality of electronic devices, the electronic device 190 discards the response to the detected voice input output. If the device determines that its score is not highest in the devices (e.g., devices 1002-2 and 1002-3) relative to the speech input, the device does not output a response to the speech input. For example, a device with a lower score turns off its speaker 520. In some implementations, the device with the lower score also turns off its microphone 516 so that only the device with the highest score detects further speech input. In some implementations, in accordance with a determination that the quality score generated by the first electronic device is not highest among the quality scores of the voice inputs generated by the plurality of electronic devices, the electronic device 190 forgoes outputting an audible response to the detected voice input and may output a visual response (e.g., a visual indication that the device is not determined to be a leader).
In some implementations, a plurality of electronic devices are communicatively coupled through a local network, and transmit and receive are performed through the local network. Electronic devices 190 are communicatively coupled through a local network (e.g., local network 104) and may communicate their scores to each other through the local network. For example, a device may multicast or broadcast its score over a local network.
If at least one of the devices is not on the local network, the device may communicate its score to the voice assistant server 112. In some implementations, the device leadership arbitration module 780 transmits the received scores to the devices, and the devices determine whether their respective scores are highest. In some implementations, the device leadership arbitration module determines which score is highest, and transmits the results of the determination to the devices. In some implementations, the hub device can include modules similar to the device leadership arbitration module 780 and function in a similar role.
In some embodiments, the quality score comprises a confidence in the detection of the voice input; the quality score is a confidence value of the speech input sample. In some embodiments, the quality score comprises a signal-to-noise ratio level of detection of the voice input; the quality score is a signal-to-noise ratio level or value (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio) of the speech input sample.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 recognizes a command in the voice input and outputs an audible and/or visual response to the detected voice input based on a determination that the type of command is associated with the first electronic device. If a command or request in the speech input is recognized as a command or request that is particularly relevant to a device of the plurality of devices that detected the speech input, that device outputs a response to the speech input and the other devices give up outputting the response, even if the device having the particular relevance of the command does not have the highest score in the device relative to the speech input. Examples of commands or requests with particular relevance include video playback requests (e.g., for a presentation or television device) and music playback requests (e.g., for an audio system or a speaker system). Further, a command or request is associated with device-specific if it recognizes that the user wishes a particular device to complete the request (e.g., the command "play video on my bedroom TV" is particularly relevant to TV devices in the bedroom, as the command explicitly identifies the device), or the command/request includes device status parameters that are applicable to the current status of the device (e.g., the "screen off" command is associated with a device whose screen is on, and not with a device that does not have a screen or whose screen is off).
In this way, multiple devices capture individual samples of the speech input and determine which sample is the best. Based on the determination, one of the devices responds to the speech input and further speech input from the user. In some embodiments, the plurality of devices repeats the above process for each voice input or at intervals of a predetermined number of voice inputs (e.g., again determining the leader at every 5 voice inputs or at every 10 voice inputs).
In some implementations, multiple devices detect voice input and send voice input samples captured thereof to the voice assistant server 112. The voice assistant server 112 aggregates the samples or selects the best quality sample to process or compare the samples to obtain the final portion of each sample. In some implementations, when multiple devices are receiving and detecting voice inputs, the devices each display a visual indication (e.g., a predefined LED pattern) that the user is listening.
Exemplary Process for noise reduction
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 1300 of reducing noise around a voice interface device, according to some embodiments. The method 1300 is implemented at an electronic device 190 having one or more microphones, a speaker, one or more processors, and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors. The electronic device 190 is configured to wake up through any of a variety of affordances, including voice-based affordances (e.g., voice inputs including hotwords).
The electronic device determines a current noise profile of an environment surrounding the electronic device (1302). The electronic device 190 may run the noise module 558 (e.g., the noise determination module 572) when idle to determine a noise profile of its surroundings. In some implementations, determining the current noise profile includes determining a noise level (e.g., volume) of the noise, as well as capturing and processing the ambient noise. This processing may include, for example, determining the frequency and other parameters of the ambient noise.
The electronic device determines whether the noise profile interferes with the voice-based affordance (1304). The electronic device 190 compares the determined noise profile to the noise profiles in the noise profile store 576 and evaluates parameters of the noise profiles to determine whether the noise profiles (i.e., the current noise surrounding the electronic device 190) interfere with the voice-based affordance.
In accordance with a determination that the noise profile interferes with the voice-based affordance, electronic device 190 presents a prompt to a user to wake the electronic device using an affordance of the plurality of affordances other than the voice-based affordance (1306). The prompt instructs the user to wake up the electronic device 190 using additional affordances in addition to the voice-based affordance. In some implementations, the cue is also or otherwise includes an indication that ambient noise interferes with hotword recognition. For example, the electronic device 190 can display a predetermined pattern on the LED522 that indicates that ambient noise interferes with the voice-based affordance and that prompts the user that the user should wake up the device using another affordance (e.g., press the button 512, touch the touch sensor array 514, use another device communicatively coupled to the electronic device 190, such as a smartphone). The indication/prompt may be displayed on the display 524 or output as a sound or tone through the speaker 520.
In some embodiments, among other things, the speech-based affordance includes a spoken hotword. The voice-based affordance includes the user speaking a hotword that wakes up the electronic device 190, as described above.
In some implementations, determining whether the noise profile interferes with the speech-based affordance includes determining whether the noise profile negatively affects identifying hotwords in speech input detected by the electronic device. The electronic device 190 determines whether ambient noise (represented by a noise distribution) will negatively impact the electronic device 190 in detecting/identifying the hotword (e.g., noise that is large enough to overwhelm the voice input of the user having the hotword, the noise having a frequency distribution that may interfere with the voice input of the user having the hotword, the noise will distort the voice input of the user having the hotword).
In some implementations, determining whether the noise profile negatively affects recognizing the hotword in the speech input includes comparing the noise profile to a noise level threshold of a hotword recognition process associated with the electronic device. The recognition analysis module 568 of the electronic device 190 (or the voice assistant server 112) analyzes the hotword recognition module 562 of the electronic device 190 (e.g., when the electronic device 190 is idle) to determine a noise threshold at which noise will cause problems to algorithms or processes used by the modules. These thresholds are saved and may be compared to the current noise distribution to determine whether the current noise distribution will cause problems to the hotword recognition module 562. The analysis by the hotword recognition module is relative to the electronic device 190, whereby the threshold varies from device to device.
In some implementations, determining whether the noise distribution negatively affects recognition of hotwords in the speech input includes comparing the noise distribution to a speech volume level threshold, wherein the speech volume level threshold is defined based on a predetermined distance from the electronic device. The user volume threshold module 570 of the electronic device 190 (or the voice assistant server 112) performs an analysis of the user's voice input to determine a maximum comfortable volume level at which the user will speak the voice input, the determination being based on a predetermined distance (e.g., a predefined distance based on a "typical user distance" beyond which the voice input will decay).
In some implementations, determining whether the noise distribution negatively affects recognition of the hotword in the speech input includes comparing the noise distribution to a predetermined set of noise distributions associated with the electronic device, wherein the noise distributions of the predetermined set of noise distributions are known to negatively affect recognition of the hotword by the electronic device in the speech input. The electronic device 190 compares the noise profile to a previous noise profile (e.g., in the noise profile store 576) that interfered with the hotword detection.
In some implementations, the electronic device includes a button, and an affordance, other than a voice-based affordance, of the plurality of affordances includes an activation button. The electronic device 190 includes a physical button 512 and the user can wake up the device by activating the button 512 rather than speaking a voice input with a hotword.
In some implementations, presenting a prompt to a user to wake the electronic device using an affordance other than a voice-based affordance in the plurality of affordances includes illuminating a button on the electronic device that corresponds to a button-based affordance in the plurality of affordances. The button 512 may include illumination (e.g., an embedded LED light), and the electronic device 190 may prompt the user to use the button 512 by illuminating the button 512 instead of speaking the hotword.
In some implementations, presenting a prompt to a user to wake the electronic device using an affordance of the plurality of affordances other than the voice-based affordance includes outputting a predetermined audible sound. Electronic device 190 may output a predetermined sound or tone (or set of sounds or tones) through speaker 520 to prompt the user to use the alternative affordance.
In some implementations, the electronic device includes a display, and presenting to the user a prompt to wake the electronic device using an affordance of the plurality of affordances other than the voice-based affordance includes displaying the prompt on the display. The electronic device 190 may prompt the user to use the alternative affordance by displaying a prompt message on the display 524.
In some implementations, the electronic device includes one or more LED lights, and presenting a prompt to the user to wake up the electronic device using a different one of the plurality of affordances than the voice-based affordance includes displaying the prompt using the one or more LED lights. The electronic device 190 may prompt the user to use the alternative affordance by displaying a predetermined light pattern on the LED 522.
Fig. 8A and 8B are front and back views 400 and 420 of a voice-activated electronic device 190 according to some embodiments. The electronic device 190 is designed to be warm and attractive and naturally fits in many areas of the home. The electronic device 190 includes one or more microphones 402 and an array of full color LEDs 404. The full color LEDs 404 can be hidden under the upper surface of the electronic device 190 and are not visible to the user when they are not lit. In some embodiments, the array of full color LEDs 404 is physically arranged in a ring. Further, the back side of the electronic device 190 optionally includes a power connector 408 configured to couple to a power source.
In some implementations, the electronic device 190 presents a neat appearance with no visible buttons, and interaction with the electronic device 190 is based on voice and touch gestures. Alternatively, in some implementations, the electronic device 190 includes a limited number of physical buttons (e.g., buttons 406 on its back), and the interaction with the electronic device 190 is further based on pressing a button in addition to voice and touch gestures.
In some embodiments, given the simplicity and low cost of the electronics 190, the electronics 190 include an array of full color Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) rather than a full screen display. The illumination of the full color LED array is configured in an LED design language and different visual patterns indicative of different speech processing states of the electronic device 190 are implemented. The LED design language includes a fixed set of colors, patterns, and specific motions applied in a full color LED. The elements in the language are combined to visually indicate a particular device state during use of the electronic device 190. In some embodiments, illumination of the full color LEDs is intended to explicitly depict the passive and active listening states of the electronic device 190 among other important states. The placement of the full-color LEDs conforms to the physical limitations of the electronic device 190, and the full-color LED array can be used in speakers manufactured by third party Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) based on a particular technology (e.g., Google assistant).
When full color LED arrays are used in third party OEM speakers manufactured based on a particular technology, the full color LEDs and LED design language are configured to fit the respective physical user interface of the OEM speaker. In this case, the device status of the OEM speaker remains unchanged, while the particular visual pattern representing the device status can change (e.g., the color of the full color LED can be different, but the color of the full color LED is displayed with a similar animation effect).
In a voice-activated electronic device 190, passive listening occurs when the electronic device 190 processes audio input collected from its surroundings but does not store the audio input or transmit the audio input to any remote server. Instead, active listening occurs when the electronic device 190 stores audio input collected from its surroundings and/or shares audio input with a remote server. According to some embodiments of the present application, the electronic device 190 passively listens only to audio input in the surrounding environment without disrupting the privacy of the user of the electronic device 190.
Fig. 8C is a top view of a voice activated electronic device 190 according to some embodiments, and fig. 8D shows six visual patterns displayed by a full color LED array for indicating voice processing status according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, the electronic device 190 does not include any display screen, and full color LEDs provide a simple and low cost visual user interface compared to full screen displays. Full color LEDs can be hidden under the top surface of the electronic device and are not visible to the user when not lit. Referring to fig. 8C and 8D, in some embodiments, the full color LED array is physically arranged in a ring.
