Definitions
- the invention relates generally to radiotelephone receivers, and more particularly to an automatic gain control apparatus and methods for radiotelephone receivers
- Radio frequency receivers are well known and have automatic gain control (AGC) circuits that attempt to provide control of one or more gain stages based on the detected input power levels to maintain a relatively constant power level. Accordingly, a large dynamic range of incoming signals is modified, such as attenuated or amplified, to provide a more constant level of signal for processing.
- AGC automatic gain control
- the digital stage may have an analog/digital converter and other digital circuitry to suitably control the analog gain stages.
- These two stage AGC circuits have been developed in an attempt to control a gain for time division multiple access (TDMA) signals and some code division multiple access (CDMA) systems.
- TDMA time division multiple access
- CDMA code division multiple access
- known AGC circuits typically may be too slow to accurately compute and control millions of chips per second of data, such as for CDMA systems.
- known CDMA type receivers may have a limited dynamic range that is too small and can be too slow to track input signals that can change quickly.
- low pass filter time constants of AGC input stages can be too slow to respond in order to suitably capture a low power, fast changing coded signal.
- CDMA receivers typically a wide band receiver is used that has a bandwidth of one to five MHz.
- such systems typically need to accommodate for fast fading signals over larger frequency ranges since mobile units may be quickly changing power levels depending upon their closeness to a transmitting or receiving station.
- CDMA systems allow mobile stations to use the same radio frequencies and differing codes. Accordingly, the receivers need to quickly detect varying power levels at the same frequency for different received codes.
- known AGC circuits control an in-phase and quadrature phase gain substantially independently which can result in code domain degradation.
- CDMA systems utilize in-phase and quadrature-phase demodulation sub-systems. Imbalances in the gain of these sub-systems create errors in the demodulation process. The ratio of the quadrature signal amplitude to the in-phase amplitude is used to measure the relative phase of the incoming signal; the square root of the total sum of the quadrature power and the in-phase power is used as an amplitude measurement. Any error in the demodulation process degrades the incoming signal measurement quality and this degradation is known as code domain degradation.
- the receiver automatically clips the signal, for example, if a DC offset is received as part of the signal, or truncates a low signal.
- AGC circuits and methods should attempt to have increased speed compared to dual stage receivers to accommodate CDMA input signals and other input signals that have rapidly changing power levels.
- DC offset correction should be employed to assist in more accurately controlling gain compensation for received signals.

- the memory 318 stores the previous result of the adder 316 and adds the previous result with the new sample.
- the memory 318 is cleared each time the average value of the samples is determined. However, it will be recognized that any other suitable methods of accumulating samples may also be used.
- a resulting 26-bit value 320 is stored in buffer 322 .
- a divide by N block 324 is used to obtain a per sample mean value 326 .
- a truncating block 328 truncates the mean value from a 28-bit value to a 21-bit value. In this embodiment, 21 bits allows up to 63 dB of dynamic range, which may be adequate for most applications.
- a truncated output mean value 330 serves as input to a subtractor 332 . The truncated output mean value 330 is the rounded version of the expected value of the variance.
- the feedforward DC offset compensator circuit 202 includes an in-phase DC compensation circuit 334 and a quadrature DC compensation circuit 336 .
- Each of the feedforward DC compensation circuits 334 and 336 are substantially identical in operation.
- a buffer 338 a and 338 b receives and stores respective samples of a digitized in-phase signal and a quadrature phase signal 302 a and 302 b .
- the feedforward DC offset compensation circuits 334 and 336 each include a summning stage 340 a and 340 b which includes a summer 342 a and corresponding memory 344 a for the in-phase signal, and summer 342 b and memory 344 b for the quadrature phase DC compensation circuit 336 .
- These summing stages 340 a and 340 b obtain an average sum for N samples, such as for 1820 samples as noted above.

- the gain assignment look up table is determined by the one or more gain stages 104 a , 104 b through 104 n .
- the first stages have the largest amount of gain. This approach allows the best noise figure of the overall cascaded amplifier. For example if 104 a is 0 or 32 dB gain stage, whenever the total gain is less than 32 dB it is set to 0 dB at the lookup table. However if the total gain is larger than 32 dB (say 34 db), the first stage is set to 32 dB and the next 2 dB is set by the lookup table to stage 104 b , and so on.
- the gain control 384 is input to digital analog converters 386 and 388 simultaneously so that gain control is applied to all gain stages at the same time. This can effectively speed up the attenuation or amplification as necessary.
- the comparator 376 is coupled to compare the automatic gain control value 374 which serves as a gain estimate, based on nonlinear data stored as inverse transfer function data.

- each branch may be performed during a manufacturing process to maintain a suitable I to Q ratio or the stored increase transfer function may be used to calibrate the receiver.
- the clock rate of the A/D converter should be chosen to adequately provide conversions based on the bandwidth of the incoming signal.
- the structure for blocks described herein may be implemented in any suitable fashion.
- memory elements and a suitably programmed digital signal processor, software, firmware, state machines, discrete logic or any other suitable structure may be used.

- the gain estimation circuit receives digital data representing a power level along the nonlinear portions of the inverse transfer function, the lookup table contains associated gain estimation values for those nonlinear portions of the receiver. The gain estimation circuit then applies these nonlinear values to determine the appropriate gain savings for the plurality of gain stages.
- One method for calibrating the apparatus shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B may be as follows. However, any suitable calibration method may be used.
- a 1 MHz offset signal tuned to the lowest channel number may be injected into the receiver at a level of minus 110 dBm.

- the entire process is repeated for the desired temperature ranges, such as ⁇ 20, 6, 30 and 60 degrees Celsius.
- a matrix of attenuator settings is interpolated in the processing device for 220 power levels, 12 channels and 16 temperatures.
- the matrix serves as the inverse transfer function of the receiver and is downloaded into the memory 108 .
- the power control circuit In operation, when a signal is received by the receiver, the power control circuit is brought to a nominal power level as measured by the internal power meter using the system attenuators, for example, the gain stages. Based on the known operating channel, the measured temperature and attenuator setting, an accurate measurement of the input power may be calculated from the calibration data or inverse transfer function data stored in memory. This determined power level or received signal strength indication value is then reported at a rate of approximately 625 microseconds to a receiver master controller, such a computer. It is coupled to access the results of 330 , 332 , 364 , 368 and formally 370 and 372 . It has access to the lookup tables 108 and 382 , and calibrates these tables by saving the required data into the tables. The table has inputs which are similar to address input of a memory and outputs like data output of a computer memory.
