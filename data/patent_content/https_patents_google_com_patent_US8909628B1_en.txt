- This specification relates to detection of content scraping.
- Content appearing in a resource e.g., web page, that is found in a particular site can be scraped, e.g., copied, using various techniques.
- the scraped content can be presented, in its entirety or a portion thereof, in a different site.
- This specification describes a system that can detect scraping, e.g., copying, of content from a site, e.g., a web site or other collection of data resources.
- the system can determine a site originality score for the site, based in part on the detected scraping, that represents a measure of originality of content presented in resources found in the site.
- the score can be determined by sampling n-grams from resources found in the site and by computing a ratio of sampled n-grams that originally appeared in the resources to the total number of n-grams that were sampled from the resources.
- the site originality score for a site can be used as a signal to rank resources, or to rank search results that identify resources, that are found in one site relative to resources found in another site.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of identifying a plurality of n-grams in a plurality of resources found in a particular site; determining, for each of the plurality of resources, a count of n-grams that originated in the resource; determining, based on counts of n-grams that originated in the resources, a first aggregate count of n-grams that originated in the particular site; determining a second aggregate count of the plurality of n-grams that were identified in the plurality of resources found in the particular site; and determining, based on the first and second aggregate counts, a site originality score for the particular site.
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- Identifying a plurality of n-grams in a resource comprises computing, for each n-gram in the resource, a corresponding hash value, and selecting a plurality of n-grams based on their corresponding hash values.
- Determining a first aggregate count of n-grams that originated in the particular site comprises summing the counts of n-grams that originated in each of the plurality of resources found in the particular site.
- Determining the site originality score comprises computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, wherein the numerator is based on the first aggregate count, and wherein the denominator is based on the second aggregate count.
- the ratio is multiplied by a specified value.
- the ratio is added to a specified value.
- the ratio is multiplied by a first specified value plus a second specified value.
- An n-gram is determined to originate in a resource found in a particular site by identifying a URL associated with an earliest crawl time stamp for the n-gram, and determining whether the identified URL matches a URL for the particular site.
- An n-gram that is determined to originate in a resource in a different site is inherited by the particular site when the n-gram is no longer available in the different site, and where a crawl time stamp for the n-gram in the particular site is the next earliest crawl time stamp for the n-gram.
- Site originality scores representing a measure of originality for sites can be computed.
- the site originality scores can be used to rank search results according to the web sites in which the resources identified by the results are found. For example, web sites including more original content can be promoted relative to web sites including the content as copied from another source.
- a site originality score for a site can be used as a term in the computation of scores for resources that are found in the site.

- a user 102 can interact with the search system 114 through a user device 104 .
- the user device 104 can be a computer coupled to the search system 114 through a data communication network 112 , e.g., a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks.
- the search system 114 can be implemented on the user device 104 , for example, if a user installs an application that performs searches on the user device 104 .
- the user device 104 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 106 , for storing instructions and data and a processor 108 for executing stored instructions.
- RAM random access memory
- the memory can include both read only and writable memory.
- the user device 104 can be a personal computer of some kind, a cloud client device, a smartphone, a tablet, or a personal digital assistant.
- the user device 104 can run an application program, e.g., a web browser, that can interact with the search system 114 to display web pages that provide a user interface to the search system 114 for the user 102 of the user device 104 .
- a user 102 can use the user device 104 to submit a query 110 to a search system 114 .
- a search engine 130 within the search system 114 performs the search to identify resources matching the query.
- the query 110 may be transmitted through the network 112 to the search system 114 .
- the search system 114 includes an index database 122 and the search engine 130 .
- the search system 114 responds to the query 110 by generating search results 128 , which are transmitted through the network to the user device 104 for presentation to the user 102 , e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed by a web browser running on the user device 104 .
- the term “database” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data: the data does not need to be structured in any particular way, or structured at all, and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more locations.
- the index database 122 can include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently.
- the term “engine” will be used broadly to refer to a software-based system or subsystem that can perform one or more specific functions. Generally, an engine will be implemented as one or more software modules or components, installed on one or more computers in one or more locations. In some cases, one or more computers will be dedicated to a particular engine; in other cases, multiple engines can be installed and running on the same computer or computers.
- the search engine 130 When the query 110 is received by the search engine 130 , the search engine 130 identifies resources that satisfy the query 110 .
- the search engine 130 will generally include an indexing engine 120 that indexes resources on the Internet and uses an index database 122 to store the index information, and a ranking engine 152 or other software that generates scores for the resources that satisfy the query 110 and that ranks the resources according to their respective scores.
- the search system 114 can include, and can communicate with, a site originality engine 140 that can generate site originality scores for sites.
- the site originality engine 140 can generate site originality scores based at least in part on shingles data 150 and site data 160 .
- the site originality scores can be used by the ranking engine 152 to adjust scores for the resources that satisfy the query 110 , and to rank the resources according to their respective adjusted scores.
- Shingles data 150 includes data that describes shingles. Shingles are contiguous subsequences of words that were obtained from resources in a collection of resources.
- the shingles data 150 includes one or more Internet addresses, e.g., a Uniform Resource Locators (URL), corresponding to a resource in a site in which the shingle was seen in the resource by the search system 114 , e.g., while crawling a web corpus, and a time stamp indicating when the shingle was crawled.
- URL Uniform Resource Locators
- the shingles data 150 can indicate the URL in which the shingle was first crawled by the search system 114 , e.g., based on the earliest crawl time stamp for the shingle, thus indicating the URL in which the particular shingle originated.
- the shingles data 150 can also indicate the URL in which the shingle was last crawled, e.g., based on the last crawl time stamp for the shingle.
- Site data 160 includes data that the system has that describes particular sites.
- Site data for a particular site can include resources, e.g., web pages, that are found in the particular site.
- the system can use the site data 160 to sample n-grams from resources that are found in a particular site. For example, the system can randomly select n-grams from resources found in a particular site.
- the system can determine, based in part on the shingles data 150 , a count of sampled n-grams that originated in resources found in the particular site.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining a site originality score.
- the process 200 will be described as performed by a system including one or more computing devices.
- a search system 114 as described in reference to FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 200 .
- the system samples n-grams from resources found in a particular site ( 202 ).
- the system can sample, from each resource found in the particular site, one or more n-grams, where the number of sampled n-grams can be an appropriate value, e.g., a number from 1 to 100, depending on various criteria, e.g., characteristics of the site or based on empirical data.
- the system samples, from each resource, all n-grams in the resource.
- Each n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items, e.g., a sequence of n words, from a given sequence of text in a resource, where the number of n items can be, e.g., a number from 1 to 10.
- n can be based on empirical data, for example, to identify an n-value that uniquely identifies original content. For example, sampled 6-grams can provide a greater ability to uniquely identify original content than sampled 2-grams.
- the system randomly selects one or more n-grams from each resource found in the particular site. For example, the system can randomly sample five 4-grams from each resource found in the particular site.
- the sampling of n-grams can be performed more methodically to allow consistency between the sampling of n-grams from resources found in different sites.
- the system hashes each n-gram in a resource using, e.g., a MinHash algorithm.
- the n-gram hash values are sorted, e.g., in a descending order, and the n-grams can be selected as samples based in part on their corresponding hash values, e.g., the system can select as samples the n-grams having the top ten highest hash values.
- the system determines, for resources found in the particular site, a count of n-grams that were sampled from the resource and that originated in that particular resource ( 204 ).
- the system can determine, for each resource found in the particular site, a count of n-grams that were sampled from the resource and that originated in the particular resource.
- the system can determine whether an n-gram originated in a resource based on the earliest crawl time stamp for the particular n-gram. For example, an n-gram that was crawled in resources found in site A on January 5, in resources found in site B on January 10, and in resources found in site C on January 15, is first crawled in resources found in site A, since the crawl time stamp of January 5 is earlier than the crawl time stamps for sites B and C.
- the system can count the number of n-grams that originated in each resource found in a particular site. For example, for a site that includes three resources, the system can determine that a first resource has five n-grams that were first crawled in the first resource, that a second resource has three n-grams that were first crawled in the second resource, and that a third resource has four n-grams that were first crawled in the third resource. In other words, the system can determine that the five n-grams that were first crawled in the first resource originated in the first resource, that the three n-grams that were first crawled in the second resource originated in the second resource, and that the four n-grams that were first crawled in the third resource originated in the third resource.
- the count can be for a particular time window to a current time, e.g., all shingles that were crawled by the system in the preceding day, two days, week or month, for example, or over all shingles data available to the system.
- the system can determine a count of n-grams that were sampled from the resources found in the particular site and that originated in those resources by matching each sampled n-gram with shingles, e.g., in the shingles data 150 , as described in reference to FIG. 1 .
- an n-gram matches a shingle if the sequence of items in the sampled n-gram is identical, or is similar according to some similarity measure, to the sequence of items in the shingle.
- a trigram “lazy red dog” matches a shingle “lazy red dog,” but does not match a shingle “dog red lazy.”
- the system determines whether an n-gram matches a shingle by computing a first hash value for the sampled n-gram and a second hash value for the shingle, and by comparing the first and second hash values. In such implementations, the n-gram and the shingle match if the first and second hash values satisfy a threshold.
- the system can determine, using the shingles data, whether the sampled n-gram originated in the resources found in the particular site. In some implementations, the system determines whether the sampled n-gram originated in the resources found in the particular site by determining whether the URL associated with the earliest crawl time stamp for the particular shingle matches the URL for the particular site.
- the system may determine that the n-gram that was sampled from a resource found in the particular site originated in a different resource that is found in a different site.
- content from the different resource, which includes the sampled n-gram may have been copied and, therefore, may not be content that originates from the particular site. Accordingly, in such cases, the sampled n-gram may not be included in the count.
- the different site in which the sampled n-gram originated may have moved its content to the particular site, e.g., the different site may have changed its domain name to the particular site. In such situations, the sampled n-gram that originated in the different site may still be considered content that originates from the particular site.
- the system determines whether the particular site should inherit a sampled n-gram from a different site in which the sampled n-gram originated. In such implementations, the system identifies all sites for which the sampled n-gram has a crawl time stamp prior to the crawl time stamp for the particular site. Once the sites have been identified, the system can determine whether the sampled n-gram is still available in the identified sites.
- the system can designate the particular site as the inheritor of the sampled n-gram and the sampled n-gram is deemed to originate from the particular site. In such situations, the sampled n-gram is included in the count.
- the system can identify resources that are found in sites A and B, in which the sampled trigram was also crawled.
- the system can use, e.g., shingles data, to determine that the sampled n-gram originated in site A on January 3 and was crawled in site B on January 15, both of which are dates prior to the January 18 crawl date for the particular site.
- the system can determine whether the sampled n-gram is still available in sites A and B.
- the system can designate the particular site as the inheritor of the sampled trigram and can include the sampled trigram in the count of n-grams that originated in the particular site.
- the system can designate site B as the inheritor of the sampled trigram over the particular site, since the date on which the sampled n-gram was available in site B, e.g., as observed during the crawling of resources, by the system, in site B, is earlier than the date the sampled n-gram was available in the particular site.
- the system determines whether a sampled n-gram is still available in a resource by selecting one or more n-grams from the resource, and by comparing the sampled n-gram to the n-grams selected from the resource to determine whether there is a match.
- the selection of n-grams from the resource can be accomplished by computing hash values for each n-gram in the resource, e.g., using a MinHash algorithm, and by selecting one or more n-grams based on their corresponding hash values. For example, the system can select the n-grams having the top ten highest hash values.
- the system can determine that the sampled n-gram is still available in the resource. If the sampled n-gram does not match an n-gram that was selected from the resource, then it may be the case that the sampled n-gram is no longer available in the resource or that the sampled n-gram is still available in the resource but was not captured during the selection of n-grams from the resource.
- the system when the sampled n-gram does not match an n-gram that was selected from the resource, the system gives the particular site a partial count for the sampled n-gram, e.g., a value from 0 to 1, e.g., 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, or 1.
- the partial count is included in the count of n-grams that originated in the particular site.
- a sampled n-gram may be included in the count of n-grams that originated in the particular site despite having been determined, by the system, to originate in a different site in which the sampled n-gram is still available.
- a sampled n-gram that originated in a site other than the particular site is included in the count of n-grams that originated in the particular site if the time difference between the crawl time stamp for the sampled n-gram in the site and the crawl time stamp for the sampled n-gram in the particular site is within a threshold time.
- n-grams that originated in the second site since the time difference between January 19 and January 20 is one day.
- the system aggregates the counts of n-grams that were sampled from the resources found in the particular site and that originated in the particular resources ( 206 ). For example, for a site that includes two resources, the system can determine that a first resource has five n-grams that originated in the first resource and that a second resource has four n-grams that originated in the second resource. The system can aggregate the counts to determine that there are nine n-grams that originated in resources found in the particular site.
- the system determines a site originality score for the particular site ( 208 ).
- the site originality score can be determined by computing a ratio of sampled n-grams that originated in the resources found in the particular site to a total count of n-grams that were sampled from the resources found in the particular site.
- the ratio can be represented by a fraction in which the numerator represents an aggregate count of sampled n-grams that originated in the resources found in the particular site and the denominator represents an aggregate count of n-grams that were sampled from the resources found in the particular site.
- F/T the aggregate count of sampled n-grams that originated in the resources found in the particular site
- T the aggregate count of n-grams that were sampled from the resources found in the particular site.
- a site originality score can also be determined by computing a ratio of a numerator and a denominator, where the numerator is based on the aggregate count of sampled n-grams that originated in the resources found in the particular site, and where the denominator is based on the aggregate count of n-grams that were sampled from the resources found in the particular site, where the ratio adjusted, e.g., by being multiplied by a constant, for example, a number greater than or equal to 0.
