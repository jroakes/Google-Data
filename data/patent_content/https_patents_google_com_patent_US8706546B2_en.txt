Definitions
- the present invention concerns advertising, such as online advertising for example.
- the present invention concerns selecting and/or scoring content-relevant advertisements (“ads”).
- Interactive advertising provides opportunities for advertisers to target their ads to a receptive audience. That is, targeted ads are more likely to be useful to end users since the ads may be relevant to a need inferred from some user activity (e.g., relevant to a user's search query to a search engine, relevant to content in a document requested by the user, etc.).
- Query keyword targeting has been used by search engines to deliver relevant ads.
- the AdWords advertising system by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. (referred to as “Google”), delivers ads targeted to keywords from search queries.
- content targeted ad delivery systems have been proposed. For example, U.S. patent application Ser. No.
- Harik, Deepak Jindal and Narayanan Shivakumar as inventors describe methods and apparatus for serving ads relevant to the content of a document, such as a Web page for example.
- Content targeted ad delivery systems such as the AdSense advertising system by Google for example, have been used to serve ads on Web pages.
- the '900 application describes how so-called “targeting criteria” (or simply “criteria”, whether used in the singular or plural form), used to look up relevant ads, may be determined in an exemplary embodiment.
- targeting criteria or simply “criteria”, whether used in the singular or plural form
- the '900 application describes that an off-line (perhaps nightly) dump of a complete ads database is used to generate an index that maps topics (e.g., a PHIL cluster identifiers) to a set of matching ad groups.
- a document may be associated with one or more ads using a document identifier (e.g., a URL) to determine one or more ads.
- the document information may have been processed to generate relevance information, such as a cluster (e.g., a PHIL cluster), a topic, etc.
- the document clusters may then be used as query terms in a large OR query to an index that maps topics (e.g., PHIL cluster identifiers) to a set of matching ad groups, via the index that maps topics to ad groups.
- the results of this query may then be used as first cut set of candidate criteria. More specifically, the candidate ad groups may then be used to determine an actual information retrieval (IR) score for each ad group summarizing how well the criteria information plus the ad text itself matches the document relevance information. Estimated or known performance parameters (e.g., selection rates, conversion rates, etc.) for the ad group may be considered in helping determine the best scoring ad group(s). Targeting criteria associated with the best scoring ad group(s) can be used as “criteria” to determine a final set of ads.
- IR information retrieval
- a content-relevant an ad server can use the set of one or more “criteria” to request ads.
- the provided ads may participate in an arbitration (e.g., an auction) to place the ads in available ad spots, to provide the ads with enhanced features or treatments (e.g., enhanced colors, enhanced fonts, images, animation, etc.), etc.
- a requestor may request that an ad be sent back if K of the M criteria sent match a single ad group.
- Each of the queries could be processed in sequence until any ad, without regard to the number of ads, is returned.
- raw_query 0 could be processed. If any ads matched any of crit 0 through crit 15 , these ads would be returned (for subsequent processing) and the other raw queries would not be processed. If no ads were returned for raw_query 0 , raw_query 1 would be processed, and so on.
- ad A was returned because it had a targeting criteria that matched crit 1
- ad B was returned because it had a targeting criteria that matched crit 9 .
- ad A is more relevant to the document content than ad B.
- this fact is ignored in an arbitration in which ad A and ad B compete.
- processing multiple requests leads to complexity and extra load on processing and communications resources, particularly in a distributed environment.
- Embodiments consistent with the present invention may be used to score ads eligible to be served with a document (for example, because they are relevant to the document).
- each ad is scored using a price parameter associated with the ad and an indication of relevancy of the ad to the document.
- the indication of relevancy of the ad to the document is based on an ordinal ranking of a relevancy criteria of the document used to select the ad, and/or a value of a relevancy criteria of the document used to select the ad.
- the eligible ads are determined by obtaining relevancy criteria for the document and selecting ads using at least some of the obtained relevancy criteria.
- the ads are selected, and perhaps filtered, in a distributed manner.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram showing parties or entities that can interact with an advertising system.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating an environment in which, or with which, embodiments consistent with the present invention may operate.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method for determining and scoring ads in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a distributed ad serving system.

- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of apparatus that may be used to perform at least some operations, and store at least some information, in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- the present invention may involve novel methods, apparatus, message formats, and/or data structures for selecting and/or scoring content-relevant ads.
- the following description is presented to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications and their requirements.
- the following description of embodiments consistent with the present invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the precise form disclosed.
- Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles set forth below may be applied to other embodiments and applications.
- a series of acts may be described with reference to a flow diagram, the order of acts may differ in other implementations when the performance of one act is not dependent on the completion of another act. Further, non-dependent acts may be performed in parallel.
- Online ads may have various intrinsic features. Such features may be specified by an application and/or an advertiser. These features are referred to as “ad features” below.
- ad features may include a title line, ad text, and an embedded link.
- ad features may include images, executable code, and an embedded link.
- ad features may include one or more of the following: text, a link, an audio file, a video file, an image file, executable code, embedded information, etc.
- Serving parameters may include, for example, one or more of the following: features of (including information on) a document on which, or with which, the ad was served, a search query or search results associated with the serving of the ad, a user characteristic (e.g., their geographic location, the language used by the user, the type of browser used, previous page views, previous behavior, user account, any Web cookies used by the system, user device characteristics, etc.), a host or affiliate site (e.g., America Online, Google, Yahoo) that initiated the request, an absolute position of the ad on the page on which it was served, a position (spatial or temporal) of the ad relative to other ads served, an absolute size of the ad, a size of the ad relative to other ads, a color of the ad, a number of other ads
- a user characteristic e.g., their geographic location, the language used by the user, the type of browser used, previous page views, previous behavior, user account, any Web cookies used by the system
- serving parameters may be extrinsic to ad features, they may be associated with an ad as serving conditions or constraints. When used as serving conditions or constraints, such serving parameters are referred to simply as “serving constraints” (or “targeting criteria”). For example, in some systems, an advertiser may be able to target the serving of its ad by specifying that it is only to be served on weekdays, no lower than a certain position, only to users in a certain location, etc. As another example, in some systems, an advertiser may specify that its ad is to be served only if a page or search query includes certain keywords or phrases.
- an advertiser may specify that its ad is to be served only if a document, on which, or with which, the ad is to be served, includes certain topics or concepts, or falls under a particular cluster or clusters, or some other classification or classifications (e.g., verticals).
- an advertiser may specify that its ad is to be served only to (or is not to be served to) user devices having certain characteristics.
- an ad might be targeted so that it is served in response to a request sourced from a particular location, or in response to a request concerning a particular location.
- Ad information may include any combination of ad features, ad serving constraints, information derivable from ad features or ad serving constraints (referred to as “ad derived information”), and/or information related to the ad (referred to as “ad related information”), as well as an extension of such information (e.g., information derived from ad related information).
- the ratio of the number of selections (e.g., clickthroughs) of an ad to the number of impressions of the ad (i.e., the number of times an ad is rendered) is defined as the “selection rate” (or “clickthrough rate”) of the ad.
- a “conversion” is said to occur when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served ad. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, it may be the case that a conversion occurs when a user clicks on an ad, is referred to the advertiser's Web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that Web page. Alternatively, a conversion may be defined as a user being shown an ad, and making a purchase on the advertiser's Web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days).
- a conversion may be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, registering on a Website, etc.
- user actions don't indicate a consummated purchase, they may indicate a sales lead, although user actions constituting a conversion are not limited to this. Indeed, many other definitions of what constitutes a conversion are possible.
- the ratio of the number of conversions to the number of impressions of the ad i.e., the number of times an ad is rendered
- the ratio of the number of conversions to the number of selections or the number of some other earlier event
- conversion rate The type of conversion rate will be apparent from the context in which it is used. If a conversion is defined to be able to occur within a predetermined time since the serving of an ad, one possible definition of the conversion rate might only consider ads that have been served more than the predetermined time in the past.
- a “property” is something on which ads can be presented.
- a property may include online content (e.g., a Website, an MP3 audio program, online games, etc.), offline content (e.g., a newspaper, a magazine, a theatrical production, a concert, a sports event, etc.), and/or offline objects (e.g., a billboard, a stadium score board, and outfield wall, the side of truck trailer, etc.).
- Properties with content may be referred to as “media properties.”
- properties may themselves be offline, pertinent information about a property (e.g., attribute(s), topic(s), concept(s), category(ies), keyword(s), relevancy information, type(s) of ads supported, etc.) may be available online.
- pertinent information about a property e.g., attribute(s), topic(s), concept(s), category(ies), keyword(s), relevancy information, type(s) of ads supported, etc.
- an outdoor jazz music festival may have entered the topics “music” and “jazz”, the location of the concerts, the time of the concerts, artists scheduled to appear at the festival, and types of available ad spots (e.g., spots in a printed program, spots on a stage, spots on seat backs, audio announcements of sponsors, etc.).
- a “document” is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may be a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, etc.
- the files may be of any type, such as text, audio, image, video, etc.
- Parts of a document to be rendered to an end user can be thought of as “content” of the document.
- a document may include “structured data” containing both content (words, pictures, etc.) and some indication of the meaning of that content (for example, e-mail fields and associated data, HTML tags and associated data, etc.)
- Ad spots in the document may be defined by embedded information or instructions.
- a common document is a Web page.
- Web pages often include content and may include embedded information (such as meta information, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript, etc.).
- a document has an addressable storage location and can therefore be uniquely identified by this addressable location.
- a universal resource locator (URL) is an address used to access information on the Internet.
- a “Web document” includes any document published on the Web. Examples of Web documents include, for example, a Website or a Web page.
- Document information may include any information included in the document, information derivable from information included in the document (referred to as “document derived information”), and/or information related to the document (referred to as “document related information”), as well as an extensions of such information (e.g., information derived from related information).
- document derived information is a classification based on textual content of a document.
- document related information include document information from other documents with links to the instant document, as well as document information from other documents to which the instant document links.
- Content from a document may be rendered on a “content rendering application or device”.
- content rendering applications include an Internet browser (e.g., Explorer, Netscape, Opera, Firefox, etc.), a media player (e.g., an MP3 player, a Realnetworks streaming audio file player, etc.), a viewer (e.g., an Abobe Acrobat pdf reader), etc.
- a “content owner” is a person or entity that has some property right in the content of a media property (e.g., document).
- a content owner may be an author of the content.
- a content owner may have rights to reproduce the content, rights to prepare derivative works of the content, rights to display or perform the content publicly, and/or other proscribed rights in the content.
- a content server might be a content owner in the content of the documents it serves, this is not necessary.
- a “Web publisher” is an example of a content owner.
- User information may include user behavior information and/or user profile information.
- E-mail information may include any information included in an e-mail (also referred to as “internal e-mail information”), information derivable from information included in the e-mail and/or information related to the e-mail, as well as extensions of such information (e.g., information derived from related information).
- An example of information derived from e-mail information is information extracted or otherwise derived from search results returned in response to a search query composed of terms extracted from an e-mail subject line.
- Examples of information related to e-mail information include e-mail information about one or more other e-mails sent by the same sender of a given e-mail, or user information about an e-mail recipient.
- Information derived from or related to e-mail information may be referred to as “external e-mail information.”
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an advertising environment.
- the environment may include an ad entry, maintenance and delivery system (simply referred to as an ad server) 120 .
- Advertisers 110 may directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in the system 120 .
- the ads may be in the form of graphical ads such as so-called banner ads, text only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads may also include embedded information, such as a link, and/or machine executable instructions.
- Ad consumers 130 may submit requests for ads to, accept ads responsive to their request from, and provide usage information to, the system 120 .
- An entity other than an ad consumer 130 may initiate a request for ads.
- other entities may provide usage information (e.g., whether or not a conversion or selection related to the ad occurred) to the system 120 . This usage information may include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served.
- the ad server 120 may be similar to the one described in the '900 application.
- An advertising program may include information concerning accounts, campaigns, creatives, targeting, etc.
- the term “account” relates to information for a given advertiser (e.g., a unique e-mail address, a password, billing information, etc.).
- a “campaign” or “ad campaign” refers to one or more groups of one or more advertisements, and may include a start date, an end date, budget information, geo-targeting information, syndication information, etc.
- Honda may have one advertising campaign for its automotive line, and a separate advertising campaign for its motorcycle line.
- the campaign for its automotive line may have one or more ad groups, each containing one or more ads.
- Each ad group may include targeting information (e.g., a set of keywords, a set of one or more topics, etc.), and price information (e.g., cost, average cost, or maximum cost (per impression, per selection, per conversion, etc.)). Therefore, a single cost, a single maximum cost, and/or a single average cost may be associated with one or more keywords, and/or topics.
- each ad group may have one or more ads or “creatives” (That is, ad content that is ultimately rendered to an end user.).
- Each ad may also include a link to a URL (e.g., a landing Web page, such as the home page of an advertiser, or a Web page associated with a particular product or server).
- the ad information may include more or less information, and may be organized in a number of different ways.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an environment 200 in which the present invention may be used.
- a user device also referred to as a “client” or “client device”
- client device 250 may include a browser facility (such as the Explorer browser from Microsoft, the Opera Web Browser from Opera Software of Norway, the Navigator browser from AOL/Time Warner, the Firefox browser from Mozilla, etc.), an e-mail facility (e.g., Outlook from Microsoft), etc.
- a search engine 220 may permit user devices 250 to search collections of documents (e.g., Web pages).
- a content server 230 may permit user devices 250 to access documents.
- An e-mail server (such as GMail from Google, Hotmail from Microsoft Network, Yahoo Mail, etc.) 240 may be used to provide e-mail functionality to user devices 250 .
- An ad server 210 may be used to serve ads to user devices 250 .
- the ads may be served in association with search results provided by the search engine 220 .
- content-relevant ads may be served in association with content provided by the content server 230 , and/or e-mail supported by the e-mail server 240 and/or user device e-mail facilities.
- ads may be targeted to documents served by content servers.
- an ad consumer 130 is a general content server 230 that receives requests for documents (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, Web page listings, etc.), and retrieves the requested document in response to, or otherwise services, the request.
- the content server may submit a request for ads to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- Such an ad request may include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request may also include document request information.
- This information may include the document itself (e.g., page), a category or topic corresponding to the content of the document or the document request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the document request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, document information, etc.
- a category or topic corresponding to the content of the document or the document request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, document information, etc.
- the content server 230 may combine the requested document with one or more of the advertisements provided by the ad server 120 / 210 . This combined information including the document content and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the end user device 250 that requested the document, for presentation to the user. Finally, the content server 230 may transmit information about the ads and how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., position, selection or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.) back to the ad server 120 / 210 . Alternatively, or in addition, such information may be provided back to the ad server 120 / 210 by some other means.
- the offline content provider 232 may provide information about ad spots in an upcoming publication, and perhaps information about the publication (e.g., the content or topics or concepts of the content), to the ad server 210 .
- the ad server 210 may provide a set of ads relevant the content of the publication for at least some of the ad spots.
- Examples of offline content providers 232 include, for example, magazine publishers, newspaper publishers, book publishers, offline music publishers, offline video game publishers, a theatrical production, a concert, a sports event, etc.
- Owners of the offline ad spot properties 234 may provide information about ad spots in their offline property (e.g., a stadium scoreboard banner ad for an NBA game in San Antonio, Tex.).
- the ad sever may provide a set of ads relevant to the property for at least some of the ad spots.
- Examples of offline properties 234 include, for example, a billboard, a stadium score board, and outfield wall, the side of truck trailer, etc.
- search engine 220 may receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine may retrieve relevant search results (e.g., from an index of Web pages).
- relevant search results e.g., from an index of Web pages.
- An exemplary search engine is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference , Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999 (both incorporated herein by reference).
- search results may include, for example, lists of Web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those Web pages, and hypertext links to those Web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine 220 may submit a request for ads to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, etc. In one embodiment, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, and preferably from three to five.
- the request for ads may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geolocation information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., Web pages), full text of identified documents, topics of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- identifiers related to the search results e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”
- scores related to the search results e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores
- snippets of text extracted from identified documents e.g., Web pages
- full text of identified documents e.g., topics of
- the search engine 220 may combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the ad server 120 / 210 . This combined information including the search results and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the user that submitted the search, for presentation to the user.
- the search results are maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the search engine 220 may transmit information about the ad and when, where, and/or how the ad was to be rendered (e.g., position, selection or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.) back to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- information about the ad and when, where, and/or how the ad was to be rendered e.g., position, selection or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.
- such information may be provided back to the ad server 120 / 210 by some other means.
- the e-mail server 240 may be thought of, generally, as a content server in which a document served is simply an e-mail.
- e-mail applications such as Microsoft Outlook for example
- an e-mail server 240 or application may be thought of as an ad consumer 130 .
- e-mails may be thought of as documents, and targeted ads may be served in association with such documents. For example, one or more ads may be served in, under, over, or otherwise in association with an e-mail.
- servers as (i) requesting ads, and (ii) combining them with content
- a client device such as an end user computer for example
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 300 for selecting and scoring ads in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- a request including document information is accepted.
- ad search criteria may be determined using the accepted document information.
- the determined criteria may be ranked.
- a weight may be assigned using the rankings.
- Eligible ads are selected (e.g., identified) using the criteria.
- the number of eligible ads may be decreased (e.g., using filtering).
- the identified eligible ads may then be scored using their associated criteria weights (Block 370 ) before the method 300 is left (Node 380 ).
- the request may specify the number of ads desired.
- the request may specify a type of ad (e.g., text only, audio, video, image, etc.) desired.
- the document information may be a document identifier.
- the document information may be a URL.
- the document information may include content (extracted) from the document.
- the document information may include topics or concepts (e.g., PHIL clusters) of the document content.
- the criteria weights for each criteria may be based on how relevant that criteria is to the document.
- the MAC can be selected as desired. For example, tuning the MAC may be used to tune the relative importance of click through rate (“CTR”) and cost per click (“CPC”) when scoring the ads (e.g., for use in an arbitration or auction).
- CTR click through rate
- CPC cost per click
- ads for each of the crit i may be determined.
- an AD j is selected due to crit i that ad is assigned cw i .
- each ad may include a criteria weight.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary distributed ad serving system 400 provided in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- the number of shards may be a function of the amount of advertiser information stored on each shard, as well as the storage capacity of each shard.
- Each of the shards 440 has access to different sets of ad information, and returns, to the ad mixer 410 , a reply with ad(s) matching one or more of the criteria of the query.
- the ad mixer 410 may then select a final set of one or more ads to be provided in a reply.
- shards 2-T 440 can operate on a request in parallel, considering different sets of ad information.
- the ad mixer 410 need not determine the criteria itself.
- the criteria may have been provided in the ad request, or may be determined by another component (not shown). In either case, the ad mixer 410 might weight a set of rank ordered criteria.
- FIG. 5 is a bubble diagram of exemplary operations that may be performed in a manner consistent with the present invention, as well as information that may be used and/or generated by such operations, in a distributed ad serving system such as that 400 of FIG. 4 .
- An exemplary ad mixer 510 may include document to criteria serving operations 520 , ad arbitration operations 580 , and document criteria information 530 .
- Each shard 540 may include criteria to ad serving operations 550 and ad information 560 .
- Each shard 540 may also include ad filtering/reduction operations 570 .
- an ad request including document information may be received by document to criteria serving operations 520 .
- These operations 520 may use the document information to obtain criteria using document criteria information 530 .
- the document information in the request may be (or include) a document identifier (e.g., a URL of a Webpage) and the document criteria information 530 may be an index mapping document identifiers to one or more criteria.

- an actual relevancy score of the criteria to the document (and/or ad) may be used instead of, or in addition to, rank when determining the criteria weight.
- the exemplary arbitration described above used a product of CTR, CPC and CW, other factors may be used instead of, or in addition to CTR and CPC.
- the score may be the product of CW and cost per (thousand) impression(s).
- the main drawback of using a distributed approach is that the shards 440 might process all of the criteria and return all the ads for all of these criteria at once. This can adversely affect the ad mixer 410 , shards 440 and the communications link(s) between them (e.g., in terms of CPU load, network load and latency, etc.). On or more of the following refinements may be used to mitigate such adverse affects.
- some form of compression may be used to compress the communications between the ad mixer 410 and the shards 440 to limit the amount of network bandwidth.
- the ad mixer 410 may filter ads (e.g., using publisher-specific (or document source-specific) filters.
- ads e.g., using publisher-specific (or document source-specific) filters.
- the shards 440 might be instructed to limit (e.g., the number of) the ads returned.
- the shards 440 may be provided with constraints (e.g., a threshold predicted eCPM) that may, in effect, reduce the number of ads returned by the shards 440 .
- the shards might pass the eCPM value(s) to the ad mixer 410 so that the ad mixer doesn't need to re-determine it or them. That is in some embodiments, the eCPM determination may be distributed to the shards 440 . However, in at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention, the ad mixer 410 might have access to a better estimate of ad CTRs than the shards 440 . In such a case, it might be desirable to have each shard 440 (or the shards 440 to collectively) return more candidate ads than requested by the document publisher.
- most of the filtering of ads is done in the ad mixer 410 .
- at least some of this filtering may be moved to the shards 440 .
- This refinement can be used to reduce the number of ads that need to be sent to the ad mixer 410 , thereby saving CPU resource of the ad mixer 410 and communications resources of link(s) between the shards 440 and the ad mixer 410 .
- a Webpage includes an article on caring for the German Sheppard breed of dogs and has two available ad spots, the first ad spot being preferred over the second.
- Webpage criteria are ordered as follows:
- the criteria weight (CW) for each criteria is determined in accordance with equation [2] above, and that MAC is set to 0.5.
- the criteria weights would be:
- AD1 would be served in the first ad spot
- AD2 would be served in the second ad spot
- AD3 would not be served.
- the first criteria (c1) gets a 0.5 4 advantage over the fifth criteria (c5). Assuming that two ads had the same CTR, an ad triggered by the fifth criteria (and none higher) would have to pay 16 times as much as an ad triggered by the first criteria.
- AD3 would be served in the first ad spot
- AD2 would again be served in the second ad spot
- AD1 would not be served.
- embodiments consistent with the present invention improve over other ad arbitration techniques in that they account for how well the document content matches criteria used to find relevant ads.
- the relevance of the criteria to the document content may be represented by cw i .
- more ad spots may be filled and competition for ad spots may increase.
- at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention can reduce processor, communications, and/or storage resources used when determining content-relevant ads to be served with a document.
Abstract
Description
raw_query0=“crit0—OR_crit1—OR_crit2 . . . _OR_crit15”;
raw_query1=“crit16—OR_crit17—OR_crit18 . . . _OR_crit30”;
raw_query2=“crit31—OR_crit32—OR_crit33 . . . _OR_crit45”; and
raw_query3=“crit46—OR_crit47—OR_crit48 . . . _OR_crit60”. [1]
for example. Each of the queries could be processed in sequence until any ad, without regard to the number of ads, is returned. For example, raw_query0 could be processed. If any ads matched any of crit0 through crit15, these ads would be returned (for subsequent processing) and the other raw queries would not be processed. If no ads were returned for raw_query0, raw_query1 would be processed, and so on.
cwi=MACi [2]
where MAC (Modified Arbitration Constant) is between 1.0 and 0.0. The MAC can be selected as desired. For example, tuning the MAC may be used to tune the relative importance of click through rate (“CTR”) and cost per click (“CPC”) when scoring the ads (e.g., for use in an arbitration or auction). When the MAC is increased, the arbitration becomes more competitive—the importance of a CPC offer and CTR increases, but better criteria lose some of their advantage. Conversely, when the MAC is decreased, the arbitration becomes less competitive—the importance of a CPC offer and CTR decreases, and more relevant criteria gain an advantage.
raw_query=“crit0—OR_crit1—OR_crit2 . . . _OR_critN” [3]
criteria_weights={cw0,cw1,cw2, . . . cwN} [4]
Using this request, ads for each of the criti may be determined. In at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention, if an ADj is selected due to criti that ad is assigned cwi. In at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention, if an ad is, or could have been, selected due to more than one criteria, it is given the higher of the two criteria weights. Thus, when the ads are passed back to the request source, each ad may include a criteria weight.
eCPM j =CTR j *CPC j *CW j [5]
Suppose that this eCPM score is used in an ad arbitration to determine a placement order of eligible ads. Suppose that ADj and ADk have the same CTR, but CWj=0.5, while CWk=1.0. This means that for ADj to appear before ADk, it must pay twice as much in CPC, or to put it another way, ADj can beat ADk with half the CPC.

eCPM j =CTR j *CPC j *CW j
AD1 | KWs: t-shirt, “german sheppard, dog | CTR: 0.045 | CPC: $0.25 |
AD2 | KWs: veterinarian | CTR: 0.04 | CPC: $1.75 |
AD3 | KWs: vaccine, flu | CTR: 0.06 | CPC: $2.00 |
