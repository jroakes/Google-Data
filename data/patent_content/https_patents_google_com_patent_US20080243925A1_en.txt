Definitions
- the present invention concerns providing messages on properties with batch distribution constraints, such as offline publications for example.
- Some current online advertising networks serve online ad impressions per the browser request of a single user. Advertisers pay each time an end-user clicks on one of these ads (to go to an advertiser's Website or a landing page specified by the ad). The ad serving entity and the online publisher typically share a portion of the proceeds. In a day, ads are shown only as many times as the system predicts an advertiser's budget can afford, given a predicted number of clicks and the price paid per click.
- offline ads such as those sent via text-only emails or ads printed and circulated via a printed publication like a magazine or newspaper
- offline ads do not allow for a request-by-request based prediction.
- an advertiser with only enough budget to be clicked 10 times could be placed into a text email and sent to 10,000 users.
- 100 clicks occur. Since the advertiser might only be responsible to pay for 10 of the clicks, the ad serving entity might be liable to the text email publisher for the extra 90 clicks (if it agrees to stay within an advertiser's budget and agrees to pay for all user clicks).
- sponsored message placements are determined by (a) estimating a number of payable actions for candidate sponsored messages for a publication, (b) accepting batch mode distribution constraints of the publication and budget constraints of sponsors of the sponsored messages, and (c) selecting sponsored messages for the publication, from the set of candidate sponsored messages, using the estimated number of payable actions of the candidate sponsored messages, the batch mode distribution constraints, and the budget constraints, such that sponsored message placement revenue is increased.
- Each batch of the publication may then be published including the selected set of sponsored messages.

Techniques described in the '283 application may be used for this purpose.
- the responses for each day (or some other time period) after publication can be estimated, for a given batch, by observing past behavior.

- embodiments consistent with the present invention may assemble each batch of ads for publication as follows. Given various advertiser specified constraints like daily budget or regional targets, the proper set of ads may be selected for each batch sent. For example, a text-only email may include ads A, B, and C for batch 1 and ads A, D, and E for batch 2 , etc. In this example, Ad A is included in batches 1 and 2 because (perhaps among other reasons) the expected spend (based on the predicted number of selections and an offer per selection for Ad A) from batches 1 and 2 combined is within the budget allocated for Ad A.
- Ads which do not have enough budget for a given batch might be eliminated from consideration. However, if there is a large enough difference in offers, and/or only a slight budget shortage, it may be preferable in some instances to place an ad with a budget shortfall over an ad without a budget shortfall if doing so is expected to generate more revenue. As an extreme example, consider a batched publication with 10,000 ad spots, candidate Ad A with a selection rate of 0.03, an offer per selection of $5.00, and a budget of $1,200, and candidate Ad B with a selection rate of 0.03, an offer per selection of $1.50, and a budget of $5,000.
- Another example includes ads for the 94114 zip code batch distribution of Golf Magazine. This batch may include a mix of ads which are targeted to the 94114 zip code, and if not enough 94114 targeted ads are available could include nationally targeted ads as backfill since an advertiser with a national campaign typically has a larger budget allocation.

Thus, it may be advantageous to set the batch sizes as small as possible (subject to minimum batch size constraints).

Abstract
Sponsored message placements are determined by (a) estimating a number of payable actions for candidate sponsored messages for a publication, (b) accepting batch mode distribution constraints of the publication and budget constraints of sponsors of the sponsored messages, and (c) selecting sponsored messages for the publication, from the set of candidate sponsored messages, using the estimated number of payable actions of the candidate sponsored messages, the batch mode distribution constraints, and the budget constraints, such that sponsored message placement revenue is increased. Each batch of the publication may then be published including the selected set of sponsored messages.
Description
- § 1.1 Field of the Invention
- The present invention concerns providing messages on properties with batch distribution constraints, such as offline publications for example.
- § 1.2 Background Information
- Some current online advertising networks serve online ad impressions per the browser request of a single user. Advertisers pay each time an end-user clicks on one of these ads (to go to an advertiser's Website or a landing page specified by the ad). The ad serving entity and the online publisher typically share a portion of the proceeds. In a day, ads are shown only as many times as the system predicts an advertiser's budget can afford, given a predicted number of clicks and the price paid per click.
- Unfortunately, offline ads, such as those sent via text-only emails or ads printed and circulated via a printed publication like a magazine or newspaper, do not allow for a request-by-request based prediction. For example, an advertiser with only enough budget to be clicked 10 times could be placed into a text email and sent to 10,000 users. Suppose that 100 clicks occur. Since the advertiser might only be responsible to pay for 10 of the clicks, the ad serving entity might be liable to the text email publisher for the extra 90 clicks (if it agrees to stay within an advertiser's budget and agrees to pay for all user clicks).
- Most ads placed in text-only emails or printed and circulated via a printed publication are paid for based on a number (e.g., an estimated number) of ad impressions, not clicks. Some systems for text-only emails do charge by click, but do not have a system designed to stay within an advertiser's specified budget. Rather, these systems assume that the advertiser is willing to pay for any and all clicks delivered.
- In view of the foregoing, it would be useful to provide a system which supports pay-per-click (or pay-per-conversion) advertising in a way that can be better utilized in an environment having batch distribution constraints and advertiser budget constraints.
- In at least some embodiments consistent with the present invention, sponsored message placements are determined by (a) estimating a number of payable actions for candidate sponsored messages for a publication, (b) accepting batch mode distribution constraints of the publication and budget constraints of sponsors of the sponsored messages, and (c) selecting sponsored messages for the publication, from the set of candidate sponsored messages, using the estimated number of payable actions of the candidate sponsored messages, the batch mode distribution constraints, and the budget constraints, such that sponsored message placement revenue is increased. Each batch of the publication may then be published including the selected set of sponsored messages.

-
FIG. 1 is anexemplary environment 100 in which, or with which, embodiments consistent with the present invention may be used. Theenvironment 100 includes anad server 110, a first client device (e.g., a computer used by an advertiser) 120, and a second client device (e.g., a computer used by a publisher) 130. These components can communicate with one another via one ormore networks 140, such as the Internet for example. Embodiments consistent with the present invention may be run on one ormore ad servers 110. The ad server(s) 110 may accept advertising information from advertisers via first client device(s) 120, and may accept publication information from publishers via second client device(s) 130. As will be described in greater detail below, the advertising information may include budget constraints. The budget constraints may be per ad, per ad group, per ad campaign, or per advertiser, and may be associated with a period of time. As will be described in greater detail below, the publisher information may include a number of publications and batch constraints. -
FIG. 2 is a bubble chart of operations that may be performed, as well as information that may be used and/or generated by such operations, in an embodiment consistent with the present invention. Briefly stated, batched publication ad spot filling operation(s) 210 may accept publication batch constraint(s) 220, publicationad spot information 230, and candidate (e.g., relevant)ad information 240, and may generateinformation 250 used to fill ad spots in publication batches with ads. - The
publication batch constraints 220 may define equal-sized or unequal-sized batches. Thepublication batch constraints 220 may be a function of distribution economics. For example, thepublication batch constraints 220 may be a function of zip codes or other geographic areas to which the publication is to be distributed. As another example, thepublication batch constraints 220 may be a function of different distribution routes to be used in distributing the publication. As yet another example, the publication batch constraints may be a function of minimum print run size. Naturally, publication batch constraints may be a function of alternative or additional factors. - The publication
ad spot information 230 may define attributes of the ad spot (e.g., size, text-only ads, image ads, color ads, black and white only ads, etc.). Thisinformation 230 may also convey relevance information of the publication (e.g., a general topic, a specific topic, a vertical product or service category, a representation of content of the publication (e.g., a feature vector), etc.). - The
candidate ad information 240 may include budgetary constraints, offers for an action (e.g., an offer or a maximum offer per impression, per selection, per conversion, etc.), a relevance (e.g., with respect to the publication and/or ad spot) score, etc. - Exemplary methods for performing the batched publication ad
spot filling operations 210 are described in § 4.2.1 below. - § 4.2.1 Exemplary Methods
-
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of anexemplary method 300 for determining ad placements in a publication, subject to batch constraints, in a manner consistent with the present invention. As shown, themethod 300 may estimate a number of payable actions for candidate ads for a publication. (Block 310). Themethod 300 may also accept batch mode distribution constraints of the (e.g., offline) publication and budget constraints associated with the ads. (Block 320) Finally, themethod 300 may select ads from the set of candidate ads in order to increase (e.g., maximize) revenue (e.g., to the ad serving entity) for the publication using the estimated number of payable actions of the candidate ads, the batch mode distribution constraints, and the budget constraints. (Block 330) For example, themethod 300 may select, for each batch of the publication, a set of ads from the candidate ads which maximizes revenue for the batch, subject to budget constraints. (Block 340) Then, each batch of the publication may be published including the selected set of ads. (Block 350) - Referring back to block 310, the act of estimating a number of payable actions for candidate ads for a publication might include using measurements of past payable actions. The past payable actions might include (1) an http request resulting from clicking on a link or from typing in a URL, (2) a phone call tracked via a forwarding number placed in an ad, and/or (3) a promotional code placed in the ad and either (A) transcribed over the telephone, (B) typed into a Web form, or (C) written on written response. In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, techniques described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/396,283 (incorporated herein by reference, and referred to as “the '283 application”), titled “PROVIDING A LOCATOR, SUCH AS A URL, FOR TRACKING MULTIPLE TYPES OF USER-ADVERTISEMENT ACTIONS,” filed on Mar. 31, 2006, and listing Sanjay G. Mavinkurve and Steve Miller as inventors, may be used to track user-advertisement actions, including payable actions. In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, an estimated number of payable actions may simply be accepted.
- Still referring to block 310, the candidate ads might include ads found to be relevant to content of the publication for example.
- Referring back to block 320, the batch mode distribution constraints might be set by determining a number of unique issues to be printed for a set of one or more zip codes. Alternatively, or in addition, the batch mode distribution constraints might be set by determining a specific region using an IP address of each recipient of the publication as detected by past selections or impressions of images in html-based emails. Batches may be defined subject to other additional or alternative constraints.
- Referring back to block 330, various constrained optimization algorithms may be used. Such algorithms may find a globally optimum solution (e.g., one that produces a globally maximum revenue), or alternatively, may find a sub-optimal solution (or a solution not guaranteed to be optimal) in order to save memory and/or computational resources. For example, some techniques may find locally optimal solutions (e.g., optimal per batch, optimal per ad spot, etc., but not guaranteed to be globally optimal across all batches, all ad spots, etc.). Such techniques, for example, might find a maximum advertising revenue per batch. In any event, regardless of the technique used, the solution is one that increases revenue, even if not to the maximum extent.
- In one embodiment consistent with the present invention, the advertisements may be ordered based on expected revenue per spot (e.g., selection rate*offer per selection). Then, for each minimum-sized batch, the ads to be placed are optimized (e.g., to maximize revenue or expected revenue) in view of ad budget constraints. Any batches with the same combination of ads may be combined into a larger batch.
- Still referring to block 330, another embodiment consistent with the present invention may be useful in instances where batch sizes are different. In this other embodiment, the advertisements may be ordered based on expected revenue per ad spot and the batches may be ordered based on size. For each batch, starting from the smallest and going to the largest, the ads to be placed are optimized (e.g., to maximize revenue or expected revenue) in view of advertiser budget constraints. Any batches with the same combination of advertisements may be combined into a larger batch. In a variation to this embodiment, instead of processing the batches from smallest to largest, they may be processed at random, or from largest to smallest.
- Still referring to block 330, in yet another embodiment consistent with the present invention, the batches are assumed to be of equal size. Advertisements may be first thresholded based on their expected revenue per batch (e.g., offer/selection*selection rate*number of impressions, as limited by ad budget). The remaining ads may be ordered based on expected revenue per impression over all impressions of a batch. The ads may then be processed, from highest expected revenue per impression to lowest expected revenue per impression so that ads are assigned to batches (recall that it is assumed that all batches are of equal size, so the batch an ad is assigned to shouldn't matter), until (1) ad budgets are exhausted, and (2) all of the batches are provided with ads in their ad spots. Note that if the batches are of unequal size (e.g., different regions get different numbers of publications), the batches may be processed at random, perhaps with a bias to fill larger batches first.
- Referring again to block 330, in yet still another embodiment consistent with the present invention, batches may be ranked based on higher yield (e.g., revenue or expected revenue) taking into account various factors (impression volume, cost per selection of the related topic, geolocation, selection rate of the ad topic as a function of the content topic, conversion rate of the ad topic as a function of the content topic, etc.). Starting with the top-ranked batch, the best ad is selected for a first (or most desired) ad spot of the batch. Of the remaining ads (or ads with expected remaining budget), the best ad is selected for a first (or most desired) ad spot of the next highest ranked batch, and so on. Note that fewer ads might be available as forecasted spend exhausts ad budgets. After the first (or most desired) ad spot of all batches have been filled, the second (or next most desired) ad spot of all of the batches is similarly filled, and so on.
- Still other embodiments consistent with the present invention might compare the estimated revenue of the ads for a given batch and give more space (e.g., a double ad spot, a triple ad spot, etc.) or less space (e.g., a half ad spot) to ads such that estimated revenues per square inch within a batch would be maximized. For example, the first ad might take two spots, while the second and third ads might be half-size, together occupying a third ad spot.
- In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, the publication is a text-only email. In some other embodiments consistent with the present invention, the publication is an offline publication, such as a printed publication for example. Naturally, embodiments consistent with the present invention might be used with any type of publication subject to one or more batch size constraints.

input devices 432, such as a keyboard and pointing device (e.g., a mouse) for example. Other input devices such as a microphone, a joystick, a game pad, a satellite dish, a scanner, or the like, may also (or alternatively) be included. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit(s) 410 through anappropriate interface 430 coupled to thesystem bus 440. Theoutput devices 434 may include a monitor or other type of display device, which may also be connected to thesystem bus 440 via an appropriate interface. In addition to (or instead of) the monitor, the personal computer may include other (peripheral) output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers for example. - Referring back to
FIG. 1 , thead server 110 andclient devices machines 400, such as personal computers, servers, portable and mobile devices (e.g., personal digital assistant, mobile telephone, etc.). Referring back toFIG. 2 , theoperations 210 may be performed by one ormore machines 400 and the various information may be stored by one ormore machines 400. -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of anexemplary apparatus 500 that may perform one or more of the operations discussed above, and which may store various information discussed above, in a manner consistent with the present invention. Batched publication adspot filling modules 510 may accept publication batch constraint(s) 520, publicationad spot information 530, and candidate (e.g., relevant)ad information 540, and may generateinformation 550 used to fill ad spots in publication batches with ads. - The
publication batch constraints 520 may correspond to those 220 described above with reference toFIG. 2 . The publicationad spot information 530 may correspond to that 230 described above with reference toFIG. 2 . Finally, thecandidate ad information 540 may correspond to that 240 described above with reference toFIG. 2 . - The batched publication ad
spot filling modules 510 might include payableaction estimation module 512 andad selection module 514. The payable action estimation module might use measurements of past payable actions. The past payable actions might include (1) an http request resulting from clicking on a link or from typing in a URL, (2) a phone call tracked via a forwarding number placed in an ad, and/or (3) a promotional code placed in the ad and either (A) transcribed over the telephone, (B) typed into a Web form, and/or (C) written on written response. In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, themodule 512 might use techniques described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/396,283 (incorporated herein by reference, and referred to as “the '283 application”), titled “PROVIDING A LOCATOR, SUCH AS A URL, FOR TRACKING MULTIPLE TYPES OF USER-ADVERTISEMENT ACTIONS,” filed on Mar. 31, 2006, and listing Sanjay G. Mavinkurve and Steve Miller as inventors, to track user-advertisement actions, including payable actions. In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, an estimated number of payable actions may simply be accepted. In such embodiments, themodule 512 is not needed. -
Ad selection module 514 might use various constrained optimization algorithms. Such algorithms may find a globally optimum solution (e.g., one that produces a globally maximum revenue), or alternatively, may find a sub-optimal solution (or a solution not guaranteed to be optimal) in order to save memory and/or computational resources. For example, some techniques may find locally optimal solutions (e.g., optimal per batch, optimal per ad spot, etc., but not guaranteed to be globally optimal across all batches, all ad spots, etc.). Such techniques, for example, might find a maximum advertising revenue per batch. In any event, regardless of the technique used, the solution is one that increases revenue, even if not to the maximum extent. - In one embodiment consistent with the present invention, the
module 514 might order the advertisements based on expected revenue per spot (e.g., selection rate*offer per selection). Then, for each minimum-sized batch, themodule 514 might optimize the ads to be placed in view of ad budget constraints. Themodule 514 might combine any batches with the same combination of ads into a larger batch. - In another embodiment consistent with the present invention, the
module 514 might order advertisements based on expected revenue per ad spot and might order the batches based on size. For each batch, starting from the smallest and going to the largest, themodule 514 might place the ads such that the placements are optimized in view of advertiser budget constraints. Themodule 514 might combine any batches with the same combination of advertisements into a larger batch. In a variation to this embodiment, instead of processing the batches from smallest to largest, themodule 514 might process the batches at random, or from largest to smallest. - In yet another embodiment consistent with the present invention, in which the batches are assumed to be of equal size, the
module 514 might first threshold advertisements based on their expected revenue per batch (e.g., offer/selection*selection rate*number of impressions, as limited by ad budget). Themodule 514 may then order the remaining ads based on expected revenue per impression over all impressions of a batch. Themodule 514 might then process the ads, from highest expected revenue per impression to lowest expected revenue per impression, so that ads are assigned to batches (recall that it is assumed that all batches are of equal size, so the batch an ad is assigned to shouldn't matter), until (1) ad budgets are exhausted, and (2) all of the batches are provided with ads in their ad spots. Note that if the batches are of unequal size (e.g., different regions get different numbers of publications), themodule 514 might process the batches at random, perhaps with a bias to fill larger batches first. - In yet still another embodiment consistent with the present invention, the
module 514 might rank the batches based on higher yield, taking into account various factors (impression volume, cost per selection of the related topic, geolocation, selection rate of the ad topic as a function of the content topic, conversion rate of the ad topic as a function of the content topic, etc.). For example, themodule 514 might start with the top-ranked batch, and select the best ad for a first (or most desired) ad spot of the batch. Of the remaining ads (or ads with expected remaining budget), themodule 514 might select the best ad for a first (or most desired) ad spot of the next highest ranked batch, and so on. Note that fewer ads might be available as forecasted spend exhausts ad budgets. After the first (or most desired) ad spot of all batches have been filled, themodule 514 might fill the second (or next most desired) ad spot of all of the bathes similarly, and so on. - In still other embodiments consistent with the present invention, the
module 514 might compare the estimated revenue of the ads for a given batch and give more space (e.g., a double ad spot, a triple ad spot, etc.) or less space (e.g., a half ad spot) to ads such that estimated revenues per square inch within a batch would be maximized. For example, the first ad might take two spots, while the second and third ads might be half-size, together occupying a third ad spot. - The
modules information information 550 generated by the modules might be stored on storage devices, such as memory devices, etc., and/or might be input from, and/or output to, external devices. - § 4.2.3 Refinements, Alternatives and Extensions
- Referring back to 220 of
FIG. 2 , embodiments consistent with the present invention may set batch size constraints. For example, a text email system may be able to customize the set of ads for each user receiving a mass mailed email. However, this might not be desirable due to production performance and scalability reasons. That is, it may be advantageous to determine the ads once for a given number of users, rather than for each user. For example, a mailing list with 10,000 users might be separated into 100 batches of 100 users each. A unique set of ads may then be selected for each of the 100 batches of users. Another example includes a print publication where a unique issue can be printed for each zip code, each zip code may include 100 issues for distribution. Additionally, a batch of email addresses may be constructed around a specific region determined by the IP address of each user as detected by past clicks or impressions of images in html-based emails. For example, a “golfers united” email alias may have 100 email addresses which have been detected to be accessed from machines residing in the bay area. - Referring back to 240 of
FIG. 2 , embodiments consistent with the present invention may select ads to be relevant to content of the publication. Examples of content-relevant ad serving are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,136,875 (incorporated herein by reference, and referred to as “the '875 patent”), issued on Nov. 14, 2006 from application Ser. No. 10/375,900, filed on Feb. 26, 2003, and titled “SERVING ADVERTISEMENTS BASED ON CONTENT”. In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, ad candidates may be selected per criteria, which predict which ads are most likely to be selected given the content of the publication to include the ads. For example, ads for a Golf Magazine issue focusing on putting might have a set of candidate ads selling putters. - Referring back to block 310 of
FIG. 3 , embodiments consistent with the present invention may predict the number of selections (or conversions) for each ad. More specifically, given a set of candidate ads, the content of the publication, and the number of impressions for each ad, the number of selections (or conversions) generated for each ad in a batch can be predicted. For example, if a “Ping putter” ad typically gets a 1% response rate (e.g., selection rate) when shown next to a putting article featuring Ping putter performance, then the Ping putter ad is predicted to get 1 selection for each batch of 100 publications (assuming one Ping putter ad per publication, the publication being sent to each of 100 users). - For future predictions, past selections (or conversions) may be measured in various ways. For example, embodiments consistent with the present invention may measure past selections (or conversions) using (1) an http request resulting from clicking on a link or from typing in a URL, (2) a phone call tracked via a forwarding number placed in the ad, and/or (3) a promotional code placed in the ad and transcribed over the telephone, typed into a web form or written on written response. Techniques described in the '283 application may be used for this purpose.
- In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, the responses for each day (or some other time period) after publication can be estimated, for a given batch, by observing past behavior. For example, Golf Magazine subscribers for a given batch may typically return 30% of responses on the 1st day of postal delivery, 30% the second day, 20% the following day and 20% over the following 10 days.
- Referring back to
blocks FIG. 3 , embodiments consistent with the present invention may assemble each batch of ads for publication as follows. Given various advertiser specified constraints like daily budget or regional targets, the proper set of ads may be selected for each batch sent. For example, a text-only email may include ads A, B, and C for batch 1 and ads A, D, and E for batch 2, etc. In this example, Ad A is included in batches 1 and 2 because (perhaps among other reasons) the expected spend (based on the predicted number of selections and an offer per selection for Ad A) from batches 1 and 2 combined is within the budget allocated for Ad A. - Ads which do not have enough budget for a given batch might be eliminated from consideration. However, if there is a large enough difference in offers, and/or only a slight budget shortage, it may be preferable in some instances to place an ad with a budget shortfall over an ad without a budget shortfall if doing so is expected to generate more revenue. As an extreme example, consider a batched publication with 10,000 ad spots, candidate Ad A with a selection rate of 0.03, an offer per selection of $5.00, and a budget of $1,200, and candidate Ad B with a selection rate of 0.03, an offer per selection of $1.50, and a budget of $5,000. In this example, Ad A should have to pay $1,500 (=10,000 impressions*0.03 selections/impression*$5.00/selection). Since, however, the advertiser's budget is $1,200, the most the advertiser can pay is $1,200. On the other hand, Ad B should have to pay $450 (=10,000 impressions*0.03 selections/impression*$1.50/selection). Although the $450 is well within Ad B's budget of $5,000, placing Ad B for $450 would clearly be undesirable when Ad A can be placed for $1200. Thus, Ad A might be placed not withstanding the fact that it will get some “free” impressions (and selections).
- Another example includes ads for the 94114 zip code batch distribution of Golf Magazine. This batch may include a mix of ads which are targeted to the 94114 zip code, and if not enough 94114 targeted ads are available could include nationally targeted ads as backfill since an advertiser with a national campaign typically has a larger budget allocation.
- In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, the candidate (e.g., relevant ads) are ranked via a cost per selection*selection rate (or cost-per-click*clickthrough rate, CPC*CTR) auction. The position of an ad within an ad slot containing many ads can influence response rate. Thus some embodiments consistent with the present invention might also consider the position of the ad within an ad slot when predicting a response (e.g., an expected selection rate) for the ad.
- In some embodiments consistent with the present invention, the advertisements might be sponsored messages, or more generally messages. In such embodiments, the advertisers are sponsors, or more generally message sources.
- The following simple example illustrates operations in an exemplary embodiment consistent with the present invention. Suppose there is a run of 9,000 newsletters, each having two (2) ad spots, for a total of 18,000 ad spots. Assume that the same ad does not appear in both of the two (2) ad spots of the publication. Assume that the newsletter can be printed with different ads in batches of 1,000. Assume further that there are four relevant advertisements for the newsletter with the following attributes:
-
AD OFFER BUDGET CAN PAY FOR Ad 1 $10.00/selection $1,000 100 selections Ad 2 $5.00/selection $2,000 400 selections Ad 3 $1.00/selection $50,000 50,000 selections Ad 4 $1.00/selection $100,000 100,000 selections - Finally, assume that all of the ads have the same selection rate (or click-through rate, or CTR) of 0.05. Using this selection rate, there are 2,000 ad spots per batch of 1,000, which equates to 100 selections (=2,000 impressions*0.05) per batch of 1,000.
- First, the batch sizes of 1,000 can be combined, so that solution may have 9 batches of 1,000, or 1 batch of 2,000+7 batches of 1,000, or 1 batch of 3,000+6 batches of 1,000, . . . , or 2 batches of 2000+5 batches of 1,000, or 3 batches of 2,000+3 batches of 1,000, etc., etc.
- In this example, the advertisements are ordered based on expected revenue per spot (e.g., selection rate*offer per selection). Then, for each minimum-sized batch, the ads to be placed are optimized in view of advertiser budget constraints. Any batches with the same combination of advertisers may be combined into a larger batch. To simplify the example, if batches are combined, only the combined batch is shown. Note that as the batch size approaches 1, if batches with the same ads are combined, optimal-sized batches can be determined. Thus, it may be advantageous to set the batch sizes as small as possible (subject to minimum batch size constraints).
- A first batch of 2000 publications will be provided with 2,000 spots for Ad 1 and 2,000 spots for Ad 2. After this, Ad 1 has spent all of its budget ($1,000=2,000 impressions*0.05 selections/impression*$10/selection), while Ad 2 has spent $500 of its budget (=2,000 impressions*0.05 selections/impression*$5/selection), with $1,500 remaining.
- A second batch of 6000 publications will be provided with 6,000 spots for Ad 2 and 6,000 spots for Ad 3. After this, Ad 2 will have spent the remainder of its budget ($1,500=6,000 impressions*0.05 selections/impression*$5/selection), while Ad 3 will have spent $300 (=6,000 impressions*0.05 selections/impression*$1/selection), with $49,700 remaining.
- A third batch of 1,000 publications will be provided with 1,000 spots for Ad 3 and 1,000 spots for Ad 4. After this, each of Ad 3 and Ad 4 has spent $50 (=1,000 impressions*0.05 selections/impression*$1/selection).
- As this example illustrates, the total expected ad revenue will be $3,400 (=$1000+$500+$1500+$300+$50+$50). If the Ads were processed to fill a single 9,000 publication batch, the amount would be $900 (=9,000 impressions*0.05 selections/impression*$1/selection, for each of Ad 3 and Ad 4). So applying an embodiment consistent with the present invention provides better results in this example. If, on the other hand, Ads were processed so that advertisers received free impressions beyond their budget, the total amount would be $3,000 (=9,000 impressions*0.05 selections/impression*$10/selection, limited to $1,000+9,000 impressions*0.05 selections/impression*$5/selection, limited to $2,000), applying an embodiment consistent with the present invention would still provide better results.
- As can be appreciated from the foregoing, embodiments consistent with the present invention are useful and improve ad placements in publications subject to batch constraints, where at least some of the ads might be subject to budget constraints. Embodiments consistent with the present invention might determine ad placements for a publication subject to batch constraints by estimating the number of responses of specific ads for a publication. Given batch mode distribution and advertiser budget constraints, revenue for publication publishers and/or an ad serving entity can be increased or maximized.
