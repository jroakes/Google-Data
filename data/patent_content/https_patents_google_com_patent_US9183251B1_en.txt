- Search engines aim to identify resources (e.g., images, audio, video, web pages, text, documents) that are relevant to a user's needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user.
- Search engines return a set of search results in response to a user submitted text query. For example, in response to an image search text query, the search engine returns a set of search results identifying resources responsive to the query.
- the present disclosure relates to searching.
- innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods including the actions of receiving authoritative user data, the authoritative user data associating one or more queries with one or more authoritative users, processing the authoritative user data to identify one or more trigger queries, each trigger query including a query that, if received, triggers a display of one or more authoritative users in response, and storing the one or more trigger queries in a trigger queries database, each trigger query being associated with a first set of authoritative users, each authoritative user in the first set of authoritative users being associated with a first score relating to a particular trigger query.
- Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- the authoritative user data includes a second set of authoritative users, each authoritative user in the second set of authoritative users being associated with a second score; the first set of authoritative users is a subset of the second set of authoritative users; the first score is equal to the second score; processing authoritative user data includes, for each query of the one or more queries: determining a number of authoritative users having a first score that is greater than a threshold score, determining whether the number of authoritative users is greater than a threshold number, and, if the number of authoritative users is greater than a threshold number, including the query as a trigger query in the trigger queries database; processing authoritative user data includes, for each query of the one or more queries: summing first scores of authoritative users associated with the query to provide a combined score, determining whether the combined score is greater than a threshold score, and, if the combined score is greater than the threshold score, including the query as a trigger query in the trigger queries database; actions further

- the search system 114 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., servers) in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the search system 114 includes an authoritative user (AU) database 125 , an index database 126 , a trigger queries database 127 and a search engine 130 .
- the search engine 130 includes an indexing engine 120 , a ranking engine 122 and an authoritative user (AU) engine 124 .
- the search system 114 responds to the query 110 by generating search results 128 , which are transmitted through the network to the client device 104 in a form that can be presented to the user 102 (e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 104 ).
- the search system 114 can further respond to the query 110 by identifying one or more authoritative users, and can transfer data 129 associated with the one or more authoritative users through the network to the client device 104 in a form that can be presented to the user 102 (e.g., within the search results web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 104 ).

- a trigger queries database (e.g., the trigger queries database 127 of FIG. 1 ) can be provided based on authoritative user data.
- the trigger queries database provides a list of queries that, if received as search queries, triggers the display of one or more authoritative users.
- the authoritative user data can be received from an authoritative user database (e.g., the AU database 125 of FIG. 1 ).
- the authoritative user database can be provided from a service that identifies one or more users as authoritative users relative to one or more queries.
- the authoritative user data includes query (Q) data, authoritative user (AU) data and score (S) data that has been determined from one or more social networking services.
- an authoritative user is authoritative for one or more queries with the score providing a relative measure of the authoritativeness of authoritative user for a particular query. For example, a first user and a second user can be determined to be authoritative users for a query, and a first score and a second score can be respectively associated with the first and second users for the query. The first score can exceed, e.g., be greater than, the second score or a threshold, indicating that the first user is deemed to be more authoritative on topics underlying the query than the second user or an authoritative user in general, respectively.
- the authoritative user data is organized in triples (e.g., (Q, AU, S)), where each triple denotes that user AU is authoritative for query Q with the score S.
- the trigger query database is generated in phases. Examples phases include a candidate identification phase, a candidate expansion phase, a scoring phase and a trigger query identification phase.
- queries can be associated with or can be representative of one or more topics. Implementations of each example phase are discussed in further detail below.
- an initial set of candidate queries is defined.
- the initial set of candidate queries can include a plurality of candidate queries that have been submitted as search queries to a computer-implemented search service.
- candidate queries can be extracted from one or more search logs and can populate the initial set of candidate queries.
- candidate queries can be generated from the given authoritative users by considering the scores of users for each query and using various thresholding schemes.
- An example scheme can include identifying a query as a candidate query if there are at least k (e.g., k is an integer greater than 0) users with scores exceeding a threshold score.
- candidate queries can be selected from the one or more search logs based on respective popularities.
- the popularity of a query can be provided as a popularity score.
- the popularity score is determined based on a frequency that the query is submitted as a search query for a given time period.
- the frequency can be compared to a frequency threshold. If the frequency exceeds the frequency threshold, the query can be determined to be a popular query and the popularity score can be set to a first value (e.g., 1). If the frequency does not exceed the frequency threshold, the query can be determined to not be a popular query and the popularity score can be set to a second value (e.g., 0).
- a search log can provide data indicating that a first search query (SQ 1 ) has been submitted has a search query X number of times (e.g., within a given time period) and that a second search query (SQ 2 ) has been submitted has a search query Y number of times (e.g., within the given time period).
- Both X and Y can be provided as a frequency and can be compared to a threshold frequency. In this example, X exceeds the threshold frequency and Y is less than the threshold frequency. Consequently, SQ 1 is included in an initial set of candidate queries and SQ 2 is not included in the initial set of candidate queries.
- candidate queries within the initial set of candidate queries are expanded to provide an expanded set of candidate queries.
- a candidate query is expanded to provide expansion queries.
- the expansion queries can be identified as sub-queries of the original candidate query within the expanded set of candidate queries.
- expansion queries include synonymous queries, related queries and/or connected queries, as discussed in further detail below.
- a candidate query can be expanded by including synonymous queries.
- a candidate query can include [ceo] and synonymous queries can include [ceos] and [chief executive officers]. Consequently, the expanded set of candidate queries can include the candidate query [ceo] and the synonymous queries [ceos] and [chief executive officers].
- a candidate query can be expanded by including queries that are deemed to be related to the candidate query.
- the query [business executive] can be determined to be related to the candidate query [ceo]. Consequently, the expanded set of candidate queries can include the query [business executive].
- related queries can be provided from a database of related queries using the candidate query as an index.
- a candidate query can be expanded by including queries that are connected to the candidate query.
- the candidate query [google] can be connected to the queries [google places] and [google maps]. Consequently, the expanded set of candidate queries can also include the queries [google places] and [google maps].
- connected queries can be provided from a database of connected queries using the candidate query as an index.
- scoring information from the authoritative user data is used to associate a trigger score with each candidate query in the expanded set of candidate queries.
- it is determined whether the candidate query is provided in the authoritative user data e.g., whether the authoritative user data includes a tuple, discussed above, associated with the particular candidate query. If the candidate query is not provided in the authoritative user data, the trigger score for the candidate query is set equal to a minimum value (e.g., 0).
- associated authoritative user data is received and can include a list of authoritative users associated with the candidate query and their respective scores.
- the respective scores can be processed to identify the top k authoritative users associated with the candidate query, where k is provided as a positive integer.
- k is provided as a positive integer.
- eight authoritative users [User A (AU A ), User B (AU B ), User C (AU C ), . . . , User H (AU H )] are provided in the authoritative user data.
- a candidate query was provided as an expansion query. If the candidate query was provided as an expansion query, the scores associated with the identified top K authoritative users can be discounted. In some examples, a degree to which the scores are discounted can vary. For example, if the candidate query is a synonym of the original candidate query, a first discount value (e.g., a multiplier that is less than 1) can be applied. If the candidate query is a related query of the original candidate query, a second discount value can be applied and, if the candidate query is a connected query of the original candidate query, a third discount value can be applied. In some examples, the first discount value can be greater than the second discount value, and the second discount value can be greater than the third discount value.
- a first discount value e.g., a multiplier that is less than 1
- a second discount value can be applied and, if the candidate query is a connected query of the original candidate query.
- the authoritative users AU H , AU B , AU E , AU D and AU C are the top k authoritative users for the candidate query Q 1 and are associated with the candidate query Q 1 in the expanded set of candidate queries. It can also be determined that Q1 is an expansion query of an original candidate query. Consequently, the scores S H,Q1 , S B,Q1 , S E,Q1 , S D,Q1 and S C,Q1 can be discounted (e.g., by applying a multiplier that is less than 1) to provide respective discounted scores that are associated with the authoritative users in the expanded set of candidate queries.
- a trigger query includes a query that, if received as a search query, will trigger the display of one or more authoritative users with the search results.
- the candidate query and authoritative user data associated with the candidate query are stored in a trigger query database (e.g., the trigger queries database 127 of FIG. 1 ).
- a set of threshold scores can be applied to all candidate queries and the set of authoritative users associate with those queries.
- expanded query sets can be provided as: Q 1 ⁇ [(AU A ,S A,Q1 ),(AU B ,S B,Q1 ),(AU C ,S C,Q1 )] Q 2 ⁇ [(AU A ,S A,Q2 ),(AU B ,S B,Q2 ),(AU D ,S D,Q2 )] Q 3 ⁇ [(AU A ,S A,Q3 )]
- threshold scores ⁇ k, S THR ⁇ can be applied to identify a query as a trigger query.
- a query is provided as a trigger query in the trigger queries database if there are at least k authoritative users that have a score that exceeds S THR .
- a threshold score can be determined based on one or more of the popularity of the particular candidate query as a search query, the popularity of the candidate query in resources (e.g., web pages) and/or the type of query the candidate query is determined to be. In some examples, it can be provided that the more popular a query is, higher trigger scores should be expected. Consequently, if the candidate query is a popular search query (e.g., based on comparing a popularity score of the candidate query to a threshold, as discussed above), the threshold score can be set at a higher value than it would be if the candidate query is not a popular search query.
- the threshold score can be set based on the number of times the candidate query appears in resources.
- the number of times a query appears in resources can be provided from an index database (e.g., the index database 126 of FIG. 1 ).
- a first threshold score can be provided and, if the query appears less than or equal to X number of times in resources, a second threshold score can be provided, the first threshold score being greater than the second threshold score.
- the candidate query can be classified as a particular type of query and the threshold score can be determined based on the type.
- certain types of queries e.g., generic queries
- generic queries can include generic terms such as [run] and [favorite].
- a candidate query can be processed by a classifier to determine whether the candidate query is, for example, a generic query. If it is determined that the candidate query is a generic query, the threshold score can be set at a relatively high value to deter identification of the candidate query as a trigger query.
- a candidate query can be processed by a classifier to determine whether the candidate query is a location. If it is determined that the candidate query is a location, the threshold score can be set at a relatively high value to deter identification of the candidate query as a trigger query.
- threshold scores can be computed at least partially based on a statistical distribution of scores of all authoritative users for a given query.
- the statistical distribution can be obtained from the authoritative user data provided in the AU database.
- a threshold score can be set equal to the score of a user whose score (for the given query) is at least k times larger than the immediately following user for the same query.
- a trigger score can be determined for each query in the expanded set of candidate queries.
- each trigger score is determined by combining the scores associated with each authoritative user for the query.
- the expanded set of candidate queries can include: Q 1 ⁇ [(AU A ,S A,Q1 ),(AU B ,S B,Q1 ),(AU C ,S C,Q1 )] Q 2 ⁇ [(AU A ,S A,Q2 ),(AU B ,S B,Q2 ),(AU D ,S D,Q2 )] Q 3 ⁇ [(AU A ,S A,Q3 )]
- a trigger score TS Q1 associated with the query Q 1 can be determined as the sum of S A,Q1 , S B,Q1 and S C,Q1 .
- a trigger score TS Q2 associated with the query Q 2 can be determined as the sum of S A,Q2 , S B,Q2 and S D,Q2 .
- a trigger score TS Q3 associated with the query Q 3 can be equal to S A,Q3 .
- a trigger score can be provided as: Q 1 ⁇ TS Q1 Q 2 ⁇ TS Q2 Q 3 ⁇ TS AQ3
- each trigger score or a combination of trigger scores can be compared to one or more threshold scores. If the trigger score or combination of trigger scores exceeds the threshold score, the candidate query is determined to be a trigger query and is added to the trigger queries database, as discussed above.
