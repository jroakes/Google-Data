- A/D analog to digital converter
- the sample stream from the A/D is applied to a detector 301 .
- Detector 301 processes the samples corresponding to a sync pattern, preferably the first 72 symbols to determine whether an access code, essentially the address of the communications unit, is present.
- the switch 302 is closed and the samples, as processed (re-sampled) by the detector, are routed from the detector 301 to a signal processor 304 .
- the detector 301 further determines timing and carrier synchronization. This provides an initial carrier estimation f co , and timing estimation, specifically CLX. and FRAC for the first symbol to be recovered.
- CLK is the sample index of the incoming samples and FRAC is a Fraction of a sample.
- the particulars of the detector 301 can be found in co-pending application Ser. No. 09/709,690, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,424,673, by Chen et al., filed on Nov. 10, 2000 and tided METHOD AND APPARATUS IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR FACILITATING DETECTION OF, AND SYNCHRONIZATION WITH, A PREDETERMINED SYNCHRONIZATION SIGNAL, assigned to the same assignee as here and hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.
- the samples of the received signal are coupled to the signal processor 304 that includes a frequency and phase or timing adjustment function 303 coupled to a correlator 305 that is coupled to a trellis processor 307 and then to a symbol selector 309 .
- a carrier tracking function 313 is coupled to the detector 301 , correlator 305 , and the output of the symbol selector 309 and provides a carrier adjustment input to the adjustment function 303 .
- the adjustment function provides adjusted samples to the correlator 305 .
- the correlator performs a correlation between 4 samples of the received signal and a plurality of templates, each comprised of 4 predetermined values, where the templates each correspond to what would be the expected received signal samples for each possible symbol or symbol state transition. These correlations are provided to the trellis processor 307 .
- the trellis processor determines or calculates a metric or weight for a path corresponding to each possible branch from each symbol state to all others for each symbol period and selects the better path including corresponding branch that terminates at each symbol state. These paths and respective relative weights are provided to the symbol selector 309 .
- These symbols are coupled to a decoder 311 operating in known fashion and according to the Bluetooth standards in the preferred embodiment for decoding the particular symbols.
- the decoder 311 will not be further discussed herein, however, the operation and function of each of the other entities will be explained in more detail below with reference to FIG. 4 . However it is advisable to first explain the symbol transition diagram 500 of FIG. 5 .
- a dashed line 501 depicts three “ideal” symbols each having four samples 503 where these samples, by observation, are taken at intervals of 1 ⁇ 4 of the symbol period 505 beginning at 1 ⁇ 8 of the symbol period. Additionally shown are two symbol transitions 504 , 506 , respectively, from a 1 to a 0 and the other from a 0 to a 1.
- four templates 507 , 509 , 511 , and 513 are depicted. These templates represent the 4 possible received signals that are expected given that the respective symbol transition occurs. The departure of the templates from the ideal symbol is due to various channel characteristics as well as filtering that is performed within the receiver and the resultant inter symbol interference (ISI) that will be present.
- ISI inter symbol interference
- Template 507 includes four predetermined values x 1 –x 4 that correspond to four sample points on the received signal. This template represents the expected received signal when adjacent symbols are both 1. Similarly template 509 has four predetermined values y 1 –y 4 and corresponds to the expected received signal when a 1 to 0 symbol transition occurs. Template 511 with the four predetermined v points corresponds to a 0 to 1 symbol transition and template 513 with the four predetermined u values corresponds to a 0 to 0 symbol transition. By observation these 16 predetermined values can be represented by only four values namely x 1 , x 2 , y 1 , and y 2 as all others are equal to one of these four or the negative of one of these four.
- the signal processor 304 is arranged and constructed to recover a sequence of symbols from a received signal.
- the signal processor comprises a symbol selector for selecting a symbol based on the received signal over a time period including previous symbol periods, said symbol period, and a number of additional symbol periods.
- the number of additional symbol periods depends on the inter symbol interference associated with the received signal. In a preferred form the number of additional symbol periods is equal to two.
- the signal processor preferably further includes a trellis processor for providing, for each symbol period, the symbol selector with one surviving path to each of a plurality of symbol states.
- This plurality of symbol states corresponds one to one to a plurality of symbols, here a 1 and a 0.
- the one surviving path include a sequence of branches, one branch for each symbol period where each branch corresponds to a transition from one to another of the plurality of symbol states.
- the one surviving path to each of the plurality of symbol states further includes a path metric and the symbol selector selects a symbol for the number of additional symbol periods earlier or the symbol time prior to the additional symbol periods that corresponds to the one surviving path having or that has the better path metric after the additional symbol periods.
- the typical path metric is a cumulative metric where all the weights or metrics for each branch are summed together.
- the trellis processor acting as a metric calculator will provide the path metric as an adjusted metric where each of the path metrics have the same adjustment as the adjusted metric. For example in the preferred form with two surviving paths after each symbol period one terminating with the symbol state 0 and one with the symbol state 1 the path metric for the symbol state 0 is subtracted from each path metric leaving the path at 0 with a metric of 0 and the path at 1 with a metric equal to the difference between the two surviving paths. This approach simplifies the calculations is the preferred form.
- the trellis processor preferably determines the one surviving path according to a metric for each of a plurality of paths to each of the plurality of symbol states.
- the metric will correspond to a correlation between the received signal and a template for each branch that is part of each of a plurality of paths and will further correspond to a half energy of the template for the each branch in a preferred form.
- the correlations are provided to the trellis processor by the correlator for each symbol period and is a correlation between the received signal for the symbol period and each of a plurality of templates where each of the plurality of templates corresponds to a possible transition from one to another of the plurality of symbol states.
- the plurality of templates is selected to facilitate providing the correlations as noted with reference to FIG. 5 and further explained below referencing FIG. 4 .
- the signal processor selects symbols for a received signal that is a Bluetooth signal using 2 state frequency shift keyed modulation, a variable length packet size, and the number of additional symbol periods is two.
- the received signal is sampled four times per symbol period with the samples spaced at 1 ⁇ 4 of the symbol period and a first sample spaced at 1 ⁇ 8 of the symbol period from the edge of the symbol as determined by the CLK adjusted by FRAC from detector 301 . Each correlation is performed on four samples spaced across a symbol transition.
- the signal processor also includes means for carrier error correction that determines the difference between an expected received signal based on the sequence of symbols recovered and the actual received signal as now corrected and uses the difference to provide carrier error correction.
- the signal processor 304 is arranged and constructed to recover a sequence of symbols from a received signal.
- the received signal is preferably a Bluetooth signal using 2 state frequency shift keyed modulation and a variable length packet size.
- the signal processor includes a correlator 305 for providing a plurality of correlations between a received signal and a plurality of corresponding templates for each symbol period, where each template corresponds to a possible signal transition from a first symbol to a second symbol within a plurality of symbols or symbol states, here preferably two such symbol states.
- a trellis processor 307 for assigning weights or metrics to a plurality of branches on a trellis for each symbol period.
- the metrics correspond to the plurality of correlations.
- the trellis processor further, for each symbol time, provides a path and a composite weight or metric for each node and trims or discards all other paths that terminate at each node.
- Each node corresponds to one symbol of the plurality of symbols.
- the composite metric corresponds to the one of the metrics assigned to a one of the plurality of branches and a previous composite weight associated with a previous node where the one of the plurality of branches originated.
- the composite weight for the path provided will be better than any other composite weights corresponding to the other branches thus paths and the one of the plurality of branches is the latest branch in the surviving path.
- a symbol selector responsive to the path and the composite weight for each node or each symbol state, for selecting the path having a better composite weight and for selecting a symbol corresponding to a node on the path at an earlier symbol time period, where the earlier symbol time period is dependent on inter symbol interference associated with the received signal.
- the symbol is selected two symbol time periods earlier.
- the trellis processor provides the composite metric as a difference metric that represents the difference between composite weights for the surviving path for or to each node.
- the plurality of templates should be selected to facilitate providing the correlations such as the templates of FIG. 5 .
- the signal processor also includes the earlier noted means for carrier error correction that determines the difference between an expected received signal based on the sequence of symbols recovered and the received signal and uses the difference to provide carrier error correction. It will be recognized that the above noted functions lend themselves to a digital signal processor embodiment and that all can be readily accomplished in such a processor with limited capacity. Equally appropriate and preferred is practicing these processes or functions in a custom or semi custom integrated circuit such as a gate array or the like.
- a preferred method embodiment in accordance with the present invention can be practiced in many structural forms and viewed as the process steps explained above.
- the method is one for recovering a sequence of symbols from a received signal that includes selecting a symbol based on the received signal over a time period including previous symbol periods, the symbol period, and a number of additional symbol periods, where the number of additional symbol periods depends on the inter symbol interference (ISI) associated with the received signal.
- ISI inter symbol interference
- Preferably and based on experimental results with a Bluetooth signal simulating the ISI expected two additional symbol periods is appropriate.
- each path includes a sequence of branches, one branch for each symbol period that corresponds to a transition from one to another of the plurality of symbols.
- a path metric is provided or determined for each path and the surviving path for or to each symbol state is selected based on a better path metric.
- the one surviving path having the better path metric is determined from amongst all surviving paths and a symbol that lies on this path at the number of additional symbols earlier is selected for that earlier symbol period.
- the metrics for each path correspond to correlations between the received signal and a template representative of potential symbol transitions. To control the range of the path metrics each will be adjusted by an identical factor from time to time, preferably each symbol period.
- the 4 bit samples at a rate of 4 million samples per second is provided at input 211 ′.
- the functional circuitry within the dotted box 303 provides the frequency and timing adjustments.
- the output samples as adjusted are provided to the correlator in box 305 .
- the correlator forms a summation over each of the products of the, preferably, four samples of the received signal x(n) ⁇ x(n+3) and the appropriate corresponding template values to provide four correlations.
- finding, determining, or providing the correlation R SX (1,1) in FIG. 4 that corresponds to a 1 to 1 symbol transition amounts to forming the sum of the first and fourth samples and the product of this sum and the template value x 1 and adding that to the product of the sum of the second and third samples and the template value x 2 .
- Multiplying this correlation by ⁇ 1 gives the correlation R SX (0,0) that corresponds to a 0 to 0 symbol transition.
- the correlations R SX (0,1) and R SX )(1,0) corresponding to a 0 to 1 and a 1 to 0 transition are provided. These correlations are provided to the trellis processor 307 .
- the trellis processor subtracts a constant generally referred to as the half energy difference dE 1/2 from the correlations where the symbol has not changed (1 to 1 and 0 to 0).
- the Half Energy difference can be shown to be equal to 1 ⁇ 2 of the sum of the four template values for a 1 to 1 transition squared less 1 ⁇ 2 of the sum of four template values for a 1 to 0 transition squared.
- the trellis processor adds a difference metric dM to the correlations, specifically R SX (1,1) and R SX (1,0), when the current branch originated at a 1 symbol.
- This dM is provided from a later operation but represent the difference between the cumulative metric for a surviving path terminating at the 1 symbol and the cumulative metric for the surviving path terminating at the 0 symbol.
- These cumulative metrics corresponding to the correlations and the half energy and the previous cumulative metric or difference are supplied to a respective maximum function.
- the two paths terminating at a one symbol (transition from 1 to 1 or from 0 to 1) have their respective adjusted metrics compared at 403 and the better survives and its metric is provided as M(1) and the symbol state or symbol from which the latest branch on the surviving path originated is output as the argmax. If the surviving path is the 1 to 1 transition then a 1 is output and if a 0 to 1 then a 0 is output.
- the two paths terminating at a zero symbol have their respective metrics compared at 405 and the better survives and its metric is provided as M(0) and the symbol state or symbol from which the latest branch on the surviving path originated is output as the argmax. If the surviving path is the 0 to 0 transition then a 0 is output and if a 1 to 0 then a 1 is output. M(0) is subtracted from M(1) to form dM which is fed back for processing the next symbol and also supplied along with the argmaxs to the symbol selector 309 .
- the symbol selector 309 essentially shifts the argmaxs through a two bit shift register and selects as the nth symbol or bit the symbol or symbol state that lies on the surviving path two symbol periods later in the preferred embodiment. This is determined by tracing back along the surviving path for two symbol periods to determine the symbol from which the surviving branch originated.
- dM is greater than zero indicating that M(1) is greater than M(0) and thus that the better surviving path at the n+2 symbol period goes through or to the 1 symbol state.
- n+2 argmax From 403 we find a 0 and thus know that the surviving branch originated from a 0 symbol state.
- n+1 symbol time we need to look at the n+1 argmax from 405 and we see a 1 and thus know that the surviving branch corresponding to the surviving path at the n+1 symbol period originated from a 1 symbol state.
- the symbol selected for the nth symbol period is therefore a 1.
- the symbol selection boils down to determining which of the n+1 argmaxs should be output as the recovered symbol or bit and the other is discarded.
- the selected or recovered symbols are supplied to the decoder as well as a carrier tracking function 313 .
- the carrier tacking apparatus compares the received signal samples with the expected received signal (template values) from the recovered symbols and periodically provides an updated frequency error to 303 .
- the updated frequency error is provided every 64 symbols in the preferred embodiment and this is enabled by the switches depicted.
- inventive concepts and principles described above with respect to FIG. 4 can be applied not only to the 2 state system described but also to 4 or more state systems.
- the specific embodiments will vary and the particular techniques used to minimize computation resources may have to be changed but it is expected that many of the benefits realized in the preferred 2 state system would also be realized in an n state system.
- the selection of sample points and the symmetry thus provided 16 template values for 4 templates to be represented by 4 values and allowed 16 multiplications for providing the correlations to be replaced with 4 multiplications.
- 16 templates including 64 values would be required but taking advantage of proper sample times would allow these templates to be represented by 16 points and a similar reduction ratio for multiplications.
