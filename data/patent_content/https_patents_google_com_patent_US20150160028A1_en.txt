Description
- This specification relates to presenting information relative to a map.
- Users can use maps of geographic regions to identify travel routes. Conventionally, a user can make travel plans using hardcopy or web-based maps of a geographic location. In some instances, users can use web sites containing web-based maps to identify an itinerary for travel (e.g., a particular travel route) or hotel locations.
- Geographic areas that are reachable from a specified location within a specified time limit can be identified. Whether a geographic area is reachable from the specified location within the time limit can be determined based on different transport options, e.g., walking or public transit. In determining reachability, a first reachable geographic area is determined, e.g., a distance that can be walked from the specified location within the time limit. One or more first transport hubs, e.g., train stations, that are located within the first reachable geographic area are identified. Next, one or more second transport hubs, e.g., interconnected train stations, that are reachable from the first transport hubs within the time limit are identified. Based on the second transport hubs and the remaining time limit, geographic areas that are reachable from the second transport hubs are determined.
- Hotels that are located within the identified geographic areas can be identified. For each of the identified hotels, a further determination can be made to select hotels that can be reached from the specified location within the remaining time limit. Alternatively, a particular hotel can be used as the specified location and geographic areas that are reachable from the hotel, including points of interests located within the geographic areas, can be identified.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving, through a client device, user input specifying a location and a threshold transit time; determining, based on the specified location and the threshold transit time, a first reachable geographic area, one or more first transport hubs located within the first reachable geographic area, and respective first shortest transit times for reaching the one or more first transport hubs from the specified location; determining, for each of the one or more first transport hubs, and based on the threshold transit time and the respective first shortest transit times, one or more second transport hubs that are reachable from the specified location, and respective second shortest transit times for reaching the one or more second transport hubs from the specified location; determining, for each of the one or more second transport hubs, and based on the threshold transit time and the respective second shortest transit times, respective second reachable geographic areas; determining a combined reachable geographic area based on the first reachable geographic area and the respective second reachable geographic areas; and providing data describing the combined reachable geographic area to the client device for display. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- These and other embodiments can optionally include one or more of the following features. The first reachable geographic area is determined based on a travel distance originating from the specified location, and wherein the travel distance is based on a transit speed and the threshold transit time. A respective second reachable geographic area is determined based on a travel distance originating from a respective second transport hub, and where the travel distance is based on a transit speed, the threshold transit time, and the respective second shortest transit times. A respective first shortest transit time for reaching a first transport hub from the specified location is determined based on transit times for one or more paths from the specified location to the first transport hub. A respective second shortest transit time for reaching a second transport hub from the specified location is determined based on transit times for one or more paths from the specified location to the first transport hubs and transit times for one or more paths from the first transport hubs to the second transport hub.
- The method further includes providing an index to the client device for use in determining a listing of hotels that are reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time. The method further includes identifying one or more hotels located within the combined reachable geographic area; determining, for each of the one or more identified hotels, a respective shortest transit time for reaching the identified hotel from the specified location; determining a hotel listing based on the respective shortest transit times and the threshold transit time; and providing the hotel listing to the client device. The method further includes receiving user input adjusting the threshold transit time; and adjusting the combined reachable geographic area based on the threshold transit time. The method further includes identifying one or more hotels located within the adjusted combined reachable geographic area; determining, for each of the one or more identified hotels, a respective shortest transit time for reaching the identified hotel from the specified location; determining a second hotel listing based on the respective shortest transit times and the adjusted threshold transit time; and providing the second hotel listing to the client device.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. A geographic area representing an area that is reachable from a specified location can be determined. The geographic area can be displayed on a map to indicate regions that are reachable from the specified location within a threshold transit time. A listing of hotels that are located within the geographic area and are reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time can be determined. The geographic area can be determined based on different transport options, e.g., walking or public transit.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample search system 100. Thesearch system 100 includes amapping system 104 in communication with one ormore users 102 through anetwork 101. Themapping system 104 receives information from amap database 106 to display maps for geographic regions. Themap database 104 can store, for example, data describing different types of maps for geographic regions, e.g., two-dimensional maps, three-dimensional maps, or satellite maps. The system can identify geographic locations on maps obtained from themap database 106 based on specified location information, e.g., a zip code, geographic coordinates, street address, name of a city, state, country, continent, or point of interest. Themapping system 104 can also use the data provided by themap database 106 to calculate distances for one or more routes between two geographic locations. The distances can be measured based on metric units, English units, or time, e.g., an estimated amount of time to reach a second location from a first location based on a specified travel speed. - The
mapping system 104 can communicate with ahotel database 110 to obtain hotel information describing hotels in various geographic regions, corresponding pricing information, dates of availability, locations, descriptions, amenities, rating classes, and reviews. In particular, themapping system 104 can identify one or more hotels that are located near a particular location within a geographic region. For example, themapping system 104 can identify one or more hotels that are located within a specified distance from a particular location. In some implementations, themapping system 104 identifies one or more hotels locations that are reachable from a particular location within a specified transit time, as described below. The term “hotel” as used in the specification can refer generically to various types of accommodations including hotels, motels, lodges, or resorts. - The
mapping system 104 can communicate with atransportation information database 112 to obtain data describing locations of transport hubs, e.g., train stations, in a geographic region. The data can also identify, for each transport hub, transport options, e.g., trains, that are available at the transport hub, destination transport hubs that are reachable from the transport hub, and respective transit times for reaching the destination transport hubs. Thetransport information database 112 can store data describing geographic locations of other types of transport hubs in a geographic region, e.g., bus stops and ferry ports, their respective transport options, reachable destination transport hubs, and transit times for reaching the destination transport hubs. - A destination transport hub may be directly reachable from a transport hub, e.g., a train runs from the transport hub to the destination transport hub. A destination transport hub may also be indirectly reachable from a transport hub. For example, a bus station can be reached from a train station by walking or driving from the train station to the bus station. In some cases, the destination transport hub may be indirectly reachable from the transport hub through one or more intermediary transport hubs. For any given case, the
transport information database 112 can store data describing one or more ways of reaching a destination transport hub and corresponding transit times for reaching the destination transport hub from the transport hub. - The term “train” as used in the specification can refer generically to various types of mass transit rail systems, e.g., subways and metros. The term “bus” as used in the specification can refer generically to various types of mass public transit systems, e.g., shuttles.
- The
mapping system 104 can use the data available in thetransportation information database 112 to determine a shortest transit time between two transport hubs. In some implementations, the shortest transit time is calculated based on average transit times for traveling from a first transport hub to a second transport hub. The shortest transit times can also be calculated based on average transit times for a particular day of the week, time of day, holiday, or real-time traffic data. In calculating the shortest transit time, themapping system 104 considers all ways of reaching a first transport hub from the second transport hub. Shortest transit times between locations, e.g., transport hubs, can be determined using generally known techniques for calculating single-source shortest paths, e.g., Djikstra's algorithm. - For each transport hub, the
mapping system 104 can store, in an index, data describing a transport hub, destination transport hubs that are reachable from the transport hub, and shortest transit times from the transport hub to the respective destination transport hubs. For example, for a transport hub, e.g., a train station S1, themapping system 104 can store, in an index, data describing one or more destination transport hubs, e.g., train stations S3, S4, and bus station B1, and respective shortest transit times from the transport hub S1 to the destination transport hubs, e.g., 3 minutes, 10 minutes, and 25 minutes. In some implementations, themapping system 104 stores, in the index, data describing a transport hub, destination transport hubs that are reachable from the transport hub, and shortest transit times from the transport hub to the respective destination transport hubs based on a given day and/or time. In some implementations, the index stores, for each first transport hub, data describing destination transport hubs that are reachable within 60 minutes. - The
network 101 can be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony or wireless networks, or a combination thereof. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of anexample index 200 describing data collected by a system, e.g., themapping system 104. In some implementations, theindex 200 stores data describing atransport hub 202,destination transport hubs 204 that are reachable from thetransport hub 202, and respectiveshortest transit times 206 from thetransport hub 202 to thedestination transport hubs 204. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for determining areas that are reachable from a location. For convenience, the process 300 will be described with respect to a system, e.g.,search system 100, including one or more computing devices that performs the process 300. - The system receives user input specifying a location and a threshold transit time (302). The user input can be received from a client device communicating over a network. The user input can be specified in a graphical user interface (GUI), e.g., the GUI described below in reference to
FIG. 4 . The system can identify a geographic position for the specified location on a map, as described in reference toFIG. 1 . In some implementations, when the user input specifies the location as the name of a city, the system identifies the specified location as the city center of the city. - The system determines a first reachable geographic area from the specified location (304). In some implementations, the system determines a first reachable geographic area from the specified location by defining an area, e.g., a circular region, centered on the specified location. The circular region can be calculated using a travel distance radius that estimates a distance that is reachable from the specified location based on a transit speed and the threshold transit time.
- To calculate the travel distance radius, the system determines a distance that is reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time. The distance is based on one or more transit speeds. For example, the system can determine, based on a walking speed of 3 kilometers per hour and a threshold transit time of 30 minutes, a travel distance radius of 1.5 kilometers. Based on this travel distance radius, the system can identify a circular region that represents a reachable geographic region around the specified location, e.g., a circular region around the specified location having a 1.5 kilometer radius.
- In some implementations, the transit speed used in calculating the travel distance radius is based on a predetermined walking speed, e.g., 3 kilometers per hour. In some implementations, the transit speed is based on a specified transit method, e.g., driving or bicycling. In some implementations, the transit speed is specified by a user.
- The system determines one or more first transport hubs that are located within the first reachable geographic area (306). Transport hubs can be determined as described, for example, in
FIG. 1 . For each of the first transport hubs, the system can also determine a respective shortest transit time for reaching the first transport hub from the specified location. In calculating the shortest transit time between the specified location and a first transport hub, the system considers a time cost of directly traveling, e.g., walking, to the first location. The system can also consider a time cost of traveling to the first location using one or more intermediary transport hubs, e.g., walking from the specified location to a train station S1, and taking a train from the train station S1 to the train station S3. - The system determines one or more second transport hubs that are reachable from the specified location based on the threshold transit time (208). In some implementations, the system identifies a collection of destination transport hubs that are reachable from the first transport hubs and respective shortest transit times for reaching the destination transport hubs from the first transport hubs. The system can identify destination transport hubs and transit times using an index, e.g., the index described in reference to
FIG. 2 . - The system identifies, from the collection of destination transport hubs, second transport hubs that are reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time. In identifying a second transport hub, the system determines whether a time cost for reaching the second transport hub from the specified location is within the threshold transit time. In some implementations, the time cost is based on a sum of a shortest transit time for reaching a first transport hub from the specified location and a shortest transit time for reaching the second transport hub from the first transport hub. First transport hubs, destination transport hubs, and second transport hubs are further described in reference to
FIG. 7 . - For each of the second transport hubs, the system also determines a shortest transit time for reaching the second transport hub from the specified location. In determining a shortest transit time for the second transport hubs, the system considers the transit times for all paths from the specified location to the first transport hubs and the transit times for all paths from the first transport hubs to the second transport hub.
- The system determines respective reachable geographic areas from the one or more second transport hubs (310). In some implementations, the system determines respective reachable geographic areas from the second transport hubs by defining an area, e.g., a circular region, around each of the second transport hubs. Each respective circular region can be calculated using a travel distance radius that estimates a distance that is reachable from a second transport hub that is within the threshold transit time based on the transit speed. In determining whether the reachable distance from a second transport hub is within the threshold transit time, the system factors in a time cost for reaching the second transport hub from the specified location. In other words, the sum of a time cost for traveling the reachable distance from a second transport hub and the time cost for reaching the second transport hub from the specified location should not exceed the threshold transit time.
- The system determines a combined reachable geographic area (312). The system can merge the reachable geographic areas defined for each of the second transport hubs and the first reachable geographic area into data describing a combined reachable geographic area.
- The system provides data describing the combined reachable area and a corresponding map that encompasses the combined reachable area to the client device (314). The client device can display the map and the combined reachable area to indicate areas that are reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time.
- In some implementations, data describing the second transport hubs and respective shortest transit times for reaching the second transport hubs from the specified location are provided to the client device. In such implementations, the user can adjust the threshold transit time, e.g., using a transit time filter as described in reference to
FIG. 4 . In response to adjusting the threshold transit time, the client device can use the data to identify transport hubs that are reachable from the specified location within the adjusted threshold transit time. The client device can also use the data to determine respective reachable geographic areas from the second transport hubs and a combined reachable geographic area, as described above. - The system optionally determines a listing of hotels reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time (316). In some implementations, the system determines an index of hotels located in a geographic region. The system can use the index to identify hotels that are reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time. In such implementations, the system constructs the index by identifying hotels that are located within the combined reachable geographic area. For each identified hotel, the system determines a hotel time cost for reaching the hotel from the specified location. In some implementations, the hotel time cost is determined based on a sum of a shortest transit time for reaching the hotel from a second transport hub and a shortest transit time for reaching the second transport hub from the specified location.
- In some implementations, the system uses the index to determine a listing of hotels that are reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time. The user can adjust the threshold transit time and, in response, the system can revise the hotel listing to display listings of hotels that are reachable within the adjusted threshold transit time. In determining reachable hotels, the system can compare each hotel's respective hotel time cost with the adjusted threshold transit time to identify hotels that have a respective hotel time cost that is within the adjusted threshold transit time.
- In some other implementations, the index of hotels is provided to the client device and the client device uses the index to determine a listing of hotels that are reachable from the specified location within the threshold transit time. The client device can respond to user adjustments to the threshold transit time by determining an updated listing of hotels that are reachable from the specified location within the adjusted threshold transit time.
- Alternatively, the system provides the index to the client device for display as a hotel listing. The user can adjust the threshold transit time and, in response to the adjustment, the client device can revise the hotel listing to display listings of hotels that are reachable within the adjusted threshold transit time. In determining reachable hotels, the client device can compare each hotel's respective hotel time cost with the adjusted threshold transit time to identify hotels that have a respective hotel time cost that is within the adjusted threshold transit time.
- In some implementations, the user can specify one or more additional locations and the system can determine an aggregate combined reachable area that represents a reachable geographic area from all specified locations within the threshold transit time. The system can independently determine a combined reachable area for each specified location, as described above, and calculate an aggregate combined reachable area for the specified locations based on an intersection of the independently determined combined reachable areas for each specified location.
- A particular hotel can be specified as the specified location, together with a threshold transit time, and the system can use the process 300 to determine areas that are reachable from the particular hotel within the threshold transit time. In some implementations, the system identifies one or more points of interests that are located within the areas that are reachable from the particular hotel within the threshold transit time.
- In some implementations, the system builds an index, e.g., the
index 200 as described in reference toFIG. 2 , and stores the index in memory, e.g., random access memory (“RAM”). In such implementations, when the system receives, through a client device, user input specifying a location, the system determines an index that identifies hotels that are reachable from the specified location within a threshold transit time. The system communicates the index of hotels to the client device. The client device can use the index to filter and display listings of hotels that are reachable within a specified threshold transit time. -
FIG. 4 is an example hotel results listing 400 includingreachability map 408. Thereachability map 408 displays an area that is reachable 409 from a location that was specified in asearch box 402. Thereachable area 409 is determined based on athreshold transit time 404 and atransport option 406. The threshold transit time can be specified by value or by adjusting a slidingscale 404.FIG. 4 also includes a hotel results listing 410 includes a list of hotels including hotel name, snippets of corresponding hotel reviews, class, e.g., star level rating, user rating, relative price, and price per night. - In some implementations, the transport option is walking and the reachable area is determined by defining an area, e.g., a circular region, around the specified location, as described above. In some implementations, the transport option is driving and the reachable area is determined based on a default driving speed. Alternatively, when the transport option is driving, the system can compute reachable areas using intersections between major roads or highways as transport hubs. In some implementations, the system identifies important intersections by evaluating the amount of traffic that travels through the respective intersections over a particular time period, e.g., hour, day, month, or year. In some implementations, the transport option is public transit and the reachable area is determined by calculating a combined reachable area, as described above.
- In some implementations, the transport option is automatically selected by the system based on a city corresponding to the specified location. In some implementations, the transport option is automatically selected by the system based on a threshold percentage of previous queries specifying a particular transport option for a city corresponding to the specified location. In some implementations, the transport option is automatically selected by the system based a threshold count of one or more of transport hubs and transport options.

InFIG. 5 , thereachability map 500 spotlights areas that are reachable from the specifiedlocation 502 within a first threshold transit time, e.g., 15 minutes. In contrast, areas that are unreachable from the specifiedlocation 502 within the first threshold transit time are shown without spotlighting. - In some implementations, data describing respective transit times from particular hotels to a point of interest are displayed in a map, e.g., the
map 500, along with respective hotel indicators, as a way to provide users with a graphical interface for comparing hotel distances from the point of interest. In some implementations, data describing respective transit times from hotels to a particular point of interest is used when ranking hotels in relation to the particular point of interest. -

InFIG. 6 , thereachability map 600 spotlights areas that are reachable from the specifiedlocation 602 within a second threshold transit time, e.g., 30 minutes. In contrast to thereachability map 500 as described in reference toFIG. 5 , thereachability map 600 shows a larger reachability area as a result of the threshold transit time being increased from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. -
FIG. 7 is an example illustration of determining reachable areas from a specifiedlocation 702. Areas that are reachable from the specifiedlocation 702 can be determined using the process described in reference toFIG. 3 . InFIG. 7 , a first reachablegeographic area 704 for a specifiedlocation 702 is determined based on athreshold transit time 706. The first reachablegeographic area 704 represents, for example, an area that can be traveled, e.g., by walking, from the specified location within thethreshold transit time 706. Next,first transport hubs geographic area 704. - Destination transport hubs are identified from each of the

location 702 are identified from the destination transport hubs based on thethreshold transit time 706. InFIG. 7 ,destination transport hubs location 702 within thethreshold transit time 706. In contrast, thedestination transport hub 714 is not identified as a second transport hub because the amount of time needed to reach thedestination transport hub 714 from the specifiedlocation 702 exceeds thethreshold transit time 706. Similarly,destination transport hubs location 702 within thethreshold transit time 706. Next, respective reachablegeographic areas second transport hubs threshold transit time 706. The reachablegeographic areas location 702 within thethreshold transit time 706. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.

The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
- Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server.
- While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular embodiments of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- Thus, particular embodiments of the subject matter have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
