Definitions
- the present invention relates to a device for the compensation of chromatic dispersion comprising a compensating optical fibre with a core region surrounded by a cladding region in which a plurality of holes is present which run along the compensating optical fibre longitudinally.
- the present invention also relates to an optical communication line comprising a transmission optical fibre length having, at a wavelength ⁇ , a positive chromatic dispersion slope s t and/or a positive chromatic dispersion coefficient D t and a compensating optical fibre length with a negative chromatic dispersion slope s c and/or a negative chromatic dispersion coefficient D c .
- the present invention also relates to an optical communication system comprising such an optical communication line and a method for designing a compensating optical fibre so that, at a predefined wavelength ⁇ , it has a negative chromatic dispersion slope s c and/or a negative chromatic dispersion coefficient D c .
- the optical fibres are commonly used in the field of optical telecommunications for the transmission of signals. Essentially they comprise an inner cylindrical region, called core, within which a signal is transmitted and an outer annular region, called cladding.
- the cladding has a refractive index lower than that of the core in order to confine the signal transmitted within the latter.
- the core and the cladding are made from a silica based vitreous material and the difference in the refractive index between the core and the cladding is obtained by incorporating suitable additives (dopants) in the vitreous matrix of the core and/or of the cladding.
- suitable additives dopants
- the chromatic dispersion (or second order dispersion), defined by the above-mentioned coefficient D, is a phenomenon for which different spectral components of a pulse of light that propagates in an optical fibre travel at different speeds causing a time spreading of the pulse.
- the chromatic dispersion limits therefore, the maximum data transmission speed (that is, the bit rate) or the maximum length of a link without electrical regeneration of the signal.
- chromatic dispersion is a phenomenon that depends on the wavelength so that pulses of light at different wavelength propagate in an optical fibre at different speeds.
- This last phenomenon is a problem in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical communication system in which the information is transported along the same optical fibre by a plurality of optical signals at different wavelengths.
- WDM wavelength division multiplexing
- devices are already known that comprise an optical fibre suitably designed to have values of the chromatic dispersion coefficient D and of the chromatic dispersion slope that are very high and of an opposite sign with regards to those of the SMF optical fibre for which dispersion compensation is required.
- the devices to compensate the dispersion typically, have negative chromatic dispersion coefficient and chromatic dispersion slope.
- Negative slope dispersion compensating fibers OFC '99, WM14, pages 235-237
- OFC '99, WM14, pages 235-237 describe an optical fibre, to compensate the dispersion of a SMF optical fibre, with a refractive index profile designed in order to obtain negative values of the chromatic dispersion coefficient D and of the chromatic dispersion slope s in order to compensate the positive values of the SMF fibre.
- a holey optical fibre is an optical fibre typically made of a single type of material in which the difference in the refractive index between the core and the cladding, which provides a guided propagation, is achieved through the presence of holes in the cladding which reduce the refractive index of the material from which the fibre is made.
- a holey optical fibre has a cladding region comprising holes that run along the entire length of the fibre and a core region determined by the absence of at least one hole in the material.
- the U.S. Pat. No. 5,802,236 describes a micro-structured optical fibre which includes a solid silica core region surrounded by a inner cladding region and an outer cladding region.
- the cladding region has capillary holes that extend in the axial direction of the fibre.
- the holes in the outer cladding region are of a smaller diameter than the holes in the inner cladding region and therefore the effective refractive index of the outer cladding region is greater than the effective refractive index of the inner cladding region.
- this type of fibre may have high negative values of the chromatic dispersion coefficient D (for example, values that are more negative than ⁇ 300 ps/nm*Km) at a predetermined wavelength (for example, 1550 nm) and high negative values of the chromatic dispersion slope s so that the fibre can carry out a dispersion compensation in a range of wavelengths of 20 nm or more.
- a micro-structured optical fibre is described in which the holes of the outer cladding region are of a diameter equal to 0.688 ⁇ m, the holes of the inner cladding region have a diameter equal to 0.833 ⁇ m and the centre to centre distance ⁇ between the holes is 0.925 ⁇ m.
- such fibres may have, at 1550 nm, a chromatic dispersion slope of ⁇ 2.3 ps*nm ⁇ 2 *Km ⁇ 1 with a negative chromatic dispersion value of ⁇ 680 ps/(nm*Km) so that they may compensate a conventional optical fibre with a length 55 times greater over a 100 nm band centred around 1550 nm. Therefore, the Authors conclude that such fibres have great potential for the compensation of chromatic dispersion.
- a holey optical fibre may be produced by forming a preform starting from a bundle of empty tubes arranged according to a predetermined structure in which the central tube is replaced by a solid bar which will make up the core region of the fibre.
- the preform achieved in this way is then spinned in order to achieve a holey optical fibre with holes of diameter d and pitch ⁇ .
- the spinning process generally allows for the initial structure of the arrangement of the tubes in the preform to remain almost unchanged and, therefore, to achieve the desired value of pitch ⁇ with a high level of precision.
- the Applicant has noted that during the spinning process of the preform, the diameter of the tubes may vary so that it is not be possible to achieve with as much precision the desired value of the diameter d (and, therefore of the ratio d/ ⁇ ).

- a compensating optical fibre having, according to the invention, a negative chromatic dispersion slope s c , a first and at least one second ring of holes of a diameter d substantially equal and a ratio d/ ⁇ 0.8, has stable dispersion features with respect to modification of the parameter d/ ⁇ .

Even more preferably, it is comprised within the typical transmission band of an optical amplifier doped with erbium (that is between 1530 and 1600 nm).
- the compensating optical fibre length is placed within, upstream or, advantageously, downstream said transmission optical fibre length.
- the Applicant has found that the above-mentioned relationship D allows to achieve, within the values of ⁇ contemplated by the above-mentioned relationship C, an optimal value of ⁇ corresponding to a high absolute value of the chromatic dispersion slope s c .
- This advantageously, allows to compensate the dispersion s t *L t of the transmission optical fibre length with a short length L c of the compensating optical fibre length.
- the Applicant has in fact found that the above-mentioned relationship (F) makes sure that the compensating optical fibre length has such a chromatic dispersion coefficient D c and such a chromatic dispersion slope s c that the ratio D c /s c is substantially equal to the ratio D t /s t .

Furthermore, such stability increases significantly for a ratio d/ ⁇ equal to least 0.9.
- the stability of the ratio D/s with respect to the ratio d/ ⁇ , for a value of the ratio d/ ⁇ greater or equal to 0.8, is, furthermore, clear from FIG. 10 that illustrates the pattern of the ratio D/s (expressed in nm) with respect to the ratio d/ ⁇ for a value of ⁇ equal to 1, 1.1 and 1.15 ⁇ m.

That is, a maximum variation in the ratio D/s of only approximately ⁇ 5.2 nm corresponds to a variation of 0.01 in the ratio d/ ⁇ .
- the Applicant has verified that a variation of 0.01 in the ratio d/ ⁇ , around a value of d/ ⁇ of 0.9, corresponds to a variation in the ratio D/s of only approximately ⁇ 1.4 nm, while a variation of 0.01 of the ratio d/ ⁇ , around a value of d/ ⁇ of 0.95, corresponds to a variation of the ratio D/s only of approximately ⁇ 0.75 nm.
- Table 3 illustrates the values of ⁇ , d, L c achieved with the relations B, C and E of the method of the invention for a value of d/ ⁇ equal to 0.8 to compensate both the chromatic dispersion slope s t and the chromatic dispersion coefficient D t of the transmission optical fibre length 10 , in the case of length L t equal to 100 Km and in the different cases in which it is made up of a SMF, TWTM, TW+TM, TW RSTM, LEAF, LEAF Enhanced and FreeLightTM optical fibre (the typical values of D t , s t and D t /s t of these optical fibres are illustrated in Table 1).
