Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to notifying individuals about potential fraud, and more particularly to notifying users contemplating transactions over a distributed computer network about other user's prior transaction histories.
- the use of the Internet has provided great advances and tremendous access to information.
- the Internet has also provided a method for conducting transactions between individuals and/or parties. These transactions can take place between individuals and parties that are at great distances from one another.
- the present embodiments provide methods, apparatuses, systems, architectures, computer readable medium, and processes for use in notifying users of potential risks in entering into transactions with other users. Some preferred embodiments generate notifications to users recommending that users review other users' transaction ratings and/or histories. These embodiments further monitor and maintain user ratings.
- Some embodiments provide a method for use in facilitating transactions between users. This method determines that a first user is interested in entering into a transaction with a second user, determines a summary rating of the second user, and notifies the first user of the second user's summary rating prior to the first user entering into a transaction with the second user. In some implementations, the method further determines that the second user's summary rating is below a first threshold, generates the notification to the first user to review the second users summary rating, and implements the notification of the first user prior to the first user entering into the transaction with the second user when the second user's summary rating is below the first threshold. According to some embodiments, the method notifies the first user by displaying a warning box notifying the first user to review the second user's summary rating. Further, the method can determine that the second user's summary rating is above the first threshold, and prevent the notification to the first user when the second user's summary rating is above the first threshold.
- an alternative method for use in notifying users entering into transactions determines that a first user is interested in entering into a transaction with a second user, determines when the second user has a negative summary rating, generates a notification when the second user has a negative summary rating, and forwarding the notification to the first user.
- the method can further determine when the second user's summary rating is less than a first threshold, and generate the notification when the second user has a summary rating that is less than the first threshold.
- Some embodiments further determine when the second user has been performing transactions for less than a second threshold period of time, and generates the notification when the second user has been performing transactions for less than the second threshold period of time.
- the apparatus comprises a memory that stores ratings and summary ratings, a rating calculator coupled with the memory, the rating calculator receives at least a portion of the ratings and calculates the summary ratings, a ratings evaluator coupled with the memory, the ratings evaluator determines when the summary ratings exceed a first threshold, and a notification generator coupled with the ratings evaluator, the notification generator generates a notification when a first summary rating does not exceed the first threshold.
- the apparatus can further include ratings counter coupled with the memory, the ratings counter counts a number of ratings received for each user.
- the apparatus further comprises a counter evaluator coupled with the ratings counter, the ratings evaluator determines when a number of ratings of a first user does not exceed a second threshold, the notification generator further couples with the counter evaluator, and the notification generator generates the notification when the number of ratings of the first user does not exceed the second threshold

- FIG. 5 depicts a simplified diagram of a list of products identified by a search method and/or engine, displayed for example through an Internet site;
- FIG. 6 depicts a simplified diagram of an Internet site that a user accesses, according to some embodiment, to participate in transactions facilitated by the present embodiments;
- FIG. 7 depicts a simplified diagram of an Internet site displaying an example of a user's summary rating information
- FIG. 8 depicts a simplified block diagram of a server, such as the server of FIG. 1 , according to some present embodiments.
- FIG. 9 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a procedure for informing users about user ratings and the issuing of notifications about users' summary ratings.
- the present embodiments provide apparatuses, systems, architectures, processes, computer readable medium encoded with code segments for implementing processes, and methods for tracking transactions, and providing individuals with information about other users' prior transaction histories.
- the present embodiments further provide users with the ability to evaluate other users based on the other user's prior transaction histories.
- users are rated by other uses with which the users have had transactions. The ratings of a first user allow other users to determine risks of being defrauded or having problems in entering into transactions with the first user.
- FIG. 1 depicts a simplified block diagram of a system 110 according to some embodiments that allow a plurality of users 122 – 125 to gain access to information, for example through searches, to communicate, and to conduct transactions.
- Each user couples with a distributed network 112 .
- the distributed network 112 allows users to access information, communicate with other users, and transfer data between users 122 – 125 and/or servers 134 and 136 .
- the distributed network can be implemented through a network such as the Internet or other such distributed networks.
- Data can be communicated over the network directly between users 122 – 126 , or data can be communicated over the network through one or more servers.
- users gain access to information and/or conduct transactions through one or more servers where the users typically do not directly communicate without communicating through the server.
- a first user e.g., user 122
- a second user e.g., user 123
- the server 134 can retrieve information and/or view items and/or services for sale by the first user.
- the second user 123 can further offer through the first server 134 to buy an item from the first user 122 .
- the first user accepts this offer, a transaction occurs for the sale of the item requested.
- the second user can provide credit card information to the first user, and/or the second user sends money, a check or other payment to the second user.
- the first user can send the product purchased to the second user completing the transaction.
- a user can forward information about the product to be sold to the one or more servers 134 , 136 .
- the servers can store the information locally in internal memory 140 and/or external memory 142 – 144 .
- the external memory is directly coupled with the server (e.g., memory 142 ) and in some instances the memory can be accessed over the distributed network 112 .
- the one or more servers can track transactions and provide users with information about other user with whom they are contemplating conducting a transaction.
- the server can track a past history of the first user 122 and supply part or all of that past history to the second user 123 so that the second user can evaluate the risk of conducting the transaction.
- Some preferred embodiments supply warnings and/or fraud information to users prior to the conclusion of a transaction so that users can better determine whether they in fact want to enter into a transaction with a certain user. Further, some embodiments provide warnings once a user identifies a product and/or service to purchase.
- the present embodiments can display a warning to the first user regarding a second user offering the product for sale when the second user has a negative or low rating, or fails to meet other criteria.
- the present embodiments typically display the warning prominently so that the user is aware of the warning.
- the servers can request information from users after a transaction has taken place to get feedback from a user about the other party that participated in the transaction.
- the system 110 and/or a server(s) 134 , 136 evaluates the feedback and maintains statistics on users based on the feedback.
- each user is tracked and a rating is generated based on prior transactions.
- Other users can access or are supplied with the ratings about other users.
- the rating can be generated based on feedback from other users interacting with and/or conducting transactions with a user. Feedback of a first user received from other users is recorded and a rating is determined based on the feedback. For example, other users can rate a first user as GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL.
- the system can apply a +1 value for each Good rating, a ⁇ 1 value for each Bad rating, and a zero (0) for each Neutral rating.
- a user's rating can further be adjusted based on requests for claims adjustment from users that did not receive items purchased after payment was made. A summation of the ratings can then be generated.
- This summation or a derivative of the summation can be provided to other users, for example, in the form of a total rating score, a number of icons (e.g., five stars “*” indicating a good rating and one star “*” indicating a poor rating; “thumbs-up” or “thumbs-down” symbols; and other such icons), a percentage rating (e.g., based on other users ratings, based on a threshold level, or other such percentages), and/or other such indications.
- the summary rating can further be based on other criteria and/or additional criteria. For example, a user's summary rating can be decreased if complaints are submitted about the user other than through ratings, if a buyer protection claim is filed against a user, and other such factors.
- the rating summation is limited so that each rating used in determining the summary rating is from a unique rater. For example, if a first user rates a second user ten (10) times, only one of those ten ratings is used in determining the summary rating. Further, the rating from a unique rater can, in some instances, be the most recent rating. Again for example, if the first user rates a second user with a GOOD rating, a +1 rating can be applied to the summary rating. If the first user later rates the second user with a BAD rating, the +1 rating is removed and a ⁇ 1 rating is applied when determining the summary rating for the second user.
- the summary rating can identify a total summary rating, a total number of ratings received, a history of ratings, whether the user was ever prevented from carrying out transactions, whether the user failed to deliver products, whether the user is a verified user (as described fully below) and other such information. Additional information can be provide with the summary rating and/or a user's transaction history including, but not limited to, seller and buyer IDs, dates indicating completions of transaction, title of the transaction or auction, potentially an Internet link to access data and/or a web page of the transaction, and other such data.
- the system 110 can allow users to access a summary rating in determining the risks in entering transactions with other users.
- the system further notifies or warns a first user when a second user with whom the first user is considering entering into a transaction with has a summary rating below a desired level or threshold.
- Some embodiments notify a first user when a second user has participated in less than a fixed or threshold number of transactions. This notification can be generated because the accuracy of the second user's summary rating has not been established based on an insufficient record. Additionally and/or alternatively, some embodiments notify a first user when a second user has been rated by other users less than a fixed or threshold number of times.
- some embodiments notify a first user when a second user has not been registered with the system for greater than a fixed or threshold period of time. For example, if the second user is a new user, and has only been registered with the system for less than a fixed period of time (e.g., 60 days), the system can generate a notification that the second user's summary rating has not been verified for a long enough period of time.
- a fixed or threshold period of time e.g. 60 days
- the warning regarding another user's rating can be provided at substantially any time during the process of finding an item or service, negotiating a transaction and completing the transaction.
- a warning is displayed, according to some embodiments, when a first user initiates a search for a desired product and a list of products that potentially meet the criteria of the first user's search.
- a warning can additional and/or alternatively be displayed once the first user selects an item indetified through a search or other means.
- a warning can be displayed once the first user offers to buy or bids on a product.
- a warning can be displayed on a notification that the first user is the highest bidder or has had an offer to purchase accepted, or at substantially any stage of a transaction.
- FIG. 2 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a process 210 for determining if and when a user should be notified about other users' summary ratings.
- the process identifies that a first and second user are considering entering into a transaction. For example, if a first user is selling a product by auction, the process can recognize when the second user is identified as being the winning bidder. As another example, the first user's product can be identified as meeting the second user's search of a product, such that a warning might be displayed with a list of identified products meeting the search. As yet another example, the system can detected that the second user has accessed information about the product being sold by the first user. In step 214 , it is determined if the first user has a summary rating.
- step 216 is entered where it is determined if the summary rating is negative. If the summary rating for the first user is negative step 220 is entered where a notification or warning is generate and forwarded to the second user.
- the notification can recommend that the second user access the first user's rating and/or transaction history information, or can simply provide the rating information. Additionally and/or alternatively, the notification can include the first user's summary rating and/or other transaction history.
- step 224 is entered where it is determined if the summary rating of the first user exceeds a summary rating threshold.
- the step 224 can determine if the first user's summary rating is greater than a +10 value.
- the summary rating threshold is defined by the system and can vary for different types of users, different types of transactions, the costs of products, and other such criteria. Further, the threshold can be dynamic such that the system can vary the threshold(s) based on feedback, evaluation of statistics, user input and complaints and other such parameters. If the first user's rating does not exceed the summary rating threshold, the process continues to step 220 where a warning is generated and forwarded to the second user.
- step 234 is entered where the process determines if the first user is a verified user.
- the system can allow users to be verified and/or provide safeguards. For example, some users can be verified users by registering such that payments are forwarded to independent third parties, recognized by the system, which then forward payments to the selling user. Some users can post a bond or deposit money, and/or provide insurance that can be accessed by the system operators in the event that the users attempt to defraud other users. Additionally and/or alternatively, users can be registered as PayDirect address verified, such that the system and/or operators have verified a users' address. Other types of user verification as are known in the art can be conducted to certify that the user is a legitimate user with minimal risk of fraud.
- the system may limit some users (e.g., individual users) to register with the system only upon providing a credit card number, and limiting that credit card number to be associated with a single user ID. Further information about a user can also be required, such as E-mail address, billing address of credit card, alternate mailing address, recording an Internet Protocol address from which a user registers and/or accesses the system, and other such information. If the first user is not a verified user, the process 210 continues to step 220 where a warning or notification is generated and forwarded to the second user.
- a warning or notification is generated and forwarded to the second user.
- step 216 If it is determined in step 216 that the first user's summary rating is not negative and that the summary rating is greater than the threshold in step 224 , and/or that the first user is a verified user in step 234 , the process continues to step 244 where it is determined if the first user has been registered and/or has been active with the system for longer than a threshold period of time.
- This threshold period can be set to substantially any period of time, and is typically determined by the system operators depending on the types and/or costs of transaction, the time period expected to determine that a user is a legitimate user and other such criteria.
- step 246 the process terminates in step 246 without generating a warning or notification to the second user suggesting that the second user should review the first user's summary rating.
- the process continues to step 220 where the notification and/or warning is generated and forwarded to the second user.
- FIG. 3 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a process 310 for use in generating and maintaining a user's summary rating.
- a new rating is received, for example a first user submits a rating about a second user.
- step 314 If it is determined in step 314 that a summary rating exists, the process alternatively proceeds to step 320 where it is determined if the first user has previously rated the second user. If the first user has rated the second user, step 322 is entered where the first user's previous rating of second user is retrieved. In step 324 , the process determines if the previous rating is different than the current rating. If the previous and current ratings are the same, step 326 is entered where the new rating from the first user is recorded, the summary rating is not altered and the process 310 terminates. Alternatively, if the previous and current ratings are different, the previous rating is removed from the calculation of the summary rating in step 328 . Typically, the system does not delete previous ratings as these rating are maintained for further transaction history data, further statistics, and other such uses. In some implementations, old ratings may be deleted, for example, ratings older than one year or some other time period.
- step 334 is entered where the first user's current rating is recorded and associated with the second user's ratings.
- step 336 all of the relevant ratings associated with the second user are retrieved.
- a user's ratings that are older than a predefined period may be purged or not used in the calculation of summary rating so that the summary rating is maintained as current.
- only a last predefined number of ratings are used (for example, only the last 50 ratings might be used in the calculation of the summary rating).
- the second user's summary rating is calculated based on all of and/or the relevant ratings of the second user.
- the process may recalculate or adjust the summary rating based on the new rating instead of recalculating the summary rating based on all of the relevant previous ratings.
- the second user's summary rating is recorded and associated with the second user.
- a total number of raters of the second user is incremented to reflect that an additional user has rated the second user.
- FIG. 4 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a process 410 according to some embodiments for use in maintaining a relevant summary rating threshold.
- the systems and/or methods are dynamic such that parameters, criteria and/or thresholds can be adjusted to maintain the systems and methods as current, and effective.
- the process 410 of FIG. 4 is one example of one implementation for allowing the systems and/or methods to be dynamic by, at least in part, adjusting the threshold if too many users' ratings are fluctuating between above and below the threshold indicating that the threshold may not be, for example, high enough.
- a rating of a user is received, for example, a first user submits a rating of a second user.
- the summary rating threshold identifies the user as a relatively lower risk if the user's summary rating equals or exceeds the threshold, and identifies the user as a potential risk or is a higher risk when the summary rating is below the threshold.
- step 416 is entered where the user's summary rating is recalculated.
- the recalculating can be implemented through a process similar, at least in part, to the process 310 of FIG. 3 and/or other processes.
- step 422 it is determined if the second user's recalculated summary rating falls below the first summary rating threshold. If the second user's recalculated summary rating does fall below the first summary rating threshold, step 424 is entered where the second user is recorded.
- step 426 a total number of users that have recalculated summary ratings that have dropped below the first threshold in incremented.
- the process 410 determines if the total number of users having recalculated summary ratings that fall from above to below the first threshold exceeds a second dropped rating threshold.
- the number of users having recalculated summary ratings that fall from above to below the first summary rating threshold may be limited to summary ratings that have been recalculated within a predefined period of time (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 3 months or other such relevant time periods depending on the number of users, the frequency of users falling from above to below the summary rating threshold and other such criteria).
- the total number of users that have dropped below can be based on a period of time (e.g., those users that have dropped below within the last 6 months.
- step 432 is entered where the first rating summary threshold is increased.
- the process 410 can increase the first summary rating threshold by a single value (e.g., +1), by a fixed about (e.g., +5) or other such adjustments.
- the process 410 terminates.
- the summary rating threshold can similarly be decreased in some implementations, for example, if not enough user's ratings exceed the threshold.
- the systems and/or methods provide for other changes and variations in parameters and/or criteria besides the summary rating threshold.
- Some implementations can monitor the value of priced products and the ratings associated with users buying and selling products in price ranges. Additionally, some implementations monitor and adjust the summary rating threshold based on the types of products being sold. Other parameters and statistics can be monitored and evaluated allowing the systems and methods to be dynamic.
- users can access the system through a distributed network.
- one or more servers are utilized to generate one or more Internet sites that allow users to access information about available transactions facilitated through the system.
- the present embodiments can generate the notification and/or warning to users by generating and displaying a notification on the Internet site.
- the system can generate and display a separate graphical box or pop-up that prompts and/or recommend that a user access another user's summary rating, or simply displays an alternative Internet site with the other user's summary rating and/or transaction history information.
- FIG. 5 depicts a simplified diagram of a list 510 of products identified by a search method and/or engine, such as a search engine operated by Yahoo!TM, and displayed, for example through an Internet site.
- the search results include a user's search criteria and/or terms, indicated by reference numeral 512 .
- the search engine accesses one or more databases and/or other storage of information to identify entries 514 that match and/or closely match the search criteria 512 .
- the identified entries 514 are typically displayed, usually in a listed order dictated by the search method, such as how closely the identified entry matches the search criteria 512 .
- Some search results 514 may include information and/or links to products and/or services 516 that are for sale by other users (where the other users can be individuals, companies, partnerships, distributors, manufactures, and other such users utilizing transaction systems, such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! Auctions, other auction Internet sites, other Internet sites for selling products, and substantially any other venue for transactions where a user can retrieve data).

- FIG. 7 depicts a simplified diagram of an Internet site displaying an example of a user's summary rating and transaction history information 710 .
- the summary rating and history information includes a total summary rating 712 . Further, the total Good ratings 714 and total Bad ratings 716 are also displayed.
- the total rating includes ratings of a first user (e.g., FirstUser) as both a seller (rating 720 and 722 ) and as a buyer (rating 724 ).
- the history information can include a summary of past history 726 (for example, the first user participated in four (4) transactions with positive comments from three unique users).
- the summary can also include a time line rating history 730 allowing other users to identify if the first user's rating does not reflect current activities. For example, if a user has good ratings six months ago, but only bad ratings in the past month, some users may evaluate the first user as a greater risk than a summary rating may indicate.
- the history rating 710 can include additional information, recommendations, links to other information, advertising, related product information, links to other sellers of the same or similar products, pricing of other products sold by the user, and/or other information, recommendations, and access to other information.
- FIG. 8 depicts a simplified block diagram of a server, such as the server 136 of FIG. 1 , according to some embodiments.
- the server 136 generates the Internet site, such as the Internet site 610 shown in FIG. 6 , to facilitate transactions between two or more users.
- the server can include one or more central processing units (CPU) 812 that control the server 136 .
- the CPU can be implemented through a computer, a microprocessor and/or other controller(s) or combinations of controllers.
- One or more interfaces 814 are included in the server 136 , including one or more input ports 815 and one or more output ports 816 (and/or bidirectional ports).
- the interface 814 at least in part couples with the network 112 allowing the server to communicate with other components (e.g., user's computers, other servers, and memory) coupled with the network.
- the interface 814 can further allow the server 136 to couple with periphery devices, such as external memory, printer(s), display(s), keyboard(s), pointer device(s), and other such periphery devices.
- the server 136 can further include an internal memory 140 and/or can couple with external memory (e.g., external memory 142 coupled directly with the server, and/or one or more memories 144 coupled with the server 136 through the distributed network 112 ).
- the memory can store user information 820 , including rating information 822 (summary rating, all ratings received, total number of ratings, and other such relevant rating information), transaction history information 823 (prior purchases, prior sales, prior auction bids submitted, and other such transaction history), account information 824 (e.g., email address, mailing address, credit card information, and other such information), and other similar user information.
- the memory can additionally store programs 825 and executables 826 for the operation of the server, the communication with users and other components of the system, the operation of one or more Internet sites, the generation of notification to users, the displaying of notifications to users, the locations of notifications on a display, and other such data.
- the memory can include display parameters and data 827 for the generation of an Internet site, and data to be included on the Internet site 828 , such as data about products for sale by users, advertising information to be displayed on the Internet site, and other additional data. Other data and/or information can be included in the memory.
- the server 136 includes sub-processors or functional devices that perform some of the functional capabilities of the server.
- the sub-processors can include a rating calculator 840 , a ratings evaluator 842 , a notification generator 844 , a ratings counter 846 , a counter evaluator 850 , a summary ratings evaluator 852 , a threshold generator 854 , and other such sub-processors.
- the CPU 812 can include and/or perform the functions of one or more of the sub-processors. Additionally and/or alternatively, some of the sub-processes can be implemented through external devices accessed by the server 136 .
- the rating calculator 840 receives and/or retrieves from memory at least a portion of the ratings for users and calculates summary ratings for the users.
- the ratings evaluator 842 determines when the summary rating for a user exceeds a first threshold (e.g., a threshold indicating that a notice does not need to be forwarded to other users).
- the notification generator 844 can couple with the ratings evaluator, so that the notification generator can generate a notification when a summary rating does not exceed the first threshold.
- the ratings counter 846 couples with the memory and counts the number of ratings received for each user.
- the counter evaluator 850 determines if a user has received a predefined number or second threshold of ratings.
- the notification generator can further couple with the counter evaluator to generate a notification when the number of ratings of a user does not exceed the second threshold.
- the summary ratings evaluator 852 couples with the ratings evaluator, and determines whether a third threshold number of a first group of users having summary ratings that at one point exceeded the first threshold and have had their summary ratings adjusted below the first threshold. This allows the system to more accurately define the summary rating threshold to verify that it is not set too low so that users become verified as low risks, and then are re-evaluated as potential risks.
- a threshold generator 854 couples with the summary ratings evaluator 852 , to adjust the first threshold when the number of the first group of users exceeds the third threshold.
- Some embodiments include a time evaluator 856 that verifies that a user has been registered with the server and/or system for a minimum time period. For example, the time evaluator can notify the notification generator 844 that a first user has been registered for less than 60 days. The notification generator can then display a notification and/or cause a notification to be forward to other users that the first user has been registered for a limited time and has not been verified as a lower risk.
- the server 136 and/or the CPU 812 can include other sub-processors to perform other functions.
- One or more buses 860 or other internal communication coupling between CPU 812 , memory 140 , interfaces 814 (to other memory, users and/or other components), and sub-processors is also included within the server 136 .
- Some embodiments further monitor, track and manage other parameters, statistics and/or criteria in an attempt to further optimize operation and the notification of potential higher risk users. For example, some embodiments determine a total number of users, and/or a total number of active users (defined by substantially any criteria, such as, users that have accessed the system within the past 90 days). The number of users can further be sub-divided into a total number of users that meet certain criteria, such as total number of users that are selling products through the system, total number of users that have entered into more than a predefined number of transactions, and other sub-divisions.
- some embodiments can further determine a total number for each type of users, where the “type” is defined as “Negative”, “Unrated”, “Rated”, “Good”, and other such types. A percentage of users of each type can also be determined (e.g., total number of type/total number of users). Still further, categories of transactions can be defined, and users can be defined according to the categories in which they partake. The categories can be substantially any categories according to the transactions provided by the present embodiments.
- categories for sales of products can be defined as: Apparel, Accessories & Shoes; Bargains; Beauty; Books; Computers & Office; DVD & Video; Electronics; Flowers & Gifts; Health & Personal Care; Home, Garden & Garage; Jewelry & Watches; Music; Sports & Outdoors; Toys & Baby; Shop by Brand; Consumer Information (e.g., Consumer Reports®, PC World Reviews and other such consumer information); Auctions (e.g., Yahoo! Auctions); Shop by Store; Shopping by defined parameters (e.g., Yahoo! SmartSort); and other such categories.
- Other categories can be defined depending on the implementation of the embodiments.
- a total number of users participating in transactions in each category can be determined.
- a percentage of users per category can further be determined (e.g., total number of users participating in a category/total number of users).
- a category “Electronics” can allow for Auctions, user-to-user transactions, user-to-store transactions, and other such kinds of transactions.
- the present embodiments can in some implementations further determine a total number of kinds of transactions per category (e.g., determine a total number of auctions from each category type of user, per category).
- the total number of kinds of transactions from each type of user can also be determined per category (e.g., determine a total number of auctions from each category type of user, per category).
- Percentages of kinds of transactions per category, as well as percentage of types of users per kinds of transactions for each category can also be determined.
- Some implementations further determine a total number of bids on auctions from each type of user per category. A percentage of number of bids on auctions from each type of user per category can similarly be determined. Further, a total number of negative ratings per type of user pre category, and a percentage of number of negative ratings per type of user, pre category can also be ascertained.
- users can purchase insurance to insure against fraud during a transaction.
- the present embodiments can further determine the total number of insured transactions, a percentage of insured transactions relative to the total number of transactions, the total number of insurance claims, a total number of insurance claims for each type of user, a total number of insurance claims pre category, a total number of insurance claims for each type of user per category, a percentage of insurance claims for each type of user pre category (total insurance claims per category/total transactions per category), and other such statistics relative to insured transactions. Further, some implementations compare total insurance claims and percentages to gross merchandise sales (GMS), auctions, number and/or types of bids and other such statistics.
- GMS gross merchandise sales
- the present embodiments further determine statistics related to user ratings. For example, a total number of users accessing summary rating information on other users can be compiled. A percentage of users accessing summary rating information on other users can also be generated (e.g., users accessing summary/total users entering transactions; or users accessing summary/total users bidding). As indicated above, some implementations determine placement on a display (e.g., placement within an Internet site) of a notice to a user recommending the user check another user's summary rating. For example, a total number of users accessing summary rating information on other users according to placement can be determined. A percentage of users accessing summary rating information on other users can similarly be determined (e.g., users accessing summary/total users (bidding and/or entering transactions) according to placement).
- the rating thresholds defining when a user receives a notification and/or warning box can vary based on numerous conditions, criteria, parameters and statistics. For example, the threshold level for displaying a notification can be higher for more expensive products and lower for less expensive products. Further, for products that are below a certain value, one or more thresholds can be eliminated, so that in some instances a user does not receive a warning when a second user's rating is below a threshold and/or has not participated in a threshold number of transactions.
- the present embodiment can maintain statistics on the displaying of notifications and use of the notifications to access further user information/history, further information on recommendations, access to related products, use of coupons and other such statistics related to the displaying of the notification and the action of users based on the notification.
- the system further adjusts threshold levels and criteria in determining when to display a notification and what to include within the notification based on the statistics. Following adjustments the statistics are continued to be tracked so that further adjustments and fine tuning can be implemented.
- additional statistics are monitored and/or previous statistics are more rigorously examined during a predefined period of time following an adjustment to a threshold or other adjustment.
- the utilization of the statistics allows the system to be dynamic and flexible. The system can tailor the notifications based on the types of transactions, the costs of transactions, the types of user, and other such criteria.
- users that have summary ratings below a defined threshold are prevented from participating in further transactions facilitated by the system.
- this denial of access can further be limited by the number of transactions and/or the time period in which the user participates in transactions.
- a user selling products may be denied access if the user has a negative five ( ⁇ 5) summary rating. Further, a user may be denied access if the user obtains a summary rating of a negative three ( ⁇ 3), when the user has participated in less than five (5) transactions. Similarly, a user may be denied access if the user obtains a summary rating of a negative three ( ⁇ 3), when the user has been registered for less than one month.
- These values for summary ratings, the number of transactions, and time periods defined are simply examples, and the embodiments are not limited to these values. Alternatively, some present embodiments evaluate these values and can make adjustments to these values to avoid fraudulent transactions and/or improve user confidence. Some embodiments determine total numbers of users denied access to system, and further determine percentage of users denied access to system (including percentages per category, per total number of users, per total number of users bidding, per total number of users participating in transactions, and other such percentages).
- the present embodiments in some implementations can define multiple summary ratings for a single user. These multiple ratings can be defined according to the transactions being entered into, the categories for which the transaction is related, whether a user is a buyer or seller, and other similar criteria. For example, a single user can have, in some embodiments, a summary rating as a seller, a summary rating as a buyer, a summary rating for specific categories (e.g., a user can have an Auction summary rating), and other summary ratings.
- FIG. 9 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a procedure 910 for informing users about user ratings and the issuing of notifications about users' summary ratings.
- the system receives a new user registration. For example, a new user accesses an Internet site and registers with the system so that the user can submit bits on products being auctioned, or a new user registers in order to be able to sell products through the system.
- a first message is generated informing the new user about risks in participating in transactions (e.g., transactions over the Internet).
- the generated message further includes information about user ratings, how the ratings are generated and the importance of reviewing other users' ratings prior to completing a transaction with other users.
- the first message can be a “Welcome” message welcoming the new user to the system that includes the information about risks and ratings.
- the generated first message is forwarded to the new user.
- the first message can be forwarded through substantially any relevant method, such as by e-mail, displayed on an Internet site during and/or following user registration, by regular mail (e.g., U.S. Postal Service), and other such communication methods.
- regular mail e.g., U.S. Postal Service
- a combinations of methods are used to communicate the first message (e.g., by e-mail and regular mail).
- step 910 continue to step 922 where the process determines if a transaction is about to be completed. For example, the process determines that a winning bidder has been established. In another example, the process can identify that an agreed price has been established. In yet other embodiments, the process can be signaled when a user selects to purchase a product (e.g., the user selects a purchase option). If a transaction is about to be completed, step 924 is entered where the process determines if an additional notification about user ratings should be forwarded to one or more of the users. For example, the process can determine if one or more of the users of the subject transaction are unrated or have a summary rating that is negative. In some implementations the process utilizes the process 210 of FIG. 2 .
- step 926 is entered where a message identifying risk and recommending the user access summary ratings is generated.
- the message is forwarded to one or more of the users entering into the transaction.
- the message can be a Notice or Warning box that is displayed in the Internet site on the user's display (e.g., notification box 620 of FIG. 6 ).
- the notification box can be displayed in substantially any relevant position in the display.
- Some embodiments of the process 910 further include step 932 where a rating reminder or follow-up message is forwarded after a transaction has taken place to one or more of the users that took part in a transaction.
- the reminder message can request the user to rate the one or more users with whom they entered into the transaction.
- an e-mail can be forwarded to a first user that bought a product from a second user.
- the e-mail message can request the first user to rate the second user (e.g., was the purchased product(s) received, was the product damaged, and other such criteria).
- an e-mail can be forwarded to the second user requesting the second user rate the first user (did the first user receive payment, was the payment accurate, and other such criteria).
- reminder messages can be generated at substantially any period of time following the transaction.
- the reminder message to a selling user can be sent seven (7) days after the transaction, by which time the seller should be aware whether payment was received.
- the reminder message to a buying user can be sent thirty (30) days after the transaction, by which time the buying user should have received the purchased product and the condition of the product.
- the notification to users can, in some embodiments, be different for different users.
- a seller notification can be displayed on an Internet site being viewed by the selling user that has information relevant to a buying user.
- a buyer notification can be displayed on an Internet site being viewed by the buying user that has information relevant to a seller user.
- the notifications can be notification boxes displayed, and the buying user notification can be positioned in a buyer Internet site in a first position, and the selling user notification can be positioned in a seller Internet site in a second position.
- different notifications can be forwarded depending on the types (Good, Bad, Neutral) of users, the kinds of transactions, the categories of the transactions and other factors.
- Some embodiments additionally provide an exemption and/or an override to the generation and communication of notifications.
- some selling users can be exempted from receiving notifications about reviewing a buying user's summary rating.
- Such selling users can include corporations, stores and other users that are aware of the risks involved in entering transactions.
- the process of forwarding notifications to buying users can be eliminated for certain selling users.
- the notification can be eliminated for products that are below a certain value and/or have a lower risk of fraud. Other such users can be exempted from the notification.
- the present embodiments provide users with summary rating information as well as notifying users to access other user's rating information in an attempt to educate users and to avoid fraudulent transactions. Further, the notification and/or warning is provide to users early in the transaction process, for example, when user first accesses information about a product, in results from a searches, and/or at other stages in the transaction process. In some implementations, once it is determined that the notification should be displayed, the notification is displayed at each stage of the transaction.
- the notifications allow users to check rating information and/or transaction history information to better weigh the risks involved in entering into transactions. Additionally, the notifications can be initiated based on a variety of factors and these factors can vary according to users, kinds of transactions, categories of transactions, and other criteria. Still further, the present embodiments provide for the collecting and tracking of metrics and/or statistics. These metrics allow the embodiments to adjust thresholds and vary evaluations in an attempt to ensure the notifications are accurate and forwarded or displayed with an optimal degree of frequency so that the notifications have meaning.
- the notifications provided by the present embodiment provide users with increased confidence regarding transactions, and thus will increase the number of transactions that are facilitated through the embodiments.
