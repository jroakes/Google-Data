m(n) quick oblique ascension and then flattening in high-order tap place of sef-adapting filter 10.Similarly, people can infer that most information comes down to be included in several leading the recurrence of RLSL algorithm, and the number of times of minimizing coefficient update can be realized acceptable performance of filter.
Thereby a kind of good mechanism that exchanges performance with computation requirement for will will be predicted square F at forward direction and backward error
m(n) and B
m(n) number of times of recurrence of upward carrying out or renewal reduces to the predefine part of described filter length.Then, error prediction square remains unchanged in remaining filter tap upgrades.Update times reduces the minimal loss that may cause this sef-adapting filter performance, but the increase of real-time performance can prove that the minimal loss of this performance of filter is reasonable.
Fig. 8 illustrates as forward direction and backward error prediction square F
m(n) and B
mThe performance loss of 360 tap filters when (n) after only 100 renewals of wave filter, just remaining unchanged.This width of cloth figure has showed that error prediction that 360 tap filters carry out update all and only calculate preceding 100 taps of described 360 tap filters at wave filter more under the news is that the wave filter return loss of unit strengthens (ERLE) with dB.
In order to produce the figure of Fig. 9, will be for forward direction and backward error prediction square F
m(n) and B
m(n) renewal of go up carrying out this process of being limited in the predefine part of described filter length is upgraded the difference restriction of quantity and is repeated at being applied to error prediction, and the ERLE curve plotting of sef-adapting filter 10 relatively.The curve display of Fig. 9 when error prediction upgrades quantity and reduces, how performance of filter reduces.In addition, Fig. 9 shows that the performance of wave filter when upgrading error prediction square more than the individual filter tap of about 180 (half) has minimum growth.
Refer now to Figure 10, that show among Figure 10 is time demand and forward direction and the backward error forecast updating F that records
m(n) and B
mThe comparative pattern of number of times (n).The figure of Figure 10 here helps out for the suitable balance between decision computation requirement and the peak filter performance.This width of cloth figure has drawn the contrast of the number of times of the forward direction of renewal of the time demand that records of RLSL wave filter 10 and 360 tap length wave filters and backward error prediction square.These values have reflected the measurement of carrying out in hardware realization in real time.As expectation, when update times reduces, linear thereupon minimizing of time.
In the final realization of optimum RLSL algorithm, recursion cycle is divided into two parts.First is to the update all shown in the equation 30 by equation 22.These renewals are normally carried out till the predefine tap number of wave filter.The definite quantity of required tap will be analyzed to determine certainly according to the compromise between real-time and the performance of filter.The second portion of optimum RLSL algorithm is provided to equation 37 by equation 31.In these serial recurrence are upgraded, forward direction and backward error prediction square F
