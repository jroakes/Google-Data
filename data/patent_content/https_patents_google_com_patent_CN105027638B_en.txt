D2D (i) can be different from the PCMAX (i) for UE1 on UL carrier wave.
With reference to Fig. 1, the UL carrier resource on cell 101j is assigned to UE1 and transmits for D2D, and mode is, if this
A little resources (or part of it) will also be used by UE3 and be used for cellular transmission, then the degree of the cellular transmission of D2D transmission interference UE3
(measuring at Nej) is limited.
Assuming that such as UE3 is being used for the identical PUSCH RB of D2D communication for cellular communication using UE1.When NEj is dispatched
D2D resource is by UE1 in use, NEj determines the interference of what rank undergone in NEj for license.The interference rank being allowed to can be with
Based on such as echo signal and interference and noise ratio (SINR) and the reception power of the cellular communication from UE3 at Nej
Measurement determine.The interference rank that NEj will be allowed is sent to UE1 by signal.Signal may not necessarily be allowed dry
The actual value of rank is disturbed, and can be the expression of the value, the inlet point of such as look-up table (for example, -100dBm is mapped to 0, -
100dBm is mapped to 1 etc.).Using the interference rank of permission, UE1 determines PD2D, Max (i), may consider NEj and UE1 it
