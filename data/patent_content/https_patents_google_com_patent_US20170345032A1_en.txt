Definitions
- Content sharing services serve content, such as pictures, videos, text, or combinations thereof, to users who access the content sharing service.
- the content may be sourced from a publisher, automatically generated, or from upload by one of the users.
- the content sharing service may store the content, or link to other services, and subsequently retrieve the content prior to serving the content to the users.
- the content sharing service may augment the serving of the content with shared content.
- the shared content may be served before, during and after the presentation of the content.
- the shared content may be associated with meta information, and when the shared content is clicked-through by a user, the user may be redirected to additional content associated with the shared content.
- the shared content may provide information associated with a product or service related to the content.
- the shared content may be presented along with a functional input to bypass the serving of the shared content.
- the content sharing service ensures that a user is not served shared content that the user is not interested in consuming.
- a user may be served shared content from the content sharing service based on prior activities. For example, if a content publisher sources a group of videos, and the user has accessed one or more of the publishers videos, the user may be served shared content sourced from the publisher based on the users previous activities.
- a user may be served shared content based on the users similarity to another user. For example, if a users viewing preference matches or is similar to another users viewing, preference, the user may be served shared content based on the other user's content accessed.
- the content sharing service may serve shared content based on a keyword search that a user employs to find and retrieve content. Additionally, the content viewed by the user may be associated with a specific interest or category. The content sharing service may serve shared content based on the specific interest or category that the user has shown interest in.
- the content sharing service may monetize the serving of shared content to users. Accordingly, a third-party associated with the subject matter of the shared content may direct the content sharing service to serve users the shared content.
- the content sharing service may monetize the serving of shared content by promising a specific number of views or accesses by the users. In doing so, the content sharing service may assess a charge per shared content in which the user does not access the bypass function (“views”), or in which a user clicks-through the shared content. Thus, the third-party may ensure that it is paying primarily for views in which the user fully consumed (i.e. did not enable the bypass function) the third-party's shared content.
- the third-party may request that shared content (or a group of shared content items) be served along with a budget restraint.
- the budget restraint may represent a limit that the third-party is willing to spend for a specific time period for the serving of shared content.
- the content sharing service may ensure that for the specific time period, the third-party's shared content will not be served to more users than the third-party's requested budget restraint allows for.
- a system and method for automatic audience creation by scoring users of a content sharing service includes a user analysis module to monitor data associated with the users of the content sharing service; and a channel analysis module to monitor data associated with a first channel; a scoring module to score, based on the monitored data associated with users and the first channel, each user based on a ratio of views versus accesses for shared content sourced from the first channel; and an audience assignment module to create an audience for the first channel of users with scores above a predetermined threshold.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example computer.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example of a system for automatic audience creation by scoring users.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a method for automatic audience creation by scoring users.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a method for optimizing a created audience.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a method for optimizing a created audience based on a metric.
- a content sharing service may be configured to employ techniques for improving the click-through rate of shared content served along with other content.
- the content sharing service may monetize the serving of shared content and receive compensation commensurate with the amount of times the shared content is clicked through.
- the shared content may be served along with a bypass function that allows a user to bypass the viewing of the shared content after a predetermined time.
- the compensation associated with the shared content may be set commensurate with the number of times the user does not access the bypass function, and thus consumes all of, or a significant portion of, the shared content.
- a view may be classified as a situation in which a user consumes all, or an amount over a predefined threshold, of the shared content. Accordingly, the content sharing service may monetize content or shared content commensurate with the view numbers associated with the content or shared content.
- Third parties that are affiliated with, or source shared content may affix a budgetary restraint along with the serving of shared content (or a group of shared content items). For example, a third-party may request that the third-party's shared content is served under a budget of X dollars for every hour. If each view is charged at a rate of X/1,000 dollars, the content sharing service may serve the shared content 1,000 times during every Y hour.
- the content sharing service may only record instances in which the user views the shared content when applying a charge to the third-party. Thus, there is no guarantee that the content sharing service reaches the 1,000 views mandated by the third-party's budget.
- the content sharing service is configured to randomly serve the shared content to the content sharing service's user base as a whole, there may be instances where not enough users view the shared content during the time period affixed to the third-party's budgetary restraint.
- the methods and systems discussed herein employ data collection associated with each user's interaction with the content sharing service over a time period.
- Each user is assigned a score based on the user's likelihood of viewing shared content.
- the scoring may be determined through prior knowledge and learning models based on each user's interaction with the content sharing service.
- the users are assigned to a third-party's shared content audience.
- the content sharing service may exclusively serve the shared content to users in the third-party's audience.
- the above-described determination may be improved by analyzing a channel associated with the third-party.
- a channel is a group of content items or shared contents items associated with the third-party.
- the subset of users may further be refined to users that are subscribed to the third-party's channel.
- the audience creation may be improved by dynamic adjustments performed iteratively.
- the content sharing service may be configured to analyze the success of the created audience at satisfying the third-party's budget.
- An initial threshold may be used to create an initial audience. The initial threshold may mandate that users with a certain score constitute the audience associated with the third-party's shared content.
- the content sharing service may determine that the initially created audience does not produce enough views. Accordingly, the threshold for a score required to be an audience member is increased, thereby allowing less users to be included in the audience. As these remaining users have the highest likelihood of producing a view, the content sharing service increases the likelihood that the third party's shared content will be viewed.
- the content sharing service may lower the threshold score used. Accordingly, the number of users who constitute the third party's audience is increased. Thus, every time shared content is served to an audience member, the likelihood of the audience member viewing the shared content is reduced.
- Another aspect to the systems and methods disclosed herein is that users who exhibit scores over a threshold for multiple third-party shared content sources are deliberately assigned to specific third-party audiences. For example, if the user exhibits scores to warrant membership to ten third-party audiences, and the content sharing service mandates that each user only be assigned to six third-party audiences, the systems and methods disclosed herein may determine the six specific third party audiences that the user is assigned to. The deliberate assignation is done to ensure that the content sharing service serves shared content to users in a way to maximize revenue.
- the onus of creating an audience is removed from a third-party.
- the third-party may realize the serving of shared content with greater rates of click-through and more views.
- the third-party's shared content is less likely to be served to a user who is not interested in the shared content.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.

- Various aspects of the content sharing service 270 are monitored, such as each user's activity on the content sharing service 270 (operation 311 ), activity on each channel (operation 312 ), for example. Operations 311 and 312 may be performed in parallel.
- operation 311 the user's viewing of content or shared content versus the user's accessing of content or shared content is recorded.
- activity associated with the channel such as content or shared content that is viewed versus content or shared content that is accessed is recorded.
- the data recorded in operations 311 and 312 are correlated. For each user, a record of the respective user is made per channel of the content or shared content the respective user viewed and accessed.
- a score for each user per channel is computed.
- the score corresponds to the ratio of the user's viewing of content or shared content versus accessing content or shared content. A higher ratio corresponds to a higher score.
- an audience is created for a channel. If the operator of the channel, or the operator of content sharing service 270 designate that a channel be assigned an audience according to method 300 , the channel is assigned to a predefined number of users with the highest computed score for the channel. The predefined number may be set based on a number deemed appropriate for an initial audience creation. As explained in operation 350 below, the number of users assigned to a channel's audience may be updated to be greater or lesser based on a dynamic operation.
- the audience created in operation 340 is optimized.

- a created audience for a channel is analyzed.
- the predetermined time interval may be determined by the operator of the content sharing service 270 or by a third-party associated with the channel being analyzed.
- Method 400 is performed iteratively at every predetermined interval after an initial audience for a channel is created.
- a ratio of the views versus access of content or shared content sourced for the channel is determined. After this determination is made, the membership of the created audience for the channel may be adjusted accordingly based on operations 421 - 423 .
- the created audience size is lessened.
- the created audience size may be lessened by increasing a score required to be a member of the created audience.
- a ratio below the threshold indicates that users are accessing shared content, but not viewing the shared content.
- the budget associated with the channel's shared content is not used.
- the budget associated with the channel may be used fully.
- the created audience size is made larger.
- the created audience size may be made larger by lowering the score required to be an audience member of the channel.
- the justification for performing operation 423 is that the ratio indicates that the users are viewing the shared content at a rate that may exceed the allocated budget for a time period.
- the budget for the time period may be used in its entirety well before the time period elapses. In this way, the third-party associated with the shared content does not realize an evenly spread distribution of the third party's shared content over the time period.
- Method 400 ensures that the created audience per channel is dynamically optimized so that the created audience's size matches a third-party's budgetary restraint for shared content distribution.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a method 500 for optimizing an audience based on a metric.
- the method 500 may be implemented on the system 200 depicted in FIG. 2 .
- the method 500 may be performed during operation 350 of method 300 .
- the user is assigned to the predetermined number of audiences based on the determined predicted revenues of operation 520 .
- the user would be assigned to the ten audiences with the highest RPMu values.

The system includes a user analysis module to monitor data associated with the users of the content sharing service; and a channel analysis module to monitor data associated with a first channel; a scoring module to score, based on the monitored data associated with users and the first channel, each user based on a ratio of views versus accesses for shared content sourced from the first channel; and an audience assignment module to create an audience for the first channel of users with scores above a predetermined threshold.
Description
- Content sharing services serve content, such as pictures, videos, text, or combinations thereof, to users who access the content sharing service. The content may be sourced from a publisher, automatically generated, or from upload by one of the users. The content sharing service may store the content, or link to other services, and subsequently retrieve the content prior to serving the content to the users.
- The content sharing service may augment the serving of the content with shared content. The shared content may be served before, during and after the presentation of the content. The shared content may be associated with meta information, and when the shared content is clicked-through by a user, the user may be redirected to additional content associated with the shared content. The shared content may provide information associated with a product or service related to the content.
- In certain implementations, the shared content may be presented along with a functional input to bypass the serving of the shared content. By providing the functional input to bypass the serving of the shared content, the content sharing service ensures that a user is not served shared content that the user is not interested in consuming.
- A user may be served shared content from the content sharing service based on prior activities. For example, if a content publisher sources a group of videos, and the user has accessed one or more of the publishers videos, the user may be served shared content sourced from the publisher based on the users previous activities.
- A user may be served shared content based on the users similarity to another user. For example, if a users viewing preference matches or is similar to another users viewing, preference, the user may be served shared content based on the other user's content accessed.
- Other techniques employ keyword and interest metrics. The content sharing service may serve shared content based on a keyword search that a user employs to find and retrieve content. Additionally, the content viewed by the user may be associated with a specific interest or category. The content sharing service may serve shared content based on the specific interest or category that the user has shown interest in.
- The content sharing service may monetize the serving of shared content to users. Accordingly, a third-party associated with the subject matter of the shared content may direct the content sharing service to serve users the shared content.
- The content sharing service may monetize the serving of shared content by promising a specific number of views or accesses by the users. In doing so, the content sharing service may assess a charge per shared content in which the user does not access the bypass function (“views”), or in which a user clicks-through the shared content. Thus, the third-party may ensure that it is paying primarily for views in which the user fully consumed (i.e. did not enable the bypass function) the third-party's shared content.
- Additionally, the third-party may request that shared content (or a group of shared content items) be served along with a budget restraint. The budget restraint may represent a limit that the third-party is willing to spend for a specific time period for the serving of shared content. Thus, the content sharing service may ensure that for the specific time period, the third-party's shared content will not be served to more users than the third-party's requested budget restraint allows for.
- A system and method for automatic audience creation by scoring users of a content sharing service is provided. The system includes a user analysis module to monitor data associated with the users of the content sharing service; and a channel analysis module to monitor data associated with a first channel; a scoring module to score, based on the monitored data associated with users and the first channel, each user based on a ratio of views versus accesses for shared content sourced from the first channel; and an audience assignment module to create an audience for the first channel of users with scores above a predetermined threshold.
- The detailed description refers to the following drawings, in which like numerals refer to like items, and in which:
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example computer. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an example of a system for automatic audience creation by scoring users. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a method for automatic audience creation by scoring users. -
FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a method for optimizing a created audience. -
FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a method for optimizing a created audience based on a metric. - A content sharing service may be configured to employ techniques for improving the click-through rate of shared content served along with other content. The content sharing service may monetize the serving of shared content and receive compensation commensurate with the amount of times the shared content is clicked through. The shared content may be served along with a bypass function that allows a user to bypass the viewing of the shared content after a predetermined time. The compensation associated with the shared content may be set commensurate with the number of times the user does not access the bypass function, and thus consumes all of, or a significant portion of, the shared content. A view may be classified as a situation in which a user consumes all, or an amount over a predefined threshold, of the shared content. Accordingly, the content sharing service may monetize content or shared content commensurate with the view numbers associated with the content or shared content.
- Third parties that are affiliated with, or source shared content may affix a budgetary restraint along with the serving of shared content (or a group of shared content items). For example, a third-party may request that the third-party's shared content is served under a budget of X dollars for every hour. If each view is charged at a rate of X/1,000 dollars, the content sharing service may serve the shared content 1,000 times during every Y hour.
- In the above example, the content sharing service may only record instances in which the user views the shared content when applying a charge to the third-party. Thus, there is no guarantee that the content sharing service reaches the 1,000 views mandated by the third-party's budget.
- If the content sharing service is configured to randomly serve the shared content to the content sharing service's user base as a whole, there may be instances where not enough users view the shared content during the time period affixed to the third-party's budgetary restraint.
- Disclosed herein are methods and system for automatic audience creation by scoring users. The methods and systems discussed herein employ data collection associated with each user's interaction with the content sharing service over a time period.
- Each user is assigned a score based on the user's likelihood of viewing shared content. The scoring may be determined through prior knowledge and learning models based on each user's interaction with the content sharing service.
- After each user is given a score based on the users likelihood of viewing shared content, the users are assigned to a third-party's shared content audience. In cases when the content sharing service serves the third-party's shared content, the content sharing service may exclusively serve the shared content to users in the third-party's audience.
- The above-described determination may be improved by analyzing a channel associated with the third-party. A channel is a group of content items or shared contents items associated with the third-party. Thus, the subset of users may further be refined to users that are subscribed to the third-party's channel.
- The audience creation may be improved by dynamic adjustments performed iteratively. After a predetermined time has elapsed, the content sharing service may be configured to analyze the success of the created audience at satisfying the third-party's budget. An initial threshold may be used to create an initial audience. The initial threshold may mandate that users with a certain score constitute the audience associated with the third-party's shared content.
- After performing an analysis after the predetermined time elapses, the content sharing service may determine that the initially created audience does not produce enough views. Accordingly, the threshold for a score required to be an audience member is increased, thereby allowing less users to be included in the audience. As these remaining users have the highest likelihood of producing a view, the content sharing service increases the likelihood that the third party's shared content will be viewed.
- Conversely, if the analysis indicates that number of views satisfies the third-party's budget at a time less than the time interval, the content sharing service may lower the threshold score used. Accordingly, the number of users who constitute the third party's audience is increased. Thus, every time shared content is served to an audience member, the likelihood of the audience member viewing the shared content is reduced.
- Another aspect to the systems and methods disclosed herein is that users who exhibit scores over a threshold for multiple third-party shared content sources are deliberately assigned to specific third-party audiences. For example, if the user exhibits scores to warrant membership to ten third-party audiences, and the content sharing service mandates that each user only be assigned to six third-party audiences, the systems and methods disclosed herein may determine the six specific third party audiences that the user is assigned to. The deliberate assignation is done to ensure that the content sharing service serves shared content to users in a way to maximize revenue.
- By providing an automatic creation of an audience, the onus of creating an audience is removed from a third-party. Further, by employing the techniques herein, the third-party may realize the serving of shared content with greater rates of click-through and more views. Thus, the third-party's shared content is less likely to be served to a user who is not interested in the shared content.
- In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating anexample computer 100. Thecomputer 100 includes at least oneprocessor 102 coupled to achipset 104. Thechipset 104 includes amemory controller hub 120 and an input/output (I/O)controller hub 122. Amemory 106 and agraphics adapter 112 are coupled to thememory controller hub 120, and adisplay 118 is coupled to thegraphics adapter 112. Astorage device 108,keyboard 110, pointingdevice 114, andnetwork adapter 116 are coupled to the I/O controller hub 122. Other embodiments of thecomputer 100 may have different architectures. - The
storage device 108 is a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium such as a hard drive, compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), DVD, or a solid-state memory device. The memory 105 holds instructions and data used by theprocessor 102. Thepointing device 114 is a mouse, track ball, or other type of pointing device, and is used in combination with thekeyboard 110 to input data into thecomputer 100. Thepointing device 114 may also be a gaming system controller, or any type of device used to control the gaming system. For example, thepointing device 114 may be connected to a video or image capturing device that employs biometric scanning to detect a specific user. The specific user may employ motion or gestures to command thepoint device 114 to control various aspects of thecomputer 100. - The
graphics adapter 112 displays images and other information on thedisplay 118. Thenetwork adapter 116 couples thecomputer system 100 to one or more computer networks. - The
computer 100 is adapted to execute computer program modules for providing, functionality described herein. As used herein, the term “module” refers to computer program logic used to provide the specified functionality. Thus, a module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software. In one embodiment, program modules are stored on thestorage device 108, loaded into thememory 108, and executed by theprocessor 102. - The types of computers used by the entities and processes disclosed herein can vary depending upon the embodiment and the processing power required by the entity. The
computer 100 may be a mobile device, tablet, smartphone or any sort of computing element with the above-listed elements. For example, a data storage device, such as a hard disk, solid state memory or storage device, might be stored in a distributed database system comprising multiple blade servers working together to provide the functionality described herein. The computers can lack some of the components described above, such askeyboards 110,graphics adapters 112, and displays 118. - The
computer 100 may act as a server (not shown) for the content sharing service disclosed herein. Thecomputer 100 may be clustered withother computer 100 devices to create the server. Thevarious computer 100 devices that constitute the server may communicate with each other over anetwork 250. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an example of system for automatic audience creation by scoring users. Thesystem 200 includes ananalysis module 210, ascoring module 220, anaudience assignment module 230, and anaudience optimization module 240. As illustrated inFIG. 2 , thesystem 200 communicates vianetwork 250 to aserver 260. Theserver 260 hosts acontent sharing service 270. Theserver 260 andsystem 200 may be implemented on a device, such ascomputer 100. - The
content sharing service 270 serves content to devices that access thecontent sharing service 270 over thenetwork 250, such asuser device 280. - Some of the content or shared content that the
content sharing service 270 serves may be sourced from a third-party 290. Thethird party 290 sources content or shared content, such as sharedcontent A 291 and sharedcontent B 292. Content and shared content sourced from third-party 290 may be presented as a channel of the third-party 290. - The
analysis module 210 includes auser analysis module 211 and achannel analysis module 212. Theuser analysis module 211 monitors a subset of users associated with thecontent sharing service 270. Thus, each access to thecontent sharing service 270 may be monitored in several ways, such as the content accessed by each user, the shared content viewed by each user, and the shared content bypassed by each user, for example. - The
channel analysis module 212 monitors accesses to various channels demarcated on thecontent sharing service 270. A channel may be associated with a specific third-party. Accordingly, thechannel analysis module 212 may monitor accesses to the content or, shared content associated with the specific third-party that constitutes a channel. - The
user analysis module 211 and thechannel analysis module 212 may interact with a user and channelpersistent store 205 to retrieve information about the various users and channels registered on thecontent sharing source 270. - The
analysis module 210 may correlate the monitored data of each user for specific channels. Thus, theanalysis module 210 may maintain data indicating each user's interaction with content or shared content associated with a specific channel. For example, if a user ‘A’ is served content or shared content associated with a specific third-party, theanalysis module 210 may maintain a recordation for user ‘A’ associated with the access to third-party's content or shared content. Further,analysis module 210 may maintain a recordation of instances in which the user viewed or bypassed the shared content for a particular channel. - The
scoring module 220 assigns a score to each user based on the data sourced from theanalysis module 210. The score serves to provide a metric that allows thecontent sharing service 270 to predicatively analyze a probability that the user views the shared content. The score may be based on the ratio of the number of user views versus the number of user accesses for content or shared content sourced from the third-party's channel. - The
scoring module 220 may assign a score to each user per channel. The scores may be stored in a scoringpersistent store 206. The score essentially serves as an indication of a user's likelihood to view content or shared content sourced from a third-party. - The
audience assignment module 230 creates an audience for each channel.System 200 may be configured with a predetermined initial audience number. The predetermined initial audience number may be set through various ways, such as by an algorithm employed bysystem 200, or a manually chosen number, for example. - For example, if the predetermined initial audience number is 100, the shared content associated with a channel is only served to the 100 users with the highest score for the channel. Thus, the 100 users with the highest likelihood of viewing shared content from a specific channel ere exclusively served, shared content associated with the channel. A recordation of the created audience for each channel may be stored in the audience
persistent store 207. - The
audience optimization module 240 optimizes the assigned audiences for each channel. Theaudience optimization module 240 includes a dynamicaudience optimization module 241 and anallocation optimization module 242. - The dynamic
audience optimization module 241 performs an operation to optimize the created audiences at a predetermined time interval. At each predetermined time interval, a determination may be made as to whether the created audience per each channel is optimally set. For example, if a ratio between user views versus user accesses of content or shared content associated with the channel is below a predetermined threshold, a determination may be made that the created audience may be reduced in size. - The predetermined threshold employed by the dynamic
audience optimization module 241 may be related to the budgetary restraint associated with the third-party. Thus, the ratio calculate above may help predict whether the created audience is effective in using the third-party's budget for a predetermined time period. - The dynamic
audience optimization module 241 may determine the ratio between user views versus user accesses of content or shared content associated with the channel over the predetermined threshold. Accordingly, the created audience may be increased in size (i.e. a lesser score may be required for a user to be added to an audience). In this way, the audience may be greater in size, while ensuring that the shared content sufficiently gets viewed during a specific time period. - Additionally, if there is no change in the above-noted ratio, the dynamic
audience optimization module 241 may maintain the audience size. - The
allocation optimization module 242 determines resolves conflicts in cases where a specific user is assigned to audiences of various channels over a predefined amount that the implementer of thecontent sharing service 270 has set. For example, if the specific user scores well enough to be assigned to twenty different channels, and thesystem 200 is configured to allow each user to be assigned only to ten channels, theallocation optimization module 242 determines which ten channels the user is assigned to. - An example metric for assigning the user to various audiences is to employ a monetization basis. This metric may be based on predicatively observing which assignment generates the highest revenue.
- For example, the following expression may be used to calculate a ranking for a specific user for a specific channel. The expression is defined as:
-
RPMu=1000*CPC*VTR*e; - wherein RPMu is defined as revenue per thousand users,
- CPC is defined as the cost-per-click (i.e. the money generated per clicking shared content from the specific channel by the specific user),
- VTR is defined as the view-through-rate (i.e. the score for the specific user for the specific channel), and
- e=(1000*number of views by all users of the specific channel)/(number of users associated with the specific channel).
- After calculating the RPMu for each channel that the specific user is associated with, the channels with the highest RPMu may constitute the set of audiences in which the specific user belongs to.

FIG. 3 illustrates an example of amethod 300 for automatic audience creation by scoring users. Themethod 300 may be implemented on thesystem 200 depicted inFIG. 2 . - In
operation 310, acontent sharing service 270 is monitored. Various aspects of thecontent sharing service 270 are monitored, such as each user's activity on the content sharing service 270 (operation 311), activity on each channel (operation 312), for example.Operations - Specifically, in
operation 311, the user's viewing of content or shared content versus the user's accessing of content or shared content is recorded. Inoperation 312, activity associated with the channel, such as content or shared content that is viewed versus content or shared content that is accessed is recorded. - In
operation 320, the data recorded inoperations - In
operation 330, a score for each user per channel is computed. The score corresponds to the ratio of the user's viewing of content or shared content versus accessing content or shared content. A higher ratio corresponds to a higher score. - In
operation 340, based on the computed scores ofoperation 330, an audience is created for a channel. If the operator of the channel, or the operator ofcontent sharing service 270 designate that a channel be assigned an audience according tomethod 300, the channel is assigned to a predefined number of users with the highest computed score for the channel. The predefined number may be set based on a number deemed appropriate for an initial audience creation. As explained inoperation 350 below, the number of users assigned to a channel's audience may be updated to be greater or lesser based on a dynamic operation. - In
operation 350, the audience created inoperation 340 is optimized. The optimization may be performed via a plurality of techniques, several of which that are further elaborated below in regards tomethod 400 andmethod 500. -
FIG. 4 illustrates an example of amethod 400 for optimizing a created audience. Themethod 400 may be implemented on thesystem 200 depicted inFIG. 2 . Themethod 400 may be performed duringoperation 350 ofmethod 300. - In
operation 410, at a predetermined time interval, a created audience for a channel is analyzed. The predetermined time interval may be determined by the operator of thecontent sharing service 270 or by a third-party associated with the channel being analyzed.Method 400 is performed iteratively at every predetermined interval after an initial audience for a channel is created. - In
operation 420, a ratio of the views versus access of content or shared content sourced for the channel is determined. After this determination is made, the membership of the created audience for the channel may be adjusted accordingly based on operations 421-423. - In operation 421, if the ratio is below a predetermined threshold (an example of the establishment of the predetermined threshold is described above in regards to element 241), the created audience size is lessened. The created audience size may be lessened by increasing a score required to be a member of the created audience.
- Essentially, a ratio below the threshold indicates that users are accessing shared content, but not viewing the shared content. Thus, the budget associated with the channel's shared content is not used. By having a smaller audience who are more likely to view the content or shared content associated with the channel, the budget associated with the channel may be used fully.
- In operation 422, if the ratio is within an acceptable range, the created audience size is maintained.
- In operation 423, if the ratio is above the predetermined threshold, the created audience size is made larger. Converse to operation 421, the created audience size may be made larger by lowering the score required to be an audience member of the channel.
- The justification for performing operation 423 is that the ratio indicates that the users are viewing the shared content at a rate that may exceed the allocated budget for a time period. For example, the budget for the time period may be used in its entirety well before the time period elapses. In this way, the third-party associated with the shared content does not realize an evenly spread distribution of the third party's shared content over the time period.
- After operations 421-423, the method may iteratively return to
operation 410 at the predetermined time interval.Method 400 ensures that the created audience per channel is dynamically optimized so that the created audience's size matches a third-party's budgetary restraint for shared content distribution. -
FIG. 5 illustrates an example of amethod 500 for optimizing an audience based on a metric. Themethod 500 may be implemented on thesystem 200 depicted inFIG. 2 . Themethod 500 may be performed duringoperation 350 ofmethod 300. - In
operation 510, a determination is made per user if the user is assigned to more than a predetermined number of audiences. For example, a user may have a high enough score to be assigned to twenty audiences. The implementation ofcontent sharing service 270 may mandate that each user be assigned to only ten audiences or less. In this example, themethod 500 would proceed tooperation 520. - In
operation 520, a determination is made to predict the revenue the user would generate per each audience the user is assigned to. This determination may employ the formula to computer the RPMu per channel described above in regards toelement 242 ofsystem 200. - In
operation 530, the user is assigned to the predetermined number of audiences based on the determined predicted revenues ofoperation 520. In the example noted above, the user would be assigned to the ten audiences with the highest RPMu values. - According to
method 500, an implementation ofsystem 200 may ensure that users of thecontent sharing service 270 are assigned to a predetermined number of audiences in a way to maximize revenue. - Certain of the devices shown in
