Definitions
- the disclosed implementations relate generally to systems, methods and devices configured to collect information about media content items, such as television listings and streaming (e.g., audio and/or video) programs, e.g., so as to improve, for a user, access to and control over devices (e.g., a set top box or a connected TV) for playing such media content items.
- media content items such as television listings and streaming (e.g., audio and/or video) programs, e.g., so as to improve, for a user, access to and control over devices (e.g., a set top box or a connected TV) for playing such media content items.
- Interactive television technologies generally enable adding Internet-based functionality, content and/or services as an overlay to the television signals provided by cable and satellite television providers.
- one of the aims of interactive television technologies is to deliver Internet-accessible functionality, content and/or services to an individual consumer that are matched to a particular television program the consumer is currently watching.
- interactive television technologies often need to determine what a consumer is watching in order to deliver matched functionality, content and/or services.
- a second device such as a supplemental set-top box or a connected TV
- the primary set-top box provided by a cable, satellite or other network television provider.
- the supplemental set-top box sends a query to the primary set-top box requesting information about the currently playing television program selected by the consumer (e.g. the title, names of actors or characters, electronic program guide information, etc.).
- the supplemental set-top box In order to send such a query or otherwise communicate with the primary set-top box, the supplemental set-top box usually includes one or more provider-specific application program interfaces (APIs) that enable the supplemental set-top box to be paired with a wide variety of primary set-top boxes from various cable and satellite television providers.
- APIs application program interfaces
- a similar situation also applies to other possible interactions between a supplemental set-top box and a primary set-top box, such as checking whether the primary set-top box is on or off or adjusting the default configuration of the primary set-top box.
- the development of each API requires the input and cooperation of a respective cable or satellite television provider that provides a primary set-top box to consumers. Developing the APIs with various providers tends to be inefficient, and hinders scaling such technologies across a wide variety of provider-specific platforms.
- a primary set-top box In addition to TV content, other types of media content and services can be provided through a primary set-top box.
- the content or other services can be provided via a direct connection to the set-top box, as built-in features of the set-top box, or via a network connection.
- a digital video recorder (DVR) built into a set-top box can be used to record TV content or playback recorded TV content;
- the set-top box can be used to access video-on-demand (VOD), DVD, or Blu-ray content available from the cable or satellite provider, a DVD player, or a Blu-ray player, respectively, associated with the set-top box; or the set-top box can be used to connect a local security system to security monitoring services.
- VOD video-on-demand
- the various implementations described herein include systems, methods and/or devices that are enabled to determine what a particular consumer is watching on television in order to deliver matched functionality, content and/or services, as a part of an interactive television suite of technologies.
- the process of determining what a particular consumer is watching is enabled so that communication between the primary set-top box and a supplemental set-top box and/or television-integrated device is reduced, thereby avoiding the need for one or more provider specific APIs.
- one aspect of the disclosure is a method of identifying a media program by capturing display data from the media program, and extracting text from the display data in response to determining that the display data includes the text overlay, wherein the extracted text is associated with the media program.
- a media program is identified by (1) generating one or more content fingerprints from a portion (e.g., audio or video) of the media content program, and (2) comparing the one or more content fingerprints with a set of fingerprints corresponding to (e.g., extracted from) a known media program.
- a supplemental set-top box (or television integrated device) is configured to operate a primary set-top box, without a provider-specific API, in order to determine the channel line-up available to a particular subscriber through the primary set-top box.
- similar methods and features can be used to identify channel lineups available to viewers of non-subscription media content, such as over the air broadcasts that are received by a TV receiver, such as a TV receiver included, without limitation, in a computer, a media player, such as a DVD or Blu-ray player, or a digital video recorder (DVR).
- a TV receiver such as a TV receiver included, without limitation, in a computer, a media player, such as a DVD or Blu-ray player, or a digital video recorder (DVR).
- DVR digital video recorder
- the supplemental set-top box does not have direct knowledge of the TV channels that are available to the primary set-top box or other TV receiver. Consequently, the supplemental set top box needs to implement indirect strategies to identify a TV channel that is being tuned by, or entire channel lineup available to, the primary set-top box or other TV receiver.

- the client 102 includes a shared capture module (or infrastructure) that captures audio or video content on all live channels. The captured fingerprints are then extracted (by the client 102 or by a server computer). For example, when a first electronic device (e.g., the set-top box 103 or the television 110) tunes to a particular channel, a second electronic device (e.g., the client 102 or the media server 130) computes a fingerprint from a portion of audio or video content coming from the first electronic device.
- a first electronic device e.g., the set-top box 103 or the television 110
- a second electronic device e.g., the client 102 or the media server 130
- the fingerprint is sent to a server, which compares the fingerprint from the first device with the captured fingerprint. If there is no match, this is an indication that the channel is not available or that the tuning failed (e.g., a bad IR code). If there is a match, the specific channel can be added to the lineup.

- the channel review module 238 enables a user to review, correct and remove channel information.
- the channel selection module 440 detects tuned signal strength and identifies whether a tuned channel is presenting non-superfluous content - i.e., anything that is not noise.
- the channel selection module 240 also allows a user to tune channels on the TV using simple channel up/down commands, or by entering an actual channel no., and causes appropriate channel information to be displayed on the TV.
- the channel selection module 440 employs an IR blaster 125 ( Figure 1B ) to send appropriate channel tuning/selection and "info" commands to the STB (or alternatively, the TV 110).

- channel information is not provided to the client device 102 via the connection with the set top box 103
- presenting channel information requires the client 102 or an interconnected sever to perform fingerprinting (e.g., of audio or video content snippets from media content played on the television 110) to confirm that the correct channel has been selected.
- fingerprinting e.g., of audio or video content snippets from media content played on the television 110
- the client device 102 needs to be able to issue an appropriate number of channel "Up” or "Down” commands (e.g., IR commands sent using the IR blaster 12 (Fig. IB)) to the cable/set top box 103 ( Fig. 1B ) to navigate to the desired channel and then confirm that the correct channel has been arrived at.
- this is done by: (1) sending an "Info" IR command (similar to a user hitting the "Info” button on the TV remote control) and doing a quick OCR check of the resulting displayed on screen information - or (2) by fingerprinting the channel content confirm that it matches what the requested channel selection should be showing.

Description
- The disclosed implementations relate generally to systems, methods and devices configured to collect information about media content items, such as television listings and streaming (e.g., audio and/or video) programs, e.g., so as to improve, for a user, access to and control over devices (e.g., a set top box or a connected TV) for playing such media content items.
- Interactive television technologies generally enable adding Internet-based functionality, content and/or services as an overlay to the television signals provided by cable and satellite television providers. For example, one of the aims of interactive television technologies is to deliver Internet-accessible functionality, content and/or services to an individual consumer that are matched to a particular television program the consumer is currently watching. To that end, interactive television technologies often need to determine what a consumer is watching in order to deliver matched functionality, content and/or services.
- According to previously developed systems and methods, a second device, such as a supplemental set-top box or a connected TV, is configured to work with the primary set-top box provided by a cable, satellite or other network television provider. In order to determine what a consumer is watching, the supplemental set-top box sends a query to the primary set-top box requesting information about the currently playing television program selected by the consumer (e.g. the title, names of actors or characters, electronic program guide information, etc.). In order to send such a query or otherwise communicate with the primary set-top box, the supplemental set-top box usually includes one or more provider-specific application program interfaces (APIs) that enable the supplemental set-top box to be paired with a wide variety of primary set-top boxes from various cable and satellite television providers. A similar situation also applies to other possible interactions between a supplemental set-top box and a primary set-top box, such as checking whether the primary set-top box is on or off or adjusting the default configuration of the primary set-top box. The development of each API requires the input and cooperation of a respective cable or satellite television provider that provides a primary set-top box to consumers. Developing the APIs with various providers tends to be inefficient, and hinders scaling such technologies across a wide variety of provider-specific platforms.
- In addition to TV content, other types of media content and services can be provided through a primary set-top box. The content or other services can be provided via a direct connection to the set-top box, as built-in features of the set-top box, or via a network connection. For example, a digital video recorder (DVR) built into a set-top box can be used to record TV content or playback recorded TV content; the set-top box can be used to access video-on-demand (VOD), DVD, or Blu-ray content available from the cable or satellite provider, a DVD player, or a Blu-ray player, respectively, associated with the set-top box; or the set-top box can be used to connect a local security system to security monitoring services. As noted above, it is challenging to develop and maintain APIs for every possible primary set-top box device that can be connected to a secondary set-top box. The variety of additional services that can be connected to a primary set top box makes the development of APIs to provide access to, or control of, such additional services even more challenging. Therefore, there is a need for solutions that enable a supplemental set-top box to receive information from other services provided via a primary set top box and to interact with (e.g., control) those services without using custom APIs for a particular primary set-top box. United States patent application publication no.
US 2008/097984 A1 presents a method of carrying out a search using a search engine consistent with certain embodiments involving extracting selected text from a video frame containing text by optical character recognition (OCR) processing of the selected text from the video frame. - The invention is defined in the
independent claims 1, 9 and 10. Particular embodiments of the invention are set out in the dependent claims. After considering this disclosure, and particularly after considering the section entitled "Detailed Description" one will understand how the features of various implementations are used to enable identifying and presenting, in real time, Internet-accessible and/or Internet-based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program concurrently playing on a television or display. - So that the present disclosure can be understood in greater detail, a more particular description may be had by reference to the features of various implementations, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings. The appended drawings, however, merely illustrate the more pertinent features of the present disclosure and are therefore not to be considered limiting, for the description may admit to other effective features.

Figure 9A and9B are flowcharts representations of respective implementations of a method of controlling a primary set top box based on display information provided by a one way connection from the primary set top box. - In accordance with common practice the various features illustrated in the drawings may not be drawn to scale. Accordingly, the dimensions of the various features may be arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity. In addition, the drawings may not depict all of the components of a given system, method or device; because, known methods, components, and circuits have not been described in exhaustive detail. Finally, like reference numerals may be used to denote like features throughout the specification and figures.
- The various implementations described herein include systems, methods and/or devices that are enabled to determine what a particular consumer is watching on television in order to deliver matched functionality, content and/or services, as a part of an interactive television suite of technologies. In particular, in some implementations, the process of determining what a particular consumer is watching is enabled so that communication between the primary set-top box and a supplemental set-top box and/or television-integrated device is reduced, thereby avoiding the need for one or more provider specific APIs. For example, one aspect of the disclosure is a method of identifying a media program by capturing display data from the media program, and extracting text from the display data in response to determining that the display data includes the text overlay, wherein the extracted text is associated with the media program. In some cases, a media program is identified by (1) generating one or more content fingerprints from a portion (e.g., audio or video) of the media content program, and (2) comparing the one or more content fingerprints with a set of fingerprints corresponding to (e.g., extracted from) a known media program.
- Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, a supplemental set-top box (or television integrated device) is configured to operate a primary set-top box, without a provider-specific API, in order to determine the channel line-up available to a particular subscriber through the primary set-top box. In addition, in some implementations, similar methods and features can be used to identify channel lineups available to viewers of non-subscription media content, such as over the air broadcasts that are received by a TV receiver, such as a TV receiver included, without limitation, in a computer, a media player, such as a DVD or Blu-ray player, or a digital video recorder (DVR). In some implementations, it is useful to make control of the menus of a second device from a first device more reliable, even if the second device does not provide access to TV program. These methods are advantageous, because they make universal remote controls more reliable.
- A common factor in each of these situations is that the supplemental set-top box does not have direct knowledge of the TV channels that are available to the primary set-top box or other TV receiver. Consequently, the supplemental set top box needs to implement indirect strategies to identify a TV channel that is being tuned by, or entire channel lineup available to, the primary set-top box or other TV receiver.
- Numerous details are described herein in order to provide a thorough understanding of the example implementations illustrated in the accompanying drawings. However, the invention may be practiced without these specific details. And, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in exhaustive detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure more pertinent aspects of the example implementations.

While certain specific features are illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the implementations disclosed herein. To that end, the client-server environment 100 includes a set-top box 103, a television (TV) 110, a client device 102 (e.g., a supplemental set-top box), a second screen client device 120 (e.g. a laptop, a tablet computer, a smartphone, etc.), aremote control device 112, acommunication network 104, amedia server 130, abroadcast system 140, and acontent provider 150. The second screen client device 120, theclient device 102, themedia server 130, thebroadcast system 140, and thecontent provider 150 are capable of being connected to thecommunication network 104 in order to exchange information with one another and/or other devices and systems. The client-server environment 100 is merely an example provided to discuss more pertinent features of the present disclosure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that any number of such devices and/or systems may be provided in a client-server environment, and particular devices may be altogether absent. - In some implementations, the
media server 130 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely for convenience of explanation, themedia server 130 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Similarly, in some implementations, thebroadcast system 140 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely, for convenience of explanation, thebroadcast system 140 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Similarly, in some implementations, thecontent provider 150 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely, for convenience of explanation, thecontent provider 150 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Moreover, the functionality of thebroadcast system 140 and thecontent provider 150 can be combined into a single server system. Additionally and/or alternatively, while only one broadcast system and only one content provider is illustrated inFigure 1A for the sake of brevity, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that fewer or more of each may be present in an implementation of a client-server environment. - In some implementations, the second screen client device 120 (e.g. a tablet computer or laptop, etc.), the set-
top box 103, theTV 110, theclient device 102, and aremote control 112 are provided in combination within, for example, a home or commercial establishment. The set-top box 103 is configured to receive and decode signals including media content from thebroadcast system 140 or the like. In operation, the set-top box 103 decodes the signal received from thebroadcast system 140 or the like and provides audio and video content to theTV 110 for display. While a TV has been used in the illustrated example, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that any number of displays devices, including computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, smart-phones and the like, can be used to display a video stream and play the associated audio stream. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations the functions of the set-top box 103 and theTV 110 are combined into a single device. - In some implementations, the
remote control 112 is used to control the operation of one or more of the set-top box 103, theTV 110, and theclient device 102. In one mode of operation, theclient device 102 monitors thedisplay 118 of theTV 110 to determine when a program information overlay is provided. In another mode of operation, theclient device 102 emulates the function of the remote control device 112 (e.g., by sending IR commands via an IR blaster 125 (Fig. IB)) to prompt the set-top box 103 to display the program information overlay. And in yet another mode of operation, theclient device 102 receives IR transmissions from theremote control 112 that are directed to the set-top box 103. In turn, theclient device 102 may then communicate with any one of themedia monitoring server 130, thebroadcast system 140, and thecontent provider 150 through thecommunication network 104. More specific details pertaining to how theclient device 102 acquires real time program information related to what a particular user is watching is described below with reference toFigures 3-5 . - In some implementations, the set-
top box 103 is any computer device capable of connecting to thecommunication network 104, receiving video streams, extracting information from video streams and presenting video streams for the display using the TV 110 (or another display device). In some implementations, the set-top box 103 is configured as a receiver for cable TV and/or satellite TV, a digital video recorder (DVR), a digital media receiver, a TV tuner, a computer, and/or any other device that outputs TV signals. In some implementations, theTV 110 is a conventional TV display that is not connectable to the Internet and that displays digital and/or analog TV content received via over the air broadcasts or a satellite or cable connection. - Similarly, in some implementations the
client device 102 is any computer device capable of connecting to thecommunication network 104 and theTV 110. As described below with reference toFigure 5 , in some implementations, theclient device 102 is capable of receiving infrared (IR) transmissions directed to the set-top box 103 from theremote control device 112. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, theclient device 102 is capable of wired and/or wireless communication with the client device 120. In some implementations, theclient device 102 includes one ormore processors 121,non-volatile memory 122 such as a hard disk drive, and alocal database 123. In some implementations, thememory 122 includesapplication instructions 122a and associateddata 122b. In some implementations, thelocal database 123 and/or the associateddata 122b stores information related to local channel lineups, including one or more local channel lineups 180-i discovered through operations described herein. In some implementations, the operations are performed by theapplication instructions 122a. - As discussed in greater detail below, the
processor 121 executes the one or more applications in accordance with a set of instructions received from themedia monitoring server 130. Theclient device 102 may also have input devices such as a keyboard, a mouse and/or track-pad (not shown). In some implementations, theclient device 102 includes a touch screen display, a digital camera and/or any number of supplemental devices to add functionality. - As is typical of televisions, the
TV 110 includes adisplay 118 and speakers. Additionally and/or alternatively, theTV 110 can be replaced with another type of display device for presenting video content to a user, such as for example, a computer, a tablet device, a mobile telephone, a projector, or other type of video display system. The display device can be coupled to the set-top box 103 via a wireless or wired connection. - As used herein, a TV signal is an electrical, optical, or other type of data transmitting medium that includes audio and/or video components corresponding to a TV channel. In some implementations, the TV signal is a terrestrial over-the-air TV broadcast signal or a sign distributed/broadcast on a cable-system or a satellite system. In some implementations, the TV signal is transmitted as data over a network connection. For example, the set-
top box 103 can receive video streams from an Internet connection. Audio and video components of a TV signal are sometimes referred to herein as audio signals and video signals. In some implementations, a TV signal corresponds to a TV channel that is being displayed on theTV 110. -
Figure 1B is a diagram of a portion of the client-server environment 100 including an example schematic screen display on theTV 110. Again, theTV 110 includes thedisplay 118 on which video of a media program is displayed. Further, while the video is being displayed, the set-top box 103 may provide atext overlay 119 that includes channel and title information. For example, thetext overlay 119 typically includes the channel the media program is being presented on, as well as the title of the media program. Thetext overlay 119 also often includes information about actors, characters, and/or a synopsis of the media program. In some implementations, as shown inFigure 1B , theclient 102 is connected to the set-box 103 via a connection 131 (e.g., an HDMI, connection, a cable connection, or a wireless connection) by which theclient 102 can receivevideo signals 171a from the settop box 103 the same as or comparable to the video signals 171b provided by the settop box 103 to thetelevision 110 via the connection 135 (e.g., an HDMI connection). This allows theclient 102 to analyze and perform optical character recognition (OCR) on thetext overlay 119 provided by the settop box 103 along with the video and/or audio content and/or metadata associated with the show being watched (all provided as part of the video signals 171). In some implementations, theconnections top box 103 and theTV 110 and/or theclient 102 are substantially or entirely one way. That is, while it is possible for the settop box 103 to provide signals to theTV 110 and theclient 102, it is not possible for theTV 110 and theclient 102 to control the settop box 103 via commands sent back to the settop box 103 via theconnections client 102 is connected with thetelevision 110 via the connection 137 (e.g., a wireless connection, such as a WIFI, BLUETOOTH, RF, or IF connection). - With further reference to
Figure 1A , the second screen client device 120 may be any computer device that is capable of connecting to thecommunication network 104, such as a computer, a laptop computer, a tablet device, a netbook, an Internet kiosk, a personal digital assistant, a mobile phone, a gaming device, or any other device that is capable of communicating with themedia server 130. - The
communication network 104 may be any combination of wired and wireless local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN), such as an intranet, an extranet, including a portion of the Internet, or a wireless network provided by a wireless carrier. It is sufficient that thecommunication network 104 provides communication capability between the second screen client device 120 and themedia monitoring server 130. In some implementations, thecommunication network 104 uses the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) to transport information using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). HTTP permits theclient device 102 to access various resources available via thecommunication network 104. However, the various implementations described herein are not limited to the use of any particular protocol. - In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 includes afront end server 134 that facilitates communication between themedia monitoring server 130 and thecommunication network 104. Thefront end server 134 receives content information from theclient device 102. As described in greater detail below, in some implementations, the content information includes program information, such as the program title, actor names, character names, plot summaries, etc. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to send a set of instructions to theclient device 102. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to send content files, links to content files and/or metadata associated with the content files. The term "content file" includes any document or content of any format including, but not limited to, a video file, an image file, a music file, a web page, an email message, an SMS message, a content feed, an advertisement, a coupon, a playlist or an XML document. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to send or receive one or more video streams. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to receive content directly from thebroadcast system 140 and/or thecontent provider 150 over thecommunication network 104. - In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 includes a content database 136. In some implementations, the content database 136 includes advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents, and ratings associated with various media content or any combination thereof. In some implementations, the content database 136 includes links to advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents and ratings associated with various media content. In some implementations, the content database 136 is a distributed database. - In some implementations, the
broadcast system 140 includes media content such as TV programs. In some implementations, thebroadcast system 140 also includes metadata associated with one or more of the TV programs, and application program interface instructions. In some implementations, the application program interface instructions include instructions that can be provided to a client device and/or may be executed by thebroadcast system 140 under a client-server model or the like in order to link a particular TV program with the associated metadata and/or link the TV program and the associated metadata with external data and/or services, such as a social networking application. Similarly, in some implementations, thecontent provider 150 additionally and/or alternatively includes media content such as TV programs, as well as metadata associated with one or more of the TV programs. -
Figure 2A is a diagram of an example implementation of theclient device 102, discussed above with reference toFigure 1A , and which may be operable as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television-integrated device. While certain specific features are illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the implementations disclosed herein. To that end, theclient device 102 includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 202, one or more network orother communications interfaces 208,memory 206, aTV tuner 232, a video I/O 230, and one ormore communication buses 204, for interconnecting these and various other components. Thecommunication buses 204 optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system components. Theclient device 102 may also include auser interface 212 comprising adisplay device 213 and a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 214 and/or a remote control (etc.).Memory 206 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.Memory 206 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 202.Memory 206, or alternatively the non-volatile memory device(s) withinmemory 206, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some implementations,memory 206 or the computer readable storage medium ofmemory 206 store the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof, anoperating system 216, anetwork communication module 218, anOCR module 226,software modules 228, anddata 220. - The
operating system 216 includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks. - The
network communication module 218 facilitates communication with other devices via the one or more communication network interfaces 204 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on. - In some implementations, the
OCR module 226 enables theclient device 102 to process screen shots (e.g. images from the TV 110) to obtain the program information included in the program information overlay provided by the primary set-top box 103. To that end, theOCR module 226 includesOCR instructions 324 andmetadata 325. In some implementations, theOCR instructions 324 include instructions that perform OCR operations to recognize program information from TV images and content and themetadata 325 includes data employed by the OCR module to support OCR operations. For example, in some implementations the metadata includes information related to common combinations of words associated with TV channels and programs, such as channel names, broadcaster names, and words commonly used in program titles. In some implementations, e.g., when theclient 102 is equipped with appropriate processing power, screen shots are processed locally on theclient 102, e.g., so as to avoid delay caused by transmitting the screen shots to a remote sever. - In other implementations, processing screen shots (e.g., one or more of the OCR operations) take place on a server computer connected with the
client 102, e.g., via thecommunication network 104. In some implementations, theclient 102 transmits unprocessed (e.g., raw) or partially processed screenshots to a server for processing. In some implementation, theclient 102 compresses (e.g., applying one or more compression algorithms, lossy or lossless) or adjusts (e.g., transmitting black and white images) the screen shots, e.g., so as to consume less network bandwidth. - In still other implementations, where load balancing techniques are used, screen shot processing (e.g., one or more of the OCR operations) take place partially on the
client 102 and partially on a server computer. For example, in a set of 10 screen shots, high resolution screen shots processed locally (e.g., so as to avoid a potentially lengthy transmission delay), and low resolution screen shots are transmitted to a server for batch processing, which are usually quicker. For another example, in a set of 1000 screen shots, the first 500 screen shots are processed locally, while the second 500 screen shots are transmitted to a server for parallel or concurrent processing, e.g., so as to reduce overall processing time. - In still further implementations, some stages of screen shot processing take place on a client, while other stages take place on a server. For example, after a screen shot is taken, a client applies OCR techniques to the screen shot, and resulting text (produced by the OCR techniques), and/or associated annotations, are sent to a remote server, which then decides what instructions execute on a set top box (e.g., a channel switch, recording a user preference, and displaying a channel listing).
- In some implementations, the software modules include a display/
user module 234, a channellineup manager module 236, achannel review module 238, and achannel selection module 240. In some implementations, the display/user module 234 displays information provided by other software modules. The displayed information can include achannel lineup 280 discovered by some combination of theOCR module 226, channel lineup manager module 436,channel review module 238,channel selection module 240, and acommand sending module 242. - In some implementations, for some functions such as changing channels (e.g., to extract channel lineup), a process sometimes called (audio or video) fingerprinting is used in lieu of OCR techniques. In these implementations, the
client 102 includes a shared capture module (or infrastructure) that captures audio or video content on all live channels. The captured fingerprints are then extracted (by theclient 102 or by a server computer). For example, when a first electronic device (e.g., the set-top box 103 or the television 110) tunes to a particular channel, a second electronic device (e.g., theclient 102 or the media server 130) computes a fingerprint from a portion of audio or video content coming from the first electronic device. The fingerprint is sent to a server, which compares the fingerprint from the first device with the captured fingerprint. If there is no match, this is an indication that the channel is not available or that the tuning failed (e.g., a bad IR code). If there is a match, the specific channel can be added to the lineup. - In some implementations, the channel
lineup manager module 236 maps the discovered channel numbers to actual over the air channels as applicable and to cable channel names (e.g., by using the channel map information 282). Thechannel review module 238 enables a user to review, correct and remove channel information. In some implementations, the channel selection module 440 detects tuned signal strength and identifies whether a tuned channel is presenting non-superfluous content - i.e., anything that is not noise. In some implementations, thechannel selection module 240 also allows a user to tune channels on the TV using simple channel up/down commands, or by entering an actual channel no., and causes appropriate channel information to be displayed on the TV. In some implementations, the channel selection module 440 employs an IR blaster 125 (Figure 1B ) to send appropriate channel tuning/selection and "info" commands to the STB (or alternatively, the TV 110). In some implementations, thechannel selection module 240 and other modules or operations described herein that interact with theIR blaster 125 to send commands to theTV 110 or theSTB 125 do so via acommand sending module 242. Thus, using the recognized channel lineup information, a user is able to control theTV 110 via the client device 102 (which only possesses a one-way connection to TV and the STB) as if theclient device 102 possessed a two-way connection to the TV, similar to that of theSTB 103. - In some implementations, since channel information is not provided to the
client device 102 via the connection with the settop box 103, presenting channel information requires theclient 102 or an interconnected sever to perform fingerprinting (e.g., of audio or video content snippets from media content played on the television 110) to confirm that the correct channel has been selected. This also means that theclient device 102 needs to be able to issue an appropriate number of channel "Up" or "Down" commands (e.g., IR commands sent using the IR blaster 12 (Fig. IB)) to the cable/set top box 103 (Fig. 1B ) to navigate to the desired channel and then confirm that the correct channel has been arrived at. In some implementations, this is done by: (1) sending an "Info" IR command (similar to a user hitting the "Info" button on the TV remote control) and doing a quick OCR check of the resulting displayed on screen information - or (2) by fingerprinting the channel content confirm that it matches what the requested channel selection should be showing. - In some implementations, the display/
user module 234 displays information provided by other software modules. The displayed information can include a channel lineup 180 discovered by some combination of theOCR module 226, channellineup manager module 236,channel review module 238 and achannel selection module 240. In some implementations, thedata 220 includesOCR data 261 and alocal database 123 of program information. In some implementations, the program information is received from a broadcast system and/or content provider. In some implementations, theOCR data 261 includes text segments 261-1, images 261-2 and user ID information 261-3. In some implementations, thelocal database 123 includes one or more discovered channel lineups 280-i andchannel map information 282 that stores information that maps channel numbers to actual over the air channels as applicable and to cable channel names. - In some implementations, each of the above identified elements may be stored in one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices, and each of the modules or programs corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The set of instructions can be executed by one or more processors (e.g., the CPUs 202). The above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various implementations. In some implementations,
memory 206 stores a subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore,memory 206 may store additional modules and data structures not described above. -
Figure 2B shows information associated in some implementations with individual channels 458 saved in a channel lineup 280-1 stored in thelocal database 123. This information, or subsets or supersets thereof, can be associated with any number of one or more of the channel lineups 280-i. In the illustrated implementation(s), a representative first channel lineup 280-1 includes, for an individual channel 458-1 in the lineup, one or more of: input source information 460-1, displayed channel number 468-1, displayed channel name 470-1, meaningful channel number 472-1, meaningful channel name 474-1, signal strength 476-1 and broadcast location 478-1. In some implementations, the input sources 460-1 indicate the source of a respective particular channel using Yes/No or similar binary values. In some implementations the input sources 460-1 indicate whether the tuned channel is from a cable provider 462-1, an over the air source 464-1 (such as a terrestrial broadcast TV channel) or from a satellite source 468-1. Alternatively, the input sources 460-1 can be represented with a single field that holds a value that indicates the source for the respective channel (e.g. "OTA," "Cable," or "Satellite-Dish"). The displayed channel number 468-1 and name 470-1 are the channel number and name displayed on the TV display 110 (Figure 1B ) and captured via OCR operations. The displayed channel number 468-1 and name 470-1 might not be meaningful to a user (e.g., the channel number 468-1 could be a three digit value assigned by a cable company with no relationship to a known channel number). As a result, the channel information includes in some implementations, for each tuned channel, a meaningful channel number 472-1 (e.g., a recognizable over the air channel number) and channel name 474-1 (e.g., a recognizable network or channel name). The channel information for a representative channel 458-1 also includes in some implementations information related to channel reception and transmission, including signal strength 476-1 and broadcast location 478-1. -
Figure 3 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of amethod 300 of determining what a consumer is currently watching. In some implementations, the method is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining what a consumer is currently watching. For example, with reference toFigure 1A , in some implementations, themethod 300 is performed by the client device 102 (i.e., the supplemental set-top box). As noted above, when a user changes the channel or requests program information by, for example, using one or more channel selection options or pressing an "INFO" button, the primary set-top box displays an overlay including program information, such as the current channel, the title of the playing program and information about the program. Accordingly, the method includes identifying instances during which the primary set-top box provides the overlay by monitoring the display output provided by the primary set-top box, and parsing the overlay for the desired information. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, the method includes detecting when channel identifiers are displayed without being prompted by user interaction (i.e., a user pressing a button) - To that end, the method includes performing a screen or display data capture from the display device that is displaying the television program selected by the consumer through a primary set-top box or the like in order acquire an image of what is being displayed (301). In some implementations, the screen capture data is obtained from the video signal provided by the primary set-top box. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, the screen capture data is obtained from a display (i.e., video) card included in the set-top box and/or the operating system of the set-top box. Additionally and/or alternatively, the screen capture data is obtained from a TV app running on at least one of the primary set-top box, the supplemental set-top box, the TV, and a second screen device. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, the supplemental set-top box (or the like) includes a camera operable to capture an image of the display of a television or the like. The method includes analyzing the image to identify whether the image includes indicators that an overlay is being displayed by the primary set-top box (302). For example, in some implementations, the indicators include the color of the overlay, the percentage of display area the overlay typically covers when visible, the arrangement of text with the overlay, contrast between a portion of the display likely to be displaying the program and another portion of the display likely to be displaying the overlay.
- The method includes determining whether one or more of the indicators are present as indicated by the image analysis (303). If none of the indicators are present for a particular screen capture ("No" path from 303), the method includes waiting a pseudorandom amount of time or a preset delay time (304) before capturing another screen shot or the like. On the other hand, if at least one indicator is present or another threshold number of the indicators is present ("Yes" path from 303), the method includes applying an optical character recognition technique to the image in order to identify and extract the displayed information (305). Having extracted the title and/or program information, the method includes cross-referencing the extracted information with a local and/or remote database to ensure the validity of the information (306). For example, with further reference to
Figure 1A , theclient device 102 may communicate with themedia server 130 in order to check the validity of the extracted display information. More specifically, theclient device 102 may transmit all or a portion of the extracted information to themedia server 130. In turn, themedia server 130 may then check the extracted information against a content database (e.g., thecontent database 133,Fig. 1 ) to ensure that the extracted data is correct and/or provide corrected information to theclient device 102 when the extracted data is incorrect but can be matched to database information. -
Figure 4 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of amethod 400 of determining what a consumer is currently watching. In some implementations, the method is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining what a consumer is currently watching by, in part, emulating the operation of a remote control device associated with the primary set-top box. To that end, the method includes transmitting a first infrared (IR) code (or the like) to the primary set-top box in order to initiate the display of the program information overlay (401). For example, with further reference toFigure 1A , one of theclient device 102 and the client device 120 may transmit an IR code to the set-top box 103. - The method then includes performing a screen capture to acquire a screen shot (i.e. image) including the program information overlay (402). Having acquired the screen shot, the method includes transmitting a second IR code (or the like) to the primary set-top box in order to initiate the removal of the program information overlay on the playing television program (403). The method includes analyzing the image or screen shot to obtain the program information presented in the overlay (404). Having extracted the title and/or program information, the method includes cross-referencing the extracted information with a local and/or
remote database 133 to ensure the validity of the information (406). -
Figure 5 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of amethod 500 of determining what a consumer is currently watching. In some implementations, the method is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining what a consumer is currently watching, by detecting IR transmission from a remote control device associated with the primary set-top box. For example, with further reference toFigure 1A , theclient device 102 may detect IR transmissions directed to the primary set-top box 103 from the remote control device 120. - To that end, the method includes detecting an IR transmission or equivalent from a remote control device associated with a primary set-top box (501). In turn, the method includes parsing the transmission in order to identify the command that is represented by the IR transmission (502). Having identified the command, the method includes determining whether or not the identified command causes the primary set-top box to provide the program information overlay in the video stream provided to the display device. If the detected command is not likely to cause the primary set-top box to provide the program information overlay ("No" path from 503), the method includes circling back to detect another IR transmission. On the other hand, if the detected command is likely to cause the primary set-top box to provide the program information overlay ("Yes" path from 503), the method includes performing a screen or display data capture from the display device that is displaying the television program selected by the consumer through a primary set-top box or the like in order acquire an image of what is being displayed (504). The method includes analyzing the image or screen shot to obtain the program information presented in the overlay (505). And, the method includes cross-referencing the extracted information with a local and/or remote database to ensure the validity of the information (506).

Figure 6 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of amethod 600 of determining channel line-up access available through a primary set-top box. In some implementations, the method is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining channel line-up access available through a primary set-top box by using the primary set-top box channel control commands. For example, with further reference toFigure 1A , theclient device 102 may transmit IR transmissions to the primary set-top box 103 or provide equivalent signaling. - To that end, the
method 600 includes selecting an initial candidate channel to probe using the primary set-top box channel control commands (601). In some implementations, a candidate channel is any one of the suspected channel numbers that may be available through the primary set-top box. Having selected a candidate channel, themethod 600 includes transmitting a control command to the primary set-top box to tune the primary set-top box to the candidate channel (602). For example, in some implementations, transmitting a control command includes transmitting an IR code (602a). In some implementations, transmitting a control command includes transmitting a command packet over a data connection (602b). - Subsequent to transmitting the control command, the
method 600 includes performing a screen data capture (603). In some implementations, performing a screen data capture includes reading a display pixel buffer and/or reading from a display pixel bus in order to obtain at least a single frame of screen display information (603a). Themethod 600 then includes performing an image analysis to determine if the candidate channel is available as a part of a subscription associated with the primary set-top box, and thus delivering non-superfluous television content (604). In some implementations, non-superfluous television content includes television programs, sporting events, news broadcasts, movies, etc. In some implementations, superfluous television content includes data such as pay-per-view title screens, subscription information (e.g. a contact number or website address), looping advertisements and/or content trailers indicating the type of content that would be available to a subscriber of the channel that is currently not available because the primary set-top box is not associated with such a subscriber. In some implementations, performing image analysis includes performing and/or applying OCR to identify text content in the screen display data (604a). In some implementations, performing image analysis includes fingerprinting the at least one frame of screen display data to identify the program content (604b). In some implementations, performing image analysis includes performing a video analysis to determine whether or not the candidate channel is being used to deliver non-superfluous television content (604c). In some implementations, in addition to, or as a substitute forvisual analysis 604c, the channel selection model 440 (Figure 2A ) or equivalent functionality determines (604d) whether a particular channel is carrying non-superfluous television content by analyzing signal strength of channels. - Based on the image analysis, the
method 600 includes deciding whether the candidate channel is being used to deliver non-superfluous television content (605). If the candidate channel is being used to deliver non-superfluous television content ("Yes" path from 605), themethod 600 includes marking the candidate channel as available or a member of the subscription line-up available through the primary set-top box (606). If the candidate channel is not being used to deliver non-superfluous television content ("No" path from 605), themethod 600 includes marking the candidate channel as unavailable or not a member of the subscription line-up available through the primary set-top box (607). Information for active channels is then saved in one of the channel lineups 180 (611). Information saved for the active channels includes information recognized from the displayed channel information (such as channel number and name) and information obtained from local or external sources, such as a program guide stored on theclient device 102 or a server that is coupled to theclient device 102 via a network 104 (e.g., themedia server 130,Figure 1A ). - In some implementations, when there are multiple input sources, such as cable TV, over the air TV, and satellite TV, channels from a particular input source are saved and stored in a respective channel lineup. For example,
Figure 2A illustrates two saved channel lineups 180-1 and 180-2. Also, in some implementations, to make the channel lineups more user-friendly and/or to identify channels that are duplicated across multiple lineups, the displayed and OCR'd channel information is mapped to meaningful names/channel numbers, such as local over the air (OTA) channel numbers or channel names, such as network names (612). These meaningful channel names and numbers are then saved in the channel lineups along with the recognized displayed channel information. The information (e.g., channel map information 282) used to map the OCRed channel information to meaningful channel names and numbers can be previously stored on theclient device 102 and/or downloaded from the server. Alternatively, theclient device 102 can issue one or more requests to the server to map the channel information based on information available to the server for channel lineups available in the area of theclient device 102 for different input sources / content providers. - Subsequent to deciding upon the status of the candidate channel, the
method 600 includes determining whether or not to continue based on the suspected existence of additional channels (608). In some implementations, at least one addition candidate channel is suspected to exist when each of the candidate channels considered thus far has only been considered once and/or an equal number of times without overlap. If at least one more channel is not suspected to exist continue ("No" path from 608), themethod 600 ends (610). If at least one more channel is suspected to exist continue ("No" path from 608), themethod 600 includes selecting a new candidate channel and reiterating the portion of the method starting at block 602 (609). In some implementations, selecting a new candidate channel includes using the "channel up" (or "channel down") primary set-top box control command (609a). In some implementations, selecting a new candidate channel includes selecting a new channel from a list or the like (609b). In addition, the method described with reference toFigure 6 (and the related methods described with reference toFigures 4 and5 ) can be used to identify channel lineups available to viewers of non-subscription media content, such as over the air broadcasts that are received by a TV receiver, such as a TV receiver included, without limitation, in a computer, a media player, such as a DVD or Blu-ray player, or a digital video recorder (DVR). - In some implementations, in addition to TV content, other types of media content and services can be provided through the primary set-
top box 103. The content or other services can be provided via a direct (wired or wireless) connection to the set-top box 103, as built-in features of the set-top box 103, or via a network connection. For example, a digital video recorder (DVR) built into a set-top box can be used to record TV content or playback recorded TV content; the set-top box 103 can be used to access video-on-demand (VOD) content available from the cable or satellite provider associated with the set-top box; or the set-top box can be used to monitor or control a home security system. Using capabilities similar to those described above with reference toFigures 1-6 , in some implementations aclient device 102 is configured to receive display information from services/features provided via aprimary STB 103 and to interact with (e.g., control and access) those services without using custom APIs for a particular primary set-top box. - For example, in some implementations, in a trial and error process the
client device 102 sends via a one-way wireless connection provided by the set top box (such as an IR or RF interface) a sequence of one or more commands to cause the set-top box 103 to exercise certain features/services and/or access certain STB content (e.g., DVR services or VOD content). In some implementations, consistent with techniques described above, theclient device 102 then analyzes display characteristics (e.g., position, size, graphics and content) of text overlays and/or other images/information associated with the resulting images displayed by thetelevision 110 in response to the one or more commands and determines whether those text overlays are as expected given the one or more commands that were sent. In some implementations, theclient device 102 performs this determination by comparing the identified display characteristics of the resulting text overlays to a database of expected overlay display characteristics generated by particular makes and models of set top box in response to particular commands associated with particular set-top box feature sets. If the identified overlay display characteristics are consistent with the expected overlay display characteristics, theclient device 102 stores information identifying the set top box's make and model, as well as correct sequence of one or more commands used to access particular features. In this way, theclient device 102 can identify useful commands and features provided by the set-top box 103 and subsequently control those features using the identified command sequences. - In some implementations, once the
client device 102 has identified the make, model and feature set of the settop box 103, theclient device 102 can download from another device (e.g., a network server) command sequences for controlling the set-top box 103. - In any of these contexts, the command sequences can be conventional remote control commands supported by the
STB 130, which theclient device 102 can send using a compatible IR or RF transmitter, or network commands (e.g., WiFi or Bluetooth) supported by theSTB 103, which theclient device 102 can send via its own network connections. In this way, theclient device 102 is able to control the feature set provided by the set top box 103 - even though the only connections provided by the settop box 103 are one way connections (e.g., output audio and video signals with no control capabilities or remote control connections). Of course, the methods described herein are applicable to any communication modalities that are supported by a STB to enable control of its feature set and access to video and audio signals that reflect its outputs. Similarly, the methods described herein are applicable to identifying command sequences and controlling feature sets of any electronic device via comparable one way connections. - As a further illustration,
Figure 7 is a diagram of a portion of the client-server environment 100 including an example schematic screen display on theTV 110 and showing additional features provided by the set-top box 103 and theclient device 102 ofFigure 1 . TheTV 110 includes thedisplay 118 on which video of a media program is displayed. In addition to receiving and displaying TV content on the TV 110 (or other display), the set-top box 103 is configured with a variety of services/features, including, without limitation, video ondemand content 703, digital video recorder (DVR) features 705 and home security system features 707. These services/features can be provisioned to/by the set-top box 103 in a variety of ways. For example, theVOD content 703 is provided by the content provider associated with the STB 103 (i.e., the STB provider), the DVR services/features 705 can be provided by computing and storage components internal to theSTB 103 or remotely by the STB provider, and the home security system services/features 707 can be accessed via a home network or in some cases by direct connection to theSTB 103. - In some implementations, representative VOD features 703 include allowing a user to view and select video content from a list of
available VOD programs 721; representative DVR features 705 include allowing a user to view and select from a list of recordedprograms 723 and view and/or define arecording schedule 725; and representative home security features 707 that can be accessed through the STB include allowing a user to view images captured fromsecurity cameras 727, view and resetsecurity system state 729 and view and update andsecurity system configuration 731. In some implementations, state information associated with these features, which is relevant to controlling the features, might not be directly displayed by theSTB 103 in response to user commands (including commands sent by the client device 102), but these states can be ascertained by theclient device 102 by sending particular command sequences and observing the resulting video andaudio signals 171a, 773a provided by theSTB 103. - Similarly, the
STB 103 has its own features and settings that can be identified or controlled by a user or aclient device 102 with the appropriate command sequences. These features and settings include, without limitation, allowing a user to view information pertaining to: STB provider and channel/feature lineup 741,available channels 743, and onscreen menus 745 to allow a user to interact with those and other features (such as a top level menu to allow the user to access VOD, DVR and home security services/features). TheSTB 103 also has state information that is relevant to controlling theSTB 103 and its associated services/features. In some implementations this state information includes menu state 747 (i.e., the currently displayed menu), on/off state 749 (e.g., whether the STB is on or off) and the STB configuration 751 (e.g., without limitation, its provisioned services and features and the types of its available and/or active connections - such as the fact that anexample STB 103 it supports WiFi commands, has IR and RF command receivers, is DLNA compatible, has 2 HDMI outputs, including one HDMI 2.0 output, and has component video and S-video outputs). - As shown in
Figure 7 , and consistent withFigure 1B , in some implementations theclient device 102 is any computer device capable of connecting to thecommunication network 104 and theTV 110, receiving audio andvideo signals 171a, 773a from theset box 103, and issuing commands 777 to the set-top box 103. In some implementations, theclient 102 is connected to the set-box 103 via aconnection 131 by which theclient 102 can receivevideo signals 171a and audio signals 773a from the settop box 103 the same as or comparable to the video signals 171b andaudio signals 773b provided by the settop box 103 to thetelevision 110 via theconnection 135. This allows theclient 102 to analyze and perform optical character recognition (OCR) on thetext overlay 119 provided by the settop box 103 along with the video and/or audio content and/or metadata associated with the show being watched (all provided as part of the video signals 171). In some implementations, thecommunications top box 103 and theTV 110 and/or theclient 102 are substantially or entirely one way. That is, while it is possible for the settop box 103 to provide signals to theTV 110 and theclient 102, it is not possible for theTV 110 and theclient 102 to control the settop box 103 via commands sent back to the settop box 103 via theconnections Figure 1B , in some implementations the client is configured to issue commands 777 to the set-top box 103 by a connection 775 that can be one or more of a network connection (such as a WiFi or Bluetooh network connection) or RF or IR connections). As described with reference toFigure 5 , in some implementations, theclient device 102 is capable of receiving infrared (IR) transmissions directed to the set-top box 103 from theremote control device 112. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, theclient device 102 is capable of wired and/or wireless communication with the client device 120, the settop box 103 and theTV 110. - In some implementations, the
client device 102 includes one ormore processors 121,non-volatile memory 122 such as a hard disk drive, and alocal database 123. In some implementations, thememory 122 includesapplication instructions 122a and associateddata 122b. In some implementations, as described above, thelocal database 123 and/or the associateddata 122b stores information related to local channel lineups, including one or more local channel lineups 180-i discovered through operations described above. In some implementations, thelocal database 123 and/or the associateddata 122b also store data and commands related to accessing and controlling services and features provided by theSTB 103. In some implementations, the operations for controlling theSTB 103, including sending commands to theSTB 103, are performed by theapplication instructions 122a. In some implementations, theclient device 102 includes IR and/or RF blasters/transmitters to send RF or RF commands 777 to the settop box 103, theTV 110 or other compatible devices. In some implementations, the client device includes a microphone to receive audio signals 773 provided by theSTB 103 in order to assess the current state and/or programming and/or feature set of theSTB 103. - Further, while the video is being displayed, or in response to particular commands sent to the set-
top box 103, the set-top box 103 may provide a variety of text overlays 119, 751, 753 that include information related to an associated STB service or displayed content type. For example,Figure 7 shows example text overlays 119, 751, 753 associated respectively with TV program content, features and content associated with aDVR 705, and on demand programs available from a video ondemand provider 703. The set-top box 103 can also provide access to other services and features, such as services / features of ahome security system 707 controlled through the set-top box 103. Each of these features provides via the set-top box 103 has its own associated text overlays for display with the onscreen content 755 presented on theTV 110. The purpose of these overlays and other information is to enable user interaction with the associated services and features. As described with reference toFigures 1-6 , the overlay information can be stimulated, received and analyzed by theclient device 102 in order to provide interactive, two-way control of the STB 103 - even though the STB is not natively configured with connections to permit theclient device 102 such level of control. Also, as described with reference toFigures 1-6 , in some implementations, the overlay information can be passively received by the client device 102 (e.g., when generated in response to a user command to the STB 103) and then analyzed by theclient device 102 in order to identify a make and model of the STB as well as a current state of theSTB 103. - In different implementations, the one or more overlays associated with respective STB features and services are typically presented with associated screen positions, bounding box size (e.g., the size of the overlay either as x and y pixel dimensions or a percentage of screen occupied by the overlay), content, content styles and formatting, and graphics. The positions, bounding box sizes and content of the
overlays Figure 7 are simply examples of different styles ofoverlays Figure 1B , thetext overlay 119 typically includes the channel the media program is being presented on, as well as the title of the media program. Thetext overlay 119 also often includes information about actors, characters, and/or a synopsis of the media program. The content of theDVR overlay 751 is based on information provided by features of adigital video recorder 705 provided by the settop box 103, including, for example, a list of recorded programs and a recording schedule displayed in response to corresponding commands 777 sent by theclient device 102. The content of theVOD overlay 753 is based on information provided by VOD features provided by the settop box 103, including, for example a list of available VOD programs displayed in response to corresponding commands 777 sent by theclient device 102. As noted above, these overlays are presented in a characteristic manner based on the associated make, model and feature set of the STB. Accordingly, these typical display characteristics can be used by theclient device 102 to identify the associated make, model and feature set of the STB and to determine whether theclient device 102 is sending the correct command sequences for controlling the STB and/or particular services and features provide by the STB. -
Figure 8A is a diagram of an example implementation of theclient device 102, discussed above with reference toFigure 1A , and which may be operable as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television-integrated device. In some implementations, theclient device 102 includes all or a subset of the functionality described with respect toFigure 2A and all or a subset of the features described with reference toFigure 8A . While certain specific features are illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the implementations disclosed herein. To that end, theclient device 102 includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 202, one or more network orother communications interfaces 208,memory 206, aTV tuner 232, a video I/O 230, and one ormore communication buses 204, for interconnecting these and various other components. Thecommunication buses 204 optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system components. Theclient device 102 may also include auser interface 212 comprising adisplay device 213 and a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 214 and/or a remote control (etc.).Memory 206 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.Memory 206 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 202.Memory 206, or alternatively the non-volatile memory device(s) withinmemory 206, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some implementations,memory 206 or the computer readable storage medium ofmemory 206 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof, including anoperating system 216, anetwork communication module 218, anOCR module 226,software modules 228, anddata 220. - The
operating system 216 includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks. - The
network communication module 218 facilitates communication with other devices via the one or more communication network interfaces 204 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on. - In some implementations, the
OCR module 226 enables theclient device 102 to process screen shots (e.g. images from the TV 110) to obtain the program information included in the program information overlay and information associated with services and features provided by the primary set-top box 103. To that end, theOCR module 226 includesOCR instructions 324 andmetadata 325. As described with reference toFigure 2A , in some implementations, theOCR instructions 324 include instructions that perform OCR operations to recognize program information from TV images and content and themetadata 325 includes data employed by the OCR module to support OCR operations. For example, in some implementations the metadata includes information related to common combinations of words associated with TV channels and programs, such as channel names, broadcaster names, and words commonly used in program titles. In some implementations, theOCR instructions 324 include instructions that perform OCR operations to recognize information and graphical characteristics associated with other services and features provided by theSTB 103, such as DVR, VOD and home security services, and themetadata 325 includes data employed by the OCR module to support OCR operations. For example, in some implementations the metadata includes information related to common combinations of words and symbols associated with information overlays generated by different set-top box makes and models for different feature sets. - In some implementations, the
software modules 228 include a display/user module 234, a channellineup manager module 236, achannel review module 238, achannel selection module 240, acommand sending module 242, an STB command/response module 814, a UI display comparison module and an STB control module. In some implementations, the display/user module 234 displays information provided by other software modules. The displayed information can include a channel lineup 180 discovered by some combination of theOCR module 226, channellineup manager module 236,channel review module 238, andchannel selection module 240. In some implementations, the channellineup manager module 236 maps the discovered channel numbers to actual over the air channels as applicable and to cable channel names (e.g., by using the channel map information 282). Thechannel review module 238 enables a user to review, correct and remove channel information. In some implementations, thechannel selection module 240 employs an IR blaster 125 (Figures 1B and7 ) to send appropriate channel tuning/selection and "info" commands to the STB (or alternatively, the TV 110). In some implementations, thechannel selection module 240 and other modules or operations described herein that interact with theIR blaster 125 or other command interfaces to send commands to theTV 110 or theSTB 103 do so via acommand sending module 242. Thus, using the recognized channel lineup information, a user is able to control theTV 110 via the client device 102 (which only possesses a one-way connection to the STB and no prior knowledge of the applicable channel lineup) as if theclient device 102 possessed a two-way connection to theSTB 103 and had prior knowledge of the channel lineup. Similarly, a user is able to control and otherwise interact with services and features provided by the STB 103 (such as DVR and VOD services) via theclient device 102 as if theclient device 102 possessed a two-way connection to theSTB 103. - Related to identifying and controlling other features of the STB, the STB command and response module 814 includes instructions for sending commands to the
STB 103 for identifying command sequences that can be used to control particular STB services and features (e.g., DVR and VOD services) and identifying responses, if any, to those commands based on review and analysis (supported by the other software modules as required) of the corresponding audio and/orvideo signals 171a, 773a provided by the STB (collectively and/or individually referred to herein as display response data, response data or display responses). The STB command and response module 814 in some implementations also manages the trial and error process described herein that includes sendingtrial command sequences 834 to theSTB 103 in order to identifycorrect command sequences 836 for a particular make and model of settop box 103 and saving locally thecorrect command sequences 836 for re-use (e.g., to permit the user to control the associated services and features via the client device 102). In some implementations, the UI display comparison module 816 performs operations similar to those performed by the OCR 426 to analyze the response data and compare that data to known/expected response data (e.g., Expected Display Responses 832) that would be generated by a range of different set top box makes and models for a wide range of services and features in response to specific commands and command sequences. The STB control module in turn is configured to allow the user to access the services and features provided by theSTB 103 by providing access to thecorrect command sequences 836 for controlling those various services and features as if the user were doing so via an interface provided directly by theSTB 103. - The
data 220 includesOCR data 161 described above (also as extended for use by the software modules described in reference toFigures 8A-8C and methods describe in reference toFigures 9A-9B ) and command response data that includes expecteddisplay responses 832,trial command sequences 834 andcorrect command sequences 836, already described. Thedata 220 also includeslocal database information 123 that includes, but is not limited to, data related to channel lineups 280 (described in reference toFigure 2A ),channel map information 282,STB state 284,STB configuration 286, DVR data 2880, andVOD data 290. Theselocal database items 280 to 290 are described in greater detail in reference toFigure 8B . -
Figure 8B is a diagram showing additional details of thedata 220, which includesOCR data 161, command/response data 820, andlocal database data 123. Thelocal database data 123 further includes data regardingchannel lineups 280,STB state 284,STB configuration 286,DVR data 288 andVOD data 290. TheOCR data 161 is described above and the command/response data is described below, in reference toFigure 8C . Similarly, thechannel lineups data 280, which includes for the purposes of this discussion anidentity 840 of the cable or satellite service provider, is described above in reference toFigures 1-6 . Thechannel lineups 280,STB state 284,STB configuration 286,DVR data 288 andVOD data 290 include information that is relevant to and supports control by theclient device 102 of theSTB 103. Much of this information has been described with reference toFigure 7 in relation to features of theSTB 103. In some implementations, the STB state 280-3 includes amenu state 844 of theSTB 103, which includes, without limitation, an identification of the currently active STB menu and a representation of the menu structure supported by theSTB 103. TheSTB state 284 also includes an on/offdata item 846 representing the current on/off state of theSTB 103. TheSTB configuration 286 includes information related to the hardware and software configuration of theSTB 103, such whether the user prefers high definition (HD)content 848, and whichinput 850 to theSTB 103 is preferred by the user. Theclient device 102 can use this information to set the configuration of theSTB 103 when it is powered-up, or, conversely, to identify the default configuration of theSTB 103 when it is powered-up. Actual STB configuration andSTB state information client device 102 can include more or different data items than those described herein; in fact, it is intended that these data items andother data items 220 described herein are configurable as required in respective implementations to save and provide information (e.g., STB state and configuration data) that supports control of theSTB 103 by theclient device 102 and/or use of theclient device 102 for such purpose by a user. In some implementations, theDVR data 288 includes information related to recordedprograms 852 available for playback from theDVR 705 and one ormore recording schedules 854 for theDVR 705. In some implementations, theVOD data 290 includes information related to one or more video ondemand programs 862 requested by the user. By storing such information (in the cloud or locally) theclient device 102 is able to support user interaction with theSTB 103 with minimal involvement of the STB (e.g., theclient device 102 can provide user access to recorded DVR programs without the need to access a list of such programs from the STB 103). -
Figure 8C is a diagram showing additional details of the Command /Response Data 820 ofFigure 8B . This figure shows example data stored by theclient device 102 in one implementation for a set of expecteddisplay responses 832,trial command sequences 834 and correct command sequences. The trial commandssequences 834 includes a set of command sequences for a particular STB device type 830-i, where a device type is typically a combination of STB make and model. For each STB device type 830-i, the trial command sequences include a specification of a command sequence of one or more commands to access and control a particular feature type. For example,Figure 7 includes trial command sequence information for three example device types (Cable Boxes Cable Box 1, the saved command sequences 830-1 includes sequences for at least three features,Feature Types Feature Type 1 832-1 includes one command Cmd 1.1 836-1 for checking the STB On/Off state of appropriate to the make and model ofCable Box 1. Other commands sequences 836-2 and 836-3 stored forCable Box 1 device types include a sequence of commands 836-2 for Checking STB Provider (Feature Type 832-2) and a sequence of commands 836-3 for Playback DVR Recordings (Feature Type 832-3). - As described above, and further below in reference to
Figures 9A-9B , in some implementations theclient device 102 identifies correct command sequences by issuing trial command sequences to theSTB 103 and then comparing the resulting display from theSTB 103 response to a database of expectedresponses 832 to see whether there is a match between the resulting and expected display responses. Data stored for the expected display responses represent video and audio (where applicable) characteristics of text overlays and other information provided by a particular type ofSTB 103 in response to particular commands (e.g., one of the trial command sequences 834). Accordingly, in some implementations, the expecteddisplay responses 832 include, for a particular device type 850-i and featuretype 852, associated display response characteristics, such as the bounding box size coordinates 854 and associated information content 856 generated in response to the associatedcommand sequence 836. In some implementations, the content 856 represents the combination of predefined and real time content - such as the actual channel number and identifier displayed in response to an INFO command a set of features - and any associated graphics - associated with a display response to a particular command sequence). In some implementations, the bounding box coordinateinformation 854 corresponds to overlay information such as that shown inFigure 7 . For example, for theoverlays position 1,position 2 andposition 3. - The client device stores
correct command sequences 836 identified through a trial and error process as described herein - or downloaded from a server based on a determined identification of theSTB 103 type and feature set. The information stored for thecorrect command sequences 836 is comparable to the information stored for thetrial command sequences 834. For example,Figure 7 shows that information for aDevice Type 2 870-2 has been saved as a correct command sequence. In some implementations, this information would be correspond to the trial command data forDevice Type 2 830-2. Note that, in some implementations, the expecteddisplay responses 832 andtrial command sequences 834 are stored in the cloud (e.g., at a server provided by the company that sold the client device or the associated software modules).Correct command sequences 836 can also be stored in the cloud, but it is generally helpful (e.g., to allow use of the command sequences with low latency in all circumstances) to store the correct sequences locally - at the client device. Methods for employing the data and modules described herein to allow aclient device 102 to control a set-top box are now described with reference toFigures 9A and9B . -
