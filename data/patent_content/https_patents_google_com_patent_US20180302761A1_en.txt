Definitions
- the specification relates to providing recommendations for multi-party communication sessions to a user.
- Some social networks provide real-time chat services, e.g., instant messaging, video conferencing and voice chat, for communication over the Internet between at least two members of the social network.
- Users may share their views, interests, and activities via these multi-party communication sessions. They may participate in a multi-party communication session, either synchronously, in groups, to communicate in real-time (for example, to “video chat”) or to share activities (for example, to view video content), or otherwise interact with one another asynchronously in “chat” forums.
- search queries that provide results that are uninteresting or irrelevant to the user. Thus, manual searches may waste a user's time and computer resources.
- a system for recommending multi-party communication sessions to a user includes: a controller for receiving a request for a recommendation describing one or more multi-party communication sessions on a social network from a user; a user model module for retrieving user profile data for the user and for determining a user social interest model based at least in part on the user profile data; a content data module for determining one or more content identifiers associated with the multi-party communication sessions on the social network and for determining interest data describing content data associated with the one or more content identifiers; a content model module for determining one or more content models describing the content data; a determination module for determining whether a match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models and for determining the one or more multi-party communication sessions for the recommendation responsive to determining the match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models, the one or more content identifiers associated with the one or more multi-party communication sessions; and a
- another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include: receiving a request for a recommendation describing at least one communication session on a social network from a user; retrieving user profile data for the user; determining a user interest model based on the user profile data; determining at least one content identifier associated with a plurality of communication sessions on the social network; determining interest data describing content data associated with the at least one content identifier; determining at least one content model describing the content data; determining whether a match exists between the user interest model and the at least one content model; determining the at least one communication session for the recommendation responsive to determining the match exists between the user interest model and the at least one content model, wherein the at least one content identifier is associated with the at least one communication session; and transmitting the recommendation to the user.
- the operations include: receiving a social graph for the user from the social network and comparing connections in the social graph for the user and participants of the one or more multi-party communication sessions; and determining a score for the match.
- the features include: the user social interest model may include a first vector of binary values; the one or more content models may include a second vector of binary values and each binary value may correspond to an entity describing an interest; the user profile data may include a recent browsing history of the user; the content data may include one or more videos; the one or more multi-party communication sessions may include a queue of videos to be played including the one or more videos; the at least one content model is determined based at least in part on the interest data; and determining whether the match exists includes comparing connections in a social graph for the user and one or more participants of the at least one communication session.
- the technology may be particularly advantageous in a number of respects.
- the system provides recommendations to the user based on matching content associated with a multi-party communication session and a profile of a user. Therefore, the recommendations provide the user with an opportunity to participate in interesting and relevant multi-party communication sessions. Also, the user beneficially saves time by avoiding the process of manually searching for interesting multi-party communication sessions.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a recommendation system for multi-party communication sessions.

- FIGS. 4A-4D are flowcharts of another example method for recommending multi-party communication sessions.
- FIG. 5 is a graphic representation of an example user interface for recommending multi-party communication sessions.
- the system receives a request for a recommendation describing one or more multi-party communication sessions on a social network application from a user.
- the system retrieves user profile data for the user.
- the user profile data includes one or more of data describing a recent browsing history of the user, data describing a content consumption history of the user and current activity data describing a current activity of the user.
- the system determines a user social interest model for the user based at least in part on the user profile data.
- the user social interest model includes a vector of binary values, and each binary value in the vector corresponds to an entity describing an interest.
- the system determines one or more content identifiers associated with multi-party communication sessions on the social network application.
- the system determines interest data describing content data associated with the one or more content identifiers.
- the system determines one or more content models associated with the content data.
- a content model includes a vector of binary values that describe the content data.
- the system determines whether a match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models. For example, the system determines a score between the user social interest model and a first content model from the one or more content models, and determines that a match exists between the user social interest model and the first content model if the score exceeds a predetermined score threshold. Responsive to determining the match exists, the system determines one or more multi-party communication sessions to be included the recommendation based at least in part on the match, and transmits the recommendation to the user.

The GUI module 212 determines 427 the GUI that indicates no matches. The controller 202 transmits 429 the GUI that indicates no matches.
- the controller 202 does not receive a request for recommendations. Instead of the request for recommendations, the controller 202 may receive current activity data describing the user's 125 current activity. In some instances the current activity data describes a video that the user 125 may be presently watching or a website that the user 125 may be presently visiting. For example, the user 125 may be watching a video about “Indian cooking” or visiting a website about Indian recipes “Indian cooking” and the controller 202 receives current activity data describing the video that the user 125 may be presently watching or the website that the user 125 may be presently visiting.

In some instances, the determination module 210 determines multi-party communication sessions that may be viewing or sharing videos that can be similar to the video that was most recently watched by the user 125 . For example, a video may be similar if it has similar metadata (e.g., tags, etc.) to the video that was most recently watched by the user 125 .

Abstract
The disclosure includes a system and method for recommending multi-party communication sessions. The system includes: a user model module, a content model module and a determination module. The user model module determines a user social interest model based at least in part on user profile data. The content data module determines interest data describing content data associated with one or more content identifiers. The content model module determines one or more content models describing the content data. The determination module determines whether a match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models. The determination module determines the one or more multi-party communication sessions for the recommendation responsive to determining the match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models.
Description
- The specification relates to providing recommendations for multi-party communication sessions to a user.
- The popularity of electronic communications using online social networks has grown over the years. Some social networks provide real-time chat services, e.g., instant messaging, video conferencing and voice chat, for communication over the Internet between at least two members of the social network. Users may share their views, interests, and activities via these multi-party communication sessions. They may participate in a multi-party communication session, either synchronously, in groups, to communicate in real-time (for example, to “video chat”) or to share activities (for example, to view video content), or otherwise interact with one another asynchronously in “chat” forums. To find multi-party communication sessions to join, a user may use search queries that provide results that are uninteresting or irrelevant to the user. Thus, manual searches may waste a user's time and computer resources.
- According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a system for recommending multi-party communication sessions to a user includes: a controller for receiving a request for a recommendation describing one or more multi-party communication sessions on a social network from a user; a user model module for retrieving user profile data for the user and for determining a user social interest model based at least in part on the user profile data; a content data module for determining one or more content identifiers associated with the multi-party communication sessions on the social network and for determining interest data describing content data associated with the one or more content identifiers; a content model module for determining one or more content models describing the content data; a determination module for determining whether a match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models and for determining the one or more multi-party communication sessions for the recommendation responsive to determining the match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models, the one or more content identifiers associated with the one or more multi-party communication sessions; and a graphical user interface module for transmitting the recommendation to the user.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include: receiving a request for a recommendation describing at least one communication session on a social network from a user; retrieving user profile data for the user; determining a user interest model based on the user profile data; determining at least one content identifier associated with a plurality of communication sessions on the social network; determining interest data describing content data associated with the at least one content identifier; determining at least one content model describing the content data; determining whether a match exists between the user interest model and the at least one content model; determining the at least one communication session for the recommendation responsive to determining the match exists between the user interest model and the at least one content model, wherein the at least one content identifier is associated with the at least one communication session; and transmitting the recommendation to the user.
- Other aspects include corresponding methods, systems, apparatus, and computer program products for these and other innovative aspects.
- These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance, the operations include: receiving a social graph for the user from the social network and comparing connections in the social graph for the user and participants of the one or more multi-party communication sessions; and determining a score for the match. For instance, the features include: the user social interest model may include a first vector of binary values; the one or more content models may include a second vector of binary values and each binary value may correspond to an entity describing an interest; the user profile data may include a recent browsing history of the user; the content data may include one or more videos; the one or more multi-party communication sessions may include a queue of videos to be played including the one or more videos; the at least one content model is determined based at least in part on the interest data; and determining whether the match exists includes comparing connections in a social graph for the user and one or more participants of the at least one communication session.
- The technology may be particularly advantageous in a number of respects. The system provides recommendations to the user based on matching content associated with a multi-party communication session and a profile of a user. Therefore, the recommendations provide the user with an opportunity to participate in interesting and relevant multi-party communication sessions. Also, the user beneficially saves time by avoiding the process of manually searching for interesting multi-party communication sessions.
- The disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.

FIGS. 4A-4D are flowcharts of another example method for recommending multi-party communication sessions. -
FIG. 5 is a graphic representation of an example user interface for recommending multi-party communication sessions. - In some implementations, the system receives a request for a recommendation describing one or more multi-party communication sessions on a social network application from a user. The system retrieves user profile data for the user. For example, the user profile data includes one or more of data describing a recent browsing history of the user, data describing a content consumption history of the user and current activity data describing a current activity of the user. The system determines a user social interest model for the user based at least in part on the user profile data. In some implementations, the user social interest model includes a vector of binary values, and each binary value in the vector corresponds to an entity describing an interest.
- The system determines one or more content identifiers associated with multi-party communication sessions on the social network application. The system determines interest data describing content data associated with the one or more content identifiers. The system determines one or more content models associated with the content data. In some implementations, a content model includes a vector of binary values that describe the content data. The system determines whether a match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models. For example, the system determines a score between the user social interest model and a first content model from the one or more content models, and determines that a match exists between the user social interest model and the first content model if the score exceeds a predetermined score threshold. Responsive to determining the match exists, the system determines one or more multi-party communication sessions to be included the recommendation based at least in part on the match, and transmits the recommendation to the user.

FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of some instances of arecommendation system 100 for multi-party communication sessions. The illustratedrecommendation system 100 includesuser devices 115 a . . . 115 n that can be accessed by users 125 a . . . 125 n, asocial network server 101, acontent provider 118, a third-party server 142 and anasset hosting site 144. In the illustrated instance, these entities of therecommendation system 100 are communicatively coupled via anetwork 105. InFIG. 1 and the remaining figures, a letter after a reference number, e.g., “115 a,” can be a reference to the element having that particular reference number. A reference number in the text without a following letter, e.g., “115,” can be a general reference to any or all instances of the element bearing that reference number. Although only onesocial network server 101, onecontent provider 118, one third-party server 142 and oneasset hosting site 144 are illustrated, any number ofsocial network servers 101,content providers 118, third-party servers 142 andasset hosting sites 144 can be communicatively coupled to thenetwork 105. Although only two devices are illustrated, any number ofuser devices 115 n can be available to any number ofusers 125 n. Furthermore, while only onenetwork 105 is coupled to theuser devices 115 a . . 115 n, thesocial network server 101, thecontent provider 118, the third-party server 142 and theasset hosting site 144, any number ofnetworks 105 can be connected to theuser devices 115 a . . 115 n, thesocial network server 101, thecontent provider 118, the third-party server 142 and theasset hosting site 144. - The
network 105 can be a conventional type, wired or wireless, and may have numerous different configurations including a star configuration, token ring configuration or other configurations. Furthermore, thenetwork 105 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet), and/or other interconnected data paths across which multiple devices may communicate. In some instances, thenetwork 105 may be a peer-to-peer network. Thenetwork 105 may also be coupled to or includes portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. In some instances, thenetwork 105 includes Bluetooth communication networks or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data including via short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, WAP, email, etc. - In some instances, a
recommendation module 199 may be operable on thesocial network server 101, which is communicatively coupled to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 132. Thesocial network server 101 can be a hardware server that includes a processor, a memory and network communication capabilities. In some instances, thesocial network server 101 sends and receives data to and from one or more of the user devices 115, thecontent provider 118, the third-party server 142 and theasset hosting site 144 via thenetwork 105. Thesocial network server 101 includes asocial network application 109 and a social graph (not pictured). Thesocial network application 109 stores explicitly defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users as a social graph. In some examples, the social graph can reflect a mapping of these users and how they can be related. Furthermore, thesocial network server 101 and thesocial network application 109 may be representative of one social network and that there may be multiple social networks coupled to thenetwork 105, each having its own server, application and social graph. For example, a first social network may be directed to business networking, a second may be directed to or centered on academics, a third may be directed to local business, a fourth may be directed to dating and others may be of general interest or a specific focus. - In some instances, the
social network application 109 manages multi-party communication sessions. Thesocial network application 109 allows multiple users 125 to communicate in multi-party communication sessions. For example, participants of the multi-party communication session can be all connected to thesocial network server 101, which may be a central server. In some instances, a multi-party communication session uses peer-to-peer communication. - In one instance, the multi-party communication session includes a primary user (e.g., a moderator) and one or more secondary users and allows the users 125 to communicate with one another. In one instance, communication between one or more users 125 can be unilateral. For example, a user 125 in the multi-party communication session may see and/or hear the other participants in the multi-party communication session, but the user 125 may not be seen and/or heard by the other users 125. In one instance, a multi-party communication session can be public allowing any user 125 to join the multi-party communication session. In other instances, a multi-party communication session can be private. A private multi-party communication session may require an invitation for a user 125 to join the private multi-party communication sessions. In some instances, a user 125 must be logged-in (e.g., logged into the social network server 101) in order to join a multi-party communication session.
- A multi-party communication session allows for one or more of audio and visual communication. Examples of a multi-party communication session include but are not limited to one or more of a chat session, voice conference, video conference, etc. In one instance, a multi-party communication session displays video or other representations of participating users 125. In one such instance, the multi-party communication session includes both audio and video communication. It will be realized that the preceding are merely examples of multi-party communications sessions and that other examples exist.
- In some instances, multimedia content can be consumed by participants during a multi-party communication session. For example, the participants may share or view content such as videos, photos, images, music, the text of present or past chat sessions, etc. during the multi-party communication session. The content can include any other type of content capable of being hosted by the
asset hosting site 144. In some instances, theasset hosting site 144 may provide the multimedia content consumed during the multi-party communication session. In some instances, thecontent provider 118 may provide the multimedia content consumed during the multi-party communication session. - In some instances, the
social network application 109 provides multi-party communication session data describing multi-party communication sessions managed by thesocial network application 109. For example, the multi-party communication session data may include a description, a name, a list of participants, a session type (e.g., chat session, voice conference, video conference), a privacy type (e.g., public, private), a status (e.g., in progress, scheduled for a future time) and/or associated content data. In some instances, the associated content data includes one or more identifiers that identify the content. The identifiers may identify content or assets hosted byasset hosting site 144. In some instances, the identifiers may be stored in theasset database 116. The identifiers may be associated with the content stored on theasset database 116. For example, the identifiers identify a video, image, music file or any other content and an association between the identifiers and the content they point to can be stored on theasset database 116. - The
asset hosting site 144 can be any system that allows a user 125 to access an intellectual property asset via searching and/or browsing interfaces. Theasset hosting site 144 can be a hardware server that includes a processor, a memory and network communication capabilities. It will be understood that the term “web site” represents any computer system adapted to serve content using any internet working protocols, and is not intended to be limited to content uploaded or downloaded via the Internet or the HTTP protocol. - In one instance, the
asset hosting site 144 can be configured to receive and share all or a portion of an intellectual property asset. Examples of an intellectual property asset include, but are not limited to: a video; one or more songs; a video game; a book; etc. An intellectual property asset can be represented in any media type and/or file type. For example, theasset hosting site 144 shares content, e.g., a video file, an audio file (e.g., one or more songs), a file that includes a combination of video and audio, an image file including a JPEG or GIF file, a file including a video game program, a text file. An intellectual property asset is referred to as “an asset” hereinafter. - In one instance, sources of assets provided by the
asset hosting site 144 are from uploads of assets by users 125, searches or crawls of other web sites or databases of assets, or the like, or any combination thereof. For example, in one instance, anasset hosting site 144 can be configured to allow uploads of assets by users 125. In some instances, theasset hosting site 144 can be configured to only obtain assets from other sources by crawling such sources or searching such sources in real time. - The
asset hosting site 144 is communicatively coupled to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 139. In the illustrated instance, theasset hosting site 144 includes: afront end interface 102; anasset serving module 104; anasset search module 106; an uploadserver 108; apresentation module 110; athumbnail generator 112; auser database 114; and anasset database 116. In some instances, therecommendation module 199 may be operable on theasset hosting site 144. In one instance, the components of theasset hosting site 144 are communicatively coupled to one another. For example, they are communicatively coupled to one another via a bus (not pictured). Other conventional features (e.g., firewalls, load balancers, authentication servers, application servers, failover servers, site management tools) are not shown so as not to obscure the feature of the system. - In one instance, the illustrated components of the
asset hosting site 144 can be implemented as single pieces of software or hardware or as multiple pieces of software or hardware. In general, functions described in one instance as being performed by one component, can also be performed by other components in other instances, or by a combination of components. Furthermore, functions described in one instance as being performed by components of theasset hosting site 144 can be performed by one or more user devices 115 in other instances if appropriate. In one instance, the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. - The
front end interface 102 can be an interface that handles communication with one or more of thecontent provider 118, the user device 115, thesocial network server 101 and the third-party server 142 via thenetwork 105. For example, thefront end interface 102 receives an asset uploaded from thecontent provider 118 and delivers the asset to the uploadserver 108. In one instance, thefront end interface 102 receives requests from users 125 of the user devices 115 and delivers the requests to the other components of the asset hosting site 144 (e.g., theasset search module 106 or the asset serving module 104). For example, the asset can be a video and thefront end interface 102 receives a video search query from a user 125 and sends the video search query to theasset search module 106. - The upload
server 108 receives one or more assets from thecontent provider 118 via thefront end interface 102. For example, the uploadserver 108 receives one or more of a video file, an audio file (e.g., one or more songs), a file that includes a combination of video and audio, an image file including a JPEG or GIF file, a file including a video game program and/or a text file from thecontent provider 118. In one instance, the uploadserver 108 processes the one or more assets and stores the processed assets in theasset database 116. The uploadserver 108 assigns an asset identification (“asset ID”) to the stored asset. In some instances, an asset ID may be referred to as a content identifier. An asset ID includes identifiers for videos (“video ID”), songs (“song ID”), images (“image ID”), video games (“video game ID”) and books (“book ID”). For example, the uploadserver 108 assigns a video ID to a video and stores the video together with the video ID in theasset database 116. In other instances, the uploadserver 108 performs one or more of: formatting an asset; compressing an asset; metadata tagging an asset; content analysis, etc. - The
asset database 116 can be a storage system that stores assets shared by theasset hosting site 144 with the users 125. In one instance, theasset database 116 stores the assets processed by the uploadserver 108. In some instances, theasset database 116 also stores metadata associated with the assets. The metadata includes one or more of: a title; a description; tag information; a time length; and the like. In one instance, some or all of the metadata of the assets can be provided by thecontent provider 118. For example, a user of thecontent provider 118 provides a title and a description of an asset when uploading the asset to theasset hosting site 144. - In some instances, the
asset database 116 stores user-generated content. The content may be generated by user 125 while participating in a multi-party communication session. For example, the content may be text during a text chat between users 125. In another example, the content may be text from a voice or video chat between users 125. A speech-to-text system may generate the text by parsing the voice or video chat. In another example, the content may be content shared between users 125. The users 125 may share photos, music, links, etc, during the multi-party communication session. The user-generated content may be any content generated by a user 125. The uploadserver 108 may assign an asset identification (“asset ID”) to each user-generated content. - The
asset search module 106 includes code and routines that, when executed by a processor (not pictured), processes any search queries received by thefront end interface 102 from users 125. A search query received by thefront end interface 102 from a user 125 includes search criteria including keywords that identify an asset the user 125 can be interested in. Theasset search module 106 uses the search criteria to query the metadata of the asset stored in theasset database 116. The search results for the query can be returned to thefront end interface 102 for presentation to the user 125. For example, if a user 125 provides thefront end interface 102 with a keyword search query, theasset search module 106 identifies an asset stored in theasset database 116 related to the keyword and returns the search result (e.g., asset IDs and/or metadata including titles, descriptions, thumbnails of the identified assets) to thefront end interface 102. - The
asset serving module 104 includes code and routines that, when executed by a processor (not pictured), processes requests for an asset (e.g., a video, a book, a picture, a music file) and provides the asset to users 125. For example, theasset serving module 104 receives a query from a user 125 via thefront end interface 102, retrieves a set of videos from theasset database 116 based at least in part on the query and presents the set of videos to the user 125 via thefront end interface 102. - In one instance, the
asset serving module 104 receives a request from a user 125 to access an asset when the user 125 clicks on a link to the asset. The request received from the user 125 includes the asset ID of the asset that the user 125 wishes to access. In one instance, the asset ID can be included automatically in the request once the user 125 clicks on the link for the asset. Theasset serving module 104 uses the asset ID to search and locate the asset in theasset database 116. Once the requested asset can be located, theasset serving module 104 transmits the asset to the user 125 via thefront end interface 102. The asset can be presented to the user 125 on a web page. Metadata associated with the asset can also be presented with the asset, e.g., the title and description of the asset. In one instance, theasset serving module 104 stores the asset ID of the asset in theuser database 114 after sending the asset to the user 125 so that an asset history of the user 125 can be stored in theuser database 114. - The
user database 114 can be a storage system that stores data and/or information associated with a user 125. For example, theuser database 114 stores the asset IDs of assets uploaded by a user 125 to theasset hosting site 144 and the asset IDs of assets that the user 125 has accessed from theasset database 116. In one instance, the user 125 can be identified by using a login name and password and/or by using the user's internet protocol address. - The
thumbnail generator 112 includes code and routines that generates a thumbnail for an asset. A thumbnail can be a picture that represents an asset in theasset hosting site 144. For example, assume the asset can be a video. Thethumbnail generator 112 analyzes the video and selects a frame of the video as the thumbnail. In one instance, thethumbnail generator 112 provides one or more pictures for the video and the user 125 uploading the video to theasset hosting site 144 selects one picture as the thumbnail. - The
presentation module 110 includes code and routines that, when executed by a processor (not pictured), presents any information intended for a user 125 to a corresponding client device, e.g., the user device 115. For example, thepresentation module 110 generates a graphic associated with the assets stored in theasset database 116. Thepresentation module 110 sends the graphic to a browser application (not pictured) installed in the user device 115 via thefront end interface 102 and thenetwork 105. - The
content provider 118 can be any device that provides assets to theasset hosting site 144. For example, thecontent provider 118 can be a computing device that uploads an asset to theasset hosting site 144. Thecontent provider 118 is communicatively coupled to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 138. In one instance, thecontent provider 118 can be also a user device 115. In some instances, thecontent provider 118 can be the same entity that operates theasset hosting site 144. - In one instance, the
content provider 118 can be configured to operate a client device to perform various content provider functions. Examples of the content provider functions include, but are not limited to: uploading an asset to theasset hosting site 144; editing an asset stored by theasset hosting site 144; removing an asset from theasset hosting site 144; and editing content provider preferences associated with an asset. - The

In the illustrated instance, the user 125 a interacts with theuser device 115 a viasignal line 131. Theuser 125 n interacts with theuser device 115 n. - In some instances, the
recommendation module 199 acts in part as a thin-client application that may be stored on theuser devices social network server 101, the third-party server 142 and theasset hosting site 144. In other instances, the user device 115 includes a browser application (not shown). Therecommendation module 199 may be extensible code stored and executed by the browser application. For example, therecommendation module 199 may be stored in a cache of the browser application. A processor of the user device 115 (not pictured) may execute therecommendation module 199. - In some instances, the
recommendation module 199 may be stored on a third-party server 142, which is communicatively coupled to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 134. In some instances, the third-party server 142 can be a hardware server that includes a processor, a memory and network communication capabilities. The third-party server 142 sends and receives data to and from other entities of therecommendation system 100 via thenetwork 105. - In some instances, the
recommendation module 199 receives a request for a recommendation describing one or more multi-party communication sessions on asocial network application 109 from a user 125. Therecommendation module 199 retrieves user profile data for the user 125. Therecommendation module 199 determines a user social interest model based at least in part on the user profile data. In some instances, the user social interest model includes a vector of binary values. For example, each binary value in the vector corresponds to an entity describing an interest. - The
recommendation module 199 determines one or more content identifiers associated with multi-party communication sessions on thesocial network application 109. Therecommendation module 199 determines interest data describing content data associated with the one or more content identifiers. Therecommendation module 199 determines one or more content models describing the content data. In some instances, a content model includes a vector of binary values that describe the content data. Therecommendation module 199 determines whether a match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models. Therecommendation module 199 determines one or more multi-party communication sessions for the recommendation responsive to determining the match exists. Therecommendation module 199 transmits the recommendation to the user 125. Therecommendation module 199 is described below in more detail with reference toFIGS. 2-5 . - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , an example of therecommendation module 199 is shown in more detail.FIG. 2 is a block diagram of acomputing device 200 that includes arecommendation module 199, aprocessor 235, amemory 237 and astorage 243. The components of thecomputing device 200 are communicatively coupled by abus 220. In some instances, thecomputing device 200 can be one of asocial network server 101, a user device 115, anasset hosting site 144 and a third-party server 142. - The
processor 235 includes an arithmetic logic unit, a microprocessor, a general purpose controller or some other processor array to perform computations and provide electronic display signals to a display device. Theprocessor 235 is coupled to thebus 220 for communication with the other components viasignal line 236.Processor 235 processes data signals and may include various computing architectures including a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, or an architecture implementing a combination of instruction sets. AlthoughFIG. 2 includes asingle processor 235,multiple processors 235 may be included. Other processors, operating systems, sensors, displays and physical configurations can be possible. - The
memory 237 stores instructions and/or data that may be executed by theprocessor 235. Thememory 237 is coupled to thebus 220 for communication with the other components viasignal line 238. The instructions and/or data may include code for performing the techniques described herein. Thememory 237 may be a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, a static random access memory (SRAM) device, flash memory or some other memory device. In some instances, thememory 237 also includes a non-volatile memory or similar permanent storage device and media including a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM device, a DVD-ROM device, a DVD-RAM device, a DVD-RW device, a flash memory device, or some other mass storage device for storing information on a more permanent basis. - The
storage 243 can be a non-transitory memory that stores data for providing the functionality described herein. Thestorage 243 is communicatively coupled to thebus 220 viasignal line 240. Thestorage 243 may be a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, a static random access memory (SRAM) device, flash memory or some other memory devices. In some instances, thestorage 243 also includes a non-volatile memory or similar permanent storage device and media including a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM device, a DVD-ROM device, a DVD-RAM device, a DVD-RW device, a flash memory device, or some other mass storage device for storing information on a more permanent basis. - In some instances, the
storage 243 stores user profile data describing one or more user profiles upon consent of users 125. In some instances, the user profile data may include profile information of user 125 from thesocial network application 109. For example, profile information may include a description of the following information for the user 125: employment information, education, places lived, age, relationship status, gender, interests, a description of the most recent video watched by the user 125, etc. In some instances, the user profile data may describe social network data of user 125 from thesocial network application 109. For example, the social network data may include search history, comments, posts, acknowledgments, browsing history, etc. In another example, the social network data may include content consumption history, content uploaded, channel subscriptions, etc. In some instances, thestorage 243 stores social graph data. Social graph data can include data describing the social graph for a user 125. For example, the social graph can be a social graph associated with thesocial network application 109. In some examples, the social graph can reflect a mapping of users 125 and how they can be related. - In some instances, the
storage 243 stores a user social interest model for a user 125. The user social interest model may be data describing the interests of the user 125. For example, the user social interest model may be a vector of binary values describing interests of the user 125. In some instances, the user social interest model can be based on profile information for the user 125 that describes the most recent video watched by the user 125. For example, the user 125 watches a video describing a Indian cooking recipe, and the user social interest model indicates that the user 125 can be interested in multi-party communication sessions related to Indian cooking recipes since that can be the most recent video watched by the user 125. - In some instances, the
storage 243 stores multi-party communication session data describing one or more multi-party communication sessions. For example, the multi-party communication session data may include a description, a name, a list of participants, a session type (e.g., chat session, voice conference, video conference), a privacy type (e.g., public, private), a status (e.g., in progress, scheduled for a future time) and/or associated content data for a multi-party communication session. In some instances, the associated content data includes one or more content identifiers that identify the content (e.g., a video, picture, text describing a chat between two or more users 125, etc.) that can be an element of the multi-party communication session. For example, a content identifier may be an asset ID described inFIG. 1 . - Assume, for example, that two users 125 may be engaged in a multi-party communication session. The two users 125 may be communicating by a video chat, voice chat, text chat, etc. The users 125 may be chatting while watching a video of a movie. Here, the movie may be the content. For example, the two users 125 may be engaged in a first multi-party communication session in which the users 125 may be watching a video related to the Republican National Convention. The two users 125 may provide comments to each other via text, voice, video, etc. For example, a user 125 may say verbally that she disagrees with a statement by a presidential candidate viewed by the user 125 from the video. The verbal comment made by the user 125 can be converted to text by the
asset hosting site 144, and this text can also be content associated with the multi-party communication session that can be used to determine whether to recommend the first multi-party communication session to another user 125 that has requested a recommendation for a multi-party communication to join. This concept is described in more detail below with reference to “user-generated data.” Similarly, one of the users 125 can make a comment about the video via a chat input. For example, the user 125 types “Wow, that candidate has an interesting idea; I'm not sure if I agree with it, but it is interesting.” The text of this chat can also be content associated with the multi-party communication session that can be used to determine whether to recommend the multi-party communication session to another user 125 that has requested a recommendation for a multi-party communication to join. This concept is described in more detail below with reference to “user-generated data.” - In some instances, the
storage 243 stores interest data describing the content data (e.g., videos, music, photos, books, etc). For example, thestorage 243 stores metadata associated with the content. The metadata may include one or more of: a title; a description; tag information; a time length, etc. In some instances, the interest data includes comments or acknowledgments by users 125 associated with the content. - In some instances, the interest data may be user-generated data. The content may be generated by user 125 while participating in a multi-party communication session. For example, during a chat between two users 125, the two users 125 may communicate the words or phrase “Republican National Convention” a number of times. Because the phrase “Republican National Convention” was used by the two users 125, the metadata describing the text or chat may include the description “Republican National Convention.” In some instances, the two users 125 may share links with each other during a multi-party session. For example, a user 125 may share a link to a newspaper article related to the Republican National Convention. Because the newspaper article is related to the Republican National Convention, the metadata describing the link shared by user 125 may include the description “Republican National Convention.”
- The
storage 243 may store content models describing content data associated with multi-party communication sessions. In some instances, thestorage 243 may store a vector of binary values describing the content data. For example, each binary value corresponds to an entity describing the content data. For example, an entity may be a portion of the title or description of a video. In another example, the entity may be a description of text communicated by users 125 in the multi-party communication session. - In some instances, the
storage 243 stores graphical data describing a user interface for displaying recommendations to a user 125.

recommendation module 199 includes: acontroller 202, auser model module 204, acontent data module 206, acontent model module 208, adetermination module 210 and aGUI module 212. These components of the recommendation module are communicatively coupled to each other via thebus 220. - The
controller 202 can be software including routines for handling communications between therecommendation module 199, other components of thecomputing device 200 and other entities of therecommendation system 100. In some instances, thecontroller 202 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for handling communications between therecommendation module 199, other components of thecomputing device 200 and other entities of therecommendation system 100. In some other instances, thecontroller 202 can be stored in thememory 237 of thecomputing device 200 and can be accessible and executable by theprocessor 235. Thecontroller 202 may be adapted for cooperation and communication with theprocessor 235 and other components of thecomputing device 200 viasignal line 222. - The
controller 202 handles communication between therecommendation module 199, other components of thecomputing device 200 and other entities of therecommendation system 100. For example, thecontroller 202 receives a request for a recommendation describing one or more multi-party communication sessions on asocial network application 109 from a user 125. In some instances, the request may be a one-time request. For example, the user 125 requests recommendations available at the time of the request. In some instances, the request may be a recurring request. For example, the user 125 requests recommendations at periodic times in the future. In some instances, the request may be scheduled to provide the recommendation at a specific date and time. In another example, thecontroller 202 receives graphical data for providing a user interface to a user 125 from theGUI module 212 and sends the graphical data to a user device 115, causing the user device 115 to present the user interface to the user 125. - In some instances, the
controller 202 receives data from other components of therecommendation module 199 and stores the data in thestorage 243. For example, thecontroller 202 receives a user social interest model from theuser model module 204. Thecontroller 202 stores the user social interest model in thestorage device 243. In some instances, thecontroller 202 retrieves data from thestorage device 243 and sends the data to components of therecommendation module 199. For example, thecontroller 202 retrieves user profile data from thestorage device 243 and sends the data to theuser model module 204. - The
user model module 204 can be software including routines for determining user social interest models. In some instances, theuser model module 204 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for determining user social interest models.

user model module 204 retrieves user profile data for a user 125. In one instance, theuser model module 204 receives user profile data from asocial network application 109. For example, theuser model module 204 may receive profile information of user 125 from thesocial network application 109 via thecontroller 202. The profile information may include a description, employment information, education, places lived, age, relationship status, gender, interests, etc. In some instances, the user profile data may include social network data of user 125 from thesocial network application 109. For example, the social network data may include search history, comments, posts, acknowledgments, browsing history, etc. The acknowledgments can be a positive or negative endorsement. - In some instances, the social network data may include content consumption history, content uploaded, channel subscriptions, etc. For example, the
user model module 204 receives data describing consumption history, content uploaded or channels subscribed to by user 125 from theasset hosting site 144 via thenetwork 105. In some instances, theuser model module 204 retrieves the asset history for a user 125 from theasset hosting site 144 stored inuser database 114. In some instances, theuser model module 204 stores the user profile data for the user 125 instorage 243. - In some instances, the
user model module 204 receives the most recent content consumed by a user 125. The most recent content consumed by the user 125 may be a video viewed by user 125. For example, the user 125 may have most recently viewed a video related to the Republican National Convention. In some instances, the most recent content consumed by the user 125 may be a website or a webpage that user 125 may be visiting. For example, the user 125 may be viewing a blog or a forum related to Indian cooking. In some instances, the most recent content consumed by the user 125 may be a multi-party communication session that the user 125 participated in. For example, the user 125 participated in a multi-party communication session having a topic related to the Republican National Convention. The most recent content consumed can be any content, e.g., a song, a photo, a newspaper article, a blog, a video game, etc. - In some instances, the
user model module 204 receives data describing user-generated data. The user 125 may have participated in a multi-party communication session that the participants talked or chatted about a topic. For example, the topic may be related to the Republican National Convention. Theuser model module 204 receives data describing this user-generated data. In another example, during the multi-party communication session, the user 125 may have shared a link with another user 125 for news articles related to the Republican National Convention. This may also be user generated data that is communicated to theuser model module 204. Theuser model module 204 then generates a user social interest model based at least in part on the user generated data. The user model can be generated by theuser model module 204 based on additional data including, for example, the social graph data for the user 125. - In some instances, the
user model module 204 receives social graph data for user 125 fromsocial network application 109. Social graph data can include data describing the social graph for a user 125. For example, the social graph may be a social graph associated with thesocial network application 109. In some instances, theuser model module 204 stores the social graph data instorage 243. - The
user model module 204 determines a user social interest model for user 125. In some instances, theuser model module 204 determines the user social interest model describing interests of the user 125. For example, the user social interest model may be a vector of binary values. Each binary may correspond to an entity describing an interest of user 125. For example, the user 125 may have an interest in Indian cooking and the user social interest model indicates that the user 125 may be interested in Indian cooking or any other related topic. Theuser model module 204 may determine the user social interest model based at least in part on the user profile data. For example, theuser model module 204 may determine an interest of user 125 based at least in part on the profile information for user 125 from thesocial network application 109. In another example, theuser model module 204 may determine an interest of the user 125 based at least in part on a post, a comment or an acknowledgement by the user 125 onsocial network application 109. In another example, theuser model module 204 may determine an interest of the user 125 based at least in part on a past query or recent browsing history by user 125. Theuser model module 204 may determine an interest based at least in part on content consumption history, content uploaded or channels subscribed to by user 125. Theuser model module 204 may store the user social interest model instorage 243. In some instances, theuser model module 204 determines an interest of the user 125 based on the most recent content consumed by a user 125. The most recent content consumed by user 125 may be a video, a website, a song, a photo, a newspaper article, a blog, a video game, a multi-party communication session etc. For example, the user 125 most recently visited a blog related to Indian cooking. In some instances, theuser model module 204 determines that the user 125 may have an interest in Indian cooking based only on the most recent activity for the user 125 being that the user 125 visited the blog related to Indian cooking. Before the user 125 visited the blog, there may be nothing in the user profile data of user 125 to indicate that the user 125 may have an interest in Indian cooking. Therefore, theuser model module 204 can determine new and recent interests of the user 125 and therecommendation module 199 can recommend a multi-party communication session for the user 125 based on this recent interest. - The
content data module 206 can be software including routines for determining interest data describing content data associated with multi-party communication sessions. In some instances, thecontent data module 206 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for determining interest data describing content data associated with multi-party communication sessions. In some other instances, thecontent data module 206 can be stored in thememory 237 of thecomputing device 200 and can be accessible and executable by theprocessor 235.

content data module 206 determines interest data describing content data associated with the content identifiers. In some instances, thecontent data module 206 retrieves the interest data fromasset hosting site 144. For example, thecontent data module 206 retrieves the interest data fromasset hosting site 144 via thecontroller 202 andnetwork 105. In some instances, thecontent data module 206 sends a request toasset hosting site 144 that includes the content identifiers. Theasset hosting site 144 may transmit metadata describing the content data to thecontent data module 206 via thecontroller 202 andnetwork 105. The metadata may include one or more of: a title; a description; tag information; a time length, etc. In some instances, the interest data includes comments or acknowledgments associated with the content. Thecontent data module 206 may store the interest data instorage 243. In one example, content may be a video and the metadata includes the description “Republican National Convention.” In another example, the content may be text communicated during a multi-party communication session. The metadata describing the text may include a description “Republican National Convention” based on a user 125 communicating the phrase “Republican National Convention” during the multi-party communication session. The interest data may include “Republican National Convention” based on the video and text. - The
content model module 208 can be software including routines for determining content models describing content. In some instances, thecontent model module 208 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for determining content models describing content. In some other instances, thecontent model module 208 can be stored in thememory 237 of thecomputing device 200 and can be accessible and executable by theprocessor 235. Thecontent model module 208 may be adapted for cooperation and communication with theprocessor 235 and other components of thecomputing device 200 viasignal line 228. - The
content model module 208 determines content models describing content. In some instances, thecontent model module 208 determines the content models based at least in part on the interest data. In some instances, thecontent model module 208 determines one or more content models based on data describing videos associated with the multi-party communication sessions. For example, the two users 125 may have viewed a video during a multi-party communication session related to the Republican National Convention and the content models can be generated based at least in part on this video. In some instances, thecontent model module 208 determines one or more content models based on metadata describing the text of a chat communicated between the two users 125. The metadata describing the text may be a description “Republican National Convention” and the content model may be generated based at least in part on this description. - In some instances, the content model may be a vector of binary values describing the content data. Each binary value corresponds to an entity describing the content. For example, a description of a video (e.g., Republican National Convention) may be an entity. In another example, a description of a text (e.g., Republican National Convention) may be an entity. The
content model module 208 may store the one or more content models instorage 243. - The
determination module 210 can be software including routines for determining recommendations. In some instances, thedetermination module 210 can be a set of instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below for determining recommendations.

determination module 210 determines whether a match exists between the user social interest model and the one or more content models. In some instances, thedetermination module 210 compares the user social interest model and the one or more content models. For example, theuser model module 204 determines a vector of binary values for the user social interest model. Thecontent model module 208 determines a vector of binary values for the one or more content models. Thedetermination module 210 compares the vector of binary values for the user social interest model and the vector of binary values for the one or more content models. Thedetermination module 210 may determine a match exists based at least in part on a number of entities in each vector that are the same. For example, both vectors may include two entities labeled “College X” and “College Football.” In some instances, thedetermination module 210 may determine a match exists based at least in part on a number of entities in each vector that may be similar. For example, one vector may include an entity labeled tagged “politics” and the other vector may include an entity tagged “Indian recipes.” In some instances, thedetermination module 210 determines a match exists based at least in part on comparing connections in the social graph for user 125 and the participants of a multi-party communication session. For example, thedetermination module 210 determines the number of connections for a user 125 included in a list of participants associated with a multi-party communication session. Therefore, thedetermination module 210 can determine multi-party communication sessions having participants familiar to user 125. - In some instances, the interest of the user 125 may be only based on the most recent content consumed by a user 125. Therefore, the match may be based on recent or new interests of the user 125. The user 125 may have most recently visited an Indian cooking blog. However, before the visit, nothing in the user profile data of user 125 may indicate an interest in Indian cooking. Therefore, the
recommendation module 199 may provide recommendations based on recent and new interests of user 125. - In some instances, the
determination module 210 determines a score for the match between the user social interest model and the one or more content models. For example, the score may be based at least in part on the number of same entities in the vectors, the number of similar entities in the vectors or the number of connections for user 125 included in the list of participants associated with a multi-party communication session. In some instances, thedetermination module 210 determines a match exists based at least in part on the score. For example, thedetermination module 210 determines a match exists based at least in part on the score exceeding a predetermined score threshold. - The
determination module 210 determines one or more multi-party communication sessions for the recommendation. In some instances, thedetermination module 210 determines the multi-party communication sessions based on the match between the user social interest model and the content models. Thedetermination module 210 may determine the multi-party communication sessions for the recommendation based on the content models describing the content or videos. The content may be associated with the multi-party communication sessions for the recommendation. In some instances, the recommendations may be determined based on the trend in popularity of a topic associated with each multi-party communication session at the time of the request.

TheGUI module 212 determines 427 the GUI that indicates no matches. Thecontroller 202 transmits 429 the GUI that indicates no matches. - In some instances, at least a part of the
recommendation module 199 may be stored and executed by anasset hosting site 144. In some instances, thecontroller 202 does not receive a request for recommendations. Instead of the request for recommendations, thecontroller 202 may receive current activity data describing the user's 125 current activity. In some instances the current activity data describes a video that the user 125 may be presently watching or a website that the user 125 may be presently visiting. For example, the user 125 may be watching a video about “Indian cooking” or visiting a website about Indian recipes “Indian cooking” and thecontroller 202 receives current activity data describing the video that the user 125 may be presently watching or the website that the user 125 may be presently visiting. Theuser model module 204 determines the user social interest model based at least in part on the current activity data, i.e., theuser model module 204 determines the user social interest model based on the video that the user 125 may be presently watching or a website that the user 125 may be presently visiting. For example, the user social interest model may be determined based on current activity data indicating that the user 125 may be presently watching a video about “Indian cooking” or may be visiting a website about Indian recipes. Thedetermination module 210 may determine one or more multi-party communication sessions to recommend to the user 125 based at least in part on the current activity data. Thus, in some instances therecommendation module 199 can recommend multi-party communication sessions to the user 125 without receiving a request for recommendations. - In some instances, the
user model module 204 determines the user social interest model based on a description of the most recent video watched by the user 125. For example, the user 125 watches a video describing an Indian cooking recipe, and the user social interest model indicates that the user 125 may be interested in multi-party communication sessions related to Indian cooking recipes since that may be the most recent video watched by the user 125. In some instances, thedetermination module 210 determines multi-party communication sessions that may be viewing or sharing videos that can be similar to the video that was most recently watched by the user 125. For example, a video may be similar if it has similar metadata (e.g., tags, etc.) to the video that was most recently watched by the user 125. In some instances, the similarity of the video may be determined based on comments left for the videos. In some instances, thedetermination module 210 determines multi-party communication sessions having content data related to the video most recently watched by the user 125 based on data generated as a result of speech-to-text conversion for conversation in a multi-party communication session. For example, in a multi-party communication session, two users 125 may discuss Indian cooking which can be related to the video's topic “Indian recipes.” Thedetermination module 210 may be configured to determine that videos can be similar in other ways. -
