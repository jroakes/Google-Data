Definitions
- This application generally relates to systems and methods for generating and providing different length versions of a video.
- Watching television is a leisure activity many people around the world routinely engage in.
- the notion of turning on the TV and having regularly scheduled content ready to digest is both relaxing and predictable.
- broadcast media content is generally provided to viewers at a fixed length which is predefined by the content itself, the broadcast networks and supplementary advertising media. Due to a general level of inflexibility associated with traditional broadcast television with respect to selecting which shows to watch, when to watch them and how long to watch them, current and future generations of viewers are turning to online video streaming services.
- online video streaming services allow users to select from a variety of media content for viewing on demand. Further with the ubiquitous nature of media creation and publishing tools, individuals are able to become productive content creators. This has resulted in exponential growth of available streaming media content. In order to increase viewership and continue to draw viewers away from conventional broadcast media, these online video streaming services are constantly seeking mechanisms to provide viewers with media consumption options that are tailored to user's individual needs and that capitalize on flexibility and media viewing control options that originally incentivized viewers to turn to online video streaming services.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system for generating and providing different length versions of a video in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein;
- FIG. 2 presents an example user interface displaying videos provided by a media provider with options to select different length versions of the respective videos for playback at client device in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein;

- FIG. 12 is a schematic block diagram of a sample-computing environment in accordance with various aspects and embodiments.
- the subject matter described in this disclosure relates to systems and methods for generating and providing different length versions of a video.
- users have various windows of time to view videos that are available on demand, such as videos provided by an online media provider.
- videos may pass over watching a video that is longer than a current window of viewing time available to the user.
- the subject matter described in this disclosure therefore provides systems and methods for generating different length versions of a video and making these different length versions of the video available for streaming to users so that the users can select a version of the video for viewing that is suitable to them based on a current amount of time they would like to devote to watching the video.
- a video streaming system configured to provide on demand streaming video to users via a network can automatically generate different length versions of a video provided by the video streaming system. For example, for a video that is 37 minutes in length, the video streaming system can generate a version of the video that is 5 minutes in length, 10 minutes in length and 20 minutes in length. The video streaming system can further make these different length versions of the video available to viewers in addition to the original video. For example, a video can be presented to users with the option to select one of the different length versions of the video for viewing (e.g., the original 37 minute version, the 5 minute version, the 10 minute version, or the 20 minute version).
- the video streaming system can systematically summarize the video source file and generate a ‘cliffs notes’ version of the source file with summaries of the content included in respective segments of the video. Using the summarized video content, the system can automatically edit the video to include or exclude different segments of the video and generate different length versions of the video.
- the user when coming across the video while navigating the video streaming system via a user interface configured by the video streaming system (e.g., a website platform or application platform), the user can be provided with the option to choose which length version of the video to watch.
- the uploader of the video can facilitate choosing which segments of the video to include/exclude in different length versions of the video.
- the uploader can also provide input regarding the number of different length versions to create and desired durations of the different length versions of the video (e.g., for a 30 the uploader can request that the video streaming system generate a 5 minute version, a 10 minute version, and a 15 minute version).
- the video streaming system can create an edited version of the video fitting an amount of time provided by the viewer in association with a request to watch the video. For example, a user can find a 30 minute video and request to watch a 7.5 minute version of the video. In response to the request, the video streaming system can create the 7.5 minute version of the video on the fly and provide it to the user for viewing.
- a system in one or more aspects, includes an analysis component configured to analyze a video and generate summaries of content included in respective segments of the video.
- the system further includes a summary component configured to generate shortened versions of the video having durations less than the duration of the video based in part on the summaries of the content included in the respective segments of the video, wherein the video is made available for streaming in association with an option to select the video or one of the shortened versions.
- a method in another aspect, includes using a processor to execute computer executable instructions stored in a memory to perform acts including generating summaries of content included in respective segments of a video, and receiving a request to play a shortened version of the video, the request including a desired length of the shortened version of the video.
- the acts further include generating the shortened version of the video having the desired length in response to the request based in part on the summaries of the content included in the respective segments of the video, and streaming the shortened version of the video to a device associated with the request.
- tangible computer-readable storage medium comprising computer-readable instructions that, in response to execution, cause a computing system to perform various operations.
- the operations include at least, generating summaries of content included in respective segments of the video, and generating shortened versions of the video having durations less than the duration of the video based in part on the summaries of the content included in the respective segments of the video, wherein the video is made available for streaming in association with an option to select the video or one of the shortened versions.

- the term segment of a video includes a portion of a video less than the whole.
- a segment can include a frame of video.
- a segment can include a group of frames.
- a segment can be defined based on a duration of time segment of the video (e.g., a video can be divided into respective 5 second segments, 10 second segments, 15 second segments, etc.).
- summary video component 110 can generate one or more shortened versions of the video by editing the video to remove or cut one or more of the segments of the video.
- analysis component 108 can analyze respective segments of a video file and associate information (e.g., metadata tags) with the respective segments identifying features associated with the respective segments.
- the metadata tags can identify objects, actors, places, locations and things appearing in the respective segments of a video.
- the metadata can also identify actions or activity occurring in the respective segments.
- the tags can indicate an activity of driving, walking, running, sitting, fighting, dancing, etc.
- the metadata tags can also indicate points in time associated with content included in a segment of a video (e.g., night time, lunchtime, 1930s, during the Revolutionary War, in a futuristic time period, etc.).
- the metadata can also identify words spoken and music included in audio associated with the respective video segments.

- analysis component 108 can analyze text of an existing transcript of the audio portion (e.g., a closed caption file) of a video.
- Analysis component 108 can also associate information with respective segments of a video representative of collective user engagement or interest in the respective segments.
- the user can provide various clues that are indicative of whether the user finds a particular portion or part of the video interesting or not. For example, as a user watches a video the user may fast forward past parts of the video the user finds uninteresting to arrive at a portion of the video the user finds interesting.
- a user can also perform various other actions that can indicate an interest in a particular portion of a video. For example, a user may rewind back to interesting parts of a video, comment on interesting parts of a video, re-watch interesting parts of a video, or share links to interesting parts of a video.
- a user can also perform various actions that indicate a disinterest in certain parts of a video. For example, the user may stop watching a video upon the occurrence of a disinteresting part or provide comments indicating a disinterest in a particular part of a video.
- Information related to user interest/engagement in respective segments of a video can further be employed by analysis component 108 (or another system) to determine levels of relative user interest/engagement in the respective segments of the video.
- Information representing user engagement/interest in a video segment can thus be associated with the respective segments and used to determine which segments of a the video to include/exclude in a summary video.
- Analysis component 108 can also associate information with respective segments of a video indicating whether the segments are the start of a new scene or event in the video.
- analysis component 108 can employ automatic scene detection mechanisms and analyze an encoded/compressed video consisting of a plurality of intra-frame (I-frames) interspersed with predictive frame inter-frames (P-frame) and/or a bi-predictive inter-frames (B-frame).
- the I-frames can be identified and tagged by analysis component 108 as boundary frames between different scenes of the video. For example, each I-frame occurring in a video comprising a plurality of sequential frames can be considered the start of a new scene in the video. Groups of adjacent frames occurring between respective I-frames can constitute a separate scene in the video.
- video compression is tailored to facilitate encoding frames of a video as I-frames or P-frames/B-frames based on parameters that recognize spatial and temporal differences between frames associated with scene changes.
- analysis component 108 can further automatically generate summaries of respective segments or groups of segments of a video. For example, analysis component 108 can generate metadata to associate with a video file that summarizes (e.g., in text), primary aspects and features associated with respective segments or groups of segments of the video.
- the metadata can indicate what segments of a video are associated with different scenes of a video, what generally occurs in the respective scenes, who predominately appears in the respective scenes, why those persons appear in the respective scenes, highlights of the scenes (e.g., a punch line, a climactic moment, a funny moment, etc.), user interest in the respective scenes and/or specific features/highlights of the scenes, etc.
- analysis component 108 can generate a summary file for a video (e.g., as metadata or text), that summarizes (e.g., in words and/or computer readable language) the content of a video (e.g., the various features and aspects of the visual and audio content of the video) and/or collective user interest in the video with respect to the respective segments of the video.
- a summary file for a video e.g., as metadata or text
- summarizes e.g., in words and/or computer readable language
- the content of a video e.g., the various features and aspects of the visual and audio content of the video

In one or more aspects, a system is provided that includes an analysis component configured to analyze a video and generate summaries of content included in respective segments of the video, and a summary component configured to generate shortened versions of the video having durations less than the duration of the video based in part on the summaries of the content included in the respective segments of the video, wherein the video is made available for streaming in association with an option to select the video or one of the shortened versions.
Description
This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/146,411, filed Jan. 2, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
This application generally relates to systems and methods for generating and providing different length versions of a video.
Watching television (TV) is a leisure activity many people around the world routinely engage in. The notion of turning on the TV and having regularly scheduled content ready to digest is both relaxing and predictable. However, broadcast media content is generally provided to viewers at a fixed length which is predefined by the content itself, the broadcast networks and supplementary advertising media. Due to a general level of inflexibility associated with traditional broadcast television with respect to selecting which shows to watch, when to watch them and how long to watch them, current and future generations of viewers are turning to online video streaming services.
These online video streaming services allow users to select from a variety of media content for viewing on demand. Further with the ubiquitous nature of media creation and publishing tools, individuals are able to become productive content creators. This has resulted in exponential growth of available streaming media content. In order to increase viewership and continue to draw viewers away from conventional broadcast media, these online video streaming services are constantly seeking mechanisms to provide viewers with media consumption options that are tailored to user's individual needs and that capitalize on flexibility and media viewing control options that originally incentivized viewers to turn to online video streaming services.
Numerous aspects, embodiments, objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:
The innovation is described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this innovation. It may be evident, however, that the innovation can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the innovation.
By way of introduction, the subject matter described in this disclosure relates to systems and methods for generating and providing different length versions of a video. Often times, users have various windows of time to view videos that are available on demand, such as videos provided by an online media provider. As a result, a user may pass over watching a video that is longer than a current window of viewing time available to the user. The subject matter described in this disclosure therefore provides systems and methods for generating different length versions of a video and making these different length versions of the video available for streaming to users so that the users can select a version of the video for viewing that is suitable to them based on a current amount of time they would like to devote to watching the video.
In an embodiment, a video streaming system configured to provide on demand streaming video to users via a network can automatically generate different length versions of a video provided by the video streaming system. For example, for a video that is 37 minutes in length, the video streaming system can generate a version of the video that is 5 minutes in length, 10 minutes in length and 20 minutes in length. The video streaming system can further make these different length versions of the video available to viewers in addition to the original video. For example, a video can be presented to users with the option to select one of the different length versions of the video for viewing (e.g., the original 37 minute version, the 5 minute version, the 10 minute version, or the 20 minute version).
In an aspect, after a video is uploaded to or otherwise provided to the video streaming system, the video streaming system can systematically summarize the video source file and generate a ‘cliffs notes’ version of the source file with summaries of the content included in respective segments of the video. Using the summarized video content, the system can automatically edit the video to include or exclude different segments of the video and generate different length versions of the video. On the client side, when coming across the video while navigating the video streaming system via a user interface configured by the video streaming system (e.g., a website platform or application platform), the user can be provided with the option to choose which length version of the video to watch.
In an aspect, the uploader of the video can facilitate choosing which segments of the video to include/exclude in different length versions of the video. The uploader can also provide input regarding the number of different length versions to create and desired durations of the different length versions of the video (e.g., for a 30 the uploader can request that the video streaming system generate a 5 minute version, a 10 minute version, and a 15 minute version). In another aspect, the video streaming system can create an edited version of the video fitting an amount of time provided by the viewer in association with a request to watch the video. For example, a user can find a 30 minute video and request to watch a 7.5 minute version of the video. In response to the request, the video streaming system can create the 7.5 minute version of the video on the fly and provide it to the user for viewing.
In one or more aspects, a system is provided that includes an analysis component configured to analyze a video and generate summaries of content included in respective segments of the video. The system further includes a summary component configured to generate shortened versions of the video having durations less than the duration of the video based in part on the summaries of the content included in the respective segments of the video, wherein the video is made available for streaming in association with an option to select the video or one of the shortened versions.
In another aspect, a method is disclosed that includes using a processor to execute computer executable instructions stored in a memory to perform acts including generating summaries of content included in respective segments of a video, and receiving a request to play a shortened version of the video, the request including a desired length of the shortened version of the video. The acts further include generating the shortened version of the video having the desired length in response to the request based in part on the summaries of the content included in the respective segments of the video, and streaming the shortened version of the video to a device associated with the request.
Further provided is a tangible computer-readable storage medium comprising computer-readable instructions that, in response to execution, cause a computing system to perform various operations. The operations include at least, generating summaries of content included in respective segments of the video, and generating shortened versions of the video having durations less than the duration of the video based in part on the summaries of the content included in the respective segments of the video, wherein the video is made available for streaming in association with an option to select the video or one of the shortened versions.
Referring now to the drawings, with reference initially to FIG. 1 , presented is a diagram of an example system 100 for generating and presenting different length versions of a video, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments described herein. Aspects of systems, apparatuses or processes explained in this disclosure can constitute machine-executable components embodied within machine(s), e.g., embodied in one or more computer readable mediums (or media) associated with one or more machines. Such components, when executed by the one or more machines, e.g., computer(s), computing device(s), virtual machine(s), etc. can cause the machine(s) to perform the operations described.
As used herein the term media content or media item can include but is not limited to streamable media (e.g., video, live video, video advertisements, music, music videos, sound files and etc.) and static media (e.g., pictures, thumbnails). In some aspects, the term media content or media item includes a collection of media items such as a playlist including several videos or songs, or a channel including several videos or songs associated with a single media creator.
In an aspect, media provider 102 can employ one or more networked computing devices to store media content and deliver media content to users via a network 116. The media content can be stored in memory 112 associated with media provider 102 and/or at various networked devices employed by media provider 102 and accessed via client device 118 using a web based platform of the media provider 102. For example, media provider 102 can include a media presentation source that has access to a voluminous quantity (and potentially an inexhaustible number) of shared media (e.g., video and/or audio) files. The media presentation source can further stream these media files to one or more users at respective client devices 118 of the one or more users over a network 116. In another example, media provider 102 can include any entity that provides videos to users along with other content and services (e.g., a social networking website that provides social networking services and social videos or an educational website that provides educational videos and services).
To facilitate generating different length versions of videos provided by media provider 102, summary video platform 104 can include reception component 106, analysis component 108 and summary video component 110. Reception component 106 is configured to receive videos uploaded to media provider 102 or otherwise provided to media provider 102 for which one or more shortened or summary versions of the video are to be created. In an aspect, reception component 106 can be configured to receive all videos uploaded to or otherwise provided by media provider 102 for which one or more shortened versions have not yet been generated and made available by media provider 102. In another aspect, reception component 106 can receive a video for processing by summary video platform 104 in response to a received request to generate one or more summarized versions of the video (e.g., from an uploader of the video or from a potential viewer of the video). For example, a user of media provider can upload a video to media provider for publishing and sharing with others. After the video is uploaded, the uploader can request and/or authorize that multiple different length versions of the video be created by media provider 102 and made available to others in addition to the original video. In response to such a request, the video can be received by reception component 106 for processing by summary video platform 104 to create the multiple different version of the video.
In an aspect, analysis component 108 can analyze respective segments of a video file and associate information (e.g., metadata tags) with the respective segments identifying features associated with the respective segments. For example, the metadata tags can identify objects, actors, places, locations and things appearing in the respective segments of a video. The metadata can also identify actions or activity occurring in the respective segments. For example, the tags can indicate an activity of driving, walking, running, sitting, fighting, dancing, etc. The metadata tags can also indicate points in time associated with content included in a segment of a video (e.g., night time, lunchtime, 1930s, during the Revolutionary War, in a futuristic time period, etc.). The metadata can also identify words spoken and music included in audio associated with the respective video segments.
Information related to user interest/engagement in respective segments of a video can further be employed by analysis component 108 (or another system) to determine levels of relative user interest/engagement in the respective segments of the video. Information representing user engagement/interest in a video segment can thus be associated with the respective segments and used to determine which segments of a the video to include/exclude in a summary video.
In an aspect, based the variety of information identified by analysis component 108 regarding features of respective segments of a video (e.g., including but not limited: things appearing in a segment, actions occurring in a segment, words spoken in a segment, music occurring in a segment, level of user interest in a segment, whether the segment is associated with a start of a new scene, etc.), analysis component 108 can further automatically generate summaries of respective segments or groups of segments of a video. For example, analysis component 108 can generate metadata to associate with a video file that summarizes (e.g., in text), primary aspects and features associated with respective segments or groups of segments of the video. For instance, the metadata can indicate what segments of a video are associated with different scenes of a video, what generally occurs in the respective scenes, who predominately appears in the respective scenes, why those persons appear in the respective scenes, highlights of the scenes (e.g., a punch line, a climactic moment, a funny moment, etc.), user interest in the respective scenes and/or specific features/highlights of the scenes, etc. In other words, analysis component 108 can generate a summary file for a video (e.g., as metadata or text), that summarizes (e.g., in words and/or computer readable language) the content of a video (e.g., the various features and aspects of the visual and audio content of the video) and/or collective user interest in the video with respect to the respective segments of the video.
In an aspect, summary video component 110 can tag respective segments of a video with ranking information that represents their level of priority for inclusion in a summary video. The ranking applied to a segment can be a function of the variety of factors identified by analysis component 108, including but not limited to: actions and events associated with the segment, people occurring in the segment, objects appearing in the segment, words spoken in the segment, music occurring in the segment, user interest in the segment, whether the segment is a start of a new scene, whether the segment includes repetitive content, and whether the segment includes new content. Summary video component 110 can further cut segments tagged or associated with a lower ranking before segments associated with a higher ranking when generating a shortened version of the video.
For example, summary video component 110 can determine or infer segments or groups of segments of the video that are associated with key aspects or events and segments of the video that are associated with less significant details of the video based on summaries of the respective segments or groups of segments. Those segments associated with key aspects can receive a higher ranking than those segments associated with less significant aspects. For example, a video of a steeplechase can include several similar frames of the horse and rider running through a field and fewer unique frames where the horse encounters a jump or fence. According to this example, summary video component 110 can determine or infer that the frames at which the horse encounters the jumps/fences are more entertaining than those frames where the horse is merely running through the field and associated the frames at which the horse encounters the jumps/fences with a higher ranking.
In an aspect, summary video component 110 can be configured to generate a single shortened version of a video with a set duration. For example, summary video component 110 can be configured to generate M minute (e.g., 5 minute) summary versions of respective videos provided by media provider 102. According to this example, summary video component 110 can skip generating summary videos for videos originally less than M minutes. In another example, summary video component 110 can be configured to generate shortened versions of respective videos provided by media provider 102 where the duration of the shortened version is determined by summary video component 110 (e.g., based on a variety of factors such as length of the original video, content of the video, features of the respective segments of the video, potential points in the video suitable for cutting and/or splicing the video, etc). According to this example, the summary version of original videos of a same length can have different durations. For example an original 30 minute video could have a summary version that is 7.5 minutes and another original 30 minute video could have a summary version that is 4.3 minutes.
In another aspect, summary video component 110 can be configured to generate multiple different length summary versions of respective videos provided by media provider 102. According to this aspect, the number of versions and the durations of the respective versions can be fixed or vary as function of the length of the original video (and/or as a function of other factors such as, content of the video, features of the respective segments of the video, potential points in the video suitable for cutting and/or splicing the video, etc.). For example, for respective videos provided by media provider 102, summary video component 110 can be configured to generate V different length versions, where V is a number and where V can vary based on the length of the original video. For example, for videos that are originally between 5 to 10 minutes in length, V can be 1. In another example, for videos that are originally between 10 to 20 minutes in length, V can be 2, and for videos that are originally greater than 20 minutes in length, V can be 3. The durations of respective versions of a video can also be a function of the duration of the original video. For example, for videos that are about 5 minute in length, summary video component 110 can be configured to generate 2 minute versions, for videos that are about 10 minutes in length, summary video component 110 can be configured to generate 5 minute versions and 2 minute version, for videos that are about 30 minute in length, summary video component can be configured to generate 15 and 5 minute version, etc.
In an aspect, when generating shortened versions of videos, summary video component 110 can actually generate new video files that are the edited versions of the video. For example, summary video component 110 can cut segments of a video and splice or adjoin segments of the video where gaps are established as a result of cut segments. Summary video component 110 can then store the edited version of the video in a separate file from the original version of the video. In another aspect, summary video component 110 can generate a metadata file to associate with an original video file that indicates certain segments of the video to include and/or exclude when the video is streamed via media provider and/or played at a client device based on the version selected. For example, summary video component can tag segments of the video file with different markers representative of segments of the video to include in different length versions of the video. When one of the versions is selected for playing, media provider 102 can stream and/or a client device video player can read, only those segments with tags corresponding to the selected version.
Videos for which one or more shortened summary versions are available are further marked or noted via an alternative version section (e.g., section 308 and the like, highlighted in gray). For example, video 1 and video 2 include a 5 minute version, a 7 minute version, and a 10 minute version. Similarly video 3 includes a 2 minute version, video 4 includes a 5, 10 and 15 minute version, and video 6 includes a 10 and 30 minute version, video 7 includes a 5, 15 and 30 minute version and video N includes a 5, 10 and 15 minute version. Video 5 does not have a summary video version associated therewith. In an aspect, for a video having one or more summary versions, a user can select either the original length version of the video for playing or one of the summary versions. Accordingly, if a user would like to watch a certain video but does not have enough time to watch the full length version, the user can simply select a shorter version of the video to watch.
In another aspect, after summary video component 110 has generated a summary version of a video, review component 406 can play the summary version back to the uploader before publication for the uploader to approve. In response to approval of the summary version of the video, the uploader can authorize publication of the summary version. In response to disapproval of the summary version, the uploader can disapprove publication of the summary version and/or request summary video component 110 generate a new summary version of the video.
In another aspect, using selection component 506, the uploader of the video can tag, mark or otherwise indicate segments of the video the uploader would like included in a summary video and/or segments of the video the uploader would like excluded from the summary video. For example, the uploader can highlight or tag interesting parts in the video that the uploader considers good material for inclusion in a summary video. The uploader can also highlight or tag parts of the video the uploader would like to be cut from the summary video. In accordance with this aspect, the uploader can also provide ranking information indicating relative levels of importance of respective segments of a video for inclusion in a summary video. For example, the uploader can tag segments of the video with a score from 1 to 10, where a score of 1 indicates the segment is not a good candidate for inclusion in the summary video and a score of 10 indicates is a very good candidate for inclusion in the summary video. Scores from 2-9 can indicate varying and relative degrees of importance of the respective segments with respect to inclusion in a summary video. Summary video component 110 can employ selection data provided by the uploader regarding segments to include/exclude in a summary video when generating the summary video.
In an aspect, summary video platform 604 is configured to generate a summary version of a video in response to a request for a summary video received from a user who would like to view the summary version of the video. The request can indicate at least a desired length of the summary video. For example, a user could find a video he or she is interested in viewing provided by media provider 102 that is a duration longer than the amount of time the user would like to devote to watching the video. Using summary video platform 604, the user can send a request for the generation of a shortened version of the video. In response to the request, summary video component 110 can generate the shortened version of the video and stream or otherwise provide the shortened version of the video to the user (e.g., via at client device 118) as opposed to the full length version of the video. For example, the request could indicate a 10 minute version of the video is desired. In response to the request, summary video component 110 can generate the 10 minute version of the video. According to this aspect, in the alternative of and/or in addition to generating multiple different duration summary versions of a video and making these versions available to potential viewers, summary video component 110 can generate a summary version of a video on the fly.
In an aspect, when generating a summary video version of a video on the fly (e.g., in response to a user request), summary video component 110 can edit a full length version of the video in a same or similar manner to that described with respect to the mechanisms by which summary video component 110 can generate multiple different length versions of the video, as discussed with reference to FIG. 1 .
In another aspect, where summary video component 110 has previously generated one or more summary versions of a video of various durations, in response to a request for a summary video of a specified duration, summary video component 110 can identify one of the previously generated summary versions of the video having duration closest to the specified duration. Summary video component can then work off of that previously generated summary version of the video to create the video with the specified duration. In particular, the summary video component 110 can add and/or subtract segments from the previously generated summary version to create the version having the specified duration.
For example, a user could request a 12 minute summary version of a video for which a previously generated 10 minute summary version exists. According to this example, summary video component 110 can simply add 2 minute of video to the 10 minute version to generate the 12 minute version (as opposed to starting over from scratch). In an aspect, all summary versions generated for a video (e.g., as initially generated in response to upload of the video and/or in response to a summary video request from a user) can be stored in memory (e.g., memory 112) accessible to summary video platform. These summary versions can later be re-used and/or modified in response to future request for summary versions of the video.
In an aspect, in addition to specifying a desired duration of a requested summary video, request component 606 can receive summary video requests specifying additional features for a requested summary video. For example, the request can indicate a certain actor, object or place appearing in the video to focus on or highlight in the summary video. According to this example, a user could request a summary video of a basketball game that is X minutes long and features actions shots including player number 41. In another example, a user could request a summary video that focuses on scenes occurring at the lake house or scenes featuring children and animals. In another example, a user could request a summary video that does not include profanity or violence.
It should be appreciated that a variety of different features/parameters associated with an original can be identified by a user in a summary video request to tailor the summary video to the user's noted preferences. Summary video component 110 can employ the various features and summaries of video segments identified by analysis component 108 to generate a requested summary video based on the features noted in the request. For example, summary video component 110 can generate a requested “humorous” summary version of a video having a requested X length by using metadata identifying various parts of the video considered humorous. According to this example, summary video component can extract the humorous segments in association with generating the summary video having the duration X.
For example, the user preferences can relate to types of videos the user tends to watch or particular features of those videos the user tends to enjoy. In addition to user preference, personalization component 608 can further direct summary video component 110 to tailor a summary video based on one or more of the following factors: demographics of the user (e.g., age, gender, language, location, etc.), watch history of the user, video sharing history of the user, video commenting of the user, social affiliations of the user, trending videos, or trending parts of videos. According to this aspect, a 5 minute summary version of a certain video that is to be played to a male audience can include entirely different content than another five minute version of the same video that is to be played to a female audience.
In an aspect, analysis component 108 can employ inference component 706 to infer features and aspects of content of segments of a video and to facilitate inferring summaries of content of respective segments of a video. Summary video component 110 can further employ inference component 706 to infer how to edit a full length version of a video to generate one or more summary versions of a video. For example, summary video component 110 can employ inference component 706 to infer which segments of a video to include/exclude in a summary video based on a desired length of the summary video, preferences associate with a user to which the summary video will be provided, and summaries of features and content associated with the respective segments of the video.
In order to provide for or aid in the numerous inferences described herein, inference component 706 can examine the entirety or a subset of the data to which it is granted access and can provide for reasoning about or infer states of the system, environment, etc. from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. An inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. An inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data.
Such an inference can result in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification (explicitly and/or implicitly trained) schemes and/or systems (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc.) can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter.
A classifier can map an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, such as by f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.
