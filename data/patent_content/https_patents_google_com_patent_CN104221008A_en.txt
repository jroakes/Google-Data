In an embodiment of technology described herein, can access map data base, if map data base 12 for example, to look ahead or to retrieve and the corresponding map datum of the map area that comprises determined route (, map datum segment).In another embodiment, can look ahead map datum to generate one or more routes.For generating the map datum of route, can be contained in for providing information to show the segment of diagram data in the same manner of route.In different embodiments, for generating the data of route, can be contained in and the map datum segment being separated for playing up the map datum segment of route.In another embodiment, for generating the data of route, can be contained in the data mode that is different from map datum segment.Look ahead and be usually directed to needing data to initiate the retrieval to map datum before processing.For example, look ahead can relate to utilize this map datum initiate to play up or Presentation Function before retrieving map data.Look ahead and may also relate in local storage store map data to retrieve faster by map data base.For example, the speed of access local storage may faster than the speed of access map data base (for example,, because intermittence connects, connects bandwidth etc.).Only can be by network 25 intermittently access server 14 in the situation that at mobile device, look ahead and may relate to when client terminal device can be connected to server 14, no matter whether mobile device/user has asked these data of access even, all the access of map datum and retrieval are dispatched to (for example, through for playing up request or the function with the corresponding map datum of prefetch data).
Fig. 6 illustrates and at route, is around provided with the route 501 of square region 510 shown in Fig. 5.It should be pointed out that term " around " refers to and comprises this position or point when reference position or some use.Therefore, in " destination is around ", comprise the region adjacent with destination, and destination itself.Square 510 can represent the zone of dispersion with the corresponding map of discrete unit of map datum.About above-mentioned map datum segment, each square region 510 can represent or corresponding to the map datum segment for specific level of zoom.Region 510 can only represent the subset in available or searchable whole group of map datum segment.For example, in the situation that map datum segment can exist because of whole view window 600 conventionally, by the represented map datum segment in region 510, be only the sub-fraction for total map datum segment of view window.
Fig. 6 is illustrated in specific level of zoom, for showing that the map datum of the minimum number of route may comprise and the corresponding at least one group of map datum segment in the region that comprises each point on route.In one embodiment, can be by looking ahead or retrieve the map datum for the minimum number of route through the corresponding map datum segment of square 510 shown in map datum library access and Fig. 6.For example, one in the device of system 10 can comprise instruction, after carrying out by processor, this instruction can determine whether the point on route is included in the map datum segment of also determining or identify the map datum segment that comprises the minimum number that contains route in map datum segment immediately.
Some that apply for mapping are played up situation, and route may need larger region around.Conventionally, the method and system can for example, by determining the subset of the map datum segment in the region that is identified for comprising route (, the route shown in Fig. 5-9) along the segment radius of point that comprises the route of initial point and destination.Fig. 7 illustrates example virtual map and shows 700, and it has shown a part of available map data that are stored in map data base 12 with first (arbitrarily) level of zoom.With the map segment radius 754 distributing, show point of interest 704.Map segment radius 754 represents that distance is for identifying segment to obtain the radial distance from point of interest 704 of segment from map data base 12.In Fig. 7, segment radius 754 extends to identify a plurality of map datum segments from point of interest 704, and described a plurality of map datum segments are associated with the point of interest in being arranged on the circumferential area 756 being limited by identified segment radius R.In the embodiment illustrated, this region 756 define by for example from map data base 12 identification and be sent to this group of one client terminal device 16-22 map datum segment of looking ahead.In an example, even partly will be arranged in this group map datum segment of looking ahead with the overlapping any map datum segment of circumferential area 756.In Fig. 7, these segment shadow representation.
Fig. 8 illustrates along two points 802 and 804 for example, with the route segment 810 (, road segment segment) of corresponding segment radius 810.Shadow region in Fig. 8 illustrates the map datum segment for route segment 810 that can retrieve based on radius 802,804.In Fig. 8, only can use several points (for example,, with the isolated point of constant spacing) along road to determine map radius and can retrieve corresponding shadow region.In other embodiments, can limit with more some the map segment radius of line segment.In addition,, although line segment, as road segment segment can comprise the point of unlimited amount, the request of map segment not necessarily needs a large amount of requests for data segment or identification.On the contrary, can calculate to the line segment of whole length (for example, using integral function) interested shadow region and can carry out single calculating and with identification, be positioned at all segments of route radius.Subsequently, can carry out single for example calling, with (, once) and retrieve all corresponding map datum segments.
Fig. 9 illustrates the process flow diagram that can be used for looking ahead about method, routine or the process 900 of the map datum on the map surface as shown in Fig. 5-6.The method 900 can comprise one or more square frames, module, function or the routine that the form with computer executable instructions exists, and described computer executable instructions is stored in tangible computer-readable medium and uses the processor of server 14 or client terminal device 16-22 to carry out.Can comprise that the method 900 as any back-end device of the computing environment for system as herein described (for example usings, server 14) or fore device (for example, client terminal device 16-22) module or assembly, or as a part that is positioned at the module outside this system.For the ease of explaining, describe with reference to the accompanying drawings Fig. 9, and method 900 also can be used together with user interface with other objects certainly.Under any circumstance, square frame 902 is determined route information, and it comprises the information about one group of road of initial point, destination and connection initial point and destination.Can receive this information in response to one or more instructions of execution in the mapping application in client terminal device 16-22.Square frame 902 also can be looked ahead for generating the map datum of route.As discussed, for generate this map datum of route can take with for play up the similar and different map datum segment of the map datum segment of route form or can together be stored as independent data mode.In one embodiment, for generating the map datum of route, can take to limit the form of the route planning instruction of route.
Square frame 904 can be determined the chart portfolio segment radius along the point of route.In one embodiment, square frame 904 can determine along route minimum segment radius a little.Can select figure segment radius minimally to allow to select the map datum segment with the corresponding minimum number in region that comprises whole route (route as shown in Figure 6).This minimum map segment radius can be considered to the radii fixus of whole route.In other embodiments, square frame 904 also can be determined along the point of interest of route or the chart portfolio segment radius of preferential point.Can determine that these points of interest have the radius (will make further discussion below) that is greater than minimum segment radius.Once determine the radius of route, 906, square frame can access map data base, if map data base 12 is to obtain and the corresponding map datum segment of radius definite in square frame 904.Square frame 908 can be retrieved subsequently with the corresponding map datum segment of radius definite in square frame 904 and retrieved segment is stored in the local storage of client terminal device 16-22.
In one embodiment, can be to the some assigned priority value along route.For example, can use the sign, attribute or other designators that are associated with point on route to distribute or assigned priority.Can limit route segment by one group of point, and therefore when putting distribution priority to one group that limits route segment, route segment (for example, the road segment segment of route) can be corresponding to this priority.Further, priority attribute may be only high value or low value (that is, have priority or do not have priority).In other embodiments, priority can be the scale value between high value and low value.
Method and system as herein described can determine that one or more points of interest are to be shown to user via interface 34.Can input definite point of interest based on user, for example, by user, address be provided to the data field presenting on interface 34 or by user and selects to find by determining with the mutual point of interest obtaining at interface 34.Conventionally, along the priority of the point of route, can represent that user may initiate the possibility of the function that access and this put corresponding map datum or be determined by this possibility.This can be with initiation function to use specifically diagram data to show that a part of user of map is corresponding.Can determine that based on the tolerance of system in operation the possibility of access, described tolerance for example comprise carrying out instruction that mapping applies with the analysis of par and the number of times of access map datum.
In one embodiment, can under default situations, initial point and destination be assigned as to the point of interest with high priority.Figure 10 illustrates the region 1000 that comprises determined route 501 (Fig. 5), wherein has map datum corresponding to the initial point 502 large with the region of route 506 than along connecting initial point 502 and destination 504 and region around, destination 504.Figure 10 illustrates one group of priority that point is higher that can be to initial point 502 and destination 504 distribution ratios along the route 506 between initial point and destination.In this case, to initial point 502 and destination 504, distribute larger map segment radius.Initial point and destination can represent the point of interest of acquiescence.In this case, the data volume of retrieving for the point with higher priority (initial point and destination) of connection line is greater than the data volume for the point retrieval with lower priority of adapter path.
In some embodiments, destination 504 may have higher priority, and therefore compares with initial point 502, has the more map datum corresponding to larger region.This may be applicable to will go to destination and more may in destination, need the situation of more information by (time that may stay is longer) ratio at initial point (may can leave the time that starts to stay from user shorter) as user.Yet, also have certain situation, wherein initial point may need more substantial priority and may have larger map area.For example, this may be following this situation, when the complicacy about the region of initial point (for example, complicacy is along with the quantity of crossroad, road and the complicacy of landform increase and increase) is very high and need more big map region area for navigation by near region initial point.
Figure 11 A illustrates the view window 1100 on map surface, and wherein map surface shows a plurality of points of interest 502,504 and 1101.Figure 11 A is illustrated in the particular interest point 1101 on the route 501 between initial point 502 and destination 504.In this case, compare with route around, point of interest 1101 can be assigned with higher priority and larger segment radius.This point of interest can be city, cities and towns or other terrestrial reference that has been assigned with high priority.Along some points of interest of route, can be assigned with high priority and can be for the map datum segment of the larger quantity of those interest point search.
Figure 11 B illustrates the view window 1150 of route 501, and this route 501 has and the route 501 between initial point 502 and destination 504 departs from the particular interest point 1120 of a segment distance.In this case, can specify in a little 1120 regions 1125 around and be the corresponding map datum segment of region 1125 mark.In one embodiment, can determine the segment radius of point of interest 1120, make the circumference and the segment radius overlaid of edge from the point of the nearest route 501 of point of interest 1120 of segment radius.For being positioned near the point of interest of route 501, this may be easily.In another embodiment, the method and system can be determined one or more paths of the point of interest 1120 to route from the point along route.Whether determined that the path for point of interest 1120 can be depending on the distance between point of interest 1120 and path 501.For example, when the distance to this point reaches or during lower than threshold distance, can be identified for to the path of route of departing from the point of interest 1120 of route, wherein this threshold distance explanation user will more likely move the shorter distance that departs from route but not the distance that departs from route grown to reach this point 1120.
More at large, can input based on user, for example, by user, address be provided to the data field presenting on interface 34 or by user and selects to find by determining along the priority of the point of route with the mutual point of interest obtaining at interface 34.For example, user can access operates in web browser or other programs on the client terminal device of recognizing site, business district, family etc., according to identified content, one in client terminal device 16-22 can allow user to select this project to show with near the map setting up it around at this point of interest.
Can be by a use in client terminal device 16-22 for inputting or otherwise identify any suitable manual methods of one or more points of interest.In addition, mapping application on one in client terminal device 16-22 can be identified point of interest automatically, for example, by determining the GPS position of the current location of in client terminal device 16-22, by determining the point of interest of search recently, the database of the point of interest stored by access or for example, by determining the point of interest (, city, neighbouring area etc.) of recent visit.Certainly, at some in this case, mapping application can be determined position, download map datum for this position to apply storage in as a setting on user's set and therefore without carrying out any specific user interactions.
As discussed above, process square frame 906-908 can access map data base with in single level of zoom, look ahead with at the point of interest map datum segment of the larger corresponding larger quantity of map area around.In one embodiment, replace or except for having the diagram data segment of o'clock looking ahead in the first single level of zoom more of high priority, the method and system also can be for have the high priority o'clock map datum segment of looking ahead in the second higher level of zoom.Figure 12 illustrates the identical route shown in Fig. 6, and it has the region 506 that represents to have with the level of zoom shown in Fig. 6 the map datum segment of formed objects.In addition, Figure 12 illustrates by the represented extra map datum segment in the region 1210 of the second higher level of zoom.Wish to be amplified to the zoom function that can initiate view window the user in initial point 502 or region around, destination 504.When the map datum segment with higher level of zoom is taken to in client terminal device 16-22 in advance, may be relatively very fast to playing up the response time of those map datum segments.
Certainly, except retrieving extra map datum segment in the second higher level of zoom, the method and system also can be in the second higher level of zoom retrieving map data segment for being different from the region of the first level of zoom or for the zones of different with respect to other points on route in the second higher level of zoom.In addition the data that, the method and system can maybe cannot be retrieved higher level of zoom for example, for the point with low priority along route (,, in the centre of route, not having point of interest etc.).The map datum of whether retrieving higher level of zoom may depend on along the priority of the point of route for the point about in the middle of route.As discussed above, the priority of the point on route can be based in part on determining the possibility of this map datum of access.
Said method and system can only be retrieved or process the available of definite area based on comprising determined route or subset that can retrieving map data segment and be stored in the cache memory of client terminal device 16-22.When the map datum of expection being downloaded to local cache memory when carrying out quick-searching and processing, the method and system can provide the response time faster.Although the priority of one type discussed above is that to retrieve, the priority of Second Type can be order or the sequence of retrieving map data based on specifying what map datum (in route region and/or level of zoom data around).The sequence of map data retrieval (for example, map datum segment) can contribute to reduce the expense of bandwidth and processor.The sequence of map data retrieval also can guarantee, in the situation that lost in retrieving to the connection of the server that contains map datum, first downloads more important and has a segment of high priority.
Figure 13 illustrates for determining when or with the process flow diagram of which kind of sequential search map datum segment.Square frame 1302 can determine to receive respectively organize different map datums.This group map datum can be corresponding to determined map datum as discussed above.For example, first group of map datum can be corresponding to the region around initial point, second group of map datum can be corresponding to the region around in destination, the 3rd group of map datum can be corresponding to the region in the path along between initial point and destination, and the 4th group of map datum can be corresponding to extra point of interest.Extra group can relate to other data of different zoom level of the part (for example, initial point, destination, road segment segment and other points of interest) for route.
Square frame 1304 can be determined the present situation (for example, the state of view window, current bandwidth, current processor capacity etc.) of system subsequently.Square frame 1306 can be identified for being taken in advance the sequence of every group of map datum determining in square frame 1302 subsequently.The determining situation that can be based on definite in square frame 1304 of square frame 1306 and carrying out.The determined sequence of square frame 1306 can be the fixing acquiescence sequence based on the possible access sequence of user.This can be the situation when square frame 1304 indication default condition.In square frame 1308, can be by the determined sequential access map data base of square frame 1307 every group of map datum segment for square frame 1302.In square frame 1310, the map datum of institute's access carries out quick access in the time of can retrieving subsequently and/or be stored in local storage to initiate access when user or map application or need the processing capacity of map datum.
General sequence can relate to retrieving map data for destination, initial point, along the extra point of interest of route, also have to the various linkage sections (road segment segment) that depart from the point of interest of route.Another sequence can be by comprising for the general introduction collection of the map datum of the minimum map tile data of level of zoom and comprising that at a displayable view window (as shown in Figure 5) position of the view window of initial point and destination guides.Another sequence can be included in map datum, initial point and destination on the general introduction collection of the first level of zoom the map datum in higher level of zoom, also have in the first level of zoom with the corresponding map datum of road segment segment.In another kind of sequence, when distributing higher priority to initial point, initial point data can have precedence over destination data.This may be situation about occurring when initial point contains complicated traffic.Another kind of situation may be when when the locational extraneous information of active user (for example,, through GPS positioning signal) is placed in the position along the route away from initial point by user and situation about occurring.In other cases, the map datum for the point of interest along route can have the priority higher than initial point.Certainly, other sequences are also possible and are arranged in the opereating specification of technology described herein.
In one embodiment, state access that can be based on view window or sequence and the region of the map datum segment of looking ahead.Especially, position that can be based on view window and access map datum segment.The position of view window can be along route centered by the close position of specified point.Along with the variation of view window position, thereby make central site approach other parts of route, the map datum (for example,, through square frame 906-908) that can retrieve additional areas maybe can change the sequence (for example,, through square frame 1306-1310) of retrieval.For example providing the current location of the device of playing up map, so that in the situation that map (, is used gps system) centered by current location, can use this embodiment.
The sequence of the subset of the quantity of Map blocks of data and access Map blocks of data can be based on system shown in Figure 1 current bandwidth or processor load.The decision that whether will download the map datum segment of greater or lesser radius can be depending on the bandwidth being associated with map datum segment from server retrieves some and/or postpones to consider.In some embodiments, more than bandwidth considers can be depending on the current bandwidth that checks for retrieving map data segment/whether be positioned at threshold value for the time of downloading.For example, the current download state that in client terminal device 16-22 can check retrieving is to determine whether to retrieve and larger segment radius diagram data segment extraly accordingly.
Can consider for carrying out the processor capacity of map datum library access.For example, can check current processor capacity for threshold value.This may be situation about occurring when the present situation of mapping application needs the data retrieval reducing and/or processes because of processor load.For example, the in the situation that of processor overload or backup (capacity of processor very low or lower than threshold value), the radius that can reduce map datum segment is with the total amount of the map datum segment that reduces retrieval and process, thereby reduces the working load of processor.
Further, the situation that the sequence of map datum segment and quantity can be based on storer of looking ahead.The storer for example, may with the limited quantity of distributing to the map datum of looking ahead.Can suitably adjust the ratio of respective regions of map datum segment to consider the budget of storer.The sequence of budget record retrieval that can be based on storer.Alternately, budget that can be based on storer reduces the quantity of map datum segment group.
It is consistent with method and system as herein described with any suitable order enforcement and maintenance that any suitable subset of square frame shown in Fig. 9 and Figure 13 can be passed through some different devices (for example, client or server).In addition, can add extra definite square frame to improve being subject to the filtration of the pattern parameter of interpolation processing.
