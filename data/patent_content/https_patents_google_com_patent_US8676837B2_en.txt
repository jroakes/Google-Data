Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to information aggregation systems and, more particularly, to systems and methods for personalizing news content aggregated by a news aggregation service.
- Existing news aggregation services search out, and aggregate, news content published on web pages throughout the Internet.
- the news aggregation service presents a list of stories, from the aggregated news content, relevant to the query or to the newspaper section requested, with each story involving a group of articles from different publications dealing with the same topic.
- users must periodically access the news aggregation service, re-enter a search query and view relevant news stories.
- Systems and methods, consistent with the principles of the invention implement a news browsing service that may store user news content searches and use these previously stored searches to automatically, and periodically, provide a personal news document, such as, for example, a personal news web page, to the user that includes personalized news content.
- the personal news document may be hosted on the news aggregation server, or on a personal document server associated with the user.
- the user may customize the content and format of the personal news document via a user interface implemented at a server associated with the news browsing service or at a client associated with the user.
- a method of customizing a news web page associated with a user of a news aggregation service includes creating the customized news web page with one or more personalized search queries received from the user.
- the method further includes fetching news content from multiple news source servers, aggregating the news content, and searching the aggregated news content based, at least in part, on the one or more personalized search queries.
- the method also includes providing selected news content to the customized news web page based, at least in part, on results of the search.
- a method of creating a personalized news document includes receiving multiple search queries from a user and creating a customized news document including multiple personalized news sections, with each news section being associated with a different one of the multiple search queries.
- the method further includes retrieving news content from memory using the multiple search queries and inserting selected news content of the retrieved news content into each of the personalized news sections of the customized news document.
- a method of providing news content to a personalized news document via a news aggregation server includes associating multiple search queries with a user and maintaining the multiple search queries in a memory associated with the news aggregation server.
- the method further includes periodically searching aggregated news content using the multiple search queries and periodically providing selected news content to a news document associated with the user using results from the periodic searches of the aggregated news content.

- the software instructions may be read into memory 230 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 250 , or from another device via communication interface 280 .
- the software instructions contained in memory 230 may cause processor 220 to perform processes that will be described later.
- hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the principles of the invention.
- implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- FIGS. 3A , 3 B, 3 C and 3 D are flowcharts of exemplary processing for creating and updating personalized newspaper documents according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- the processing exemplified by FIGS. 3A , 3 B, 3 C and 3 D can be implemented in software and stored on a computer-readable memory, such as main memory 230 , ROM 240 or storage device 250 of server 120 .
- the processing exemplified by FIGS. 3A , 3 B, 3 C and 3 D can be implemented in hardwired circuitry, such as combinational logic, within server 120 .
- server 120 accessing external news content (e.g., from server 130 ), fetching the news content and aggregating the fetched news content in a local memory (act 305 )( FIG. 3A ).
- server 120 may use a news crawler (e.g., web robot) that may access news content documents hosted by news source server(s) 130 .
- News source server(s) 130 may host, for example, news content from the Washington Post, the New York Times, or other news content sites.
- the fetched news content may then be indexed and grouped, using conventional indexing and grouping algorithms (act 310 ).
- Server 120 may pre-seed a personal news document with one or more news sections, with each of the news sections including one or more search queries (act 315 ).
- the personal news page may include, for example, a personal news web page and may be stored on server 120 or server 140 .
- keywords e.g., ‘bush,’ bush iraq,’ etc.
- a search query may, thus, include a combination of one or more of the query forms above.
- Each of the news sections of the personal news document may be defined by an associated query.
- Server 120 may determine whether a user, associated with a client 110 , has selected his/her personal news document (act 320 ). For example, as shown in FIG. 4 , a user may “click” on the “personal news” button 405 of a news search page 400 of a news aggregation service associated with server 120 to select his/her personal news document. If the user has selected his/her personal news document, processing may continue at act 350 ( FIG. 3B ). If not, server 120 may then receive a news search query from a user (act 325 ). For example, as shown in FIG. 4 , a user may enter, in news search page 400 , text in a search field 410 . In another implementation, as shown in FIG.
- a user may enter search text in a secondary “advanced news search” page 500 that may be readable from search page 400 .
- Search page 500 may include various advanced search features that permit, for example, the user to search for news content based on publication date, exact phrases contained in the news content, etc.
- queries deployed by the user in the past may be ranked based on recency and frequency and made accessible through a menu placed on the search page. Selecting such a search query may reissue the query and generate a new news section. This list of queries can be automatically laid out as a newspaper with many sections distributed over many pages.
- Server 120 may determine whether the user desires that the received search query be remembered (act 330 ). For example, server 120 may prompt the user with “Do you want to remember this search?” If the user desires that the received search query be remembered, server 120 may associate the search query with an existing news section of a personal news document associated with the user (act 335 ). If the user does not desire the received search query to be remembered, then server 120 may determine whether the user desires to make the received search query into a news section of the personal news document associated with the user (act 340 ). For example, server 120 may prompt the user with “Do you want to make this search a section?” If so, server 120 may associate the received search query with a new news section of the personal news document associated with the user (act 345 ).
- server 120 may execute the queries associated with each of the one or more news sections of the user's personal news document (act 350 ).
- the results of the executed queries may be merged based on scores computed by search engine 125 to produce a final ranking which may form entries in the user's news sections.
- Server 120 may then provide the user's personal news document to the user (act 355 ) ( FIG. 3C ). If server 120 hosts the user's personal news document, then server 120 may send one or more documents to the user containing the user's personal news document. If the user's personal news document is hosted on personal document server 140 , then server 120 may send one or more documents to server 140 containing the user's personal news document. Server 120 may, additionally, direct the user's web browser to the documents hosted on server 140 .
- the user's personal news document may be formatted similar to a human-compiled newspaper, with a title, short introduction, related story titles, data, photo, etc. By way of example, FIG.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a personal news document 600 that includes two news sections 605 and 610 , “California News” and “World News,” respectively.
- the user's personal news document may additionally be used to produce a similarly configured print newspaper in a viewable or hard copy format.
- a postscript or pdf file may be produced that is portable for viewing and ready to print for offline reading.
- the layout of the print newspaper may be separately specified from the personal news document hosted on either servers 120 or 140 .
- Server 120 may determine whether the user desires to customize his/her personal news document (act 360 ). If not, processing may continue at act 370 . If the user does desire to customize his/her personal news document, then server 120 may receive input from the user to customize the personal news document associated with the user (act 365 ). An interactive program (known as a Wizard) may execute at server 120 , or at the client 110 associated with the user, to walk the user through the process of adding news sections, placing them appropriately, and customizing their look and feel.
- a Wizard An interactive program (known as a Wizard) may execute at server 120 , or at the client 110 associated with the user, to walk the user through the process of adding news sections, placing them appropriately, and customizing their look and feel.
- users may customize their personal news document in various ways, including the following: (a) adding a new section seeded with new queries; (b) changing the appearance or location of a news section or the queries associated with a news section; (c) moving news sections around (e.g., from top left of news page to bottom right, from 2 columns to 1 column layout, etc.); (d) deleting a news section; (e) changing display properties for news within a news section (e.g., deciding how many stories the news section should have, how many related titles within a story, whether images should be shown, etc.); and (f) changing ranking properties within a news section.
- the user may decide how freshness of the news content should be valued, such as, for example, sorting news content by time, by importance, or by some combination, or by providing hints for ranking certain types of stories above other stories.
- the user may indicate that a certain kind of news source (e.g., New York Times, sources in USA, etc.) may be preferred or not preferred.
- the user may provide general keywords that are of interest to the user (e.g., San Francisco) and stories with these keywords should be boosted.
- the user can list journalists they like or do not like or genres they like or do not like (e.g., opinion/commentary vs. breaking news vs. briefs vs. full coverage).
- a “cookie,” or an identifier contained in a “cookie” that is, in turn, mapped to the stored user preferences, may be used in some implementations consistent with the principles of the invention.
- a user may make their personal news document available to other users through a registry where personal news documents are registered. Other users may then search this registry and view and copy news sections that other users have created.
- Server 120 may access external news content (e.g., from server 130 ), fetch updated news content and aggregate the updated news content in local memory (act 370 ).
- server 120 may use a news crawler (e.g., web robot) that may access updated news content documents hosted by news source server(s) 130 .
- the fetched updated news content may be indexed and grouped, using conventional indexing and grouping algorithms (act 375 ) ( FIG. 3D ).
- Server 120 may then, periodically, execute a query(ies) associated with one or more news sections of the user's personal news document (act 380 ).
- Server 120 may, optionally, notify the user of any updates to news sections of the user's personal news document based on the result of the executed search of the updated news content (act 385 ).
- Server 120 may implement a news alert service that may notify the user via, for example, a page, an e-mail, a FAX, or a telephone call, that their personal news document has been updated.
- the user may be notified at stipulated intervals, or only when updated news content for their personal news document exists.
- the notification from server 120 may include the actual news updates (e.g., an e-mail may include a summary of an updated news story), or the notification may only include a brief textual or oral notification that the user can access their personal news document to retrieve the updated news content. Processing may then return to act 320 ( FIG. 3A ) to determine if the user has again selected his/her personal news document.
- Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may use previously stored user searches to automatically, and periodically, provide a personal news document to the user that includes personalized news content.
- the user may customize the content and format of the personal news document via a user interface implemented at a server associated with the news browsing service, or at a client associated with the user.
