Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to searching for text in two or more languages.
- the present disclosure more specifically relates to configuring a software application, such as a web browser or search engine, to search for text in multiple languages.
- Webpages and other forms of electronic documents may be created using text in any number of written languages.
- the various written languages may also utilize disparate alphabets that may or may not contain the same characters.
- the Spanish alphabet contains the same letters as that of English, with the additional letter, ⁇ .
- Some webpages or other electronic documents may also include text in multiple languages. For example, a webpage from Quebec, Canada, may include text in French and English, which are both official languages in Canada.
- Fonts play a role in the representation of languages in electronic documents. For example, two websites may be in the same language, but utilize different font scripts to represent the symbols of the language. Attempts have been made to standardize the fonts used for a particular language in electronic documents. For example, the Unicode Standard includes standards for representing characters in a myriad of different languages. Fonts can also play a role in searching. Many text searching techniques involve matching a particular character in a particular font to the same character in the same font. This further increases the number of possible characters that can be searched, since characters may vary between languages or even within a particular language.
- One implementation is a computerized method for performing a search in multiple languages.
- the method includes receiving, at a processing circuit, a search query that includes a first search term, a second search term, and a language selection for the first search term.
- the method also includes retrieving, from a transliteration database stored in a memory, a transliterated search term using the first search term and the language selection.
- the transliterated search term is in the selected language.
- the method further includes determining, by the processing circuit, whether a webpage contains the transliterated search term.
- the method additionally includes determining, by the processing circuit, using a default language, whether the webpage contains the second search term.
- the method further includes providing search result data for display by an electronic display, the search result data representing the webpage having the transliterated search term and the second search term.
- the system includes a processing circuit configured to provide an electronic document for display by an electronic display.
- the processing circuit is also configured to receive a search query that includes a first search term in a first language, a second search term in the first language, and a language selection for the first search term.
- the processing circuit is further configured to retrieve, from a transliteration database stored in a memory, a transliterated search term using the first search term and the language selection.
- the transliterated search term is in the selected language.
- the processing circuit is also configured to determine whether the electronic document contains the transliterated search term and configured to determine whether the electronic document contains the second search term using a default language.
- the processing circuit is also configured to provide search result data for display by an electronic display, the search result data representing the electronic document having the transliterated search term and the second search term.
- a further implementation is a computerized method for performing a search in multiple languages.
- the method includes requesting a webpage over a network and providing the webpage for display by an electronic display.
- the method also includes receiving, from an interface, a search query comprising a first search term and a second search term.
- the method further includes receiving, from the interface, a language selection for the first search term.
- the method additionally includes providing a transliteration request over the network to a transliteration database.
- the transliteration request includes the first search term and the language selection for the first search term.
- the method also includes receiving, from the transliteration database, a transliterated search term in the selected language for the first search term, in response to providing the transliteration request.
- the method further includes providing search result data for display by the electronic display, the search result data representing the webpage having the transliterated search term in the selected language and the second search term in a default language.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with a described implementation
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example display of a web browser having a text search utility
- FIG. 3 is an example process for performing a text search in a non-default language
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example display of a web browser searching for text in multiple languages.
- FIG. 5 is an illustration of an example display of a web browser providing a suggested transliterated search term.
- an electronic document (e.g., a webpage, a text file, spreadsheet, etc.) may be searched in a plurality of languages.
- a default language is utilized to search for text in a document.
- an application may utilize the default language of the device's operating system for text searching.
- the default language may be selected when the application is installed on the device.
- text searching in an application may be limited to a default language.
- a software application may be configured to search for text in multiple languages, but entry of search terms in a non-default language may not be possible or may require the use of additional software and/or hardware to enter a search query in two or more languages.
- a user may use an interface device (e.g., a keyboard, touchpad, etc.) that supports entering characters in multiple languages. The user may switch the input format of the interface device between the default language and one or more other languages, to search in a non-default language.
- a user may install transliteration software to aid in the entry of text in a non-default language. To perform a text search in a language other than in the default language, the user may still have to cut and paste transliterated terms from the transliteration program into a search field.
- a software application e.g., a web browser, a text editor, a document viewer, etc.
- the search term may be transliterated into the selected search language and the document (e.g., a web page, a text document, etc.) may be searched using the transliterated term.
- searching may be performed across multiple languages.
- a search language may be associated with each search term, allowing terms to be searched in different languages. For example, a text search may be performed for a first term in a first language and a second term in a second language. In this way, a user viewing content that contains multiple languages can seamlessly search for text across the presented languages.

- Process 300 includes retrieving a transliteration of the search term in the selected language (block 306).
- a transliteration database stored in a local memory or accessed over a network may be used to retrieve a transliteration of the search term in the selected language.
- the transliteration database may contain a mapping of words in the input language to that of the selected language. For example, an English-Telugu database may include an entry that maps the English word, "Hyderabad," to the Telugu word " ".
- the transliteration database may include entries that conform to a Unicode standard. Unicode standard fonts are widely adopted, thereby increasing the chance that a transliterated word matches text in a particular document.
- the transliteration database may contain non-Unicode fonts in addition to, or in lieu of, Unicode fonts.
- Process 300 includes determining the presence of the transliterated term (block 308).
- the presence of the transliterated term in an electronic document may be determined. For example, a displayed webpage may be searched for the transliterated term by a web browser. In another example, a text editor or other application for viewing documents may search a document for the presence of the transliterated term.
- a ranking algorithm may be used to determine a set of one or more network addresses of electronic documents that contain some or all of the search terms.
- search terms in two or more languages may be searched using a single search query.
- a webpage may be searched for some search terms in Hindi and other search terms in English.
- One of the search languages may or may not be the default language in which the search terms were entered.
- search terms may be entered in English, if English is the default language for the search.
- the search may be performed in one or more languages other than English, depending on the selected languages.
- a search may be performed for a term in both the default language and in a selected language. For example, a search query of "te: Vietnamese” may be used in some implementations to search for "Hyderabad" in both Telugu and in English.
- a primary input language and one or more other default search languages may be selected. For example, a user may be able to specify that English is to be used to enter search terms and that the terms are to be searched in both English and Hindi if a language is not selected, by default.

- search utility 216 may be configured to send a transliteration request to the remote database and to receive the transliterated search terms.
- a search term in input field 218 may be replaced with its retrieved transliteration.
- some or all of the originally entered search query may appear in input field 218 after a transliterated term is retrieved.
- Search utility 216 may be configured to utilize a search query and one or more selected languages entered via input field 218, to determine the presence of search terms and/or transliterated search terms on webpage 206. For example, texts 210, 212, 214 may be searched for the word "born" in English, the word “India” in Hindi, and the word "Hyderabad” in Telugu. In some implementations, a search query may only search for a conjunctive phrase. For example, search utility 216 may only search for the full set of entered search terms to determine if the terms appear in sequence on webpage 206. In some implementations, words or phrases of a search query entered into input field 218 may be searched individually on webpage 206. For example, search term 402 may be matched in text 210, search term 402 may be matched in text 214, and search term 410 may be matched in text 212.
- search utility 216 may provide visual indicia on display 200 regarding the results of the text search. For example, search utility 216 may display the number of matches of search terms on webpage 206 (e.g., a count of how many times a search term, phrase, or query appears on webpage 206). In some implementations, navigation buttons 220 may be used to cycle among matching terms on webpage 206. Indicia may also be displayed on webpage 206 to signify a matching term. For example, search term 402 (e.g., the English word "born") may be highlighted in text 210, to signify a term match. Indicia of matches with transliterated search terms may also be displayed on webpage 206.
- search term 402 e.g., the English word "born
- Indicia of matches with transliterated search terms may also be displayed on webpage 206.
- the Hindi transliteration of search term 406 (e.g., the English word "India”) may be highlighted in text 214 and the Telugu transliteration of search term 410 (e.g., the English word "Hyderabad”) may be highlighted in text 212.
- indicia of a match may be a coloration of a matching term, an icon, a cursor position, or any other form of visually indicating that a search term has been found in an electronic document.
- FIG. 5 shows display 200 displaying a web browser providing a suggested transliterated search term.
- search utility 216 may be configured to provide a display of suggested terms and/or to display transliterated terms for review.
- Suggested search terms may, for example, reduce the amount of input needed for a user to enter a search query.
- Suggesting search terms and/or displaying transliterated search terms for review may also allow a user to correct spelling errors in the search query, during entry of a search query.
- search utility 216 is configured to suggest one or more search terms via field 508.
- Field 508 may be a dropdown box, a popup window, or any other form of visual field to convey suggested terms to the user via display 200.
- Field 508 may provide suggested terms during or after the entry of a search term in the default language or in a selected language, according to various implementations.
- a search term 504 e.g., "Hyderabad”
- a language selection 502 e.g., cursor 506 is directly adjacent to the search term being entered.
- field 508 may display one or more suggested terms.
- the terms displayed in field 508 may be in the default language or in another language, if a non-default language has been specified. For example, entry of "Hyder" into input field 218 of search utility 216 may cause field 508 to display "Hyderabad” in English or in Telugu as a suggestion. Selection of a suggested search term may cause search utility 216 to automatically complete the text in input field 218 in the default language or in a specified language, according to various implementations.
- Suggested terms may be retrieved by referencing the entered portion of a search term in a database of terms stored locally or over a network. For example, a list of most commonly used words or phrases that begin with the same letters as those entered may be retrieved from the database.
- a corrected spelling may be suggested. For example, "Hyderabad” may be suggested in field 508 on entry of "Hybera” in input field 218 of search utility 216. Corrected spelling suggestions may also be presented in a non-default language, if one is selected. For example, entry of "te: Hybera” may also cause the Telugu word for "Hyderabad" to appear in field 508.
- field 508 or the like may allow a user to review a transliterated search term after entry of a search term in input field 218. For example, after the user places a space between the end of a search term and the beginning of the next term (e.g., there exists a space between cursor 506 and the end of the previously entered search term), a transliterated search term may be retrieved and presented in field 508 for review. The user may choose to revise the search term entered into input field 218, if the transliterated term in field 508 is not the intended term or phrase. In this way, a user is able to review and revise search terms during entry of the search query.
- a transliterated term may be presented in input field 218 after entry of a search term. For example, entry of "te: Vietnamese" in input field 218 may cause the Telugu word to appear directly in input field 218. Selection of a backspace button may cause the originally entered term (e.g., in the default input language) to reappear. In this way, spelling mistakes may be corrected in the default input language and the transliterated search term can also be verified by the user.
- search utility 216 may be integrated into field 202.
- field 202 may be associated with a search engine and accept search terms, in addition to resource names or network addresses.
- the search terms entered into field 202 may be passed to the associated search engine, thereby returning results to the web browser (e.g., replacing displayed webpage 206 with the search results).
- the search results may, for example, be a listing of hyperlinks to webpages that contain text corresponding to the search terms entered into field 202 in the selected languages.
- search utility 216 may be part of a text editor or other application configured to display a document.
- search utility 216 may be integrated into a spreadsheet application to allow multilingual searches to be performed.
- the functionality of search utility 216 may be integrated into an Internet search engine to allow searching for Internet content in multiple languages using a single input language to enter a search query.

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to searching for text in two or more languages. The present disclosure more specifically relates to configuring a software application, such as a web browser or search engine, to search for text in multiple languages.
- Webpages and other forms of electronic documents may be created using text in any number of written languages. The various written languages may also utilize disparate alphabets that may or may not contain the same characters. For example, the Spanish alphabet contains the same letters as that of English, with the additional letter, ñ. Some webpages or other electronic documents may also include text in multiple languages. For example, a webpage from Quebec, Canada, may include text in French and English, which are both official languages in Canada.
- Fonts play a role in the representation of languages in electronic documents. For example, two websites may be in the same language, but utilize different font scripts to represent the symbols of the language. Attempts have been made to standardize the fonts used for a particular language in electronic documents. For example, the Unicode Standard includes standards for representing characters in a myriad of different languages. Fonts can also play a role in searching. Many text searching techniques involve matching a particular character in a particular font to the same character in the same font. This further increases the number of possible characters that can be searched, since characters may vary between languages or even within a particular language.
- Implementations of the systems and methods for performing multilingual searching are described herein. One implementation is a computerized method for performing a search in multiple languages. The method includes receiving, at a processing circuit, a search query that includes a first search term, a second search term, and a language selection for the first search term. The method also includes retrieving, from a transliteration database stored in a memory, a transliterated search term using the first search term and the language selection. The transliterated search term is in the selected language. The method further includes determining, by the processing circuit, whether a webpage contains the transliterated search term. The method additionally includes determining, by the processing circuit, using a default language, whether the webpage contains the second search term. The method further includes providing search result data for display by an electronic display, the search result data representing the webpage having the transliterated search term and the second search term.
- Another implementation is a system for performing a search in multiple languages. The system includes a processing circuit configured to provide an electronic document for display by an electronic display. The processing circuit is also configured to receive a search query that includes a first search term in a first language, a second search term in the first language, and a language selection for the first search term. The processing circuit is further configured to retrieve, from a transliteration database stored in a memory, a transliterated search term using the first search term and the language selection. The transliterated search term is in the selected language. The processing circuit is also configured to determine whether the electronic document contains the transliterated search term and configured to determine whether the electronic document contains the second search term using a default language. The processing circuit is also configured to provide search result data for display by an electronic display, the search result data representing the electronic document having the transliterated search term and the second search term.
- A further implementation is a computerized method for performing a search in multiple languages. The method includes requesting a webpage over a network and providing the webpage for display by an electronic display. The method also includes receiving, from an interface, a search query comprising a first search term and a second search term. The method further includes receiving, from the interface, a language selection for the first search term. The method additionally includes providing a transliteration request over the network to a transliteration database. The transliteration request includes the first search term and the language selection for the first search term. The method also includes receiving, from the transliteration database, a transliterated search term in the selected language for the first search term, in response to providing the transliteration request. The method further includes providing search result data for display by the electronic display, the search result data representing the webpage having the transliterated search term in the selected language and the second search term in a default language.
- These implementations are mentioned not to limit or define the scope of this disclosure, but to provide examples of implementations to aid in understanding thereof.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims, in which:
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with a described implementation; -
FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example display of a web browser having a text search utility; -
FIG. 3 is an example process for performing a text search in a non-default language; -
FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example display of a web browser searching for text in multiple languages; and -
FIG. 5 is an illustration of an example display of a web browser providing a suggested transliterated search term. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- According to some aspects of the present disclosure, an electronic document (e.g., a webpage, a text file, spreadsheet, etc.) may be searched in a plurality of languages. In a typical software application, such as a web browser, a default language is utilized to search for text in a document. For example, an application may utilize the default language of the device's operating system for text searching. In another example, the default language may be selected when the application is installed on the device. In these and other cases, text searching in an application may be limited to a default language.
- The applicants of the present disclosure have noted that a software application may be configured to search for text in multiple languages, but entry of search terms in a non-default language may not be possible or may require the use of additional software and/or hardware to enter a search query in two or more languages. For example, a user may use an interface device (e.g., a keyboard, touchpad, etc.) that supports entering characters in multiple languages. The user may switch the input format of the interface device between the default language and one or more other languages, to search in a non-default language. In another example, a user may install transliteration software to aid in the entry of text in a non-default language. To perform a text search in a language other than in the default language, the user may still have to cut and paste transliterated terms from the transliteration program into a search field.
- In some implementations described herein, a software application (e.g., a web browser, a text editor, a document viewer, etc.) may be configured to allow entry of a search term and a selection of a search language associated with the search term. The search term may be transliterated into the selected search language and the document (e.g., a web page, a text document, etc.) may be searched using the transliterated term. In some implementations, searching may be performed across multiple languages. A search language may be associated with each search term, allowing terms to be searched in different languages. For example, a text search may be performed for a first term in a first language and a second term in a second language. In this way, a user viewing content that contains multiple languages can seamlessly search for text across the presented languages.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , a block diagram of acomputer system 100 in accordance with a described implementation is shown.System 100 includes aclient 102 which communicates with other computing devices via anetwork 106. For example,client 102 may communicate with one or more content sources ranging from afirst content source 108 up to annth content source 110.Content sources client 102.System 100 may also include asearch engine 104, which provides network address information (e.g., a URL, an IP address, an FTP address, etc.) ofcontent sources client 102 overnetwork 106. For example,client 102 may provide one or more search terms tosearch engine 104. In response,search engine 104 may provide address information for one or more webpages or other content available fromcontent sources client 102. -
Network 106 may be any form of computer network that relays information betweenclient 102,search engine 104, andcontent sources network 106 may include the Internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, satellite network, or other types of data networks.Network 106 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computer, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) that are configured to receive and/or transmit data withinnetwork 106.Network 106 may further include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections. For example,client 102 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radar, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to other computing devices innetwork 106. -
Client 102 may be of any number of different types of user electronic devices configured to communicate via network 106 (e.g., a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a digital video recorder, a set-top box for a television, a video game console, etc.).Client 102 is shown to include a processing circuit, which may comprise aprocessor 112 and amemory 114.Memory 114 stores machine instructions that, when executed byprocessor 112,cause processor 112 to perform one or more of the operations described herein.Processor 112 may include a microprocessor, ASIC, FPGA, etc., or combinations thereof.Memory 114 may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providingprocessor 112 with program instructions.Memory 114 may include a floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic disk, memory chip, ASIC, FPGA, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory, optical media, or any other suitable memory from whichprocessor 112 can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable computer programming language such as, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python and Visual Basic. -
Client 102 may include one or more user interface devices. A user interface device may be any electronic device that conveys data to a user by generating sensory information (e.g., a visualization on a display, one or more sounds, etc.) and/or converts received sensory information from a user into electronic signals (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a pointing device, a touch screen display, a microphone, etc.). The one or more user interface devices may be internal to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a built-in display, microphone, etc.) or external to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a monitor connected toclient 102, a speaker connected toclient 102, etc.), according to various implementations. For example,client 102 may include anelectronic display 116, which visually displays webpages and other electronic documents using data received fromcontent sources search engine 104. -
Content sources client 102. For example,content sources search engine 104 may include a processing circuit including aprocessor 120 and amemory 122 configured to provide a webpage toclient 102. The webpage may include one or more text fields that allowclient 102 to generate a search query.Search engine 104 may receive the search query fromclient 102 vianetwork 106 and provide data indicative of one more network addresses ofcontent sources client 102. For example,client 102 may request a search webpage fromsearch engine 104 and receive the search webpage, in response. The search webpage may then be used atclient 104 to create a search query and to send the search query tosearch engine 104. In response,search engine 104 may determine one or more network addresses of content oncontent sources client 102 that includes a hyperlink or other address information for the content. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , anexample display 200 is shown.Display 200 is in electronic communication with one or more processors that cause visual indicia to be displayed bydisplay 200.Display 200 may be located inside or outside of the same housing as that of the one or more processors. For example,display 200 may be external to a desktop computer (e.g.,display 200 is a monitor), may be a television set, or may be any other stand-alone form of electronic display. In another example,display 200 may be internal to a laptop computer, mobile device, or other computing device having an integrated display. - As shown in
FIG. 2 , the one or more processors in communication withdisplay 200 may execute a software application, such as a web browser (e.g.,display 200 is part of a client device). The web browser operates by receiving input of a resource name or network address into afield 202, such as a web address, from an input device (e.g., a pointing device, a keyboard, a touchscreen, etc.). In response, the one or more processors executing the web browser may request data over a network (e.g., the Internet, an intranet, etc.) from a content source corresponding to the resource name or network address. The content source may provide webpage data and/or other data to the client device and used to cause visual indicia to be displayed bydisplay 200. - In general, webpage data may include text, hyperlinks, layout information, and other data that is used to provide the framework for the visual layout of displayed
webpage 206. In some implementations, webpage data may be one or more files in a markup language, such as the hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible HTML (XHTML), extensible markup language (XML), or any other markup language. For example, the webpage data inFIG. 2 may include a file, "example.html" provided by the website, "www.example.org." The webpage data may include data that specifies where indicia appears onwebpage 206, such asimage 208 or other visual objects. In some implementations, the webpage data may also include additional information used by the client device to retrieve additional indicia displayed onwebpage 206. For example, the file, "example.html," may include network address information for the location ofimage 208. - The web browser providing display data to display 200 may include a number of navigational controls associated with
webpage 206. For example, the web browser may include the ability to go back or forward to other webpages using inputs 204 (e.g., a back button, a forward button, etc.). In various implementations,inputs 204 may retrieve webpage data again from a content source over a network or may retrieve previously displayed webpage data from a local cache. - The web browser may include a
search utility 216 configured to locate search terms entered into aninput field 218 onwebpage 206.Search utility 216 may be a popup window, a set of tools embedded into the web browser, etc. For example,search utility 216 may be displayed when a dropdown menu is selected to perform a search. In another example,search utility 216 may be displayed on entry of a certain combination of keys (e.g., CTRL+F, etc.). In some implementations,search utility 216 may include abutton 222 configured to hide orclose search utility 216.Input field 218 is configured to receive one or more search terms from an interface device (e.g., a keyboard, a keypad, a touchscreen display, a microphone, etc.).Search utility 216 may search for the one or more search terms onwebpage 206 in response to receiving a search command (e.g., selection of an enter key, selection of a displayed search button, etc.). In some implementations,search utility 216 may provide indicia of the number of matches of the search terms onwebpage 206.Search utility 216 may includenavigation buttons 220 configured to reposition the display ofwebpage 206 ondisplay 200 to focus on a particular instance of a search term onwebpage 206. For example,navigation buttons 220 may be used to search up or down onwebpage 206 until the next matching word is found. In some implementations,search utility 216 may highlight a matching search term onwebpage 206 or provide other visual indicia of a match (e.g., by changing the color of the matching word, by displaying an icon near the matching word, etc.). - In some cases,
webpage 206 may contain text in any number of different languages. For example,webpage 206 may containtext 210 in English,text 212 in Telugu, andtext 214 in Hindi.Texts texts - In some implementations, a default language may be associated with
search utility 216. For example, a default language may be associated with the web browser providing display data to display 200 and/or the operating system running the web browser. In such a case, a search term may be entered intoinput field 218 in the default language using an interface device. For example, the search term, "Hyderabad," may be entered in English intoinput field 218, if English is the default language.Search utility 216 may then be used to search text onwebpage 206 for occurrences of "Hyderabad." - Entry of terms into a search field in a language other than that of the default language may be prevented in some systems or may involve a number of complicated steps. For example, a user wishing to search for the Telugu transliteration of "Hyderabad," i.e.,
- According to various implementations, a search query may be entered in a default language. A language selection may be associated at the individual word or phrase level of the entered search query. For example, a search query of "Hyderabad India" in English may include a selection that the term "Hyderabad" is to be searched in Telugu. Such a methodology allows search terms to be entered without the need for additional software and/or hardware and also supports search queries that include terms in multiple languages.
-
FIG. 3 is anexample process 300 for performing a text search in a non-default language.Process 300 may be utilized, for example, by a web browser, text editor, or other application that displays text, according to various implementations. In some implementations,process 300 may be utilized by a search engine to allow searching for content over a network in a plurality of languages. In some implementations, a system that includes a client and one or more remote devices may utilizeprocess 300 to provide seamless text searching across one or more non-default languages. -
Process 300 includes receiving a search term (block 302). A search query may include one or more search terms. According to various implementations, the one or more search terms in a search query may be received in a default language. For example, if English is the default language for search queries in an application, a search query may be received in English from a QWERTY keyboard, an English-alphabet touchpad, etc. In general, a search query may be used by a search utility (e.g., a search function within an application, a search engine on the Internet, etc.) to locate search terms in the search query within one or more electronic documents. For example, a search query may be used to locate search terms on a displayed webpage or other file containing text. In another example, a search query may be used by a search engine to locate files and other content on a network that contain the search terms. -
Process 300 includes receiving a selection of a language (block 304). A selected language may be associated with one or more search terms in a search query. For example, a first search term may have an associated language of English, a second search term may have an associated language of Telugu, and the remaining search terms may have an associated language of Hindi. In such a case, the various search terms may be used to search in the specified languages. In some implementations, each search term may have a specified language (i.e., searching in the default input language requires a selected search language). In some implementations in which a default language is utilized, only terms that are to be searched in a non-default language may have an associated selected language. In some implementations, one or more search languages may be selected as a default search language. For example, a user may enter search queries in English and specify that searches are to be performed for the entered terms in both English and in Hindi. - A language may be selected in any number of ways. In one implementation, language codes may be used to specify a search language for a term or phrase in the search query. For example, the prefix "te:" may be used to denote that a search term is to be searched in Telugu. In another example, the prefix "hi:" may be used to denote that a search term is to be searched in Hindi. Using such language prefixes, a possible search query may be "hi: airport" to search for the Hindi word for "airport." In some implementations, a language prefix may apply to all terms after the prefix until another prefix is entered. For example, the search query "hi: Mahatma Gandhi" may be used to search for the Hindi words for "Mahatma Gandhi." In some implementations, a search query may be used to search for terms across multiple languages. For example, the search query "te: Indira Gandhi en: Katherine Frank" may be used to search for the Telugu transliteration of "Indira Gandhi" and the phrase "Katherine Frank" in English. Such a query may be used, for example, to search a multilingual webpage for information about the biography of Indira Gandhi written by Katherine Frank.
- In some implementations, the selection of a language may be received from an interface device via selection of an icon, button, or other selectable area of a graphical user interface. For example, a user may be able to select a first button associated with Telugu when entering search terms that are to be searched in Telugu. The user may then select a second button associated with Hindi when entering search terms that are to be searched in Hindi. Other ways of selecting a language are contemplated including receiving a voice command from a microphone, using text suffixes in the search query (e.g., using a search query of "Indira Gandhi -te" to search for "Indira Gandhi" in Telugu), and selecting one or more hotkeys on a keyboard or keypad (e.g., selecting CTRL-ALT-T to search for terms in Telugu and CTRL-ALT-H to search for terms in Hindi).
-
Process 300 includes retrieving a transliteration of the search term in the selected language (block 306). A transliteration database stored in a local memory or accessed over a network may be used to retrieve a transliteration of the search term in the selected language. The transliteration database may contain a mapping of words in the input language to that of the selected language. For example, an English-Telugu database may include an entry that maps the English word, "Hyderabad," to the Telugu word " -
Process 300 includes determining the presence of the transliterated term (block 308). In implementations in which the search utility is part of an application, the presence of the transliterated term in an electronic document may be determined. For example, a displayed webpage may be searched for the transliterated term by a web browser. In another example, a text editor or other application for viewing documents may search a document for the presence of the transliterated term. In implementations in which the search utility is a search engine, a ranking algorithm may be used to determine a set of one or more network addresses of electronic documents that contain some or all of the search terms. - In some implementations, search terms in two or more languages may be searched using a single search query. For example, a webpage may be searched for some search terms in Hindi and other search terms in English. One of the search languages may or may not be the default language in which the search terms were entered. For example, search terms may be entered in English, if English is the default language for the search. However, the search may be performed in one or more languages other than English, depending on the selected languages. In some implementations, a search may be performed for a term in both the default language and in a selected language. For example, a search query of "te: Hyderabad" may be used in some implementations to search for "Hyderabad" in both Telugu and in English. In other implementations, a primary input language and one or more other default search languages may be selected. For example, a user may be able to specify that English is to be used to enter search terms and that the terms are to be searched in both English and Hindi if a language is not selected, by default.

FIG. 4 shows display 200 displaying a web browser configured to search for text in multiple languages. As shown,webpage 206 containingtexts display 200.Search utility 216 may be configured to accept search terms in a default language and one or more language selections for the search terms, according to various implementations. For example,input field 218 may utilize English as the default input language. Thus, a user entering a search query intoinput field 218 may do so in a single language, reducing the number of steps required to search for text in a non-default language. For example,search terms -
Search utility 216 may also be configured to receive a selection of a language for one or more ofsearch terms language selection 404 may specify thatsearch term 406 is to be searched in Hindi, while alanguage selection 408 may specify thatsearch term 410 is to be searched in Telugu. In some implementations,search utility 216 may be configured to search in the default language and/or in other default search languages, if no language selection is associated with a search term. For example,search term 402 may be searched in the default language of English, if no language selection is associated withsearch term 402. In another example,search term 402 may be searched in both English and Telugu, if English and Telugu are both selected as default search languages. -
Search utility 216 may retrieve transliterated search terms from one or more transliteration databases using a search term and a selected language. In one implementation, a transliteration database may be stored in the memory of the client device that provide display data to display 200. For example, the transliteration database may be part of the web browser application displayed ondisplay 200. In another implementation,search utility 216 may be configured to access a remote transliteration database over a network, to retrieve transliterations of the search terms. For example, a transliteration database may be provided as a resource on the Internet by the manufacturer of the web browser or another entity. In such a case,search utility 216 may be configured to send a transliteration request to the remote database and to receive the transliterated search terms. In some implementations, a search term ininput field 218 may be replaced with its retrieved transliteration. In other implementations, some or all of the originally entered search query may appear ininput field 218 after a transliterated term is retrieved. -
Search utility 216 may be configured to utilize a search query and one or more selected languages entered viainput field 218, to determine the presence of search terms and/or transliterated search terms onwebpage 206. For example, texts 210, 212, 214 may be searched for the word "born" in English, the word "India" in Hindi, and the word "Hyderabad" in Telugu. In some implementations, a search query may only search for a conjunctive phrase. For example,search utility 216 may only search for the full set of entered search terms to determine if the terms appear in sequence onwebpage 206. In some implementations, words or phrases of a search query entered intoinput field 218 may be searched individually onwebpage 206. For example,search term 402 may be matched intext 210,search term 402 may be matched intext 214, andsearch term 410 may be matched intext 212. - In some implementations search
utility 216 may provide visual indicia ondisplay 200 regarding the results of the text search. For example,search utility 216 may display the number of matches of search terms on webpage 206 (e.g., a count of how many times a search term, phrase, or query appears on webpage 206). In some implementations,navigation buttons 220 may be used to cycle among matching terms onwebpage 206. Indicia may also be displayed onwebpage 206 to signify a matching term. For example, search term 402 (e.g., the English word "born") may be highlighted intext 210, to signify a term match. Indicia of matches with transliterated search terms may also be displayed onwebpage 206. For example, the Hindi transliteration of search term 406 (e.g., the English word "India") may be highlighted intext 214 and the Telugu transliteration of search term 410 (e.g., the English word "Hyderabad") may be highlighted intext 212. In other implementations, indicia of a match may be a coloration of a matching term, an icon, a cursor position, or any other form of visually indicating that a search term has been found in an electronic document. -
FIG. 5 shows display 200 displaying a web browser providing a suggested transliterated search term. In some implementations,search utility 216 may be configured to provide a display of suggested terms and/or to display transliterated terms for review. Suggested search terms may, for example, reduce the amount of input needed for a user to enter a search query. Suggesting search terms and/or displaying transliterated search terms for review may also allow a user to correct spelling errors in the search query, during entry of a search query. - In some implementations,
search utility 216 is configured to suggest one or more search terms viafield 508.Field 508 may be a dropdown box, a popup window, or any other form of visual field to convey suggested terms to the user viadisplay 200.Field 508 may provide suggested terms during or after the entry of a search term in the default language or in a selected language, according to various implementations. In one example, a search term 504 (e.g., "Hyderabad") may be partially entered with a language selection 502 (e.g.,cursor 506 is directly adjacent to the search term being entered). During entry ofsearch term 504,field 508 may display one or more suggested terms. The terms displayed infield 508 may be in the default language or in another language, if a non-default language has been specified. For example, entry of "Hyder" intoinput field 218 ofsearch utility 216 may causefield 508 to display "Hyderabad" in English or in Telugu as a suggestion. Selection of a suggested search term may causesearch utility 216 to automatically complete the text ininput field 218 in the default language or in a specified language, according to various implementations. - Suggested terms may be retrieved by referencing the entered portion of a search term in a database of terms stored locally or over a network. For example, a list of most commonly used words or phrases that begin with the same letters as those entered may be retrieved from the database. In some implementations, a corrected spelling may be suggested. For example, "Hyderabad" may be suggested in
field 508 on entry of "Hybera" ininput field 218 ofsearch utility 216. Corrected spelling suggestions may also be presented in a non-default language, if one is selected. For example, entry of "te: Hybera" may also cause the Telugu word for "Hyderabad" to appear infield 508. - In some implementations,
field 508 or the like may allow a user to review a transliterated search term after entry of a search term ininput field 218. For example, after the user places a space between the end of a search term and the beginning of the next term (e.g., there exists a space betweencursor 506 and the end of the previously entered search term), a transliterated search term may be retrieved and presented infield 508 for review. The user may choose to revise the search term entered intoinput field 218, if the transliterated term infield 508 is not the intended term or phrase. In this way, a user is able to review and revise search terms during entry of the search query. - In some implementations, a transliterated term may be presented in
input field 218 after entry of a search term. For example, entry of "te: Hyderabad" ininput field 218 may cause the Telugu word to appear directly ininput field 218. Selection of a backspace button may cause the originally entered term (e.g., in the default input language) to reappear. In this way, spelling mistakes may be corrected in the default input language and the transliterated search term can also be verified by the user. - In some implementations, the functionality of
search utility 216 may be integrated intofield 202. For example,field 202 may be associated with a search engine and accept search terms, in addition to resource names or network addresses. The search terms entered intofield 202 may be passed to the associated search engine, thereby returning results to the web browser (e.g., replacing displayedwebpage 206 with the search results). The search results may, for example, be a listing of hyperlinks to webpages that contain text corresponding to the search terms entered intofield 202 in the selected languages. - While some implementations are described herein with reference to performing text searching in a webpage, it is to be appreciated that other implementations may also utilize the described methodologies. In some implementations,
search utility 216 may be part of a text editor or other application configured to display a document. For example,search utility 216 may be integrated into a spreadsheet application to allow multilingual searches to be performed. In other implementations, the functionality ofsearch utility 216 may be integrated into an Internet search engine to allow searching for Internet content in multiple languages using a single input language to enter a search query. - Implementations of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
