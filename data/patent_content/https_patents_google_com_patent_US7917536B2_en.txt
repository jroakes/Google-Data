- the data storage management system 10 includes a central monitoring system 12 that is in communication with a plurality of remotely located data storage systems 14 at respective customer locations via a communications network 15 , such as the Internet.
- the central monitoring system 12 is located at a geographical location that is different from the geographical locations of the customer data storage systems 14 .
- a remote agent system 16 is located at each customer data storage system 14 and with the central monitoring system 12 via the communications network 15 .
- Each remote agent system 16 is configured to collect data from a respective data storage system 14 , convert the collected data to a standardized format, consolidate the standardized format data and store the collected data in a central data repository (e.g., a database) associated with the central monitoring system 12 .
- a central data repository e.g., a database
- the illustrated data storage management system 10 also includes a plurality of customer portals 20 .
- Each customer portal 20 is associated with a respective one of the customer data storage systems 14 and with the central monitoring system 12 .
- Each customer portal 20 provides customer access to information about the customer's data storage system 14 , and allows customer control and configuration of the data storage system 14 .
- each customer portal 20 provides users with web-based access to system performance information and status, and can be used to request services and make system changes. Customized to the desires and needs of each individual customer, the data storage management system 10 appears to the customer, via a respective customer portal 20 , as a dedicated private storage management service.
- the illustrated data storage management system 10 allows multiple independent customers to efficiently utilize the knowledge, skills, and services of a shared pool of data storage experts without relinquishing control of their respective data storage systems.
- Embodiments of the present invention can result in higher quality of service and lower management costs than any one customer could achieve on their own.
- the illustrated data storage management system 10 utilizes a combination of distributed intelligent networks, human expertise, and automated systems to manage multiple third party data storage systems.
- a central staff of storage specialists at the central monitoring system 12 monitor data feeds and system status information originating from the various remote data storage systems 14 . When system faults occur, the central staff initiates corrective action to clear the faults and maintain systems operations.
- the information collected from the various data storage systems is analyzed for recognizable patterns that precede and can indicate developing fault situations at the remote data storage systems 14 . These patterns are then programmed into the data storage management system 10 to trigger predictive alarms that enable the central staff to take preemptive measures necessary to avoid disruptions in service.
- Customers can access information regarding their specific data storage systems 14 and request changes and services through a respective customer portal 20 that utilizes an individually customized interface and appearance of a dedicated management system.
- Each remote agent system 16 provides a single point of contact for the collection and consolidation of information available from multiple systems and data sources at a respective customer data storage system 14 . This information is then translated into a common data format used by the central monitoring system 12 . Providing a layer of abstraction and isolation between the central monitoring system 12 and site specific equipment configuration, this allows each remote agent system to be customized to the needs, desires, and system configuration of each particular customer. This level of isolation serves to reduce risks as component, software, or configuration changes at any one customer site are isolated and have minimal impact on the operation of the overall service.
- Each remote agent system 16 may also be configured to apply intelligent pattern recognition and data filtering algorithms to assure that only relevant information is sent to the central monitoring system 12 . This can reduce the data load on staff at the central monitoring system 12 , thereby expanding the number of remote data storage systems 14 that can be supported by a given level of resources.
- Data storage devices at a customer site 14 may include, but are not limited to: individual drives; cabinet controller boards; network communication switches; host bus adaptors; routers; patch panels; power sources; server hardware; operating systems; and application software.
- Information from data storage devices at a customer site 14 may be “in band” (i.e., the management control path follows the same path as the data path) and “out of band” (i.e., the management control path is separated from the data path) and may include, but are not limited to: internal ASCII data logs, SNMP available management information base (MIB) instrumentation, configuration data available from console ports, device and application instrumentation, and software API (application programming interface) accessible status.
- MIB SNMP available management information base
- Each remote agent system 16 provides a single point of contact for multiple independent information sources at a customer site, thereby eliminating the need for a technician to manually collect information from the various devices.
- Each remote agent system 16 includes application software, operating system(s), and a dedicated hardware (e.g., personal computer) platform bundled into a secure dedicated subsystem.
- Each remote agent system 16 is located in close proximity to a customer's data storage system 14 and may use a variety of communication techniques to automatically collect and pre-processes status and operational information from the various components of the customer's data storage system 14 .
- this information is consolidated, filtered, converted into a standardized format, and then automatically reported to the central monitoring system 12 by a remote agent system 16 using secure communications technologies (e.g., secured sockets layer, etc.).
- secure communications technologies e.g., secured sockets layer, etc.
- These policies and scripts embody a level of intelligent decision making allowing the filtering and formatting processes to be dynamic and dependent upon the recent system events and current system status.
- This intelligent dynamic processing serves to assure only appropriate and desired information about activities, performance and system health is communicated to the central monitoring system 12 , thereby optimizing bandwidth utilization while minimizing processing load at the central monitoring system 12 . This reduction in data load serves to expand overall system scalability and efficiency.
- each remote agent system 16 to intelligently determine which information needs to be filtered allows for automatic and dynamic adjustment of data reporting based on current status and events.
- the algorithms contained in these scripts, policies, and processing software may continually evolve over time based on the collective experience and knowledge gained from managing numerous heterogeneous data storage systems across diverse environments.
- each remote agent system 16 is implemented as data collections software resident on a secured unattended processing platform located near and connected to the storage equipment of a customer site being managed.
- This software may be in addition to third party functional software such as tape back-up software, etc.
- FIG. 2 illustrates exemplary components of a remote agent system 16 , according to embodiments of the present invention.
- Each remote agent system 16 may include one to “n” applications 16 a , each with its own one to “n” database 16 b , one to “n” log file 16 c , and one to “n” instrumentation file 16 d , such as configuration, status, or SNMP MIB.
- there may applications located on devices 17 external to the remote agent system 16 but reachable through networks and other communication connections. These external devices 17 may be from multiple independent vendors, may use proprietary data formats, and may be incompatible with each other in that they do not interact but provide stand alone functionality.
- Each remote agent system 16 can collect, consolidate, and assimilate meaningful content from all of the types of information sources illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- each remote agent system 16 utilizes a flexible, multi-tier architecture to provide multiple points of data consolidation and abstraction from proprietary data formats.
- each remote agent system 16 includes one or more element information managers (EIMs) 30 , one or more service information managers (SIMs) 32 , one or more platform information manager (PIMs) 34 , and an activity director 36 that is configured to communicate with each EIM 30 , SIM 32 and PIM 34 and to instruct each EIM 30 , SIM 32 and PIM 34 as to what information to collect and store.
- EIMs element information managers
- SIMs service information managers
- PIMs platform information manager
- each EIM 30 is configured to communicate with a respective data source at a remotely located data storage system and to identify, filter and convert storage metadata from the data source to a standardized format.
- one EIM 30 may be configured to communicate with and extract data from Veritas® Log File version 6 while another EIM 30 may be configured for the Veritas® Tape Catalog file version 6 .
- metadata is a definition or description of data.
- a remote agent system 16 obtains, converts and sends to a central monitoring system 12 , data that describes the condition or state of actual data stored at a remotely located data storage system.
- the EIM's 30 are created and configured for specialized interaction within various useful system elements. For example, one EIM may integrate with a single aspect of a broader backup and restore platform for purposes of gathering metadata on all system aspects, another may interact to gather metadata associated with transactional events, thru another EIM, configuration settings and yet another EIM, media management.
- Each SIM 32 is configured to communicate with EIMs 30 associated with common data applications. For example a SIM 32 associated with Veritas® applications would communicate with and manage EIMs 30 for all Veritas® application data components at a particular customer site 14 .
- Each PIM 34 is configured to communicate with and handle SIMs 32 associated with a common data application platform (e.g., Veritas® NetBackup, Avamar, etc.). Separate information managers are written for each information source at a customer site 14 . This layered approach allows for minimal system impact and required code changes should any one element of a customer's data storage system change.
- a common data application platform e.g., Veritas® NetBackup, Avamar, etc.
- An activity director 36 (e.g., a database) is configured to communicate with each EIM 30 , SIM 32 and PIM 34 and to instruct each EIM 30 , SIM 32 and PIM 34 as to what information to collect and store.
- Each information manager (EIM, SIM, PIM) creates a standardized output which contains a different level of summation and detail.
- the data logging activity from individual modules and levels is parameter driven by information contained in an activity director 36 .
- Modules are entities acting as aggregating points for the various levels of information managers. Levels correspond to the hierarchy of depth and type of information needed. Input and output is controlled thru the activity director as a means for coordinating and correlating pertinent information.
- Each individual module reads information contained in this file to determine what action it should take in regards to collecting and writing of information to a buffer log file 38 .
- the level of detail collected and logged is therefore dynamically controlled by how the parameters in the activity director 36 are configured.
- a remote agent system 16 may also include pattern recognition logic as well as the control for what information is sent to the central monitoring system 12 .
- pattern recognition logic as well as the control for what information is sent to the central monitoring system 12 .
- a programmed course of action is initiated. This could include anything from the generation of an alarm to dynamic changes in the reporting and recording of details at a customer site 14 .
- a remote agent system 16 may contain command modules for each application and device being monitored by the data storage management system 10 .
- Command modules are capable of accepting commands issued electronically from the central monitoring system 12 , and delivering those commands to the appropriate piece of equipment at a customer's data storage system.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary standard format into which data from a customer site has been converted into, according to embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 6 illustrates how a remote agent system 16 converts data into a standardized format and filters data, according to embodiments of the present invention.
- a remote agent system 16 accesses platform elements at a customer site and extracts pertinent metadata (Block 80 ).
- the remote agent system 16 transforms the extracted metadata as necessary (Block 82 ). If operations at a customer site are determined to be successful (Block 84 ), the remote agent system 16 catalogs pertinent metadata, forwards to the central monitoring system 12 and archives a buffered set of metadata (Block 86 ).
- the remote agent system 16 classifies the failure conditions at the customer site for corrective action (Block 88 ) and interacts with an alerting system to make failure conditions known (Block 90 ).
- a remote agent system 16 functions to capture, transform, correlate and filter metadata.
- the individual element managers interact with systems information to extract metadata. That metadata is then transformed based on pre-defined algorithms.
- Condition-based pattern matching is employed to correlate metadata structures between various EIMs.
- any extraneous metadata is filtered from the metadata stream.
- a central monitoring system 12 receives and processes data received from each remote agent system 16 .
- the information is either logged into an appropriate database or, in the case of an identified system fault at a customer site 14 , converted to an alert.
- System faults at a customer data storage system 14 may include hardware problems, component problems, device level problems, application problems, and networking issues, and can span the full range of all systems that encompass service delivery. For any new services, development and integration are performed at both the EIM level and System Fault level. System Faults are aggregated, correlated and filtered to provide unique, actionable support issues. These actionable faults are logged, displayed in human-readable presentation formats and automatically integrated in an automated ticketing system.
- FIG. 7 sets forth a non-exhaustive list of possible system faults at a customer site 14 .
- alerts are immediately communicated to the central monitoring system 12 where a specialist can review and take action, if necessary. Communication can be any combination of e-mail, display, printed log, pager or other means known to those skilled in the art.
- the monitoring specialist may respond to an event by requesting additional information required, and initiating appropriate intervention measures.
- the central monitoring system 12 monitors when each event is reported, when each event is acknowledged by a specialist, what action is initiated, and when the fault was closed (e.g., when a fault condition is rectified at a customer site 14 ).
- the central monitoring system 12 may use historical trend and configuration data to go beyond identification of current system faults by using pattern recognition and artificial intelligence to identify emerging problems at a customer site 14 .
- This allows a system specialist to proactively initiate preventative measures.
- inbound data is processed to identify patterns of activities and events that are known to indicate developing system issues.
- These databases act as a logical metadata storage repository for the on-going input of remote agent metadata.
- the metadata repository is a consolidation point acting across multiple technologies (i.e., types of remote agents) and geographic locations. As metadata is loaded into this repository, there is an archiving effect supporting the multi-generational history of metadata, across service technologies and physical locations. This allows root causes to be quickly isolated and resolved before system performance problems can impact business operations of a customer.
- Pattern recognition algorithms and identified patterns are constantly being refined and revised to reflect new equipment, configurations, and experience gained from the ongoing management of a population of diverse remote storage system configurations.
- the present invention is advantageous because the central monitoring system 12 allows for a small number of specialists to easily manage a large number of customer data storage systems 14 . Whenever intervention is required, a specialist at the central monitoring system 12 is alerted to initiate appropriate interventions.
- the course of action may range from automatic correction, to dispatching instructions to an on-site technician at a customer's data storage system 14 , or a simple notification to the customer's own internal support staff.
- the selected course of action may be policy based and driven by the individual desires and agreement with each customer.
- the central monitoring system 12 can be utilized to provide quality assurance monitoring when hands-on intervention is required at a customer site to change a cable, replace a board, or manually adjust or replace some other piece of equipment. While a variety of techniques may be employed, they can be combined to allow a less skilled third party provide the required service without clouding the issues of overall responsibility or liability for system performance. According to embodiments of the present invention, the central monitoring system 12 automatically issues an activity dispatch when intervention is required, and closes the ticket when action is verified to have been completed. During this activity window, a customer's data storage system is monitored for the expected patterns of messages and alerts as the required work is performed.
- additional levels of supervision can be employed through the use of real time audio and video monitoring, as well as the use of step by step scripted directives issued by a specialist at the central monitoring system 12 .
- An example would be the use of video and voice over IP to a handheld PDA equipped with a Web camera and wireless LAN card. Communication can occur over an established network infrastructure and step by step commands can be given from the central monitoring system 12 .
- Real time audio and video feedback from the handheld PDA camera allows a specialist at the central monitoring system 12 to verify that the work is being performed correctly by a specialist at the customer's site 14 .
- preemptive measures can be taken by the central monitoring system in response to identifying data patterns that indicate potential problems at a customer's data storage system 14 .
- Broad categories include hardware, software, network which are further broken down by platform and device, type of software package and topology. For example, if a system backup at a customer's data storage system 14 fails, an automated response from the central monitoring system 12 can automatically restart the backup. If the backup fails again, an error code can be assigned and transmitted by an EIM 30 and remote agent system 16 to the central monitoring system 12 . The failure is then correlated and presented to a central alerting system at the central monitoring system where it classified and prioritized and is visible to human support staff, as well as automatically updated, depending on severity, to a ticketing system. If corrective action is not taken within a defined time period, the issue may be automatically escalated thru a parallel escalation scheme of technical support personnel and other contacts.
- each customer portal 20 provides customer access to an event mediation database 40 and a personality database 42 .
- the event mediation database 40 contains the associated events needed for customer reporting and billing.
- the information viewed through a customer portal 20 is filtered and presented according to the policies defined in the personality data base 42 for the particular customer. These policies define the information presented, as well as the branding and layout of web presentation pages, or any automated data feeds to other systems.
- the approach allows a unique and customized presentation to be developed for each customer. Presentations supported not only include web pages but XML data feeds to other external third party or custom systems.
- a customer portal 20 may also contain an n-tier reporting approach. Structured in a hierarchy based on location, customer, and channel partner, each higher layer is only able to view information relevant to their position in the hierarchy.
- a channel partner refers to the business relationship established in an indirect sales model whereby a service is sold indirectly to an end user thru a specialized party (i.e., a “channel partner”).
- individual customers can only view information relevant to their site (i.e., customers can only view information relevant to their equipment, and data storage service providers can only view information relevant to the customers they service).
- a customer portal 20 contains an interface that allows a customer to request changes in service or systems, or to engage interaction and support from a data storage management specialist.
- a remote agent system at a remotely located data storage system collects data from a remotely located data storage system (Block 100 ), converts the collected data to a standardized format (Block 110 ), and consolidates the converted, collected data (Block 120 ).
- the remote agent system may also analyze the collected data to identify data patterns that precede fault conditions at the remotely located data storage system (Block 130 ) and may initiate corrective actions if any such data patterns are identified (Block 140 ). Corrective actions initiated by the remote agent system may include communicating corrective action information to a third party (Block 145 ).
- the remote agent system may filter collected data to reduce the amount of collected data (Block 150 ).
- the remote agent system sends the collected data to a central monitoring system where the data is stored in a data repository (Block 160 ).
- the central monitoring system analyzes the collected data to identify data patterns that precede fault conditions at the remotely located data storage system (Block 170 ) and may initiate corrective actions if any such data patterns are identified (Block 180 ). Corrective actions initiated by the central monitoring system may include communicating corrective action information to a third party and/or to the remote agent system (Block 185 ).
