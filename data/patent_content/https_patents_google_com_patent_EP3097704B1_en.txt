Description
- A computing device may have access to a large quantity of data files stored locally and/or remotely from the computing device. Such a computing device may present a user interface that provides a representation of the different data files that the computing device has access to at a particular time. The computing device may detect input associated with the user interface intended to locate one or more such data files. Such interaction may not always quickly or efficiently locate the particular data file(s) that the user wishes to interact with at a particular time, however.
US 2010/216402 discloses a method that allows a device to be customized based on the proximity of colleagues, friends and family to enable smarter collaboration between people. The method allows common interactions to be carried out automatically by the device, without user intervention, whenever another device comes into range of the device.US 2013/046770 discloses a method for predicting an interaction between a recipient user and a target user; the method determines a score for information items, where the information items contain information about the target user, and a higher relevance score indicates that an information item assists the recipient user in the interaction with the target user.WO 2013/188682 discloses a method for sharing information with users; the method involves receiving a set of data items that is analysed based on a first set of criteria to obtain a subset of the set of data items that is a likely candidate for sharing. The subset of the set of data items and a subset of the set of users are presented together to a first user. - The invention is related to methods according to

FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating example operations of an example computing device that identifies one or more data files that may be of interest to a user, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. - In general, techniques of this disclosure may enable a computing device to automatically identify or "predict" one or more data files that may be of interest to a user of the computing device at a particular time. The computing device may automatically identify the one or more data files based on contextual information associated with the user of the computing device and/or users of other nearby (e.g., physically proximate) computing devices. The computing device may automatically predict, based on the contextual information, which one or more data files that the user is likely to access at a particular time and output a graphical indication of the identified or predicted data files.
- When the computing device determines that other computing devices are within a threshold distance of the location of the computing device, the computing device may infer that the user of the computing device and the respective other users of the other computing devices are physically proximate to one another (e.g., in a collaborative environment). The computing device may predict that the one or more data files that the user is likely to access at a particular time are the one or more data files that have attributes associated with the user of the computing device, the other nearby users, the particular time, the location of the computing device, or any combination thereof. In examples where the computing device determines that the user of the computing device and the other users are physically proximate to one another (e.g., in a collaborative environment), the computing device may output a graphical indication of the one or more data files that the computing device predicts will be accessed by the user when collaborating with the other users at the particular time rather than require the user to navigate through a graphical user interface (e.g., of a file system) to access one or more data files.
- Throughout the disclosure, examples are described where a computing device and/or a computing system may analyze information (e.g., locations, speeds, calendars, communications, etc.) associated with the computing device and/or the computing system only if the computing device and/or the computing system receives permission from the user to analyze the information. For example, in situations discussed below in which the computing device and/or the computing system may collect or may make use of contextual information associated with a user and/or contextual information associated with a computing device, the user may be provided with an opportunity to provide input to control whether programs or features of the computing device and/or the computing system can collect and make use of user information (e.g., information about a user's current location, current speed, etc.), or to dictate whether and/or how to the computing device may receive content that may be relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used by the computing device and/or the computing system, so that personally-identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined about the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the computing device and/or the computing system.

FIG. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example computing system that identifies one or more data files that may be of interest to a user, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Computing system 1 ofFIG. 1 is an example computing system that includescomputing device 10,computing devices 8A-8N (collectively, "computing devices 8"),information server system 60, andnetwork 30. -
Network 30 represents any public or private communication network, for instance, a cellular, Wi-Fi, and/or other type of network for transmitting data between computing devices. Computing devices 8,computing device 10, andinformation server system 60 may each send and receive data acrossnetwork 30 using any suitable communication techniques. For example,computing device 8A may be operatively coupled tonetwork 30 usingnetwork link 32A, andcomputing device 8N may be operatively coupled tonetwork 30 usingnetwork link 32N.Information server system 60 may be operatively coupled tonetwork 30 bynetwork link 32X andcomputing device 10 may be operatively coupled tonetwork 30 usingnetwork link 32Y.Network 30 may include network hubs, network switches, network routers, etc., that are operatively inter-coupled thereby providing for the exchange of information between computing devices 8,computing device 10 andinformation server system 60. In some examples,network links 32A-32N, 32X, and 32Y (collectively, "network links 32") may be Ethernet, ATM or other network connections. Such connections may be wireless and/or wired connections. -
Information server system 60 represents any suitable remote computing system, such as one or more desktop computers, laptop computers, mainframes, servers, cloud computing systems, etc. capable of sending and receiving information acrossnetwork link 32X tonetwork 30. In some examples, information server system represents a host server for a file system or data storage service.Computing device 10 and/or computing devices 8 may access a file system or data storage service hosted byinformation server system 60 for transmitting and/or receiving information associated with one or more data files between platforms, applications, and services executing atcomputing devices 8 and 10. In some examples,information server system 60 represents a cloud computing system that provides file system or data storage services throughnetwork 30 to one or more ofcomputing devices 8 and 10 that access the file system or data storage services via access to the cloud provided byinformation server system 60. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,information server system 60 includes remote file service module 62 anddevice context module 64.Modules 62 and 64 may perform operations described using software, hardware, firmware, or a mixture of hardware, software, and firmware residing in and/or executing atinformation server system 60.Information server system 60 may executemodules 62 and 64 with multiple processors or multiple devices.Information server system 60 may executemodules 62 and 64 as virtual machines executing on underlying hardware.Modules 62 and 64 may execute as one or more services of an operating system or computing platform.Modules 62 and 64 may execute as one or more executable programs at an application layer of a computing platform. - Remote file service module 62 may perform functions related to hosting a remote file system or data storage service that provides access to one or more data files stored by
information server system 60 and accessible to one or more remote computing devices (e.g., computing devices 8 and 10) via commands or requests transmitted overnetwork 30 bycomputing devices 8 and 10. For example, remote file service module 62 may receive and respond to requests for access to one or more data files managed by the remote file system or data storage service ofinformation server system 60. Remote file service module 62 may respond to a request received fromfile manager module 22 by outputting, for transmission to computingdevice 10, an indication of one or more data files maintained byinformation server system 60. Remote file service module 62 may process a request received fromfile manager module 22 by performing read, write, etc. operations on the one or more data files. - In some examples, remote file service module 62 may perform operations related to identifying or "predicting" one or more data files that a user of a computing device (e.g., computing device 10) may likely access at a particular time. For examples, remote file service module 62 may include similar features or capabilities of
file manager module 22 andfile identifier module 24 described herein. Remote file service module 62 may use the similar features or capabilities offile manager module 22 andfile identifier module 24 to determine one or more data files being managed and/or stored by remote file service module 62 and identified or "predicted", by remote file service module 62, to be accessed by the user of the computing device at the particular time. Remote file service module 62 may output one or more indications (e.g., packets of data, memory pointers to data, file names, file locations, etc.) of the one or more data files that remote file service module 62 determines may be accessed by the user of the computing device at the particular time.
As used herein, a particular time (e.g., an hour, a minute, a calendar day, a calendar month, etc.) may correspond to a current time of day associated with a computing device or system or a future time of day associated with the computing device or system.Device context module 64 may provide a device contextual information service that transmits contextual information (e.g., respective locations, direction, speed, velocity, orientation, etc.) to computingdevice 10 in response to receiving a request from one ofcomputing device 10 for data specifying the state or physical operating environment of computing devices 8. For example,device context module 64 may determine respective physical locations associated with each of computing devices 8 and update the respective physical locations asdevice context module 64 detects respective movement associated with each of computing devices 8 over time.Device context module 64 may respond to a request fromfile identifier module 24 ofcomputing device 10 for contextual information associated with computing devices 8 by outputting, for transmission tocomputing device 10, data maintained bydevice context module 64 that specifies the contextual information (e.g., respective locations) associated with computing devices 8. - As used throughout the disclosure, the term "contextual information" is used to describe information that can be used by a computing system and/or computing device, such as
information server system 60 andcomputing device 10, to determine one or more environmental characteristics associated with computing devices and/or users of computing devices, such as past, current, and future physical locations, degrees of movement, weather conditions, traffic conditions, patterns of travel, and the like. In some examples, contextual information may include sensor information obtained by one or more sensors (e.g., gyroscopes, accelerometers, proximity sensors, etc.) ofcomputing devices 8 and 10, radio transmission information obtained from one or more communication units and/or radios (e.g., global positioning system (GPS), cellular, Wi-Fi, etc.) ofcomputing devices 8 and 10, information obtained by one or more input devices (e.g., cameras, microphones, keyboards, touchpads, mice,UID 12, etc.) ofcomputing devices 8 and 10, and network/device identifier information (e.g., a network name, a device internet protocol address, etc.). - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,computing device 10 is a laptop computer while computing devices 8 are mobile phones or tablet computers. However, in other examples,computing devices 8 and 10 may be any combination of tablet computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDA), desktop computers, laptop computers, gaming systems, media players, e-book readers, television platforms, automobile navigation systems, wearable computing device (e.g., a computerized watch, computerized eyewear, computerized gloves, etc.), or any other types of mobile and/or non-mobile computing devices that are configured to communicate (e.g., transmit and receive data) across a network, such asnetwork 30. - As shown in
FIG. 1 ,computing device 10 includes user interface device (UID) 12.UID 12 ofcomputing device 10 may function as an input and/or output device for computingdevice 10.UID 12 may be implemented using various technologies. For instance,UID 12 may function as an input device using a presence-sensitive input screen, such as a resistive touchscreen, a surface acoustic wave touchscreen, a capacitive touchscreen, a projective capacitance touchscreen, a pressure sensitive screen, an acoustic pulse recognition touchscreen, or another presence-sensitive display technology.UID 12 may function as an output (e.g., display) device using any one or more display devices, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), a dot matrix display, a light emitting diode (LED) display, an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, an e-ink, or a similar monochrome or color display capable of outputting visible information to a user ofcomputing device 10. -
UID 12 may include a presence-sensitive display that may receive tactile input from a user.UID 12 may receive indications of tactile input by detecting one or more gestures from a user (e.g., as a user touches or points to one or more locations ofUID 12 with a finger or a stylus pen).UID 12 may present output to a user, for instance at a presence-sensitive display.UID 12 may present the output as a graphical user interface (e.g., user interface 14), which may be associated with functionality provided by computingdevice 10. For example,UID 12 may present various user interfaces related to the functionality of computing platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing at or accessible by computing device 10 (e.g., electronic message applications, Internet browser applications, mobile or desktop operating systems, etc.). A user may interact with a user interface to causecomputing device 10 to perform operations relating to functions (e.g., to access one or more data files using computing device 10). -
Computing device 10 may include user interface ("UI")module 20,file manager module 22, andfile identifier module 24.Modules computing device 10.Computing device 10 may executemodules Computing device 10 may executemodules computing device 10.Modules computing device 10.Modules computing device 10.UID 12 andmodules device 10, for instance, as one or more network services operating atnetwork 30 in a network cloud. -
UI module 20 may causeUID 12 to output user interface 14 (or other example user interface) for display, as a user ofcomputing device 10 views output and/or provides input atUID 12.UI module 20 andUID 12 may receive one or more indications of input from a user as the user interacts withuser interface 14, at different times and when the user andcomputing device 10 are at different locations.UI module 20 andUID 12 may interpret inputs detected at UID 12 (e.g., as a user provides one or more gestures at one or more locations ofUID 12 at whichuser interfaces 14 are displayed) and may relay information about the inputs detected atUID 12 to one or more associated platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing atcomputing device 10, to causecomputing device 10 to perform functions. For instance, while in proximity to an office location, a user ofcomputing device 10 may interact withuser interface 14 by providing input atUID 12 to predominantly access one or more work related data files.UI module 20 andUID 12 may receive indications of the input and process the input as input related touser interface 14.UI module 20 may send data associated with the received input tofile manager module 22 for further interpretation. -
UI module 20 may receive information and instructions from one or more associated platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing at computing device 10 (e.g.,file manager module 22 , etc.) for generatinguser interfaces 14. In addition,UI module 20 may act as an intermediary between the one or more associated platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing atcomputing device 10 and various output devices of computing device 10 (e.g., speakers, LED indicators, audio or electrostatic haptic output device, etc.) to produce output (e.g., a graphic, a flash of light, a sound, a haptic response, etc.) withcomputing device 10. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,user interface 14 is a graphical user interface associated with a file system ofcomputing device 10.User interface 14 includes graphical indications ofstacks 16A through 16N (collectively, "stacks 16") and graphical indications of data files 18A-18C (collectively, "data files 18"). - Each of stacks 16 represents a graphical representation of a grouping or "stack" of two or more data files that each share one or more common attributes. For example each data file in stack 16Amay share a common location tag, user author tag, portion of content, etc. In some instances, the data files of each of stacks 16 may share a common association with an application, platform, or service executing at
computing device 10. In some examples, the data files of each one of stacks 16 may be stored within a common directory of a file system or at a common hierarchical level of a file system. - Each of data files 18 represents a data file that
computing device 10 identifies or predicts to be accessed by a user ofcomputing device 10 at a particular time. Dotted arrows (which in some examples may or may not be displayed by UID 12) indicate from where (e.g., which one of stacks 16) that each of data files 18 originated. For example,UI module 20 may causeUID 12 to output graphical indications ofdata files stack 16A andUI module 20 may causeUID 12 to output a graphical indication of data file 18C that originates fromstack 16N. In some examples, each graphical indication of data files 18 may appear to "peek" out from a corresponding one of stacks 16. In other words, each graphical indication of data files 18 may appear withinuser interface 14 as a card that appears at least partially separated from a corresponding one of stacks 16 to indicate to a user ofcomputing device 10 which of data files 18 thatcomputing device 10 identifies or predicts may be accessed by the user at a particular time. -
User interface 14 may include various other types of graphical indications such as visual depictions of data file content, data file attributes, etc.UI module 20 may receive graphical information (e.g., text data, images data, etc.) for presentinguser interface 14 as input fromfile manager module 22 along with instructions fromfile manager module 22 for presenting the graphical information as graphical indications of stacks 16 and data files 18 withinuser interfaces 14 atUID 12. Based on the graphical information and the instructions received fromfile manager module 22,UI module 20 may causeUID 12 to present graphical indications of stacks 16 and data files 18 withinuser interfaces 14 to alert a user ofcomputing device 10 to one or more data files thatcomputing device 10 identifies or predicts, based on contextual information received by computingdevice 10, may be accessed at a particular time. -
File manager module 22 may perform operations for accessing (e.g., reading, writing, etc.), managing, and otherwise handling the storage and/or retrieval of individual data files that are accessible by computingdevice 10 and that may be stored locally at computingdevice 10 and/or remotely to computing device 10 (e.g., at information server system 60). For example,file manager module 22 may manage a file system as part of an underlying operating system or computing platform executing atcomputing device 10.File manager module 22 may causeUI modules 20 to output graphical indications of the one or more data files for display, as part of a user interface (e.g., user interface 14).File manager module 22 may interpret input associated withuser interface 14 and in response to the input,cause computing device 10 to perform operations (e.g., read, write, etc.) on one or more of the data files based on the input. -
File manager module 22 may access one or more data files stored byinformation server system 60 by at least transmitting commands overnetwork links 32 that causeinformation server system 60 to perform corresponding operations (e.g., read, write, etc.) on the one or more data files maintained by remote file service module 62.File manager module 22 may receive, from remote file service module 62, indications (e.g., network data packets, messages, file names, file locations in a memory, etc.) of the one or more data files stored byinformation server system 60.File manager module 22 may causeUI module 20 to generate, using the indications, a graphical user interface of a file system (e.g., user interface 14) andcause UI module 20 tooutput user interface 14 for display atUID 12. - As described in further detail below, responsive to outputting indications of one or more data files to file
identifier module 24,file manager module 22 may receive information fromfile identifier module 24 that indicates the one or more data files that fileidentifier module 24 identifies or predicts may be accessed by a user ofcomputing device 10 at a particular time.File manager module 22 may causeUI module 20 to output graphical indications of the one or more data files that fileidentifier module 24 determines may be accessed by a user at a particular time. - As used throughout the disclosure, the term "data file" is used to describe portions of information associated with the execution of various platforms, applications, and services executing within an execution environment at one or more computing devices, such as
computing device 10 and computing devices 8. For example, a data file may include a content portion that contains information associated with a word processing document, a presentation file, an e-mail message, an image, a song, etc. The content portion of the data file may include instructions that cause a processor of a computing device to perform operations for producing output (e.g., a graphic, a sound, etc.) that can be interpreted by a user (e.g., users 2 and 4) of the computing device. Each data file may have one or more attributes that specify particular characteristics of the data file and the content associated with the data file. For instance, an attribute of a data file may specify a date and/or time that the data file was created, one or more identifiers of devices or users associated with devices that authored the data file, a file type or file extension attribute specifying the type of information or application, platform, operating system, etc. which can be used to access the data file. These are just some example file attributes and one of ordinary skill in the art understands that many other types of data file attributes may exist. - An indication of a data file is used to describe a file identifier or other information that a computing device and/or computing system uses to specify a particular file. For instance, an indication of a data file may be the actual data file, the name of a data file, the location of a data file in a memory, etc. A graphical indication of a data file is used to describe a graphic, image, or other visual representation of a data file. For instance, a graphical indication of a data file may be an icon, a character string, or other visual depiction of an indication of a data file being presented at a screen, such as by computing
device 10 atUID 12. -
File identifier module 24 may identify or predict one or more data files that a user ofcomputing device 10 are likely to be accessed by the user at a particular time. In other words,file identifier module 24 may determine which one or more data files, being managed byfile manager module 22, are "contextually related" to a determined context of a user andcomputing device 10.File identifier module 24 may identify data files that fileidentifier module 24 identifies or predicts will be accessed by the user usingcomputing device 10 at a particular time based on contextual information received by computingdevice 10. The contextual information thatcomputing device 10 receives may include contextual information associated withcomputing devices 8 and 10 and/or respective users ofcomputing devices 8 and 10.File identifier module 24 may include a device proximity detection capability, a context identifier capability, and a file attribute comparator capability for identifying or predicting one or more data files that a user ofcomputing device 10 may which to access at a particular time. -
File identifier module 24 may include a device proximity detection capability for identifying computing devices 8 that are within a distance threshold of the location of computingdevice 10. For example,file identifier module 24 may determine locations associated withcomputing devices 8 and 10 and compare the determined locations ofcomputing devices 8 and 10 to determine whethercomputing device 10 is in proximity (e.g., within a threshold distance) to any of computing devices 8. In some examples, the threshold distance may be a fixed distance, a relative distance, an adjustable (e.g., user defined) distance, etc. In other words, computingdevice 10 may utilize a threshold distance that is fixed or changing to determine whether any of computing devices 8 is close enough to the location of computingdevice 10 to warrant the display of identified or predicted data files that a user may wish to access at a particular time. -
File identifier module 24 may include context identification capabilities for determining a context associated with a user ofcomputing device 10 and/or one or more users of computing devices 8. In other words,file identifier module 24 may process contextual information received by computingdevice 10 and use the contextual information to generate a context of the user ofcomputing device 10 that specifies one or more characteristics associated with the user ofcomputing device 10 and his or her physical surroundings at a particular time (e.g., location, name, address, and/or type of place, building, etc., weather conditions, traffic conditions, calendar information, meeting information, event information, etc.). For example, a context of a user may specify that a user is at a particular place (e.g., at work, at home, at a business, at a location on a map, at a coordinate location, etc.), performing a particular activity (e.g., in a meeting, at dinner, riding a bicycle, commuting in a car, playing in a sporting event, attending a movie or concert, etc.), or generally indicate where and/or what a user may be doing at a particular time.File identifier module 24 may determine whether any of the data files managed byfile manager module 22 are associated with the context of the user ofcomputing device 10 and/or related to nearby users of computing devices 8 to determine whether any of the data files are "contextually relevant." - As used herein, a data file may be contextually relevant if the data file has content, one or more attributes, and/or one or more characteristics that are related to a particular time, location, event, meeting, or other characteristic associated with a user of a computing device and defined by a context of the user. For example, a data file may have a location tag that indicates a place (e.g., a location) where the file was first created and/or last accessed by a computing device.
File identifier module 24 may determine that a data file is contextually relevant when a context of a user ofcomputing device 10 corresponds to the place at which the file was created and/or last accessed by a computing device. In some examples, contextually relevant may indicate that a data file is related to a context of a user of a computing device in time, location, or other characteristic associated with the user. -
File identifier module 24 may include file attribute comparator capabilities that determine which data files have attribute(s) related to the current context of a user ofcomputing device 10 and users of nearby computing devices 8 at a particular time. For example,file identifier module 24 may determine one or more data files that are authored and/or shared between the user ofcomputing device 10 and at least one user associated with one or more proximate computing devices 8. -
File identifier module 24 ofcomputing device 10 may only collect or make use of information associated with a user ofcomputing device 10 after first providing the user with an opportunity to provide input atcomputing device 10 to control whether programs or features ofcomputing device 10 can collect and make use of user information (e.g., information about a user's current location, current speed, etc.), or to dictate whether and/or howcomputing device 10 receives content that may be relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used by computingdevice 10 so that personally-identifiable information is removed. - In operation,
file identifier module 24 ofcomputing device 10 may determine a location of computingdevice 10 at a particular time. For instance,file identifier module 24 may receive contextual information associated withcomputing device 10 and determine a location of computingdevice 10 based on the contextual information. -
File identifier module 24 may receive Bluetooth, GPS, cellular, near-filed-communication (NFC), Wi-Fi, and/or other communication data received by a communications unit ofcomputing device 10 and determine a coordinate location of computingdevice 10. In some examples,file identifier module 24 may determine a relative location (e.g., an address, a place, a country, a city, a type of building, a business, etc.) ofcomputing device 10 and/or determine a location of computingdevice 10 based on signal triangulation (e.g., a technique for determining a single location based on relative position data received from two or more signals). In other examples,file identifier module 24 may determine a location of computingdevice 10 by determining a network identifier of a computer network (e.g., network 30) from whichcomputing device 10 transmits and receives communication data and comparing the network identifier to a database of network identifiers and locations. - Responsive to determining that at least one of computing devices 8 is proximate to
computing device 10 or within a threshold distance from the location of computingdevice 10,file identifier module 24 may identify or predict, based on contextual information associated with a user ofcomputing device 10 and contextual information associated with a user of the nearby or proximate computing devices 8, at least one data file that the user ofcomputing device 10 is likely to access at the particular time. For example,file identifier module 24 may determine, based on contextual information associated computing devices 8, that one or more of computing devices 8 is located within a threshold distance of the location of computingdevice 10 at the particular time. - In some examples, a threshold distance may correspond to a physical distance (e.g., one square meter, one city block, ten feet, etc.). In other examples, a threshold distance may correspond to a duration, a time of travel, or a travel time (e.g., five minutes of travel time, one hour of travel time, one leg of a public transportation route, etc.) for a person or machine to move from a location of computing
device 10 to a location of computing devices 8. In some examples, a threshold distance may correspond to a maximum range associated with a wired and/or wireless communication signal or transmission medium (e.g., range associated with a Wi-Fi signal, Bluetooth signal, Near-Field-Communication signal, radio signal, fiber, etc.).File identifier module 24 may determine that one of computing devices 8 is nearby or proximate tocomputing device 10 if the location of computingdevice 10 is less than a threshold distance away from one of computing devices 8. -
File identifier module 24 may receive communication data as contextual information (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Near-Field-Communication, or other wireless signal data) vialink 32Y from one or more computing devices 8 and determine coordinates and/or relative locations of each of the one or more computing devices 8 based on the communication data. In some examples,file identifier module 24 may determine relative locations (e.g., an address, a place, a country, a city, a type of building, a business, etc.) of computing devices 8 and/or determine locations of computing devices 8 based on signal triangulation techniques. - In some examples,
file identifier module 24 may determine locations of computing devices 8 based on contextual information received frominformation server system 60 in response to a request for such information fromfile identifier module 24. For example,file identifier module 24 may receive a coordinate location and/or a relative location associated with one or more of computing devices 8 frominformation server system 60.File identifier module 24 may determine the locations of computing devices 8 are within a threshold distance of the location of computing device 10 (i.e., in physical proximity to each other). - In instances where
file identifier module 24 determines thatcomputing device 10 and at least one of computing devices 8 are in physical proximity,file identifier module 24 ofcomputing device 10 may determine a context associated with a user ofcomputing device 10. The context may specify one or more characteristics associated with the user ofcomputing device 10 and may be indicative of what and/or where a user may be performing an action (e.g., whether the user is likely in a meeting at a work location, at a social event at a public place, at his or her home, etc.).File identifier module 24 may determine, based on the context, one or more data files managed byfile manager module 22 of which the user ofcomputing device 10 is likely to access at the particular time. Said differently,file identifier module 24 may identify, based on the contextual information associated with the user ofcomputing device 10 and/or the user of nearby computing devices 8, at least one data file that is identified or predicted to be accessed by the user ofcomputing device 10 at the particular time. -
File identifier module 24 may determine which of the data files that are contextually related to the users of the nearby computing devices 8 by determining whether any of the data files has an attribute associated with the determined context of the user ofcomputing device 10. For example,file identifier module 24 may identify a data file with a location tag that corresponds to the location of computingdevice 10 as a contextually relevant data file. -
File identifier module 24 may determine whether any of the data files being managed byfile manager module 22 are shared between users of computing devices 8 that are proximate to the user ofcomputing device 10. For example,file identifier module 24 may determine that at least one data file has an attribute specifying that the users associated with the nearby computing devices 8 last accessed the at least one data file at an earlier time and identify or predict that the user ofcomputing device 10 may wish to access the at least one data file at the current time. Said differently,file identifier module 24 may determine whether any of the users of nearby computing device 8 are co-collaborators or authors associated with any of the data files and/or whether the users of nearby computing devices 8 and the user ofcomputing device 10 at least accessed any of the same data files at a time prior or earlier than the particular time. - In some examples,
file identifier module 24 may determine that the context of the user ofcomputing device 10 indicates that the user ofcomputing device 10 is at a work place meeting.File identifier module 24 may infer that, due to the locations of one or more computing devices 8, the users of nearby computing devices 8 are also attending the work place meeting with the user ofcomputing device 10.File identifier module 24 may identify one or more of the data files that have attributes and/or content portions (e.g., subjects, descriptions, etc.) that contain keywords associated with the subject, description, and/or agenda contained in a calendar entry associated with the meeting as being one or more data files that the user ofcomputing device 10 may need to access at the particular time. - Responsive to identifying or predicting at least one data file that is likely to be accessed by the user of
computing device 10 at the particular time,file identifier module 24 may output an indication of the at least one data file tofile manager module 22.File manager module 22 may causeUI module 20 to output for display (e.g., present) one or more graphical indications of the at least one data file that is likely to be accessed by the user at the particular time.UI module 20 may causeUID 12 to update the presentation ofuser interface 14 atUID 12 to include graphical indications data files 18A-18C to indicate visually that the threefiles 18A-18C may be of most interest to the user ofcomputing device 10 at the particular time. - In some examples,
file manager module 22 may causeUI module 20 to output graphical indications of the identified data files 18A-18C in response to an input detected byUI module 20 at UID 12 (e.g., as user gestures at a location of UID 12) to request thatcomputing device 10 present "nearby" data files. In some examples, responsive tocomputing device 10 determining that at least one of computing devices 8 is proximate tocomputing device 10,file identifier module 24 andfile manager module 22 may causeUI module 20 to apply a "peeking" effect the graphical indications of stacks 16. Said differently, upon identifying the one or more contextually related data files,modules UI module 20 to visually display graphical indications of data files 18 as cards of stacks 16 that are slightly sliding outward from stacks 16 (e.g., in either a vertical and/or horizontal direction away from stacks 16) to graphically indicate which data files 18 of stacks 16 include content and/or have attributes relating to the context of the user ofcomputing device 10 and the context of one or more users of nearby computing devices 8. - In this manner, rather than require a user to search and sift through a large quantity of data files to identify the individual data files that the user wishes to access using a computing device at a particular time, the computing device, according to the techniques of this disclosure, may automatically identify or predict which individual data files that the user is identified or predicted to access at the particular time and may output a graphical indication of the identified or predicted data files for display. That is, in some examples, if the computing device determines that user of the computing device and the other users are physically proximate to one another (e.g., in a collaborative environment), rather than require the user to navigate through a graphical user interface (e.g., of a file system) using the computing device to view, edit, or otherwise access one or more data files, the computing device may output a graphical indication of the one or more data files that the computing device predicts will be accessed by the user when collaborating with the other users, at the particular time.
- By automatically presenting indications of contextually related data files, the user may spend less time and provide fewer inputs when searching for data files using the computing device according to these techniques. In spending less time searching and providing fewer inputs at a computing device, the computing device may perform fewer operations in response to user input, consume less electrical power, and preserve battery life.

FIG. 2 ,computing device 10 includes user interface device 12 ("UID 12"), one ormore processors 40, one ormore input devices 42, one ormore communication units 44, one ormore output devices 46, and one ormore storage devices 48.Storage devices 48 ofcomputing device 10 also includeUI module 20,file manager module 22,file identifier module 24, andfile data store 36.UI module 20,file manager module 22, andfile identifier module 24 may rely on information stored as one or more data files atfile data store 36 stored atstorage device 48. In other words, as is described in more detail below,file manager module 22 may be operable byprocessors 40 to perform read/write/etc. operations on information (e.g., data files) stored atfile data store 36, atstorage device 48.File identifier module 24 includesdevice proximity module 30,context identifier module 32, and attributecomparator module 34. -
Communication channels 50 may interconnect each of thecomponents communication channels 50 may include a system bus, a network connection, an inter-process communication data structure, or any other method for communicating data. - One or
more input devices 42 ofcomputing device 10 may receive input. Examples of input are tactile, audio, and video input.Input devices 42 ofcomputing device 10, in one example, includes a presence-sensitive display, touch-sensitive screen, mouse, keyboard, voice responsive system, video camera, microphone, or any other type of device for detecting input from a human or machine. - One or

Examples ofcommunication unit 44 include a network interface card (e.g. such as an Ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a GPS receiver, or any other type of device that can send and/or receive information. Other examples ofcommunication units 44 may include short wave radios, cellular data radios, wireless network radios, as well as universal serial bus (USB) controllers. - In some examples,
UID 12 ofcomputing device 10 may include functionality ofinput devices 42 and/oroutput devices 46. In the example ofFIG. 2 ,UID 12 may be or may include a presence-sensitive input device. In some examples, a presence sensitive input device may detect an object at and/or near a screen. As one example range, a presence-sensitive input device may detect an object, such as a finger or stylus that is within 2 inches or less of the screen. The presence-sensitive input device may determine a location (e.g., an (x,y) coordinate) of a screen at which the object was detected. In another example range, a presence-sensitive input device may detect an object six inches or less from the screen and other ranges are also possible. The presence-sensitive input device may determine the location of the screen selected by a user's finger using capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques. In some examples, presence sensitive input device also provides output to a user using tactile, audio, or video stimuli as described with respect tooutput device 46, e.g., at a display. In the example ofFIG. 2 ,UID 12 presents a user interface (such asuser interface 14 ofFIG. 1 ). - While illustrated as an internal component of
computing device 10,UID 12 also represents and external component that shares a data path withcomputing device 10 for transmitting and/or receiving input and output. For instance, in one example,UID 12 represents a built-in component ofcomputing device 10 located within and physically connected to the external packaging of computing device 10 (e.g., a screen on a mobile phone). In another example,UID 12 represents an external component ofcomputing device 10 located outside and physically separated from the packaging of computing device 10 (e.g., a monitor, a projector, etc. that shares a wired and/or wireless data path with a tablet computer). - One or
more storage devices 48 withincomputing device 10 may store information for processing during operation of computing device 10 (e.g.,computing device 10 may store data (e.g., file data store 26) thatmodules storage device 48 is a temporary memory, meaning that a primary purpose ofstorage device 48 is not long-term storage.Storage devices 48 oncomputing device 10 may configured for short-term storage of information as volatile memory and therefore not retain stored contents if powered off. Examples of volatile memories include random access memories (RAM), dynamic random access memories (DRAM), static random access memories (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memories known in the art. -
Storage devices 48, in some examples, also include one or more computer-readable storage media.Storage devices 48 may be configured to store larger amounts of information than volatile memory.Storage devices 48 may further be configured for long-term storage of information as non-volatile memory space and retain information after power on/off cycles. Examples of non-volatile memories include magnetic hard discs, optical discs, floppy discs, flash memories, or forms of electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable (EEPROM) memories.Storage devices 48 may store program instructions and/or information (e.g., data) associated withmodules file data store 36. - One or
more processors 40 may implement functionality and/or execute instructions withincomputing device 10. For example,processors 40 oncomputing device 10 may receive and execute instructions stored bystorage devices 48 that execute the functionality ofmodules processors 40 may causecomputing device 10 to read/write/etc. information, such as one or more data files atfile data store 36 and stored withinstorage devices 48 during program execution.Processors 40 may execute instructions ofmodules UID 12 to output a one or more graphical indications of identified or predicted data files for display atUID 12 as content ofuser interface 14. That is,modules processors 40 to perform various actions or functions ofcomputing device 10, for instance, causingUID 12 to presentuser interface 14 atUID 12. -
Device proximity module 30 offile identifier module 24 may perform operations for identifying one or more computing devices that are within a threshold distance of the location of computingdevice 10. For instance,device proximity module 30 may process contextual information received from computing devices 8 and determine which of computing devices 8 that are within a threshold distance of the location of computingdevice 10. - In some examples,
device proximity module 30 offile identifier module 24 may determine whether any of computing devices 8 are within a threshold distance ofcomputing device 10 by analyzing the types of communication signal received overlink 32Y from computing devices 8.Device proximity module 30 offile identifier module 24 may infer that if a communication signal is received from one of computing devices 8, than computingdevice 10 is at least within a maximum range associated with a type (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, etc.) of the communication signal. - For example, a Bluetooth communication signal may have a maximum detectable range (e.g., one meter, ten meters, etc.).
Device proximity module 30 of may determine that if computingdevice 10 receives Bluetooth communication signals fromcomputing devices 8A, thatcomputing device 8A is at least less than the maximum range of the Bluetooth communication signal (e.g., less than or equal to one meter, ten meters, etc.).Device proximity module 30 of may use similar techniques with regard to other types of communication signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular, etc.). For example, ifdevice proximity module 30 determines thatcomputing device 10 receives a Wi-Fi, cellular, or other type of signal from one of computing devices 8 than the physical distance between the one of computing devices 8 andcomputing device 10 is at least less than or equal to the maximum range. In other words,device proximity module 30 ofcomputing device 10 may detect a wireless communication signal associated with one of computing devices 8, determine, based on the wireless communication signal, a maximum detectable range associated with the wireless communication signal, and responsive to determining that the maximum detectable range does not exceed a threshold distance, determine that the second computing device is located within the threshold distance of the location of the first computing device at the particular time. - In some examples, the contextual information that
computing device 10 receives may include ambient audio data captured by respective microphones of computing devices 8 and computing device 10 (e.g., using one of input devices 42) at the particular time.Device proximity module 30 may correlate portions of the ambient audio received by each device to determine whether or not any one of computing devices 8 captured similar sounds data ascomputing device 10 at a particular time. Responsive to identifying corresponding portions of the ambient audio data detected by computingdevice 10 and one of computing devices 8,device proximity module 30 may determine that the one of computing devices 8 from which the corresponding ambient audio was detected is located within a threshold distance of the location of thecomputing device 10 at the particular time. - In some examples,
device proximity module 30 may perform other types of techniques for determining whethercomputing device 10 is located near or within a physical proximity to one or more of computing devices 8. For example,device proximity module 30 ofcomputing device 10 may detect a common beacon provided by computingdevice 10 and each of computing devices 8. Whendevice proximity module 30 ofcomputing device 10 detects the common beacon,device proximity module 30 may determine thatcomputing device 10 is co-located or in proximity to the respective one of computing devices 8 associated with the detected beacon. - In some examples,
computing devices 8 and 10 may perform "direct peer-to-peer" communication using ultrasonic signals. Whendevice proximity module 30 detects one or more ultrasonic signals from one of computing devices 8,device proximity module 30 may determine that the one of computing devices 8 that transmits the ultrasonic signals is co-located or in proximity to or within a distance threshold ofcomputing device 10. - In some examples,
device proximity module 30 may determine relative multiple nearby computing devices 8 and rank the nearby computing devices 8 from nearest to furthest.File identifier module 24 may determine one or more data files pertinent (e.g., related to) each of the multiple nearby computing devices 8.File identifier module 24 may output the ranking of the nearby computing devices 8 and the associated indications of pertinent files tofile manager module 22.File manager module 22 may causeUI module 20 to present, a graphical indication of the pertinent data files associated with each one of nearby computing devices 8, in order based on the ranking. In other words,file manager module 22 may causeUI module 20 to output a user interface (e.g., user interface 14) for display atUID 12 that not only indicates which one or more data files thatcomputing device 10 predicts may be accessed by a user at a particular time, but also indicates which of the one or more data files is associated with one of computing devices 8 that is closer in distance tocomputing device 10 and one of computing devices 8 that is further away from computingdevice 10. - In other words, in some examples, after identifying or predicting a first data file based on the relative proximity of
computing device 8A,computing device 10 may be configured to determine that computing device N is located within the threshold distance of the location of computingdevice 10 at the particular time, and determine a ranking associated withcomputing devices rank computing devices device 10 to farthest away from the location of computing device 10). The ranking may be based on distance from the location of computingdevice 10.Computing device 10 may predict, based on contextual information associated with the user ofcomputing device 10 and contextual information associated with a user ofcomputing device 8N, a second data file that the user ofcomputing device 10 is likely to access at the particular time.Computing device 10 may causeUID 12 to output, for display and based on the ranking, a graphical indication of the first data file identified or predicted to be accessed by the user of the first computing device at the particular time and the second data file identified or predicted to be accessed by the user of the first computing device at the particular time. -
Context identifier module 32 offile identifier module 24 may perform operations for determining a context associated with a user ofcomputing device 10 and/or one or more users of computing devices 8. In other words,context identifier module 32 may process contextual information received by computingdevice 10 and use the contextual information to generate a context of the user ofcomputing device 10 that specifies one or more characteristics associated with the user ofcomputing device 10 and his or her physical surroundings at a particular time (e.g., location, name, address, and/or type of place, building, etc., weather conditions, traffic conditions, calendar information, meeting information, event information, etc.).Context identifier module 32 may determine whether any of the data files managed byfile manager module 22 are associated with nearby users of computing devices 8 to determine whether any of the data files are contextually relevant. - In some examples,
context identifier module 32 may determine a context associated with a user of computing device 10 (e.g., specifying a location, a time, an event, an activity, etc.) based on contextual information received from computing devices 8 overnetwork 30. For example,context identifier module 32 may determine that a user ofcomputing device 10 is in a collaboration session (e.g., a meeting, etc.) whencontext identifier module 32 receives various short range communication signals from multiple computing devices 8 that are associated with users in a contact list associated with a user ofcomputing device 10. For instance,context identifier module 32 may determine a user identifier (e.g., a name, a phone number, etc.) associated with one or more short range wireless communication signals received from computing devices 8 and perform a lookup of the user identifiers within an electronic address book associated with the user ofcomputing device 10 to determine whether any of the users of nearby computing devices 8 may be known associates, colleagues, family members, friends, etc. of the user ofcomputing device 10. - In some examples,
context identifier module 32 may determine a context of a user ofcomputing device 10 based on contextual information associated with computing devices 8 thatcontext identifier module 32 receives fromdevice context module 64 ofinformation server system 60, overnetwork 30. For example,context identifier module 32 may receive data fromdevice context module 64 indicating that respective calendars associated with one or more users of computing devices 8 indicated the users of computing devices 8 are at a dinner party andcontext identifier module 32 may infer that the user ofcomputing device 10 is also at the dinner party whendevice proximity module 30 determines that the computing devices 8 are within a threshold distance ofcomputing device 10. - In some examples,
file identifier module 24 may receive contextual information fromcomputing devices 8 and 10 in substantially real-time. In other examples,file identifier module 24 may receive contextual information fromcomputing devices 8 and 10 at various earlier times and use the earlier information to learn and produce rules (e.g., using artificial intelligence or machine learning techniques) for discerning which one or more data files are identified or predicted to be accessed by a user usingcomputing device 10 at a later, particular time. -
Attribute comparator module 34 offile identifier module 24 may perform operations for determining which one or more data files has at least one attribute related to the current context of a user ofcomputing device 10 and users of nearby computing devices 8.Attribute comparator module 34 may parsefile data store 36 to identify one or more data files that may be of interest to a user ofcomputing device 10 at the particular time. Responsive to determining one or more data files fromfile data store 36 that have at least one attribute related to the current context of the user ofcomputing device 10 and users of nearby computing devices 8 (as determined by device proximity module 30), attributecomparator module 34 offile identifier module 24 may output, for transmission tofile manager module 22, one or more indications of the one or more data files as identified or predicted data files that the user ofcomputing device 10 may likely access at the particular time. - For example, attribute
comparator module 34 offile identifier module 24 may determine one or more data files that are authored, shared, viewed, and/or accessed by the user ofcomputing device 10 and at least one user associated with one or more nearby computing devices 8 at an earlier time. In other words, attributecomparator module 34 may determine that an attribute (e.g., an author tag, a permissions tag, etc.) of at least one data file indicates that the user ofcomputing device 10 and one or more users of computing device 8 each accessed the at least one data file at a time prior to the particular time, and predict, based on the attribute, the at least one data file. - In some examples,
file identifier module 24 may identify or predict at least one data file that the user ofcomputing device 10 is likely to access at a particular time by at least responsive to detecting a wireless communication signal associated with at least one of computing devices 8, determining, based on the wireless communication signal, a device identifier associated with the at least one of computing devices 8 and determining, based on the device identifier associated with the at least one of computing devices 8 that an attribute of the at least one data file indicates that the at least one computing device 8 previously accessed the at least one data file at an earlier time prior to the particular time. For example, attributecomparator module 34 offile identifier module 24 may parsefile data store 36 for one or more data files that have an attribute indicating that a computing device with a matching device identifier to one of the nearby computing devices 8 last accessed or at least previously accessed the data file and causefile identifier module 24 to output an indication of the data file tofile manager module 22 as a identified or predicted data file that the user ofcomputing device 10 may access at the particular time. - In some examples, attribute
comparator module 34 may parsefile data store 36 for one or more data files which have an attribute indicating that a user identifier (e.g., name, phone number, e-mail address, etc.) associated with a nearby computing device 8 previously accessed the data file.Attribute comparator module 34 may causefile identifier module 24 to output an indication of the one or more data files offile data store 36 that have an attribute indicating that a user identifier associated with a nearby computing device 8 previously accessed the data file tofile manager module 22. In other words, attributecomparator module 34 may determine, based on the contextual information associated with a user of at least one of computing devices 8, a user identifier associated with the user of the at least one of computing devices 8, and identify, based on the user identifier associated with the user of the at least one of computing devices 8, that an attribute of the at least one data file indicates that the user of at least one of computing devices 8 previously accessed the at least one data file at an earlier time prior to the particular time. -

In such examples, the graphical content may be displayed substantially contemporaneously at each respective device. For instance, some delay may be introduced by the communication latency to send the data that includes the graphical content to the remote device.
