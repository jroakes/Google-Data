Definitions
- This invention pertains in general to content search engines and in particular to generating alternative queries to suggest to the searcher.
- Language difficulties might cause a person to search using the wrong keywords.
- a person who lacks familiarity with the language of the content being searched might use the wrong keywords.
- Even a person who is familiar with the language of the content might make mistakes. For example, a British citizen who seeks information about temporarily obtaining a car in the United States might search “car for hire” rather than “car for rent.” The latter query more accurately reflects conventional usage in United States English and is likely to produce better search results.
- a search engine can suggest additional queries to the searcher.
- search engine can use to identify the additional queries, and each of these technologies will typically result in a large set of queries that the engine can potentially suggest. Presenting the entire set is often not helpful because many of the queries are likely to produce substantially the same results as the initial query.
- a system or computer program product includes a search query execution engine that searches a database for content matching a query.
- a query candidate generation module generates a set of candidates in response to the content matching the query.
- a filtering module then produces a set of suggestions by filtering the set of candidates.
- a method includes searching a database for content matching a query, generating a set of candidates in response to the content matching the query, and producing a set of suggestions by filtering the set of candidates.

- the modules are embodied as a computer program product having a computer-readable storage medium having executable computer program instructions recorded thereon.
- the modules can be stored on the storage device 208 , loaded into the memory 206 , and executed by the processor 202 .
- the types of computer systems 200 utilized by the entities of FIG. 1 can vary depending upon the embodiment and the processing power utilized by the entity.
- a client 114 typically requires less processing power and data storage than the search engine 110 .
- the client 114 can be a standard personal computer system or cellular telephone.
- the search engine 110 may comprise more powerful computers and/or multiple computers working together to provide the functionality described herein. These computers can be located together or distributed to multiple locations on the network 116 .
- FIG. 3 is a high-level block diagram illustrating modules within the search engine 110 according to one embodiment. Those of skill in the art will recognize that other embodiments can have different and/or additional modules than those shown in FIG. 3 . Likewise, the functionalities can be distributed among the modules in a manner different than described herein.
- the content database 112 holds information describing web pages, images, videos, sounds, advertisements, documents and/or other types of content accessible via the network 116 .
- the information is organized in a manner that allow the search engine 110 to quickly identify content matching a search query.
- the content database 112 also stores a reference to a location of the content on the network 116 , such as a uniform resource locator (URL) and/or directory path, so that the search engine 110 can identify matching content and return the reference to the content to a client 114 .
- the content database 112 also stores the content being searched.
- the stored content can include the original version of the content and/or a cached copy of content maintained at another location on the network 116 .
- An interface module 310 receives queries from the clients 114 and provides search results and/or suggested queries in response.
- the queries received by the interface module 310 are comprised primarily of keywords.
- the queries can also include logical operators, meta-data describing types of content to search, etc.
- the queries can be in another form, such as audio, video, images, etc.
- the results that the interface module 310 returns to the clients 114 can include content matching the queries, URLs and/or other references to matching content, and ads or other information related to the queries.
- the suggested queries returned by the interface module 310 are sets of keywords that form new queries that can be executed by the search engine 110 if the end-user so desires.
- a search query execution engine module 312 executes search queries against the content database 112 to identify matching content.
- a result of the search performed by the search query execution engine 312 is a set of ranked and ordered content.
- the content is often ordered with the most closely matching content first, although oftentimes it is desirable to order the content in another way, such as by date.
- this description assumes that the content returned by the search query execution engine module 312 is a set of web pages containing text.
- the techniques described herein can be utilized with forms of content other than textual web pages.
- a vector generation module 314 converts an end-user query into a vector.
- the vector generation module 314 creates the query vector by executing the query on the content database 112 and identifying the set of ‘n’ most highly-ranked web pages returned as results, where ‘n’ is an integer such as 50. This step is accomplished in one embodiment by monitoring the results of the search query execution engine 312 when it executes the end-user's query.
- the vector generation module 314 analyzes each web page and generates a term vector that describes it. In one embodiment, the vector generation module 314 truncates each term vector to include only its ‘m’ highest-weighted terms.
- the module 314 combines the ‘n’ term vectors containing the ‘m’ highest-weighted terms to produce a centroid, which is a vector that describes the most common terms of the set of ‘n’ web pages returned in response to the end-user query.
- the centroid contains a list of the most common and meaningful terms utilized in the pages that were identified in response to the end-user's query.
- the centroid is the end-user query vector.
- the end-user's original query can be reconstructed from the corresponding query vector. Further information regarding the generation of query vectors is found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/419,692, filed Apr. 21, 2003, and Seer. No. 10/814,105, filed Mar. 31, 2004, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.
- a centroid repository 316 stores centroids produced in response to searches executed by the search engine 110 . Assume for purposes of this description that the centroid repository 316 stores a large set of centroids produced using the technique described above. These centroids can be based on, for example, queries culled from real-world queries received by the search engine 110 during a given time period, a set of training queries fed to the search engine by an administrator, and/or hand-coded data.
- a query candidate generation module 318 generates a set of candidate queries in response to an end-user query received by the interface module 310 .
- this module 318 generates the set of candidates by creating a disjunction of the ‘n’ (e.g., 3) most highly-weighted terms from the vector generated from the user query. For example, if ‘n’ is 3 and the most highly-weighted terms in the query vector are “car,” “rental,” and “Denver,” the disjunction is “car OR rental OR Denver.”
- the query candidate generation module 318 executes a search against the centroid repository 316 for centroids matching the disjunction. This search produces a subset of centroids in the centroid repository 316 that match the disjunction. In one embodiment, the query candidate generation module 318 computes the dot product of each matching centroid against the query vector. The dot product describes the similarity between the two vectors.
- the query candidate generation module 318 sorts the subset of centroids by dot product to produce a ranked list of centroids, where the most highly-ranked centroids most closely match the query vector.
- the module 318 converts at least some of the centroids back into their search query representations and thus produces a ranked list of search queries that tend to produce documents that include the same terms as the initial search query received from the end-user. These search queries represent potential query suggestions for the end-user and are referred to herein as “candidate queries.”
- a filtering module 320 filters the candidate queries produced by the query candidate generation module 318 to produce a set of meaningful suggestions.
- the top-ranked candidate queries identified by the query candidate generation module 318 are not necessarily the most meaningful to the end-user. For example, if the end-user's query is “star wars,” the two highest-ranked candidate queries might be “star war” and “star wars movie,” neither of which is likely to provide more meaningful search results than the initial query.
- the filtering module 320 overcomes this issue by selecting meaningful queries.
- the filtering module 320 builds a set of suggestion queries.
- the filtering module 320 adds a candidate query to the set of suggestion queries if it contains a certain number of unique terms in view of the terms found in the original end-user query and the queries already added to the suggestion set.
- Each candidate query is considered in rank order until a desired number of suggestion queries is obtained.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating steps performed by the filtering module 320 to generate a set of suggestion queries according to one embodiment.
- Those of skill in the art will recognize that other embodiments can perform the steps in different orders. Likewise, other embodiments can contain other and/or additional steps than the ones shown in FIG. 4 .
- the filtering module 320 initializes 410 the suggestion set. At this point, the suggestion set has no suggestion queries in it.
- the filtering module 320 also establishes an upper limit on the number of suggestion queries that can be in the set. This limit can be set by an administrator and might be, for example, five suggestions.
- the filtering module 320 identifies 414 the highest-ranked previously-unconsidered candidate query. The filtering module 320 determines 416 whether the candidate query has been compared to every current member of the suggestion set and the original query. If 416 the candidate query has not been compared to these other queries, the filtering module 320 compares 418 the candidate query to the next suggestion set member or to the original query if it has already been compared to all suggestion set members. If 420 this comparison indicates that the candidate query differs by more than half as many terms from the other query, then the filtering module 320 returns to step 416 and continues to compare the candidate query to the remaining suggestion queries or the original query.
- the filtering module 320 adds 422 the candidate to the suggestion set. If 420 the candidate query does not differ by more than half as many terms from one of the queries it is compared to, then the candidate is discarded and the flow returns to step 412 . If 412 the suggestion set has reached the maximum number of members, or every candidate suggestion has been considered, the filtering module 320 returns 424 the suggestion set.
- the operation of the filtering module 320 can be described as:
- MAX is the maximum number of suggestion queries to obtain
- the test in Step 3.1 adds another candidate query q j to the suggestion set only if it differs by more than half as many terms from any other query already in the suggestion list Z (as well as the original end-user query u).
- the filtering module 320 can use different and/or additional tests to determine whether to add a candidate query to the suggestion set.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating the operation of the search engine 110 according to one embodiment. Those of skill in the art will recognize that other embodiments can perform the steps in different orders. Likewise, other embodiments can contain other and/or additional steps than the ones shown in FIG. 5 .
- the search engine 110 receives 510 an end-user query and executes 512 this query on the content database 112 . In response to the query execution, the search engine 110 identifies a set of matching content. The search engine 110 utilizes a subset of the matching content, such as the top 50 matches, to generate 514 a query vector corresponding to the end-user query.
- the search engine 110 creates a disjunction of the highest-weighted terms in the query vector and executes a search on-the centroid repository 316 to identify a ranked set of matching centroids. These centroids are transformed into their original queries, which thereby generates 516 a ranked set of candidate queries.
- the search engine 110 filters 518 the candidate queries to produce a set of suggestion queries. In one embodiment, the search engine 110 returns 520 the suggestion queries to the end-user contemporaneously with the search results.
- the search engine 110 seeks to generate two query suggestions for the end-user.
- the search engine 110 first considers “mars attacks.” This query is not added to the suggestion set because
- the search engine 110 next considers “rover mission.” This query is added to the suggestion set since
- search engine 110 considers “mars rover 2003.” First, the search engine considers the query's difference with “mars exploration”:
- the search engine 110 considers the query's difference with “rover mission” (which is in the suggestion set):
- the search engine 110 adds “mars rover 2003” to the suggestion set. Since the set now contains two suggestions, it has reached maximum size and the suggestion queries, “rover mission” and “mars rover 2003” are returned to the end-user.
- the search engine 110 filters candidate queries to identify ones that are likely to be meaningful to the end-user.
- the techniques described here can be used in other contexts. For example, the techniques can be used to select targeted advertisements from a pool of potential advertisements. For purposes of this description, assume that the term “suggestion” also includes keywords that are used as targeting criteria for advertisements.
