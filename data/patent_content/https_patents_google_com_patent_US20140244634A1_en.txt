Definitions
- Embodiments of this invention relate generally to search industries and, more particularly, to special purpose machines, systems, methods and computer instructions for providing personalized search results.
- the Internet provides access to a great number of resources, including webpages, articles, files, and the like.
- persons typically employ an Internet search or similar service. For example, a person may visit an Internet search website and submit a search query for “Arlington Texas” in hopes of locating webpages or other resources relating to Arlington, Tex.
- Search services typically display search results in a ranked listing based at least in part on their relevance to a search query. For example, in response to the search for “Arlington Texas”, the user may be provided with ranked listing of search results related to Arlington Tex.
- the displayed search result may include links to webpages, maps, etc. for businesses or other entities located in and around Arlington Tex.
- search techniques can provide users with a somewhat useful set of search results, the user may still have to search through the results to locate content that they are most interested in. For example, where a user is interested in the “Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington”, but only knows that it is a landmark in Arlington, the user may submit the search query “Arlington” and may have to search through maps, webpages or the like related to Arlington to navigate to the content that relates to the “Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington.
- the additional searching may include search query refinements, such as modifying the query from “Arlington” to “Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington”, manipulating (e.g., zooming/panning)) within a displayed map to display the geographic region that includes the Texas Ranger's Ballpark, or the like. If a user repeats this process, they may have to engage the same refinements each time they conduct the search and, thus, a user may have to expend a substantial amount of time and effort to navigate from the search results to the content they are interested in.
- search query refinements such as modifying the query from “Arlington” to “Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington”, manipulating (e.g., zooming/panning)) within a displayed map to display the geographic region that includes the Texas Ranger's Ballpark, or the like.
- a computer-implemented method that includes receiving, from a user, a plurality of search queries corresponding to a first location, providing a plurality of search results responsive to the plurality of search queries, identifying user interactions with the plurality of search results, mapping a search query corresponding to the first location to a refined result corresponding to a second location based at least in part on the user interactions with the plurality of search results, and in response to receiving, from the user, the search query relating to the first location, serving, for display to the user via a graphical user interface, refined content corresponding to the refined result corresponding to the second location.
- a computer-implemented method that includes receiving, from a user, a plurality of search queries, receiving, from the user, a plurality of search refinements associated with the plurality of search queries (the search refinements resulting in the display of a plurality of refined results to the user) mapping one of the plurality of search queries to one of the refined results, receiving, from the user, the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, and, in response to receiving the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, providing, for display to the user, refined content corresponding to the one of the refined results mapped to the one of the plurality of search queries received from the user.
- a system including one or more memories storing instructions and one or more processors coupled to the one or more memories and configured to execute the instructions stored thereon to perform the following steps: receiving, from a user, a plurality of search queries, receiving, from the user, a plurality of search refinements associated with the plurality of search queries (the search refinements resulting in the display of a plurality of refined results to the user) mapping one of the plurality of search queries to one of the refined results, receiving, from the user, the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, and, in response to receiving the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, providing, for display to the user, refined content corresponding to the one of the refined results mapped to the one of the plurality of search queries received from the user.
- a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising program instructions stored thereon that are executable by a processor to cause the following steps: receiving, from a user, a plurality of search queries, receiving, from the user, a plurality of search refinements associated with the plurality of search queries (the search refinements resulting in the display of a plurality of refined results to the user) mapping one of the plurality of search queries to one of the refined results, receiving, from the user, the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, and, in response to receiving the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, providing, for display to the user, refined content corresponding to the one of the refined results mapped to the one of the plurality of search queries received from the user.

- FIG. 7 is an illustration of a map-based search results webpage displaying a refined result in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 8 is a block diagram that illustrates a search query environment in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 9 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary computer system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- An “Internet search” or “web search” may include a search that is employed by a user to locate resources on the Internet.
- An Internet search may include a free-text web search, a map-based web search or the like.
- a free-text web search may include a user submitting search criteria (e.g., a text search string or similar query input) that is used to search the Internet for resources that match or are otherwise related to the search string.
- a map-based web search may include a user submitting search criteria that is used to search the Internet for resources relating to places (e.g., locations, business, landmarks, points of interest, etc.) that match or are otherwise related to the search string.
- a search server may identify a set of search results that are displayed to the user. For example, in the case of a free-text search, the user may be presented with an ordered listing of a given number of the highest ranked search results of the set (e.g., including links to webpages, maps, or other resources that correspond to the highest ranked results).
- map-based search the user may be presented with a map of one or more locations and/or an ordered listing of one or more locations that correspond to the highest ranked search results of the set.
- map-based searches for the purpose of illustration, it will be appreciated that the same or similar techniques may be provided for any variety of search types, such as free-text searches.
- initial set of search results may refer to the search results that are initially returned in response to a search query.
- an initial set of search results may be displayed that includes maps, webpages or the like related to Arlington.
- a user may make refinements to their search to navigate to or otherwise locate search results that they are interested in. If John Doe is actually interested in locating a map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, for example, after receiving the initial set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington”, he may make refinements to his search to locate the map.
- he may select one of the initial search result that includes a link to the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, he may edit the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, or, where an interactive map of Arlington, Tex. is provided in the initial set of search results, he may manipulate (e.g., pan/zoom) the map such that is displays the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.
- search refinements Such user interactions that occur shortly after the submission of a search query and/or shortly after receipt of the initial set of search results (e.g., less than about five seconds, ten seconds, twenty seconds, thirty seconds, one minute, two minutes, three minutes, five minutes, ten minutes, thirty minutes, an hour, or more after submitting the search query and/or being presented with the corresponding search query results) may be referred to herein as “search refinements”.
- search refinements The result that the user navigates to or is otherwise directed to as a result of their search refinements of a given search query may be referred to as a “refined result” for the search query.
- the content of the refined result that is served to or otherwise presented to the user may be referred to herein as “refined content”.
- certain embodiments include identifying refined results for a search query submitted by a user, and in response to subsequently receiving the search query from the user, presenting the refined result (or at least an option to navigate directly the refined result). For example, where it has been determined that John Doe typically navigates to a map of Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington after he submits a map-based search query for “Arlington”, upon John Doe subsequently submitting a map-based search query for “Arlington”, the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington may be displayed.
- the refined result is displayed in place of an initial set of search results that would otherwise be displayed to the user.
- a search results webpage including the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington e.g., see FIG. 7
- an initial set of search results e.g., including a map of Arlington, Tex. as depicted in FIG. 6
- the user may be immediately presented with the refined result without having to navigate to the refined result or otherwise having to refine their search.
- the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington may be displayed to John Doe in response to his submission of the map-based search query “Arlington” without him having to edit the search string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” or manipulate (e.g., pan/zoom) a displayed map of Arlington, Tex. to navigate to the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.
- the refined result associated with a given search query submitted by a given user is identified based at least in part on historical interactions by the user following one or submissions of the search query. For example, where John Doe repeatedly submits a map-based search query for “Arlington”, and typically edits the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” may be identified at the refined result for the search query “Arlington”. As a further example, where John Doe repeatedly submits a map-based search query for “Arlington”, and typically manipulates (e.g., pan/zoom) a displayed map of Arlington, Tex. to display the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, a search results webpage including the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington may be identified as the refined result for the search query “Arlington”.
- embodiments may include identifying refined results associated with a partial/incomplete search query (i.e., a search query that is only partially entered and/or has not yet been submitted by the user).
- the search system may identify the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” as a refined result for the partial/incomplete search query “Arlington” and display the map-based search results for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” before John Doe even submits the search query.
- Such a technique may enable refined results to be dynamically identified and presented as a user enters a search query.
- the search system may identify the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” as a refined result for the partial/incomplete search query “Arl” and display the map-based search results for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” before John Doe even completes or submits the search query.
- the refined result associated with a given search query submitted by a user is identified based at least in part on historical interactions by the user that occur at least a threshold amount (e.g., at least a threshold number and/or percentage of occurrences within a given period of time).
- a threshold amount e.g., at least a threshold number and/or percentage of occurrences within a given period of time.
- a refined result threshold may require that for a result to be identified as a refined result for a search query, within the preceding four weeks, the user must have navigated to the result on at least five occasions and at least 70% of the time shortly after submitting the search query “Arlington”.
- John Doe has submitted a map-based search query for “Arlington” ten times in the past four weeks, and has edited the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times after submitting the search query “Arlington”, the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” may be identified as the refined result for the search query “Arlington”.
- John Doe has submitted a map-based search query for “Arlington” ten times in the past four weeks, and has edited the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times after submitting the search query “Arlington”, and has manipulated a displayed map of Arlington, Tex.
- a refined result threshold may require that for a result to be identified as a refined result for a search query, within the last four weeks, the user must have navigated to the result on at least three occasions and at least 40% of the time shortly after submitting the search query.
- a link to a refined result for a search query may be displayed in association with a set of search results for the search query. For example, where the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” has been identified as a refined result for the map-based search query “Arlington” submitted by John Doe, in response to John Doe submitting the search query “Arlington”, an initial set of search results for “Arlington” (e.g., including any variety maps, webpages or the like related to Arlington, including those related to Arlington, Tex., Arlington, Va., or the like) may be displayed to John Doe along with a link to the results of a map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., see FIG.
- the user may be able to directly navigate to the refined content via selection of the link without having to engage in a series of search refinements to indirectly navigate thereto. For example, John Doe may simply select the link to navigate to the search results for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, as opposed to having to refine his search via editing the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”.
- the display of refined results and/or the display of links to refined results are based at least in part on a level of historical interactions by the user. For example, the initial set of search results for a given search query may be displayed where no refined result is identified for the search query, the initial set of search results for a search query and a link to a refined result may be displayed where the refined result is identified as being navigated to after the search query at least a relatively low number/percentage of times, and the refined result may be displayed where the refined result is identified as being navigated to after the search query at least a relatively high number/percentage of times.
- the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” may be identified as a second-level refined result for the search query “Arlington”, and John Doe may be presented with the initial set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington”, along with a link to the results of the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” upon his submission of the map-based search query “Arlington”.
- the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” may be identified as a first-level refined result for the search query “Arlington”, and John Doe may be presented with the results of the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” upon his submission of the map-based search query “Arlington”.
- a traditional set of search results for a search query may be displayed in response to the user submitting the search query
- a traditional set of search results along with an option to directly navigate to the refined result may be displayed in response to the user submitting the search query
- the refined results may be displayed in response to the user submitting the search query.
- a log of historical user search queries and associated user interactions is stored in a database (e.g., datastore 810 ) or similar data repository.
- a database e.g., datastore 810
- a refinement log may be generated that includes an index of search queries and corresponding refined results submitted by John Doe over a given period (e.g., four weeks) (e.g., see FIG. 2 ).
- the log includes one or more search-query/result pairs.
- a search-query may include a search query profile that defines characteristics of the corresponding search query, such as a search query context (e.g., free-text search, map-based search, etc.) and search query criteria (e.g., a search string). For example, where John Doe submits a map-based search query “Arlington”, the search-query-profile for a corresponding entry of the log may include a search context of “Map Search” and a search query criteria of “Arlington”. The result may identify a result navigated to by the user after the search query.
- a search query context e.g., free-text search, map-based search, etc.
- search query criteria e.g., a search string
- the result may identify the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” that is navigated to by John Doe after submitting the map-based search for “Arlington”.
- the log includes a record of the number and/or percentages of times the user has engaged in the search and subsequently refined the search to arrive at the corresponding result.
- the log tracks interaction for the past four weeks and John Doe has submitted a map-based search query for “Arlington” ten times in the last four weeks, and has edited the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times shortly after submitting the search query
- the log may include a count of nine and a percentage of 90% for the corresponding search-query/result pair relating to John Doe's map-based search “Arlington”.
- the illustrated log includes a log of activities for a single user (John Doe) for illustrative purposes, other embodiments may include a similar log for any number of users or a single log that includes search-query/results pairs for any number of users.
- a mapping of search-queries to refined-results is generated based at least in part on the historical user search queries and associated user interactions (e.g., see FIG. 3 ).
- the refinement log may be assessed to identify refined results that include search-query/results pairs that meet at least minimum threshold criteria (e.g., a minimum number and/or percentages of occurrences within a given time frame).
- the mapping includes a strength that is associated with the level of historical interactions associated with the refined result.
- a first level (e.g., corresponding to a strength of “weak”) may be associated with those search-query/result pairs that occur somewhat consistently
- a second level (e.g., corresponding to a strength of “strong”) may be associated with those query-profile/refined-query-result pairs that occur consistently.
- the search results displayed to the user in response to a given search query may be based at least in part on the mapping.
- a search server may access the mapping, determine that the map-based search for “Arlington” submitted by John Doe is strongly mapped to a refined result that corresponds to, the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, and in response to the determination, may identify and serve, for display to John Doe, a search result web-page that includes the results of the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., see FIG. 7 ).
- the search server may serve, for display to John Doe, a search result web-page that includes a set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington” along with a link to the results of the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., see FIG. 6 ).
- the mapping is stored in a database (e.g., datastore 810 ) or similar data repository.
- logs and mappings may be anonymized to protect the identity of the user.
- the log may be associated with a user ID (e.g., 1234 ), as opposed to actual name of the user.
- the user may be provided an option enable such records to be maintained.
- the user may be provided with a description of the data that is to be collected and its use, as well as an option to enable collection and use of the data.
- logs and mapping may only be maintained during a period for which they are relevant. For example, the logs/mapping may only reflect data that has been collected within the last four weeks, with the older data being purged from the log/mapping.
- FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates a method 100 of mapping search queries to refined results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- Method 100 may include receiving a plurality of search queries from one or more users (block 102 ).
- the search queries may include any variety of search queries received from one or more users.
- receiving a plurality of search queries from a user may include a search server receiving, from a user device, one or more free-text searches, map-based searches or the like submitted by John Doe.
- the search queries may be associated with one or more locations.
- the one or more free-text searches, map-based searches or the like submitted by John Doe may include one or more free-text searches or map-based searches for the query string “Arlington”.
- an identity of a user submitting the search queries may be identified by the search server based at least in part on credential information provided by the users (e.g., user log-in information such as name and password), cookie information stored in the user's browser and transmitted to the search server, or the like.
- credential information e.g., user log-in information such as name and password
- cookie information stored in the user's browser and transmitted to the search server, or the like.
- identity data may be used to associate logged searches and/or refinements to the user.
- Method 100 may include providing search results responsive to the plurality of search queries (block 104 ).
- providing search results responsive to the plurality of search queries may include, for each of the search queries, providing for the display of the corresponding search result content.
- the search server may process the search query to identify an initial set of search results responsive to the search query (e.g., including any variety maps, webpages or the like related to Arlington, including those related to Arlington, Tex., Arlington, Va., or the like), and serve, to the user device for display to John Doe, a webpage that includes content (e.g., webpage links, maps, etc.) that corresponds to the initial set of search results identified as being responsive to the search query (e.g., see FIG.
- the set of initial search results is identified and ranked using various search techniques, such as identifying search results including content that matches or is at least similar to the search criteria, and ranking the results based on their global prominence (e.g., popularity globally), their local prominence (e.g., their popularity in the location where the user identified as being is located), etc.
- their global prominence e.g., popularity globally
- their local prominence e.g., their popularity in the location where the user identified as being is located
- Method 100 may include identifying search refinements (block 106 ).
- identifying search refinements includes identifying search refinements by the user shortly after submission of the search query and/or presentation of the search query results. For example, with regard to the map-based search query for “Arlington” submitted by John Doe, identifying search refinements may include identify subsequent actions by John Doe, such as editing the search string “Arlington” to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, panning/zooming a displayed interactive map of Arlington, Tex. to the geographic region including the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, and so forth shortly after he submitted the search query and/or was presented with the search query results. In some embodiments, identifying search refinements includes generating a refinement log.
- a refinement log may be generated/updated to reflect the refinement by John Doe.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of refinement log 200 in accordance with one more embodiments of the present invention.
- Refinement log 200 may include a record of refinements made by one or more users subsequent to submitting search queries.
- refinement log 200 may include a record of search queries and search query refinements submitted by John Doe.
- refinement log 200 includes search-query/result pairs 202 , including a query-profile 204 and a result 206 , as well as corresponding number 208 and/or percentages of times the search queries and refinement by the user have occurred 210 within the last four weeks.
- refinement log 200 indicates that, shortly after submitting the a map-based search query for “Arlington” ten times within the last four weeks, John Doe has refined the search string from “Arlington” to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times (i.e., 90% of the time), and refined the search string from “Arlington” to “Arlington Va.” one time (i.e., 10% of the time).
- refinement log 200 may be stored in a memory, such as a database (e.g., database 810 ) or a similar memory location accessible by the search server.
- embodiments may include a log of partial/incomplete search queries.
- the log may include a count of nine and a percentage of 90% for a corresponding search-query/result pair relating to John Doe's partial map-based search for “Arl” and the refined result including a map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”.
- Method 100 may include mapping of search queries to refined results (block 108 ).
- mapping of search queries to refined results is based at least in part on the identified search refinements.
- mapping of search queries to refined results may include assessing refinement log 200 to identify search-query/result pairs that satisfy at least a minimum threshold criteria (e.g., occur at least a minimum threshold number/percentage of times within a given time frame).
- the thresholds number/percentages used to identify mappings may include ranges that are associated with various levels of interaction that can be used to identify strengths of the mappings. For example, a first level (e.g., corresponding to a strength of “weak”) may be associated with those search-query/result pairs that occur somewhat consistently (e.g., within the last four weeks the user has navigated to the refined result shortly after submitting the search query on least three occasions and at least 40% of the time).
- a second level (e.g., corresponding to a strength of “strong”) may be associated with those search-query/result pairs that occur consistently (e.g., within the last four weeks the user has navigated to the refined result shortly after submitting the search query on least five occasions and at least 70% of the time).
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of a refinement mapping 300 in accordance with one more embodiments of the present invention.
- mapping 300 includes a listing of search-query/result pairs 202 that have been identified as meeting the criteria for a refined result based at least in part on the information provided in refinement log 200 .
- the illustrated mapping includes a mapping of the full/complete search queries for illustrative purposes, embodiments may include mappings of partial/incomplete search queries.
- a partial map-based search query for “Arl” may be mapped to a refined result that includes the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”.
- Refinement mapping 300 also includes an indication of the strength of the particular mappings.
- certain embodiments refer to accessing a refinement mapping 300 to identify mappings between query profiles and refined query results, it will be appreciated that other embodiments may include identifying mappings via direct assessment of the information contained in refinement log 200 or similar information resource.
- the search results displayed to the user in response to a given search query may be based at least in part on a refinement mapping.
- a search server may access the refinement mapping 300 , determine that the map-based search “Arlington” submitted by John Doe is strongly mapped to a refined result that corresponds to the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, and, in response to the determination, may identify search results for the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” and serve, for display to John Doe, a search result web-page that includes search results for the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., see FIG.
- the search server may identify the search results for the map-based search query “Arlington” and serve, for display to John Doe, a search results web-page that includes a set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington” along with a link to search results for the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., see FIG. 6 ).
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart that illustrates a method 400 of providing personalized search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- Method 400 may include receiving a search query from a user (block 402 ).
- Receiving a search query from a user may include, for example, a search server receiving, from a user device, a partial or full search query provided by John Doe.
- the search query may be associated with one more locations.
- the search query submitted by John Doe may include map-based search for “Arlington”.
- an identity of the user may be identified by the search server based at least in part on credential information provided by the user (e.g., user log-in information such as name and password), cookie information stored in the user's browser and transmitted to the search server, or the like.
- credential information e.g., user log-in information such as name and password
- cookie information stored in the user's browser and transmitted to the search server, or the like.
- identity information may be used to associate the user to a particular refinement long and/or mapping. For example, upon logging in, a session for John Doe may be opened that logs searches and refinements by John Doe to refinement log 200 , and/or relies on refinement log 200 and/or mapping 300 for identifying search results and/or refined results.
- Method 400 may include determining whether the search query is mapped to a refined result (block 404 ).
- determining whether the search query is mapped to a refined result may include assessing a refinement mapping for the user. For example, in response to receiving the map-based search “Arlington” from John Doe, the search server may access refinement mapping 300 for John Doe to determine whether refinement mapping 300 includes a query profile 204 that corresponds to (e.g., matches or is otherwise related to) the map-based search “Arlington”.
- refinement mapping 300 does include a query profile 204 (e.g., “Map Search+‘Arlington’”) that does correspond to the map-based search “Arlington” submitted by John Doe and, thus, it may be determined that the search query is mapped to a refined result. If, for example, the refinement mapping 300 did not include a mapping of the map-based search query “Arlington” to a refined result, it may be determined that the search query is not mapped to a refined result. In some embodiments, determining whether the search query is mapped to a refined result may include assessing a refinement mapping for the user to determine whether or not a partial search query is mapped to a refined result.
- a query profile 204 e.g., “Map Search+‘Arlington’”
- the search server may identify the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” as a refined result for the partial/incomplete search query “Arl” and display the map-based search results for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” before John Doe even completes or submits the search query.
- refinement mapping 300 may include identifying mappings via direct assessment of refinement log 200 (or similar information resource) in a manner similar to that described with regard to generating refinement mapping 300 (e.g., at block 108 ). For example, it may be determined that a query profile 204 is mapped to a refined result 206 , and/or a corresponding strength of the mapping may be determined, based at least in part on a comparison of corresponding number 208 and/or percentages 210 of occurrences to relevant thresholds.
- Method 400 may include, in response to determining that that the search query is not mapped to a refined result, providing for the display of search results content corresponding to the search query (block 406 ).
- the search server may identify a set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington” and serve, to the user device for display to John Doe, a search results web-page similar including the set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington” in a manner similar to that of FIG. 5 .
- search results 502 include an exemplary listing of search results 504 (including a link to a place page for Arlington, Tex.) and an interactive geographic map 506 (of Arlington, Tex.) that are responsive to the map-based search query “Arlington”.
- Method 400 may include, in response to determining that the search query is mapped to a refined result, determining whether the mapping is strong or weak (block 408 ). In some embodiments, determining whether the search query is strongly mapped to the refined result may include further assessing the refinement mapping for the user. For example, in response to determining that refinement mapping 300 includes a query profile 204 that corresponds to the map-based search “Arlington” by John Doe, it may be determined that the mapping is “strong” based at least in part on the corresponding strength 302 provided in refinement mapping 300 . The mapping may be determined to be “weak” if strength 302 were to include a listing of weak as opposed to strong.
- Method 400 may include, in response to determining that that mapping is weak, providing for the display of search result content responsive to the search query and including an option to navigate to refined result content (block 410 ).
- the search server may identify a set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington” and serve, to the user device for display to John Doe, a search results web-page including the set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington”, along with a link to results of map-based search query “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, in a manner similar to that of FIG. 6 .
- FIG. 6 is an illustration of a map-based search results webpage 600 including a link 601 to a refined result in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- search results 602 include a listing of search results 604 (including a link to a place page for Arlington, Tex.) and an interactive geographic map 606 (of Arlington, Tex.) that are responsive to the map-based search query “Arlington”.
- link 601 the user may be redirected to a set of refined search results that are responsive to the map-based search query “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., see FIG. 7 ). That is, the user can select link 601 to navigate directly to the refined search result.
- Method 400 may include, in response to determining that that mapping is strong, providing for the display of refined result content (block 412 ).
- the search server may identify a set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” and may serve, to the user device for display to John Doe, a search results web-page including a set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” in a manner similar to that of FIG. 7 .
- FIG. 7 is an illustration of a map-based search results webpage 700 displaying a refined result 702 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- refined result 702 includes a listing of search results 704 (including a link to a place page for Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington) and an interactive geographic map 706 (of the region including the Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington) that are responsive to the map-based search query “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”.
- webpage 700 also includes a user selectable link 708 for returning to non-personalized search results (e.g., the initial, unrefined set of search results).
- link 708 Upon selection of link 708 , the user may be redirected to a search results webpage similar to that of FIG. 5 or FIG. 6 . That is, the user can select link 708 to navigate to unrefined search results that are at least partially responsive to the initial map-based search query “Arlington”.

Abstract
Description
- 1. Field of the Invention
- Embodiments of this invention relate generally to search industries and, more particularly, to special purpose machines, systems, methods and computer instructions for providing personalized search results.
- 2. Description of the Related Art
- The Internet provides access to a great number of resources, including webpages, articles, files, and the like. To locate resources of interest from the vast number of resources available on the Internet, persons typically employ an Internet search or similar service. For example, a person may visit an Internet search website and submit a search query for “Arlington Texas” in hopes of locating webpages or other resources relating to Arlington, Tex. Search services typically display search results in a ranked listing based at least in part on their relevance to a search query. For example, in response to the search for “Arlington Texas”, the user may be provided with ranked listing of search results related to Arlington Tex. The displayed search result may include links to webpages, maps, etc. for businesses or other entities located in and around Arlington Tex.
- Although such search techniques can provide users with a somewhat useful set of search results, the user may still have to search through the results to locate content that they are most interested in. For example, where a user is interested in the “Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington”, but only knows that it is a landmark in Arlington, the user may submit the search query “Arlington” and may have to search through maps, webpages or the like related to Arlington to navigate to the content that relates to the “Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington. The additional searching may include search query refinements, such as modifying the query from “Arlington” to “Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington”, manipulating (e.g., zooming/panning)) within a displayed map to display the geographic region that includes the Texas Ranger's Ballpark, or the like. If a user repeats this process, they may have to engage the same refinements each time they conduct the search and, thus, a user may have to expend a substantial amount of time and effort to navigate from the search results to the content they are interested in.
- Various embodiments of methods and apparatus for identifying and providing personalized search results are provided herein. In some embodiments, provided is a computer-implemented method that includes receiving, from a user, a plurality of search queries corresponding to a first location, providing a plurality of search results responsive to the plurality of search queries, identifying user interactions with the plurality of search results, mapping a search query corresponding to the first location to a refined result corresponding to a second location based at least in part on the user interactions with the plurality of search results, and in response to receiving, from the user, the search query relating to the first location, serving, for display to the user via a graphical user interface, refined content corresponding to the refined result corresponding to the second location.
- In some embodiments, provided is a computer-implemented method that includes receiving, from a user, a plurality of search queries, receiving, from the user, a plurality of search refinements associated with the plurality of search queries (the search refinements resulting in the display of a plurality of refined results to the user) mapping one of the plurality of search queries to one of the refined results, receiving, from the user, the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, and, in response to receiving the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, providing, for display to the user, refined content corresponding to the one of the refined results mapped to the one of the plurality of search queries received from the user.
- In some embodiments, provided is a system including one or more memories storing instructions and one or more processors coupled to the one or more memories and configured to execute the instructions stored thereon to perform the following steps: receiving, from a user, a plurality of search queries, receiving, from the user, a plurality of search refinements associated with the plurality of search queries (the search refinements resulting in the display of a plurality of refined results to the user) mapping one of the plurality of search queries to one of the refined results, receiving, from the user, the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, and, in response to receiving the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, providing, for display to the user, refined content corresponding to the one of the refined results mapped to the one of the plurality of search queries received from the user.
- In some embodiments, provided is a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising program instructions stored thereon that are executable by a processor to cause the following steps: receiving, from a user, a plurality of search queries, receiving, from the user, a plurality of search refinements associated with the plurality of search queries (the search refinements resulting in the display of a plurality of refined results to the user) mapping one of the plurality of search queries to one of the refined results, receiving, from the user, the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, and, in response to receiving the one of the plurality of search queries mapped to one of the refined results, providing, for display to the user, refined content corresponding to the one of the refined results mapped to the one of the plurality of search queries received from the user.

FIG. 9 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary computer system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. - As discussed in more detail below, provided are systems and methods for providing personalized search results to a user based at least in part on the user's prior search interactions. An “Internet search” or “web search” may include a search that is employed by a user to locate resources on the Internet. An Internet search may include a free-text web search, a map-based web search or the like. A free-text web search may include a user submitting search criteria (e.g., a text search string or similar query input) that is used to search the Internet for resources that match or are otherwise related to the search string. A map-based web search may include a user submitting search criteria that is used to search the Internet for resources relating to places (e.g., locations, business, landmarks, points of interest, etc.) that match or are otherwise related to the search string. As a result of an Internet search, a search server may identify a set of search results that are displayed to the user. For example, in the case of a free-text search, the user may be presented with an ordered listing of a given number of the highest ranked search results of the set (e.g., including links to webpages, maps, or other resources that correspond to the highest ranked results). In the case of a map-based search, the user may be presented with a map of one or more locations and/or an ordered listing of one or more locations that correspond to the highest ranked search results of the set. Although certain embodiments are described herein with regard to map-based searches for the purpose of illustration, it will be appreciated that the same or similar techniques may be provided for any variety of search types, such as free-text searches.
- As used herein, “initial set of search results” may refer to the search results that are initially returned in response to a search query. For example, where the user John Doe submits a map-based search query “Arlington”, an initial set of search results may be displayed that includes maps, webpages or the like related to Arlington. In many instances, a user may make refinements to their search to navigate to or otherwise locate search results that they are interested in. If John Doe is actually interested in locating a map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, for example, after receiving the initial set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington”, he may make refinements to his search to locate the map. For example, he may select one of the initial search result that includes a link to the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, he may edit the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, or, where an interactive map of Arlington, Tex. is provided in the initial set of search results, he may manipulate (e.g., pan/zoom) the map such that is displays the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Such user interactions that occur shortly after the submission of a search query and/or shortly after receipt of the initial set of search results (e.g., less than about five seconds, ten seconds, twenty seconds, thirty seconds, one minute, two minutes, three minutes, five minutes, ten minutes, thirty minutes, an hour, or more after submitting the search query and/or being presented with the corresponding search query results) may be referred to herein as “search refinements”. The result that the user navigates to or is otherwise directed to as a result of their search refinements of a given search query may be referred to as a “refined result” for the search query. The content of the refined result that is served to or otherwise presented to the user may be referred to herein as “refined content”.
- As described in more detail below, certain embodiments include identifying refined results for a search query submitted by a user, and in response to subsequently receiving the search query from the user, presenting the refined result (or at least an option to navigate directly the refined result). For example, where it has been determined that John Doe typically navigates to a map of Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington after he submits a map-based search query for “Arlington”, upon John Doe subsequently submitting a map-based search query for “Arlington”, the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington may be displayed.
- In some embodiments, the refined result is displayed in place of an initial set of search results that would otherwise be displayed to the user. For example, in response to John Doe submitting the a map-based search query for “Arlington”, a search results webpage including the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington (e.g., see
FIG. 7 ) may be displayed in place of an initial set of search results (e.g., including a map of Arlington, Tex. as depicted inFIG. 6 ) that would normally be displayed in response to the map-based search query “Arlington”. Thus, the user may be immediately presented with the refined result without having to navigate to the refined result or otherwise having to refine their search. For example, the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington may be displayed to John Doe in response to his submission of the map-based search query “Arlington” without him having to edit the search string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” or manipulate (e.g., pan/zoom) a displayed map of Arlington, Tex. to navigate to the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. - In some embodiments, the refined result associated with a given search query submitted by a given user is identified based at least in part on historical interactions by the user following one or submissions of the search query. For example, where John Doe repeatedly submits a map-based search query for “Arlington”, and typically edits the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” may be identified at the refined result for the search query “Arlington”. As a further example, where John Doe repeatedly submits a map-based search query for “Arlington”, and typically manipulates (e.g., pan/zoom) a displayed map of Arlington, Tex. to display the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, a search results webpage including the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington may be identified as the refined result for the search query “Arlington”.
- Although certain embodiments are described with regard to full/complete search queries (i.e., where the user has fully entered a search query, such as “Arlington”, and has submitted the search query, such as by pressing the “enter” key or via selection of a “Search” button displayed adjacent a search field), embodiments may include identifying refined results associated with a partial/incomplete search query (i.e., a search query that is only partially entered and/or has not yet been submitted by the user). For example, where the John Doe has typed in the search string “Arlington”, but has not yet submitted the search query, the search system may identify the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” as a refined result for the partial/incomplete search query “Arlington” and display the map-based search results for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” before John Doe even submits the search query. Such a technique may enable refined results to be dynamically identified and presented as a user enters a search query. For example, where it is determined that John Doe typically navigates to map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” after entering the letters “Arl”, when John Doe has only typed in the first three letters “Arl” the search system may identify the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” as a refined result for the partial/incomplete search query “Arl” and display the map-based search results for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” before John Doe even completes or submits the search query.
- In some embodiments, the refined result associated with a given search query submitted by a user is identified based at least in part on historical interactions by the user that occur at least a threshold amount (e.g., at least a threshold number and/or percentage of occurrences within a given period of time). For example, a refined result threshold may require that for a result to be identified as a refined result for a search query, within the preceding four weeks, the user must have navigated to the result on at least five occasions and at least 70% of the time shortly after submitting the search query “Arlington”. Where for example, John Doe has submitted a map-based search query for “Arlington” ten times in the past four weeks, and has edited the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times after submitting the search query “Arlington”, the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” may be identified as the refined result for the search query “Arlington”. Where for example, John Doe has submitted a map-based search query for “Arlington” ten times in the past four weeks, and has edited the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times after submitting the search query “Arlington”, and has manipulated a displayed map of Arlington, Tex. to display the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, the search results webpage including the map of the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington may be identified as the refined result for the search query “Arlington”. Although exemplary threshold numbers, percentages and times have been provided for exemplary purposes, it will be appreciated that any other suitable numbers, percentages and/or times may be used. For example, a refined result threshold may require that for a result to be identified as a refined result for a search query, within the last four weeks, the user must have navigated to the result on at least three occasions and at least 40% of the time shortly after submitting the search query.
- In some embodiments, a link to a refined result for a search query may be displayed in association with a set of search results for the search query. For example, where the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” has been identified as a refined result for the map-based search query “Arlington” submitted by John Doe, in response to John Doe submitting the search query “Arlington”, an initial set of search results for “Arlington” (e.g., including any variety maps, webpages or the like related to Arlington, including those related to Arlington, Tex., Arlington, Va., or the like) may be displayed to John Doe along with a link to the results of a map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., see
FIG. 7 ). Thus, the user may be able to directly navigate to the refined content via selection of the link without having to engage in a series of search refinements to indirectly navigate thereto. For example, John Doe may simply select the link to navigate to the search results for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, as opposed to having to refine his search via editing the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”. - In some embodiments, the display of refined results and/or the display of links to refined results are based at least in part on a level of historical interactions by the user. For example, the initial set of search results for a given search query may be displayed where no refined result is identified for the search query, the initial set of search results for a search query and a link to a refined result may be displayed where the refined result is identified as being navigated to after the search query at least a relatively low number/percentage of times, and the refined result may be displayed where the refined result is identified as being navigated to after the search query at least a relatively high number/percentage of times. For example, where John Doe does not consistently navigate to a particular refined result after submitting the map-based search query “Arlington” (e.g., within the last four weeks John Doe has not navigated to any particular content on least three occasions and at least 40% of the time shortly after submitting the map-based search query “Arlington”), no refined content may be identified for the map-based search query “Arlington” by John Doe and, John Doe may simply be presented with the initial set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington” upon his submission of the map-based search query “Arlington”. Where John Doe somewhat consistently edits the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., within the last four weeks has edited the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” on least three occasions and at least 40% of the time shortly after submitting the map-based search query “Arlington”), the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” may be identified as a second-level refined result for the search query “Arlington”, and John Doe may be presented with the initial set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington”, along with a link to the results of the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” upon his submission of the map-based search query “Arlington”. Where John Doe consistently edits the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., within the last four weeks has edited the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” on least five occasions and at least 70% of the time shortly after submitting the map-based search query “Arlington”), the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” may be identified as a first-level refined result for the search query “Arlington”, and John Doe may be presented with the results of the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” upon his submission of the map-based search query “Arlington”. Thus, where a user's historical interactions with results of a search query fall within a first range of activity, a traditional set of search results for a search query may be displayed in response to the user submitting the search query, where a user's historical interactions with results of a search query fall within a second range of activity that is associated with a refined result, a traditional set of search results along with an option to directly navigate to the refined result may be displayed in response to the user submitting the search query, and where a user's historical interactions with results of a search query fall within a third range of activity that is associated with a refined result, the refined results may be displayed in response to the user submitting the search query.
- In some embodiments, a log of historical user search queries and associated user interactions (e.g., refinements) is stored in a database (e.g., datastore 810) or similar data repository. For example, for the user John Doe, a refinement log may be generated that includes an index of search queries and corresponding refined results submitted by John Doe over a given period (e.g., four weeks) (e.g., see
FIG. 2 ). In some embodiments, the log includes one or more search-query/result pairs. A search-query may include a search query profile that defines characteristics of the corresponding search query, such as a search query context (e.g., free-text search, map-based search, etc.) and search query criteria (e.g., a search string). For example, where John Doe submits a map-based search query “Arlington”, the search-query-profile for a corresponding entry of the log may include a search context of “Map Search” and a search query criteria of “Arlington”. The result may identify a result navigated to by the user after the search query. For example, the result may identify the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” that is navigated to by John Doe after submitting the map-based search for “Arlington”. In some embodiments, the log includes a record of the number and/or percentages of times the user has engaged in the search and subsequently refined the search to arrive at the corresponding result. Where for example, the log tracks interaction for the past four weeks and John Doe has submitted a map-based search query for “Arlington” ten times in the last four weeks, and has edited the search query string to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times shortly after submitting the search query, the log may include a count of nine and a percentage of 90% for the corresponding search-query/result pair relating to John Doe's map-based search “Arlington”. Although the illustrated log includes a log of activities for a single user (John Doe) for illustrative purposes, other embodiments may include a similar log for any number of users or a single log that includes search-query/results pairs for any number of users. - In some embodiments, a mapping of search-queries to refined-results is generated based at least in part on the historical user search queries and associated user interactions (e.g., see
FIG. 3 ). For example, the refinement log may be assessed to identify refined results that include search-query/results pairs that meet at least minimum threshold criteria (e.g., a minimum number and/or percentages of occurrences within a given time frame). In some embodiments, the mapping includes a strength that is associated with the level of historical interactions associated with the refined result. For example, a first level (e.g., corresponding to a strength of “weak”) may be associated with those search-query/result pairs that occur somewhat consistently, and a second level (e.g., corresponding to a strength of “strong”) may be associated with those query-profile/refined-query-result pairs that occur consistently. In some embodiments, the search results displayed to the user in response to a given search query may be based at least in part on the mapping. For example, in response to receiving a map-based search for “Arlington” from John Doe, a search server may access the mapping, determine that the map-based search for “Arlington” submitted by John Doe is strongly mapped to a refined result that corresponds to, the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, and in response to the determination, may identify and serve, for display to John Doe, a search result web-page that includes the results of the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., seeFIG. 7 ). If the map-based search for “Arlington” submitted by John Doe were to be weakly mapped to the refined result that corresponds to the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, the search server may serve, for display to John Doe, a search result web-page that includes a set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington” along with a link to the results of the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., seeFIG. 6 ). In some embodiments, the mapping is stored in a database (e.g., datastore 810) or similar data repository. - It will be appreciated that such logs and mappings may be anonymized to protect the identity of the user. For example, the log may be associated with a user ID (e.g., 1234), as opposed to actual name of the user. Moreover, the user may be provided an option enable such records to be maintained. For example, prior to allowing a search service to engage in provided personalized search results as described herein, the user may be provided with a description of the data that is to be collected and its use, as well as an option to enable collection and use of the data. Further, it will be appreciated that such logs and mapping may only be maintained during a period for which they are relevant. For example, the logs/mapping may only reflect data that has been collected within the last four weeks, with the older data being purged from the log/mapping.

FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates amethod 100 of mapping search queries to refined results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.Method 100 may include receiving a plurality of search queries from one or more users (block 102). In some embodiments, the search queries may include any variety of search queries received from one or more users. For example, receiving a plurality of search queries from a user may include a search server receiving, from a user device, one or more free-text searches, map-based searches or the like submitted by John Doe. In some embodiments, the search queries may be associated with one or more locations. For example, the one or more free-text searches, map-based searches or the like submitted by John Doe may include one or more free-text searches or map-based searches for the query string “Arlington”. In some embodiments, an identity of a user submitting the search queries may be identified by the search server based at least in part on credential information provided by the users (e.g., user log-in information such as name and password), cookie information stored in the user's browser and transmitted to the search server, or the like. Such identity data may be used to associate logged searches and/or refinements to the user. -
Method 100 may include providing search results responsive to the plurality of search queries (block 104). In some embodiments, providing search results responsive to the plurality of search queries may include, for each of the search queries, providing for the display of the corresponding search result content. For example, with regard to the search query for “Arlington”, the search server may process the search query to identify an initial set of search results responsive to the search query (e.g., including any variety maps, webpages or the like related to Arlington, including those related to Arlington, Tex., Arlington, Va., or the like), and serve, to the user device for display to John Doe, a webpage that includes content (e.g., webpage links, maps, etc.) that corresponds to the initial set of search results identified as being responsive to the search query (e.g., seeFIG. 5 ). In some embodiments, the set of initial search results is identified and ranked using various search techniques, such as identifying search results including content that matches or is at least similar to the search criteria, and ranking the results based on their global prominence (e.g., popularity globally), their local prominence (e.g., their popularity in the location where the user identified as being is located), etc. -
Method 100 may include identifying search refinements (block 106). In some embodiments, identifying search refinements includes identifying search refinements by the user shortly after submission of the search query and/or presentation of the search query results. For example, with regard to the map-based search query for “Arlington” submitted by John Doe, identifying search refinements may include identify subsequent actions by John Doe, such as editing the search string “Arlington” to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, panning/zooming a displayed interactive map of Arlington, Tex. to the geographic region including the Texas Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, and so forth shortly after he submitted the search query and/or was presented with the search query results. In some embodiments, identifying search refinements includes generating a refinement log. For example, where John Doe refines the search string from “Arlington” to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” after being presented with a traditional set of search results for the map-based search query of “Arlington”, a refinement log may be generated/updated to reflect the refinement by John Doe. -
FIG. 2 is an illustration ofrefinement log 200 in accordance with one more embodiments of the present invention.Refinement log 200 may include a record of refinements made by one or more users subsequent to submitting search queries. For example,refinement log 200 may include a record of search queries and search query refinements submitted by John Doe. In the illustrated embodiment,refinement log 200 includes search-query/result pairs 202, including a query-profile 204 and aresult 206, as well as corresponding number 208 and/or percentages of times the search queries and refinement by the user have occurred 210 within the last four weeks. For example, in the illustrated embodiment,refinement log 200 indicates that, shortly after submitting the a map-based search query for “Arlington” ten times within the last four weeks, John Doe has refined the search string from “Arlington” to “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times (i.e., 90% of the time), and refined the search string from “Arlington” to “Arlington Va.” one time (i.e., 10% of the time). In some embodiments,refinement log 200 may be stored in a memory, such as a database (e.g., database 810) or a similar memory location accessible by the search server. Although the illustrated log includes a log of full/complete search queries for illustrative purposes, embodiments may include a log of partial/incomplete search queries. For example, where John Doe has entered a partial map-based search query for “Arl” ten times in the last four weeks (e.g., when entering the search string “Arlington”) and has ultimately searched for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” nine times shortly after completing and submitting the search query, the log may include a count of nine and a percentage of 90% for a corresponding search-query/result pair relating to John Doe's partial map-based search for “Arl” and the refined result including a map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”. -
Method 100 may include mapping of search queries to refined results (block 108). In some embodiments, mapping of search queries to refined results is based at least in part on the identified search refinements. For example, mapping of search queries to refined results may include assessingrefinement log 200 to identify search-query/result pairs that satisfy at least a minimum threshold criteria (e.g., occur at least a minimum threshold number/percentage of times within a given time frame). - In some embodiments, the thresholds number/percentages used to identify mappings may include ranges that are associated with various levels of interaction that can be used to identify strengths of the mappings. For example, a first level (e.g., corresponding to a strength of “weak”) may be associated with those search-query/result pairs that occur somewhat consistently (e.g., within the last four weeks the user has navigated to the refined result shortly after submitting the search query on least three occasions and at least 40% of the time). A second level (e.g., corresponding to a strength of “strong”) may be associated with those search-query/result pairs that occur consistently (e.g., within the last four weeks the user has navigated to the refined result shortly after submitting the search query on least five occasions and at least 70% of the time).

FIG. 3 is an illustration of arefinement mapping 300 in accordance with one more embodiments of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiments,mapping 300 includes a listing of search-query/result pairs 202 that have been identified as meeting the criteria for a refined result based at least in part on the information provided inrefinement log 200. Although the illustrated mapping includes a mapping of the full/complete search queries for illustrative purposes, embodiments may include mappings of partial/incomplete search queries. For example, a partial map-based search query for “Arl” may be mapped to a refined result that includes the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”.Refinement mapping 300 also includes an indication of the strength of the particular mappings. Although certain embodiments refer to accessing arefinement mapping 300 to identify mappings between query profiles and refined query results, it will be appreciated that other embodiments may include identifying mappings via direct assessment of the information contained inrefinement log 200 or similar information resource. - In some embodiments, the search results displayed to the user in response to a given search query may be based at least in part on a refinement mapping. For example, in response to receiving a map-based search for “Arlington” from John Doe, a search server may access the
refinement mapping 300, determine that the map-based search “Arlington” submitted by John Doe is strongly mapped to a refined result that corresponds to the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, and, in response to the determination, may identify search results for the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” and serve, for display to John Doe, a search result web-page that includes search results for the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., seeFIG. 7 ). Were, for example, the mapping to identify a weak mapping to the refined result that corresponds to the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, the search server may identify the search results for the map-based search query “Arlington” and serve, for display to John Doe, a search results web-page that includes a set of search results for the map-based search query “Arlington” along with a link to search results for the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., seeFIG. 6 ). -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart that illustrates amethod 400 of providing personalized search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.Method 400 may include receiving a search query from a user (block 402). Receiving a search query from a user may include, for example, a search server receiving, from a user device, a partial or full search query provided by John Doe. In some embodiments, the search query may be associated with one more locations. For example, the search query submitted by John Doe may include map-based search for “Arlington”. In some embodiments, an identity of the user may be identified by the search server based at least in part on credential information provided by the user (e.g., user log-in information such as name and password), cookie information stored in the user's browser and transmitted to the search server, or the like. Such identity information may be used to associate the user to a particular refinement long and/or mapping. For example, upon logging in, a session for John Doe may be opened that logs searches and refinements by John Doe torefinement log 200, and/or relies onrefinement log 200 and/ormapping 300 for identifying search results and/or refined results. -
Method 400 may include determining whether the search query is mapped to a refined result (block 404). In some embodiments, determining whether the search query is mapped to a refined result may include assessing a refinement mapping for the user. For example, in response to receiving the map-based search “Arlington” from John Doe, the search server may accessrefinement mapping 300 for John Doe to determine whetherrefinement mapping 300 includes aquery profile 204 that corresponds to (e.g., matches or is otherwise related to) the map-based search “Arlington”. In the illustrated embodiment, it may be determined thatrefinement mapping 300 does include a query profile 204 (e.g., “Map Search+‘Arlington’”) that does correspond to the map-based search “Arlington” submitted by John Doe and, thus, it may be determined that the search query is mapped to a refined result. If, for example, therefinement mapping 300 did not include a mapping of the map-based search query “Arlington” to a refined result, it may be determined that the search query is not mapped to a refined result. In some embodiments, determining whether the search query is mapped to a refined result may include assessing a refinement mapping for the user to determine whether or not a partial search query is mapped to a refined result. For example, where the partial map-based search for “Arl” is mapped to the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, upon John Doe has typing in the letters “Arl” in a map-based search field, the search server may identify the map-based search for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” as a refined result for the partial/incomplete search query “Arl” and display the map-based search results for “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” before John Doe even completes or submits the search query. - Although certain embodiments refer to accessing
refinement mapping 300 to identify mappings between query profiles and refined results, it will be appreciated that other embodiments may include identifying mappings via direct assessment of refinement log 200 (or similar information resource) in a manner similar to that described with regard to generating refinement mapping 300 (e.g., at block 108). For example, it may be determined that aquery profile 204 is mapped to arefined result 206, and/or a corresponding strength of the mapping may be determined, based at least in part on a comparison of corresponding number 208 and/orpercentages 210 of occurrences to relevant thresholds. -
Method 400 may include, in response to determining that that the search query is not mapped to a refined result, providing for the display of search results content corresponding to the search query (block 406). For example, in response to determining the map-based search query for “Arlington” is not mapped to a refined result, the search server may identify a set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington” and serve, to the user device for display to John Doe, a search results web-page similar including the set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington” in a manner similar to that ofFIG. 5 .FIG. 5 is an illustration of a map-basedsearch results webpage 500 displayingsearch results 502 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. As depicted, search results 502 include an exemplary listing of search results 504 (including a link to a place page for Arlington, Tex.) and an interactive geographic map 506 (of Arlington, Tex.) that are responsive to the map-based search query “Arlington”. -
Method 400 may include, in response to determining that the search query is mapped to a refined result, determining whether the mapping is strong or weak (block 408). In some embodiments, determining whether the search query is strongly mapped to the refined result may include further assessing the refinement mapping for the user. For example, in response to determining thatrefinement mapping 300 includes aquery profile 204 that corresponds to the map-based search “Arlington” by John Doe, it may be determined that the mapping is “strong” based at least in part on thecorresponding strength 302 provided inrefinement mapping 300. The mapping may be determined to be “weak” ifstrength 302 were to include a listing of weak as opposed to strong. -
Method 400 may include, in response to determining that that mapping is weak, providing for the display of search result content responsive to the search query and including an option to navigate to refined result content (block 410). For example, in response to determining that the mapping of the map-based search for “Arlington” to the map-based search query “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” is weak, the search server may identify a set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington” and serve, to the user device for display to John Doe, a search results web-page including the set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington”, along with a link to results of map-based search query “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”, in a manner similar to that ofFIG. 6 . -
FIG. 6 is an illustration of a map-basedsearch results webpage 600 including alink 601 to a refined result in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. As depicted, search results 602 include a listing of search results 604 (including a link to a place page for Arlington, Tex.) and an interactive geographic map 606 (of Arlington, Tex.) that are responsive to the map-based search query “Arlington”. Upon selection oflink 601, the user may be redirected to a set of refined search results that are responsive to the map-based search query “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” (e.g., seeFIG. 7 ). That is, the user can select link 601 to navigate directly to the refined search result. -
Method 400 may include, in response to determining that that mapping is strong, providing for the display of refined result content (block 412). For example, in response to determining that the mapping of the map-based search for “Arlington” to the map-based search query “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” is strong, the search server may identify a set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” and may serve, to the user device for display to John Doe, a search results web-page including a set of search results that are responsive to the map-based search “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark” in a manner similar to that ofFIG. 7 . -
FIG. 7 is an illustration of a map-basedsearch results webpage 700 displaying arefined result 702 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. As depicted,refined result 702 includes a listing of search results 704 (including a link to a place page for Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington) and an interactive geographic map 706 (of the region including the Texas Ranger's Ballpark in Arlington) that are responsive to the map-based search query “Arlington Texas Ranger's Ballpark”. In the illustrated embodiment,webpage 700 also includes a user selectable link 708 for returning to non-personalized search results (e.g., the initial, unrefined set of search results). Upon selection oflink 708, the user may be redirected to a search results webpage similar to that ofFIG. 5 orFIG. 6 . That is, the user can select link 708 to navigate to unrefined search results that are at least partially responsive to the initial map-based search query “Arlington”. -
