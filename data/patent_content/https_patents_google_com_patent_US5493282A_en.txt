Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to the field of addressed messaging communication systems, and more particularly to an addressing method for conserving power in distributed communication receivers in an information distribution system.
- conserveing power is particularly important in portable communication receivers which are typically powered by battery power or other depletable power source.
- an information distribution system periodically transmits large amounts of information to distributed communication receivers.
- the large volume of transmitted information per transmission batch and the large number of transmissions over time can require the communication receivers to receive and process the transmitted information and consequently consume power most of the time. This can seriously reduce the battery life of the communication receivers.
- Short battery life normally equates to requiring the users of the communication receivers to replenish the batteries or other depletable power source in the communication receivers more often than would reasonably be acceptable by the users.
- the added waste of the depleted batteries can be an environmentally unacceptable byproduct.
- the communication receiver receives the transmitted information, determines whether the communication receiver has subscribed to the particular transmitted information, and then, if subscribed to, stores the transmitted information into a memory for subsequent retrieval by a user of the communication receiver.
- a distributed population of paging receivers may subscribe to one or more different information categories, e.g., weather, stock, sports, news, etc., from a very large selection, and possibly from more than one information service provider.
- Each one of the many subscription categories of the information service provider typically is uniquely identifiable to the subscribing paging receivers.
- Each paging receiver can selectively "detect" only the "subscribed to" information message, e.g., by detecting an address coupled with the transmitted information.
- the paging receiver attempts to conserve power and extend battery life by turning off unnecessary electronic circuits when the information message is not destined for the particular paging receiver.
- This continuous process of receiving information and determining whether the communication receiver subscribed to the particular transmitted information can rapidly deplete the power of a power source, e.g., a battery, because more often than not the communication receiver is.
- each communication receiver may want to subscribe to a large number of information subscriptions from one or more information service providers.
- each information subscription may be embedded in a larger information transmission batch, where each information subscription is identified by an address also embedded in the batch. All the communication receivers subscribing to a particular information subscription must search for the particular subscription address to detect the transmission of the information subscription. While searching for the particular address in large information transmission batches that are being periodically transmitted the communication receivers can consume significant amounts of power from their power sources.
- one approach has been to include sub-addressing information in a data portion of a long transmitted message. That is, a communication receiver would detect an address in the message, such as to identify the general information service provider, and subsequently would search the length of a long data portion of the message to identify whether any subscriptions are transmitted within the transmission. These subscriptions comprised sub-addresses followed by corresponding information data for each sub-address, all within the data portion of the message.
- One communication system of the general type discussed above is disclosed in International Application Number PCT/US88/01581, which was published on Nov. 17, 1988 having the International Publication Number WO 88/09104, by the inventors Fascenda et al.
- An alternative approach can be to provide many different addresses to the general information service provider, one address for each of the many subscriptions in the service.
- conventional communication receivers subscribing to anything more than a small number of subscriptions would be overwhelmed by the processing power required to decode all the potential addresses corresponding to their subscriptions.
- a method for decoding a transmitted message in a communication receiver the message comprising an address code word and an associated data portion, the address code word comprising an address portion.
- the communication receiver receives an address code word of a transmitted message, and then corrects up to a predetermined number of bit errors in the received address code word.
- the communication receiver can conserve power during at least one of until a subsequent address code word is expected to be received, and during the data portion of the transmitted message following a failed correction of the address code word.
- the communication receiver compares the address portion of the corrected address code word to at least one predetermined subscription address.
- the communication receiver can conserve power during at least one of until a subsequent address code word is expected to be received, and during the data portion of the transmitted message following a determination of no match between the address portion of the corrected address code word and the at least one predetermined subscription address.

- the controller 816 recovers from the code memory 822, the transmission phase number to which the data communication receiver is assigned. The phase number is transferred to the phase select output ( ⁇ Select) of the controller 816 and is coupled to an input of phase selector 828.
- a phase clock corresponding to the transmission phase assigned, is provided at the output of the phase selector 828 and is coupled to clock inputs of the demultiplexer 820, block de-interleaver 824, and address and data decoders 830 and 832, respectively.
- the demultiplexer 820 is used to select the binary bits associated with the assigned transmission phase which are then coupled to the input of block de-interleaver 824, and clocked into the de-interleaver array on each corresponding phase clock.
- the de-interleaver array is an 8 ⁇ 32 bit array which de-interleaves eight interleaved address, control or message code words, corresponding to one transmission block.
- the de-interleaved address code words are coupled to the input of address correlator 830.
- the controller 816 recovers the address patterns assigned to the data communication receiver 106, and couples the patterns to a second input of the address correlator.
- the message information associated with the address is then decoded by the data decoder 832 and stored in a message memory 850 in a manner well known to one skilled in the art of selective call receivers.
- a sensible alert signal is generated by the controller 816.
- the sensible alert signal is preferably an audible alert signal, although it will be appreciated that other sensible alert signals, such as tactile alert signals, and visual alert signals can be generated as well.
- the audible alert signal is coupled by the controller 816 to an alert driver 834 which is used to drive an audible alerting device, such as a speaker or a transducer 836. The user can override the alert signal generation through the use of user input controls 838 in a manner well known in the art.
- the message information is coupled to the input of data decoder 832 which decodes the encoded message information into preferably a BCD or ASCII format suitable for storage and subsequent display.
- data decoder 832 decodes the encoded message information into preferably a BCD or ASCII format suitable for storage and subsequent display.
- the stored message information can be recalled by the user using the user input controls 838 whereupon the controller 816 recovers the message information from memory, and provides the message information to a display driver 840 for presentation on a display 842, such as an LCD display.
- FIG. 15 is a flow chart describing the operation of the data communication receiver in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the controller operation is initialized, at step 1504. Power is periodically applied to the receiver portion to enable receiving information present on the assigned RF channel.
- battery saver operation is resumed, at step 1508.
- the synchronization word correlator begins searching for bit synchronization at step 1510.
- bit synchronization is obtained, at step 1510, the "A" word correlation begins at step 1512.
- the message transmission rate is identified as described above, at step 1516, and because frame synchronization is obtained, the time (T1) to the start of the frame identification code word is identified, at step 1518.
- the non-complemented "A” word is not detected, at step 1514, indicating the non-complemented "A” word may have been corrupted by a burst error during transmission, a determination is made whether the complemented "A" bar” is detected, at step 1520.
- the "A bar” word is not detected at step 1512, indicating that the "A-bar” word may also have been corrupted by a burst error during transmission, battery saver operation is again resumed, at step 1508.
- the message transmission rate is identified as described above, at step 1522, and because frame synchronization is obtained, the time (T2) to the start of the frame identification code word is identified, at step 1524.
- decoding of the frame identification word occurs, at step 1526.
- the frame ID detected is not one assigned to the data communication receiver, at step 1528, battery saving is resumed, at step 1508, and remains so until the next assigned frame is to be received.
- the decoded frame ID corresponds to an assigned frame ID, at step 1528, the message reception rate is set, at step 1530. An attempt to bit synchronize at the message transmission rate is next made at step 1532.
- step 1533 When bit synchronization is obtained, at step 1533, the "C" word correlation begins at step 1534.
- frame synchronization is obtained, and the time (T3) to the start of the message information is identified, at step 1538.
- step 1536 When the non-complemented "C” word is not detected, at step 1536, indicating the non-complemented “C” word may have been corrupted by a burst error during transmission, a determination is made whether the complement "C bar" is detected, at step 1540. When the "C bar” word is not detected at step 1540, indicating that the "C-bar” word may also have been corrupted by a burst error during transmission, battery saver operation is again resumed, at step 1508. When the "C-bar" word is detected, at step 1540, frame synchronization is obtained, and the time (T4) to the start of the message information is identified, at step 1542. At the appropriate time, message decoding can begin at step 1544.
- the reliability of synchronizing with synchronization information which is subject to burst error corruption is greatly enhanced.
- the use of a predetermined synchronization code word as the first synchronization code word, and a second predetermined synchronization code word which is the complement of the first predetermined synchronization code word allows accurate frame synchronization on either the first or the second predetermined synchronization code word.
- additional information such as the transmission data rate can be provided, thereby enabling the transmission of message information at several data bit rates.
- FIG. 16 is a timing diagram illustrating the organization of the transmission frame utilized in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the transmission frame comprises a synchronization code word 1600 followed by eleven data blocks labeled Block 0 to Block 10. Address, control and message code words are distributed within the eleven data blocks in a predetermined order.
- the first code word, located in Block 0 is always a block information code word 1602 and includes such information as the beginning locations of an address field 1604 and a vector field 1606, leaving eighty-seven code words available in the frame for the transmission of address, vector and data code words.
- the controller 816 By knowing the beginning location of the address field 1604 and the vector field 1606, the controller 816 is able to calculate how many address code words must be decoded per frame in order to determine when a message is present within the frame. Consequently, the address field 1604 includes one or more address code words corresponding to messages located within a data field 1608. Address code words specifying, for example, numeric and alphanumeric messages have associated message information located within the data field 1608. Tone only messages can communicate all necessary information in the address code word, or optionally with a control code word in the vector field 1606, and consequently would not have associated message information located within the data field 1608.
- the vector field 1606 includes control words 1607, or vectors, which include information to identify the starting location 1612 of messages 1610 located within the data field 1608.
- the vector code word 1607 identifies the location of the first data code word 1612 and also the number of data code words in the data portion 1610 of the message for the current frame. Further, there is a one to one correspondence between the relative location of the address code words 1605 located within the address field 1604 and the relative location of the associated vectors (vector code words) 1607 located within the vector field 1606.
- the relative location of an address code word 1605 in the address field 1604 points to the location of an associated vector 1607 in the vector field 1606 which includes information that then points via 1609 to the starting location 1612 of a message 1610 in the data field 1608 of the current frame.
- This indirect pointing scheme provides significant flexibility in arranging the message information within transmission frames for the communication system 100 because the message information, including the relative starting position of the message information in a transmission frame, can be dynamically allocated to one or more transmission frames as the frames are being processed for transmission.
- the paging terminal 102 can organize the message information into the transmission frames as the paging requests are being processed with significant flexibility in selecting the relative position of the message information within the transmission frames.
- FIG. 17 is a more detailed electrical block diagram of the address correlator 830 (FIG. 8) configured for partial interleaved address correlation, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the recovered address information is selected by the demultiplexer 820 shown in FIG. 8, such as by the data transmission rate and phase assigned to the receiver 106, and is applied to an input of the address correlator 830.
- the recovered address information is serially coupled to the input of the address correlator 830 via the block de-interleaver 824. That is, the block de-interleaver 824 and the address correlator 830 receive the recovered address information as selected by the demultiplexer 820.
- the phase clock which is synchronized to the recovered data and which is generated by the phase timing generator 826 and phase selector 828, as shown in FIG. 8, is coupled to the clock input of the address correlator 830 and therein coupled to the clock input of an address bit demultiplexer 1710 as shown in FIG. 17 to allow the recovered data to be clocked into the address bit demultiplexer 1710.
- the address bit demultiplexer 1710 sequentially selects an input 1720,1730 of one of eight address correlators 1722,1732 for each bit of recovered data from the demultiplexer 820 thereby performing the address de-interleaving process.
- the first address correlator 1722 and the eighth address correlator 1732 are specifically shown in FIG. 17, while the other six similar address correlators are implied by the dotted lines between address correlators one 1722 and eight 1732.
- the phase clock from the phase selector 828 is also coupled to the clock input of a divide by eight selector 1711 which provides eight select outputs A through H. Each of the eight select outputs A through H is enabled once every eight clock pulses of the phase clock. Each select output couples a select pulse signal to a select input 1725,1735 of each of the eight address correlators 1722,1732.
- the select pulse signals are synchronized with the address bit demultiplexer 1710 to provide a select pulse to each one of the eight address correlators 1722,1732 when its corresponding bit of recovered address information from the demultiplexer 820 is selectively coupled to the input 1720,1730 of the selected one of eight address correlators 1722,1732.
- eight interleaved address code words can be contemporaneously de-interleaved and processed (partially correlated bit by bit) by the eight address correlators 1722,1732.
- other numbers of address code words can be de-interleaved and processed using obvious variations of the structure and method described above.
- Each of the eight address correlators 1722,1732 comprises a received address register which stores each incoming bit of a received address code word corresponding to the particular address correlator.
- Each address code word comprises an address pattern, e.g., twenty one bits of received address information out of thirty two bits in a received address code word.
- Each bit is clocked into the received address register using the select pulse signals at the select input 1725,1735.
- each of the eight address correlators 1722,1732 comprises a received bit count accumulator 1724,1734 which accumulates a total count for the number of bits of a received address code word stored in the corresponding received address register.
- At least one predetermined address pattern e.g., a twenty one bit predetermined address pattern, corresponding to an address to which the data communication receiver 106 is assigned is applied to a second input of the address correlators 1722,1732, and stored in at least one predetermined address register for each of the eight address correlators 1722,1732.
- each of the eight address correlators 1722,1732 comprises a predetermined address register, an address correlator/comparator, and a bit error accumulator 1726,1728,1736,1738.
- the first 1726 and last 1728 groupings of predetermined address register, address correlator/comparator, and bit error accumulator are shown corresponding to predetermined address pattern one and predetermined address pattern P, where the intervening groupings are implied by the dotted line.
- address correlator eight 1732 is shown with the dotted line between the first 1736 and last 1738 groupings indicating other implied groupings. Again here the groupings correspond to the predetermined address patterns one to P.
- the communication receiver 106 is pre-configured to selectively respond to the predetermined address patterns one to P.
- the address correlator/comparator compares each incoming bit of a received address pattern with a corresponding bit of a predetermined address pattern. If the bits do not match then the address correlator/comparator applies a bit error signal to the bit error accumulator 1726,1736.
- the bit error accumulator 1726,1736 is clocked according to the select pulse signals at the select input 1725,1735 to accumulate a total count of the number of mismatched bits between a received address pattern and a predetermined address pattern. In this way, each of the eight address correlators 1722,1732 receives an address pattern as part of the recovered data from the demultiplexer 820 and correlates the received address pattern with the at least one predetermined address pattern.
- the correlation provides at least one bit error count corresponding to the at least one predetermined address pattern, respectively. For each predetermined address pattern, if the bit error count exceeds a predetermined threshold, such as more than two bit errors, then the predetermined address pattern does not match the received address pattern to the predetermined number of bits as indicated by exceeding the predetermined threshold count.
- a predetermined threshold such as more than two bit errors
- the address correlators 1722,1732 can determine before receiving all the bits of an address code word whether any predetermined address pattern will not match the address pattern being received. If all predetermined address patterns do not match the address pattern being received by each of the eight address correlators 1722,1732 then the communication receiver 106 can begin to conserve power, such as until the next block of eight address code words are to be decoded from the address field 1604, or otherwise as will be more fully discussed below.
- address correlation continues on the received address patterns, e.g., the twenty one bits of received address information, until either an address is detected, meaning at least one address received was received with less than the predetermined number of bit errors, or until all addresses are found to have more than the predetermined number of bit errors, at which time battery saving is initiated.
- the battery saving operation described above allows battery saving earlier than would be possible when complete block de-interleaving is used prior to address correlation.
- the address correlators 1722,1732 When the address correlators 1722,1732 can not rule out all of the predetermined address patterns as not matching the incoming received address patterns, the address correlators 1722,1732 consequently continue receiving the incoming bits of the received address patterns, preferably until the eight address code words are totally received into the eight received address registers of the eight address correlators 1722,1732. After fully receiving the eight address code words, the predetermined address patterns which are still candidates for matching with the received address patterns corresponding to the received address code words are further processed to determine a match.
- the controller 816 couples to an error corrector 1714 each received address code word which has at least one candidate predetermined address pattern (not exceeding the bit error threshold count) to correct, for example, up to two error bits that may be included in the received address code word.
- the error correction is performed in a manner well known to those skilled in the art.
- the error corrector 1714 indicates to the controller 816 whether the correction was successful.
- the received address code word has too many received bit errors and will be removed from consideration as a viable received address code word. No further processing of an uncorrectable address code word is done.
- the error corrector 1714 If the error corrector 1714 successfully corrects the address code word, then the error corrector 1714 sends a signal thereof to the controller 816 accordingly. Then, an address comparator 1712 compares the address pattern of a corrected address code word from the error corrector 1714 with each candidate predetermined address pattern. Specifically, the controller 816 couples each candidate predetermined address pattern into a predetermined address register for the address comparator 1712, and then the address comparator 1712 performs the comparison with the address pattern of the corrected address code word from the error corrector 1714.
- a match between the address pattern of a received address code word and a predetermined address pattern indicates that the communication receiver 106 is selected for reception of a message.
- a data message associated with the address code word having the matching address pattern is normally located in the data field 1608 of the current transmission frame as discussed earlier.
- the communication receiver 106 can store in memory 822 a marker indicating the address code word as a match and for subsequently receiving the corresponding message data from the data field 1608 of the current transmission frame.
- the code memory 822 is shown including a subscription list 1702.
- the subscription list 1702 is utilized by the address correlator 830 to identify at least one predetermined service address 1704 and at least one predetermined category address 1706 associated with each one of the at least one predetermined service address 1704.
- each predetermined service address 1704 identifies a particular information service provider.
- each predetermined category address 1706 identifies a subscription provided by the particular information service provider.
- the combination of the predetermined service address 1704 and the predetermined category address 1706 constitutes a subscription address for the particular information service provider.
- This combination address is considered a multi-recipient address because the subscription address is typically broadcasted to all subscribing communication receivers.
- the communication system can deliver information services to the subscribers of an information service provider.
- the communication receiver 106 can then quickly and efficiently detect an address code word 1605 comprising the subscription identification, and consequently can decode the associated data portion 1610 of a transmitted message, which comprises the subscribed to information.
- a user can subscribe to one or more information services as identified by the respective predetermined service addresses 1704. Also, for each information service the user can subscribe to one or more information subscriptions as identified by a corresponding category address 1706.
- the subscription list 1702 preferably is organized in tabular fashion, where the table comprises 1, 2, or more service addresses as indicated by the doted line 1708.
- Each predetermined service address 1704 is associated with a grouping of one or more predetermined category addresses 1706 which are preferably organized in a block in memory 822.
- the predetermined service address 1704 comprises 16 bits of information.
- the predetermined category address 1706 comprises 5 bits of information.
- a predetermined service address 1704 combined with one of the predetermined category addresses 1706 preferably comprises 21 bits of information constituting a predetermined subscription address.
- the predetermined subscription address uniquely identifies a subscription to an information service provided by an information service provider.
- this predetermined subscription address matches a received subscription address, e.g., the address portion of an error corrected received address code word, the communication receiver 106 has detected an address code word 1605 comprising the subscription identification and consequently can decode the associated data portion 1610 of a transmitted message, which comprises the subscribed to information.
- the address code word 1800 is a 32 bit data word. Further, it is preferably organized as a 32, 21BCH code word, as described below. From the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), the address code word 1800 includes, for example, a 5 bit category address 1802, a 16 bit service address 1804, a 10 bit parity word 1806, and a parity bit 1808. Although the category address and the service address are discussed as being 5 bits and 16 bits, respectively, it is understood that other number of bits may be used for each of the two fields. Further, one address field of a predefined length, e.g., a 21 bit field, can be used to represent a subscription address to perform the total address correlation therewith.
- LSB least significant bit
- MSB most significant bit
- a 10 bit parity word 1806 is selected such that every address code word 1800 differs by at least 5 bits from every other address code word 1800 in the addressing protocol. This parity word 1806 is useful for the error corrector 1714 for performing error correction of a received address code word 1800.
- the parity bit 1808 can be defined as an even or an odd parity bit for the entire address code word 1800. For example, if the lower 31 bits of an address code word 1800 include an even number of ones then the parity bit 1808 may be set to zero. For an odd number of ones in the lower 31 bits of an address code word 1800, the parity bit 1808 may be set to 1. Hence, the parity bit 1808 provides a relatively quick way to detect 1 bit of error in a received address code word 1800.
- a block of addresses are reserved in a predetermined address space for all of the information service providers.
- the block of addresses for all the information service providers could be organized into sub-blocks of 32 subscription addresses for each information service provider.
- each service address 1804 can have associated with it up to 32 category addresses 1802.
- each information service provider can be assigned a block of addresses, such as 32 subscription addresses, where the blocks of addresses are distributed throughout the entire address space of the communication system with a maximum numerical distance (or as distant as may be desired in an addressing scheme) between address blocks assigned to individual information service providers.
- This distribution of address blocks tends to reduce the probability that the bit patterns of the addresses assigned to a first information service provider are "virtually" the same as the bit patterns of the addresses assigned to a second information service provider.
- an address correlation process in the communication receiver 106 that is subscribing to one or more information service providers can detect as early as possible that a correlation between a subscription address being received does not match any predetermined subscription addresses in memory 822. Consequently, the communication receiver 106 can begin conserving power as soon as no match is determined, preferably as early in the address correlation process as possible, and therefore will additionally extend battery life for the communication receiver 106.
- the address code word 1800 is organized with the parity word 1806 to allow an error corrector 1714 (FIG. 17) to correct, for example, up to two error bits included in a received address code word in a manner well known to those skilled in the art.
- an error corrector 1714 FOG. 17
- the received address code word can be restored to the correct value and then the subscription address from the corrected address code word can be utilized to determine whether the received and corrected subscription address matches with a predetermined subscription address for the communication receiver 106.
- a serial bit stream of data is coupled from the demultiplexer 820 to an input of the address correlator 830. Further, the controller 816 retrieves predetermined address patterns from the code memory 822 and couples the patterns to a second input of the address correlators 1722,1732. These predetermined address patterns are the predetermined service addresses 1704 for correlating the service address 1804 portion of a received address code word 1800 thereto as discussed above.
- the least significant 21 bits of the address code word 1605 comprise a service address 1804 and a category address 1802, such as the 16 bits of service address 1804 and the 5 bits of category address 1802, the full 21 bit address field can alternatively be used as a complete identifier of a subscription address without requiring the two separate service address and category address sub-fields.
- a communication receiver 106 can process received addresses more quickly and efficiently, as will be more fully discussed below. Further, this partitioning of addresses into sub-fields also allows more efficient segmentation of the available address space for a communication system 100 to distribute smaller blocks of the available system addresses as a commercial resource between the member information service providers.
- the address correlator 830 determines if there is a match between the category address portion 1802 of the received address code word 1800 and one of the predetermined category addresses 1706 associated with the previously matching predetermined service address 1704. In one aspect of the preferred embodiment, the address correlator 830 performs a sequential comparison to detect a match by traversing a list of predetermined category addresses 1706 associated with the previously matching predetermined service address 1704.
- a table 1707 in memory 822 replaces the list 1706 associated with each predetermined service address 1704.
- the table 1707 comprises a collection of predetermined category addresses available from a service provider, the service provider being identified by the predetermined service address 1704.
- the address correlator 830 in this approach, utilizes a tabular look-up mechanism for performing the matching function between the received category address 1802 and the predetermined category addresses in the table 1707.
- the table 1707 can be indexed by the value contained in the received category address 1802. A marker located at the indexed table location will indicate whether the received category address 1802 is a match.
- the marker is set to a predetermined value it indicates that the received category address 1802 is subscribed to (a match) and that the data portion of the message should be received and stored into memory 850. If the marker, on the other hand, is not set to the predetermined value then the category address 1802 is not subscribed to (not a match).
- the message data portion associated with the address code word 1800 is subsequently decoded by the data decoder 832.
- the data decoder 832 can then store the decoded message data portion in a message memory 850.
- the data portion of the message stored in memory 850 provides the subscribed to information to the user of the communication receiver 106.
- the user can subsequently recall the stored message information by using the user input controls 838 whereupon the controller 816 retrieves the message information from memory and provides the message information to the display driver 846 for presentation on the display 842. In this way, the user has access to the subscribed to information.
- the controller 816 If the address correlator 830 determines that there is no match between the received service address 1804 of the received address code word 1800 and any one of the predetermined subscription addresses 1704, or that there is no match between the received category address 1802 and any predetermined address 1706,1707, using either approach discussed above, then the controller 816 generates a battery saving signal.
- This battery saving signal is coupled to an input of the battery saver circuit 848 to suspend the supply of power to the receiver circuits of the communication receiver 106. The supply of power will be suspended at least during the associated data portion of the message. For an information service provider, the data portion of the message may be fairly long.
- the battery life of the communication receiver 106 can be significantly improved.
- FIGS. 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 are flow diagrams illustrating operational sequences for the address correlator 830 and controller 816 according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- FIGS. 19, 20, 21, and 22 illustrate a preferred address decoding sequence
- FIG. 23 illustrates a tabular look-up alternative for determining a match between a received category address 1802 and the predetermined category addresses stored in a table 1707 in memory 822.
- FIGS. 24, 25, 26, and 27 will be used to illustrate some of the advantages of the tabular look-up approach.
- the address correlator 830 performs partial correlation of incoming bits of eight interleaved address code words, similar to as discussed before.
- the outer loop at steps 1904, 1906, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1918, and 1920, processes a received bit of a received service address 1804 for each of the eight address code words 1800 being de-interleaved, as discussed before with reference to FIG. 17.
- the service address 1804 in this example starts at bit six of a received address code word 1800.
- the first five bits of the address code word 1800 are stored in each of the eight received address registers of the eight address correlators 1722,1732 without being processed at this time.
- the inner loop For each bit of a received service address 1804, the inner loop, at steps 1906, 1908, 1912, and 1914, processes a corresponding bit of each of the predetermined service addresses 1704 to determine whether the bits match, at step 1908. If the bits do not match, at step 1908, then the error accumulator corresponding to the particular predetermined service address is incremented, at step 1910. Therefore, the inner loop updates bit error accumulators for all predetermined service addresses for each of the eight address correlators 1722,1732, and the outer loop steps through the eight address correlators 1722,1732, to process a currently received bit for eight address code words 1800 being de-interleaved.
- the address correlator 830 checks, at step 2002, if any of the bit error accumulators 1726, 1728, 1736, 1738, are still within the threshold count, e.g., less than or equal to two bits of accumulated bit errors, indicating that there are still candidate predetermined service addresses 1704, as discussed before with reference to FIG. 17. If there are no more candidate predetermined service addresses 1704, at step 2002, i.e., none of the address code words 1800 being de-interleaved are addressing the communication receiver 106 for reception of a message, then the controller 816 couples the battery saving signal to the input of the battery saver circuit 848, at step 2004, as discussed before. This conserves the life of the battery.
- a second outer loop processes a next bit of each of eight service addresses 1804 of eight de-interleaving address code words 1800. That is, as discussed earlier for FIG. 19, the eight address correlators 1722,1732, will process the next bit received with the eight address code words 1800 being de-interleaved.
- This second outer loop is repeated for the total number of bits of the service address 1804 for the eight address code words 1800 being de-interleaved. In our exemplary system protocol, this last bit is the twenty first bit of the address code word 1800.
- the address correlator 803 continues receiving, at step 2011, the remaining bits of the eight address code words 1800 being de-interleaved and stored in the eight received address registers of the eight address correlators 1722,1732.
- bits 22 to 32 for the eight address code words 1800 are received by the address correlator 830, at step 2011. Processing then continues on FIG. 21, at step 2012.
- a processing loop processes those received address code words 1800 having a candidate predetermined service address 1704, as discussed before with reference to FIG. 17.
- Candidates are service addresses that are determined to be valid address code words by virtue of their position in the exemplary system protocol, e.g., in the address field 1604 (FIG. 16), and that differ by two or less bits with a predetermined service address.
- the address correlator 830 performs error correction on those received address code words 1800, at step 2104. After a successful correction, at step 2106, the address correlator 830 directly compares the corrected service address 1804 to the candidate predetermined service address 1704 at step 2108.
- This direct comparison confirms, after the error correction of the address code word 1800, that the previous result of the bit by bit error accumulation between the received service address 1804 and the candidate predetermined service address 1704 was correct. If the candidate predetermined service address matches the received service address 1804, at step 2110, then the address correlator 830 determines whether the received category address 1802 matches a predetermined category address, at step 2111.
- the address correlator 830 traverses a list of predetermined category addresses 1706, at steps 2112, 2114.
- a processing loop repeats a comparison between the received category address 1802 and each predetermined category address 1706 in the list until a match is found, or until the total number of predetermined category addresses in the list 1706 are compared and no match found.
- step 2111 is replaced by the steps 2302, 2304, 2306, and 2308 as shown in FIG. 23.
- steps 2302, 2304, 2306, and 2308 illustrate the tabular look-up approach for determining whether a received category address 1802 matches a predetermined category address 1707, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 17.
- the predetermined category addresses are represented by a category address array 1707 having one or more dimensions, e.g., two dimensions (rows and columns) are shown in FIGS. 25 and 27.
- the received category address 1802 when performing look-ups using a multi-dimensional predetermined category address array 1707, is segmented into a plurality of sub-fields corresponding to the number of dimensions of the predetermined category address array 1707.
- a two dimensional array 1707 such as shown in FIGS. 25 and 27 is indexed by two sub-fields 2402,2404,2602,2604 of the received category address 1802, as shown in FIGS. 24 and 26, respectively.
- This tabular look-up approach has the advantage that the address correlator 830 can process a very large number of predetermined category addresses by indexing into a multi-dimensional array 1707 using markers at indexed locations in the array 1707 to indicate whether the communication receiver 106 is subscribing to a particular information category, as will be more fully discussed below.
- the address correlator 830 marks, at step 2116 (FIG. 21), the matching received address code word 1800 in memory 822 for subsequent processing of the data portion 1610 of the message corresponding to the address code word 1605 (see FIG. 16), as discussed before.
- the address correlator 830 determines whether there are more address code words 1605 to process in the address field 1604 of the current transmission frame. The number and position of the expected address code words is conveyed in the exemplary system protocol.
- the address correlator 830 reinitializes parameters, at step 2206, and begins to conserve battery power until the next address code words 1605 are to be processed. If there are no more address code words to be processed, at step 2204, the address correlator 830 subsequently decodes the data portion 610 of the messages whose address code words 1605 were previously marked as having matched a predetermined address for the communication receiver 106.
- the address correlator 830 can efficiently compare a received subscription address with a moderately large number of predetermined subscription addresses, such as thirty two. This allows an information service provider to offer a rich selection of information services to its customers, which is an advantage in today's competitive marketplace.
- information service providers may want to offer greater numbers of subscriptions to their subscribing members. For example, it may be desirable at a point in time for an information service provider to allow customers to have up to, say, 1,000 different subscriptions.
- the preferred embodiment of the present invention contemplates organizing the predetermined category addresses in an array 2500 having dimensions, such as two dimensions (rows and columns) in this example, and the received category address 1802, as discussed above, is partitioned into two sub-fields 2402, 2404.
- the first sub-field 2402 corresponds to a first dimension 2502 of a subscription array 2500 and the second sub-field 2404 corresponds to a second dimension 2504 of the subscription array 2500.
- the subscription array 2500 is stored in the subscription list 1702 to represent the predetermined category addresses for a each predetermined service address 1704.
- the first sub-field 2402 comprises 2 bits of information which corresponds to the first dimension 2502 of the array 2500 comprising four rows (labeled 0 to 3) for the array 2500 in the subscription list 1702.
- the second sub-field 2404 comprises 3 bits of information which corresponds to the second dimension 2504 of the array 2500.
- the second dimension 2504 comprises 8 columns (labeled 0 to 7).
- the category address 1802 would be represented by a status marker, such as a bit of information 2506, located within the array 2500 in the subscription list 1702.
- the status marker (bit) 2506 When the status marker (bit) 2506 is set to a predetermined value, such as the number 1, it indicates that the particular communication receiver 106 is currently subscribing to that specific subscription from the information service provider. Of course, the bit 2506 could alternatively be set to zero as an indication of an affirmative subscription. Therefore, once a subscription matrix 2500 is configured to a predetermined set of status markers in the subscription list 1702, a received category address 1802 can be quickly verified as to whether that subscription is enabled or disabled for the particular communication receiver 106 by utilizing the first and second sub-fields 2402, 2404, to address the rows 2502 and the columns 2504 of the subscription matrix 2500.
- the address correlator 830 can utilize the first and second sub-fields, 2402, 2404, of the received category address 1802 to quickly locate a status marker in the subscription matrix 2500.
- the location of the status marker in the subscription matrix 2500 is indicated by a traversal of the subscription matrix in the first dimension, e.g., the rows, corresponding to the value of the first sub-field 2402 and a traversal of the subscription matrix 2500 in the second dimension, e.g., the columns, corresponding to the value of the second sub-field 2404.
- the address correlator 830 can then determine the match or lack thereof by whether the status marker 2506 indicates an enabled or disabled subscription status, respectively.
- the address code word 1800 has the received category address 1802 comprising 10 bits of information (approximately 1,000 subscriptions available).
- the received category address 1802 is partitioned into 2 sub-fields 2602, 2604.
- the first sub-field 2602 comprises 7 bits of information and the second sub-field 2604 comprises 3 bits of information.
- the subscription matrix 2700 can be organized as having 128 rows 2702 by 8 columns 2704, as shown. That is, 128 bytes of information would be sufficient to represent approximately 1,000 subscriptions for a communication receiver 106.
- a 128 byte subscription matrix 2700 would be associated with each predetermined service address 1704 in the subscription list 1702.
- a similar method as discussed above could be used to process the sub-fields 2602, 2604, of a received category address 1802 to address rows 2702 and columns 2704 of the subscription array 2700 to determine whether a particular bit in the array 2700 is set to a predetermined value, e.g., set to the number one.
- a communication receiver 106 can quickly and efficiently determine whether a received category address matches with a predetermined category address or subscription in the subscription list 1702.
- the representation of category addresses in a subscription array 2700 is a very efficient way of organizing the subscription list 1702 in the code memory 822 which tends to conserve memory. It also enhances the operational speed of the address detection process which allows conventional microprocessor technology to be used to process very large numbers of subscription addresses in real time. This, of course, helps reduce the overall product cost for a communication receiver 106, which is important in this very competitive and cost sensitive market.
- the subscription matrix organization makes it possible for the address correlator 830 to quickly and efficiently determine whether the received subscription address matches one of the predetermined subscriptions stored in the subscription list 1702, it helps reduce the amount of time and raw operational power required to determine whether the received subscription address matches any one of, say, up to one thousand predetermined subscription addresses stored in memory 822. This, of course, tends to conserve power and extend battery life, as well as make it feasible for a communication receiver 106 to subscribe to a very large number of subscriptions from one or more information service providers while being economical to manufacture and to provide to consumers.
- the communication receiver 106 can significantly enhance battery life over known information service addressing schemes. Further, the present addressing protocol for a distributed information system enables the communication receiver 106 to selectively receive a very large number of different information subscriptions while maximizing the communication receiver's operational battery life, which is a significant advantage over known information service communication systems.
