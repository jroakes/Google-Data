Definitions
- the present invention relates in general to data transmission including redundant data transmission.
- Data communications protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol have been developed over many years. These protocols transmit data in packets, which can be lost during transmission due to a variety of factors, such as transmission errors and network congestion.
- Transmission Control Protocol To address this problem, it is known to provide data redundancy, in which a packet is transmitted more than once.
- a space satellite can transmit a low bit rate signal over a lossy forward link to a receiving station. The satellite may not have a return link to communicate whether a packet is received. Therefore, the satellite transmits redundant packets to increase the probability of successful reconstruction of the signal at the receiving station.
- One aspect of the disclosed embodiments is a method for decoding an encoded data signal.
- the computer-implemented method includes accessing in a memory a set of signal elements and receiving an encoded data signal at a computing device.
- the encoded data signal includes a plurality of signal fragments each having a projection value that has been calculated as a function of at least one signal element of the set of signal elements and at least a portion of the encoded data signal, and a value associating each respective signal fragment with the at least one signal element used to calculate the projection value.
- the computing device determines a plurality of amplitude values wherein at least one of the plurality of amplitude values is based on the projection value in at least one of the plurality of signal fragments.
- a decoded signal is determined using the plurality of amplitude values and signal elements associated with the at least one of the plurality of signal fragments.
- a method for decoding an encoded data signal.
- the computer-implemented method includes accessing in a memory a set of signal elements and receiving, at a computing device, the encoded data signal including a plurality of signal fragments each having a projection value and an index value.
- a plurality of selected signal elements are identified from the set of signal elements stored in the memory, at least one of the selected signal elements corresponds to the index value in at least one of the plurality of signal fragments.
- the computing device determines a decoded data signal based on the plurality of selected signal elements and at least one projection value included in the plurality of signal fragments.
- an apparatus for decoding an encoded data signal.
- the apparatus comprises a memory including a set of signal elements and a processor in communication with the memory.

- FIG. 9 is a logic flow chart illustrating operation of the encoder of FIG. 3 ;
- FIG. 10 is a logic flow chart illustrating operation of the decoder of FIG. 7 .
- a signal is decomposed during encoding into a plurality of data elements or fragments.
- each fragment includes an index value and a projection value.
- the index value points to an entry in a dictionary or other data structure of signal elements U i .
- the first step in this iterative process can include generating a reconstructed signal (REC) by decoding the fragments already in the list. This step can be skipped for the first iteration if the list is empty. Alternatively, the list can be initialized with an arbitrarily selected signal element selected without use of the reconstructed signal REC.
- a residual signal (R) is determined by subtracting the reconstructed signal REC from the original signal S. If the residual signal R is at or below a threshold (which can be zero), encoding processing can be completed. Otherwise, a new fragment is added to the list of fragments.
- the process of adding a new fragment begins by searching the dictionary for the signal element U i that maximizes the scalar product ⁇ R, U i >, where R is the residual signal.
- the new fragment can include the value of i (the location in the dictionary where the selected signal element U i resides) and a projection value, which can be equal to the scalar product of ⁇ S, U i >.
- the new fragment is added to the existing list of fragments. A repetition factor is assigned to the new fragment.
- the repetition factor can be a monotonic function of the scalar product's absolute value ⁇ R, U i >, which provides an indication of the transfer energy associated with (and thus may indicate the relative importance of) the fragment.
- the fragment In the output (Y) of the encoder, the fragment can be duplicated depending on the value of the repetition factor.
- the dictionary entry corresponding to the newly-added fragment is deleted or flagged so that it will not be used in a subsequently generated fragment.
- the process of decoding is used by the encoder itself (to create the reconstructed signal REC as described above) and also by a decoder in a receiving station that receives the encoded signal.
- the decoding process can begin by removing duplicate fragments having the same index value.
- An array of amplitude values A 0 . . . A N is determined for the N remaining fragments by performing a transform using the projection values contained in at least a plurality of fragments.
- the reconstructed signal REC can then be generated by computing the sum over all N fragments of A k *U i,k .
- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of one exemplary embodiment in which a communications network 20 includes a transmission station 22 , which in this illustration is a space-borne satellite, and a receiving station 24 , which in this case is a mobile tracking device coupled to a moving vehicle (not shown).
- Transmission station 22 communicates with receiving station 24 by broadcasting a packetized radio-frequency signal over a lossy forward link 26 .
- Communications network 20 can be implemented in a variety of configurations, and the embodiment of FIG. 1 is shown merely for illustration.
- transmission station 22 can be a terrestrial radio or laser transmitter (e.g., used in fiber optic communications) or a computer coupled to a network.
- Forward link 26 can be wireless or wired, or a combination of both. A variety of transport protocols could be employed in forward link 26 .
- transmission station 22 can send data to receiving station 24 without acknowledgment of the reception of packets.
- a return link can be provided so that transmission station 22 and receiving station 24 can have full or partial bi-directional communication.
- Forward link 26 can be lossy, owing to poor signal quality, transmission error, network congestion, signal obstruction or other causes. If forward link 26 is lossy, packets transmitted between transmission station 22 and receiving station 24 can be lost, resulting in signal degradation. To ensure successful transmission, transmission station 22 can transmit redundant packets of data along forward link 26 . This consumes bandwidth and it can be beneficial if the redundant transmission is optimized to maximize the fidelity of the reconstructed signal at receiving station 24 .
- packets as used in this specification is used in its broadest sense and includes datagrams, segments, blocks, cells and/or frames depending on the transmission protocol that is used.
- the embodiments as described herein can be used with a range of protocols and the invention is not intended to be limited to any one particular protocol.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the transmission station 22 shown in FIG. 1 .
- transmission station 22 includes a processing unit 28 and a transmitter, e.g., radio frequency (RF) transmitter 30 .
- Processing unit 28 performs the encoding of data described below and RF transmitter 30 transmits the resulting encoded signal using radio frequency(ies).
- Processing unit 28 can be realized in hardware, software, or any combination thereof including, for example, IP cores, ASICS, programmable logic arrays, programmable logic controllers, microcode, firmware, microcontrollers, microprocessors, digital signal processors or any other suitable implementation.
- Processing unit 28 can alternatively include a general purpose computer/processor with a computer program that, when executed, carries out any of the respective methods, algorithms and/or instructions described herein.
- a special purpose computer/processor can be utilized which can contain specialized hardware for carrying out any of the methods, algorithms and/or instructions described herein.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an encoder 32 used in the transmission station 22 of FIG. 1 .
- encoder 32 can be implemented by or in processing unit 28 , as explained above.
- encoder 32 accepts as input a data signal S, such as an audio signal ( FIG. 4 ) or video signal ( FIG. 5 ).
- Encoder 32 encodes the input signal S by decomposing it into a sequence or list of fragments (hereinafter referred to as fragment list 42 ).
- the fragments of fragment list 42 are described below, but generally each includes an index value and a projection value.
- Fragment list 42 is included in an output signal Y transmitted by a signal transmitting stage 44 on forward link 26 to receiving station 24 .
- encoder 32 transmits more important fragments multiple times to increase the probability that at least one copy of the each of the important fragments is received by receiving station 24 .
- the loss of packets containing a given fragment (even a so-called important fragment) need not substantially degrade the reconstructed signal, which is generated using the data in multiple fragments.
- encoder 32 has various stages to perform its encoding functions. These functions are described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10 .
- the stages of encoder 32 can include a signal receiving stage 34 , where an input signal S is accepted; a residual calculator stage 36 in which the input signal S is compared to a reconstructed signal REC to produce a residual signal R; a fragment calculator stage 38 , where a new fragment is determined using the content of a dictionary 40 , described below; and a decoder 46 .

- the final fragment list 42 is transmitted as a component of output signal Y via the signal transmitting stage 44 .
- selected fragments of fragment list 42 can be duplicated in output signal Y to provide redundancy.
- Encoder 32 can further compress output signal Y through entropy coding, for example. This further compression can be done in a context-free fashion so that each fragment can be compressed independently and does not depend on information in other fragments (as these can be lost in transmission).
- One suitable entropy coding scheme is Huffman coding.
- Dictionary 40 and fragment list 42 can be stored in any suitable memory (such as RAM or disk storage) and can both reside on the same physical storage area or can reside on different storage areas of the same or different types.
- Encoder 32 includes a decoder stage 46 in a return path 48 .
- Decoder stage 46 generates a reconstruction signal REC of input signal S.
- Reconstruction signal REC is synthesized from the fragment list 42 using the dictionary 40 .
- An example of the operation of decoder stage 46 is provided in FIG. 10 below.
- Residual calculator stage 36 uses reconstruction signal REC to determine a residual signal R. As explained below in more detail, when residual signal R is at or below a threshold, encoding processing can terminate.

- dictionary 40 is used by encoder 32 of FIG. 3 (and dictionary 64 is used by the decoder 60 of FIG. 7 ) to reconstruct an approximation of input signal S using the fragment list 42 generated by encoder 32 .
- dictionary 40 can be a relational database that comprises a plurality of rows or records 50 . Each record can have an index field 52 and a value field 54 .

- a particular value contained in value field 54 can correspond to a sample 56 of an audio input signal S as shown in FIG. 4 .
- a particular value in value field 54 can correspond to a block 58 of a video input signal S as shown in FIG. 5 .
- Value field 54 can contain a scalar, a vector or array, or a matrix, although it is illustrated as containing a scalar in FIG. 6 .
- the values U i of dictionary 40 are referred to herein generally as signal elements, and can form an over-complete set so that any signal can be recovered by at least one finite weighted sum of the dictionary entries.
- the values of value field 54 are real numbers that can be normalized so that the sum of their squares equals one.

- dictionary refers to all such structures.
- the index values stored in fragment list 42 are intended to match unique index values of a dictionary such as the values of index field 52 of dictionary 40 .

- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of receiving station 24 of FIG. 1 .
- receiving station 24 includes a decoder 60 that operates in a manner similar to decoder stage 46 in encoder 32 ( FIG. 3 ).
- Decoder 60 receives as input an input fragment list 62 .
- fragment list 62 can be identical to output signal Y of encoder 32 , which can include duplicate fragments that are generated for redundancy.
- Input fragment list 62 may not be a complete rendition of output signal Y because packets may have been lost during transmission on forward link 26 .
- Decoder 60 processes input fragment list 62 using a dictionary 64 , which is a copy of dictionary 40 used by encoder 32 ( FIG. 3 ).
- Decoder 60 can be provisioned with dictionary 64 when it is first published, and dictionary 64 can be periodically updated to synchronize with dictionary 40 .
- dictionary 40 can include a version header which can be inspected by decoder 60 to determine whether the dictionary 64 is the same version as the dictionary 40 used by encoder 32 . If dictionary 64 is not the same version, decoder 60 can request an update to its dictionary 64 such as from the publisher of decoder 60 or other online service provider. An example of the operation of decoder 60 is provided below in conjunction with FIG. 10 .
- the output of decoder 60 is a reconstructed signal REC 66 that is an approximation of the original input signal S.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram of a fragment list 42 generated by encoder 32 and transmitted by signal transmitting stage 44 as part of output signal Y.
- Fragment list includes a plurality of 1 . . . N fragments (such as 68 a and 68 b , and generically referred to herein as fragments 68 ).
- Each fragment 68 includes an index value field 70 (such as 70 a and 70 b and generically referred to herein as index value) and a projection value field 72 (such as 72 a and 72 b and generically referred to herein as projection value).
- the value contained in index value field 70 is an integer (i) pointing to the i th record in dictionary 40 and dictionary 64 .
- fragment list 42 An individual fragment is sometimes referred to herein as the k th fragment of fragment list 42 .
- the illustrated structure is just one of many ways in which the data of fragment list 42 can be structured. In some cases, additional fields can be included in each element.
- Fragment list 42 can be implemented using links and pointers in a computer memory or in a database, such as a relational database for example.
- dictionary 40 (as well as dictionary 64 ) comprises a plurality of records 50 having an index field 52 .
- value (i) in the index value field 70 of a given fragment 68 points to that one of records 50 of dictionary 40 for example having the same value (i) in its index field 52 .
- the value contained in projection value field 72 can be a real number P k such as between ⁇ 1 and +1.
- An exemplary technique for calculating the P k , the value of projection value field 72 is provided below in conjunction with FIG. 9 .
- the projection value is a transform value that can be used to derive amplitudes of the signal elements U i . These amplitude values in turn are used to derive the reconstructed signal REC.
- each fragment 68 can be a pair of values (index value and projection) and these pairs of values can be stored in a fragment list 42 that is generated by encoder 32 .
- the underlying dictionary value (e.g., in value field 54 ) of signal element U i can be included in the fragment 68 .
- FIG. 9 is a logic flow chart illustrating the iterative operation of encoder 32 in one illustrative embodiment.
- decoder stage 46 FIG. 3
- decoder stage 46 FIG. 3
- the operations that occur at block 74 are detailed below in conjunction with FIG. 10 .
- the fragment list may be empty. Therefore, block 74 can be skipped (and the initial reconstructed signal REC set to zero).
- residual calculator stage 36 FIG. 3
- FIG. 9 generates a residual signal R.
- residual signal R is compared to a threshold value.
- the squared sum of the pixel values of the residual signal R is compared to the threshold value, which for purposes of illustration can be a number equal to or greater than zero.
- the threshold value can be based on the desired level of fidelity to be achieved in the coding of input signal S. If it is determined at block 78 that the residual signal R (or value based on the residual signal R) is at or below the threshold value (that is, that a desired level of fidelity has been attained), then encoding process of FIG. 9 terminates at block 80 .
- Blocks 82 through 90 correspond to fragment calculator stage 38 of FIG. 3 .
- the new fragment will be stored in fragment list 42 . Accordingly, signal fragments may be generated sequentially until the fidelity of the reconstructed signal reaches a desired level.
- a search is made of dictionary 40 to find that one of the records 50 ( FIG. 6 ) having a desired value U i in its field 54 .
- the criteria for selecting the desired value of U i can vary, but in this case the criterion is that the value U i is selected that maximizes the absolute value of the scalar product of ⁇ R,U i > of residual signal R and the dictionary values U i for all dictionary entries not yet used in a fragment.
- residual signal R is based on the reconstruction signal REC obtained using the current fragment list of N fragments ⁇ i 0 , P 0 ⁇ . . . ⁇ i N , P N ⁇ .
- each fragment 68 contains an index value (i) stored in index value field 70 and a projection value (P N+1 ) stored in the projection value field 72 .
- the value of the index field 70 in fragment 68 points to that one of the records 50 of dictionary 40 containing the desired value of U i .
- the value P N+1 as computed at block 84 is stored in the projection value 72 of the new fragment ⁇ i N+1 , P N+1 ⁇ .
- the new fragment contains a pointer (i) to the desired record of dictionary 40 and a corresponding projection value P N+1 .
- the value of P N+1 can be quantized by mapping it to a finite set of integer values. This quantization if performed can be part of the encoding loop (as opposed to post processing) to provide better results.
- the repetition factor can be an integer such as between 1 and 7, which determines how many duplicate copies of the fragment ⁇ i N+1 , P N+1 ⁇ will be transmitted as part of output signal Y ( FIG. 3 ).
- the repetition factor can be determined as a function of the importance of the fragment to the overall reconstructed signal.
- the repetition factor for the k th fragment 68 in fragment list 42 can be a function of the absolute value of the scalar product of ⁇ R,U i,k >, which in physical terms can be an indication of the transform energy associated with the fragment.
- a higher absolute value of scalar product of ⁇ R,U i,k > can indicate that the k th fragment containing the value U i,k is relatively more important than other fragments 68 and accordingly should be duplicated more times.
- the additional redundancy factor minimizes the effect of packet loss. That is, if the k th fragment is important and is duplicated three times (for example), there is an increased likelihood that at least one of the three copies will reach receiving station 24 .
- Control then moves to block 90 , where the selected one of records 50 of dictionary 40 (that is, the record corresponding to the index (i) and desired value U 1 ) is marked so that it will not be selected again by the encoder for use in creating a fragment.
- each entry of dictionary 40 is used only once to generate a fragment 68 , although that fragment may be duplicated in the output signal depending on the repetition factor for that fragment.
- fragments representing ever decreasing transform energy can be added to the fragment list.
- the reconstructed signal REC has greater fidelity to the original input signal S. Fragments can be added until the resulting reconstructed signal REC is of sufficiently high quality (so that the residual signal R or a value based on residual signal R is at or below the threshold).
- FIG. 10 is a logic flow chart illustrating operation of the decoder stage 46 of FIG. 3 and decoder 60 of FIG. 7 in one illustrative embodiment. For convenience, the blocks of FIG. 10 are described with respect to decoder 60 .
- Decoder stage 46 operates in substantially the same manner as decoder 60 except that decoder stage 46 uses as its input the fragment list 42 and dictionary 40 and its output is reconstructed signal REC.
- Decoder 60 processes as input a list of N fragments in the form of fragment list 62 .
- fragment list 62 can be identical to the fragment list 42 that is included in output signal Y, except that duplicate copies of important fragments in fragment list 42 may be included in output signal Y (and thus included in input fragment list 62 ) for purposes of redundancy as a countermeasure to the possibility of data loss during transmission on forward link 26 ( FIG. 1 ). ). Accordingly, block 94 is included to remove duplicate fragments.
- fragment list 42 can be identical to fragment list 42 after encoding is complete. It should be noted that transmission of fragment list 42 (as included in output signal Y) can be performed on a frame-by-frame basis so that the entire video or audio stream need not be encoded before fragments are transmitted.
- Control next moves to a block 96 , where the amplitude A k for each k th fragment is determined based upon the value P k contained in the k th fragment's projection field 72 .
- One exemplary technique for computing amplitude A k is to solve the following linear system for the unknown coefficient A j
- Other techniques can be used to find the amplitude.
- One exemplary technique for computing REC is to compute the sum of the dictionary values U i,k weighted by the corresponding amplitudes in accordance with the following equation:
- a k is determined by solving the linear system described in Equation 3 above; and U i,k is the dictionary value at that one of dictionary records 50 to which the k th fragment's index (i) points.
- the amplitude A k associated with each fragment 68 is a measure of the amplitude of that fragment's normalized dictionary value U i,k .
- the projection P k is a transform of that amplitude value.
- encoder 32 and decoder 60 can be implemented as an application computer program or other software that can be executed a computing device such as processing unit 28 .
- the logic of encoder 32 and decoder 60 implemented in hardware such as in firmware or on an ASIC or other specialized chip, or in a combination of hardware and software.
- All or a portion of embodiments of the present invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from, for example, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium.
- a computer-usable or computer-readable medium can be any signal device that can, for example, tangibly contain, store, communicate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with any processor.
- the medium can be, for example, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, or a semiconductor device. Other suitable mediums are also available.
