Definitions
- This disclosure relates to the field of content sharing platforms and, in particular, to event-based comment grouping for content items.
- social networks allow users to connect to and share information with each other.
- Many social networks include a content sharing aspect that allows users to upload, view, and share content, such as video content, image content, audio content, and so on.
- Other users of the social network may comment on the shared content, discover new content, locate updates, share content, and otherwise interact with the provided content.
- the shared content may include content from professional content creators, e.g., movie clips, TV clips, and music videos, as well as content from amateur content creators, e.g., video blogging and short original videos.
- a method for event-based comment grouping for content items includes identifying comments corresponding to a content item, the comments comprising playback timestamp information transformed into selectable links to access a corresponding portion of the content item during playback of the content item, dividing the content item into a plurality of time interval segments, grouping the received comments into the time interval segments based on the playback timestamp information of each comment, selecting a time interval segment of the time interval segments, and providing comments corresponding to the selected time interval segment for display during playback of the content item.
- the method further includes the dividing the content item into a plurality of time interval segments being based on at least one of a length of the content item, a number of comments that fall within a time range of the content item, or a minimum time interval length.
- the minimum time interval length may be configured by an administrator of a content sharing platform hosting the content item.
- the playback timestamp information corresponds to a location in a timeline of the content item playback.
- the grouping of the received comments further includes placing each comment into the time interval segment comprising a time of the corresponding portion of the content item during playback of the content item.
- providing the comments may further include placing the comments corresponding to the selected time interval segment in association with a media player in a graphical user interface (GUI) of the content item.
- GUI graphical user interface
- the selecting the time interval segment is based on a popularity of the time interval segment according to interactions with the comments of the time interval segments.
- the popularity of a time interval segment is based on at least one of votes for the comments of the time interval segment, likes of the comments of the time interval segment, number of views of the comments of the time interval segment, number of comments within a time interval segment, or sharing of comments of the time interval segment.
- the method may further include selecting a promotion for display during the selected time interval segment that is most popular.
- computing devices for performing the operations of the above described implementations are also disclosed. Additionally, in implementations of the disclosure, a computer readable storage media stores methods for performing the operations of the above described implementations.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system architecture, in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a comment sharing component in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for event-based comment grouping for a content item, according to some implementations of the disclosure.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for promotion focusing based on event-based comment grouping, according to some implementations of the disclosure.
- FIG. 5 is an example screenshot illustrating a content item playback UI with event-based comment grouping of a content item, according to an implementation of the disclosure.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system, according to some implementations.
- a comment sharing component of a content sharing platform provides a feature to group and display comments corresponding to a content item based on playback time-stamp information included in the comments.
- the comment sharing component may divide a content item into discrete interval segments and group comments containing time stamp information into their respective interval segments. Comments grouped within a specified interval may be further sorted using existing approaches (e.g., chronologically, vote count, social network attribution, reputation of commenter, combination of the above, etc.).
- the comment sharing component may also determine which interval segment to select for displaying the corresponding comments upon content item playback.
- the comment clustering may also be utilized to inform promotion selection and display during the content item playback.
- Implementations of the disclosure have a different layer of granularity than previous solutions for event-based comment clustering for content items.
- content sharing platforms allowed for playback time stamp information to be included within a comment on a content item.
- the playback time stamp information references a discrete point in time in the playback of the content item corresponding to the comment.
- content sharing platforms did not use playback time stamp information that references a discrete point in time in the playback of the content item for the sorting, organization, and/or display of comments corresponding to a content item.
- Implementations of the disclosure improve the commenting systems for content item playback by grouping and displaying comments for a content item based on the time stamp information included with the comments. Grouping comments based on time stamps and displaying the grouped comments is useful because the users of the platform are informing the platform of the portions of the content item that they particularly like (or dislike) (i.e., by indicating the time stamp information in the comments).
- the event-based comment clustering for content items described herein may help promote the creation of high-quality comments by better displaying relevant and/or popular comments to the user.
- implementations of the disclosure may increase user engagement for a content sharing platform.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system architecture 100 , in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure, for navigation of a list of content sharing platform media items on a client device via gesture controls and contextual synchronization.

- the data store 106 may be a memory (e.g., random access memory), a cache, a drive (e.g., a hard drive), a flash drive, a database system, or another type of component or device capable of storing data.
- the data store 106 may also include multiple storage components (e.g., multiple drives or multiple databases) that may also span multiple computing devices (e.g., multiple server computers).
- the client devices 110 A through 110 Z may each include computing devices such as personal computers (PCs), laptops, mobile phones, smart phones, tablet computers, netbook computers etc. In some implementations, client device 110 A through 110 Z may also be referred to as “user devices.” Each client device includes a media viewer 111 .
- the media viewers 111 may be applications that allow users to view content, such as images, videos, web pages, documents, etc.
- the media viewer 111 may be a web browser that can access, retrieve, present, and/or navigate content (e.g., web pages such as Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) pages, digital media items, etc.) served by a web server.
- HTML Hyper Text Markup Language
- the media viewer 111 may render, display, and/or present the content (e.g., a web page, a media viewer) to a user.
- the media viewer 111 may also display an embedded media player (e.g., a Flash® player or an HTML5 player) that is embedded in a web page (e.g., a web page that may provide information about a product sold by an online merchant).
- an embedded media player e.g., a Flash® player or an HTML5 player
- a web page e.g., a web page that may provide information about a product sold by an online merchant.
- the media viewer 111 may be a standalone application that allows users to view digital media items (e.g., digital videos, digital images, electronic books, etc.).
- the media viewers 111 may be provided to the client devices 110 A through 110 Z by the server 130 and/or content sharing platform 120 .
- the media viewers 111 may be embedded media players that are embedded in web pages provided by the content sharing platform 120 .
- the media viewers 111 may be applications that are downloaded from the server 130 .
- functions described in one implementation as being performed by the content sharing platform 120 can also be performed on the client devices 110 A through 110 Z in other implementations if appropriate.
- functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together.
- the content sharing platform 120 can also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through appropriate application programming interfaces, and thus is not limited to use in websites.
- the content sharing platform 120 may be one or more computing devices (such as a rackmount server, a router computer, a server computer, a personal computer, a mainframe computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, etc.), data stores (e.g., hard disks, memories, databases), networks, software components, and/or hardware components that may be used to provide a user with access to media items and/or provide the media items to the user.
- the content sharing platform 120 may allow a user to consume, upload, search for, approve of (“like”), dislike, and/or otherwise comment on media items.
- the content sharing platform 120 may also include a website (e.g., a webpage) that may be used to provide a user with access to the media items.
- the content sharing platform 120 may include multiple channels (e.g., channels A through Z).
- a channel can be data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic or theme.
- the data content can be digital content chosen by a user, digital content made available by a user, digital content uploaded by a user, digital content chosen by a content provider, digital content chosen by a broadcaster, etc.
- a channel X can include videos Y and Z.
- a channel can be associated with an owner, who is a user that can perform actions on the channel. Different activities can be associated with the channel based on the owner's actions, such as the owner making digital content available on the channel, the owner selecting (e.g., liking) digital content associated with another channel, the owner commenting on digital content associated with another channel, etc.
- the activities associated with the channel can be collected into an activity feed for the channel.
- Users other than the owner of the channel, can subscribe to one or more channels in which they are interested. Once a user subscribes to a channel, the user can be presented with information from the channel's activity feed. If a user subscribes to multiple channels, the activity feed for each channel to which the user is subscribed can be combined into a syndicated activity feed. Information from the syndicated activity feed can be presented to the user.
- Each channel may include one or more media items 121 .
- a media item 121 can include, and are not limited to, digital video, digital movies, digital photos, digital music, website content, social media updates, electronic books (ebooks), electronic magazines, digital newspapers, digital audio books, electronic journals, web blogs, real simple syndication (RSS) feeds, electronic comic books, software applications, etc.
- media item 121 is also referred to as a media item.
- a media item 121 may be consumed via the Internet and/or via a mobile device application.
- an online video also hereinafter referred to as a video
- “media,” media item,” “online media item,” “digital media,” “digital media item,” “content,” and “content item” can include an electronic file that can be executed or loaded using software, firmware or hardware configured to present the digital media item to an entity.
- the content sharing platform 120 may store the media items 121 using the data store 106 .
- the server 130 may be one or more computing devices (e.g., a rackmount server, a server computer, etc.). In one implementation, the server 130 may be included in the content sharing platform 120 .
- the server 130 may include a comment sharing component 140 and a promotion focusing component 150 .
- the comment sharing component 140 enables grouping and displaying of comments based on playback time-stamp information included in the comments. As discussed above, the playback time stamp information references a discrete point in time in the playback of the content item corresponding to the comment.
- the promotion focusing component 150 may provide information selection and display of promotions during playback of the content item based on the grouping of comments by the comment sharing component 140 .
- the comment sharing component 140 may divide a content item into discrete interval segments and group comments containing time stamp information into their respective interval segments. Comments grouped within a specified interval may be further sorted using existing approaches (e.g., chronologically, vote count, social network attribution, reputation of commenter, combination of the above, etc.). The comment sharing component 140 may also determine which interval segment to select for displaying the corresponding comments upon content item playback.
- the comment grouping may also be utilized by the promotion focusing component 150 as in input in the selection of promotions to display during playback of the content item.
- a promotion may be selected for placement during a time interval segment including comments that are determined to be most popular (in comparison to comments from the other time interval segments) (e.g., based on user interactions with the comments, such as votes, selections, viewing, sharing, etc.).
- a promotion may refer to a form of communication used to offer or encourage an audience (e.g., users, viewers, readers or listeners; sometimes a specific group) to take or continue to take some action.
- comment sharing component 140 and promotion focusing component 150 of server 130 may interact with content sharing platform and/or with other third party social network servers 160 to provide implementations of the disclosure. Further description of the comment sharing component 140 , promotion focusing component 150 , and their specific functions is described in more detail below with respect to FIG. 2 .
- implementations of the disclosure are discussed in terms of content sharing platforms and promoting social network sharing of a content item on the content sharing platform, implementations may also be generally applied to any type of social network providing connections between users. Implementations of the disclosure are not limited to content sharing platforms that provide channel subscriptions to users.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether the content sharing platform 120 can collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the content sharing platform 120 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a comment sharing component 140 and a promotion focusing component 150 in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure.
- the comment sharing component 140 includes a segment determination module 210 , a time stamp sorting module 220 , and a comment sharing UI generation module 230 .
- the promotion focusing component 150 may include a promotion placement module 240 . More or less components may be included in the comment sharing component 140 and/or the promotion focusing component 150 without loss of generality. For example, two of the modules may be combined into a single module, or one of the modules may be divided into two or more modules. In one implementation, one or more of the modules may reside on different computing devices (e.g., different server computers).
- the comment sharing component 140 and the promotion focusing component 150 are communicatively coupled to the data store 106 .
- the comment sharing component 140 and/or the promotion focusing component 150 may be coupled to the data store 106 via a network (e.g., via network 105 as illustrated in FIG. 1 ).
- the comment sharing component 140 and/or the promotion focusing component 150 may be coupled directly to a server where the comment sharing component 140 and/or the promotion focusing component 150 resides (e.g., may be directly coupled to server 130 ).
- the data store 106 may be a memory (e.g., random access memory), a cache, a drive (e.g., a hard drive), a flash drive, a database system, or another type of component or device capable of storing data.
- the data store 106 may also include multiple storage components (e.g., multiple drives or multiple databases) that may also span multiple computing devices (e.g., multiple server computers).
- the data store 106 includes content item data 290 , user data 291 , and comment data 292 .
- a time stamp may refer to a parameter that indicates a discrete or distinct location within a playback timeline of a content item (e.g., 23:02, 13m4s, etc.) and/or to a time range within the content item (e.g., “12 minutes 30 seconds to 13 minutes 5 seconds”).
- an option to comment on the content item is provided by the content sharing platform.
- the comment sharing UI generation module 230 may provide the option to comment.
- already-existing commenting functionality of the content item GUI may be utilized to receive comments on the content item from the commenting user. The commenting user may select a commenting icon or other commenting indicator to input his or her comment regarding the content item.
- the content sharing platform may transform the text indicating the discrete point in time into a selectable link (e.g., a reference in an electronic document that lets a user display or activate another document or program) that is displayed as part of the comment.
- a selectable link e.g., a reference in an electronic document that lets a user display or activate another document or program
- Data indicating user feedback for the comment, the timestamp, and the selectable link associated with the timestamp may be stored as comment data 293 in data store 106 .
- the content item is played starting at the distinct location corresponding to the selectable link.
- the other text of the comment is typically referring to the subject matter occurring at the indicated location of the time stamp.
- the segment determination module 210 divides a content item into discrete time interval segments. For example, a content item may be divided into segments A, B, C, and D and all comments that contain time stamp information are first grouped into their respective interval segments A, B, C, and D. In one implementation, the length of the intervals can be fixed. When there are not that many comments with time stamps, a content item may be divided into fixed two minute intervals (as an example).
- the length of the intervals can also be computed dynamically using the following information as parameters: the length of the content item, the number of comments which fall within a time range, and the minimum interval length, for example. Other parameters may also be used to determine interval length selection.
- Data associated with the segmenting of a content item for comment grouping purposes may be stored in content item data 290 and/or comment data 293 of data store 106 .
- a goal of choosing an appropriate time interval length is to allow a viewer of the content item to read the comments that fall within the same time interval (e.g., grouping the comments such that comments about a specific scene are displayed). If the content item is very short (e.g., under 1 minute), the content item may not be divided into segments. In this case, all of the time-stamped comments are in the one and only interval.
- the minimum interval length may be a configurable parameter. All segments can be configured with a same minimum length. In some implementations, the minimum length is derived through experimentation. If it is determined that grouping the comments using a two-minute minimum interval results in more selection and viewing of the comments and more responses to the comments than using a four minute minimum interval, then the two-minute minimum should be used.
- the time stamp sorting module 220 may then group comments containing time stamp information into their respective interval segments. That is, if the content item is divided into segments, A, B, C, D where A is 0:00-2:00, B is 2:01-5:00, C is 5:01-8:00, and D is 8:01-13:00, those comments having timestamps falling from 0:00-2:00 are grouped into segment A, and so on.
- the comments within a specified interval segment may further be sorted and grouped using other existing approaches. For example, comments within a time interval segment may be sorted based on chronological or reverse chronological order, “up” vs “down” vote count, social media friend or circle information, reputation of the commenter, and any combination of above, for example.
- Data associated with the grouping of a content item for comment grouping purposes may be stored in comment data 293 of data store 106 , for example.
- the comment sharing UI generation module 230 may select which interval segment to display the corresponding comments upon content item playback. Comments may be shown to a user one interval at a time. There are many ways of showing the grouped comments. The grouped comments do not have to be shown in chronological order. In addition, grouped comments in a particular segment may or may not be shown while the content item is playing that particular segment.
- a comment segment to display during playback of a content item may be based on popularity of comments within the segments.
- the viewing user may be provided an option to respond to, indicate favorability (e.g., like, +1, etc.), and/or share the comment.
- These options may be shown as hyperlinks or other selection icons as part of the displayed comment UI. “Popularity” may be based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, votes, likes, number of views (selections), number of comments within a segment, and so on.
- a segment having the most voted-for may be selected for display during playback of the content item.
- segment D corresponds to the most popular comments
- comments from segment D may be shown even while the content item is currently playing segments A, B, or C.
- implementations may engage the viewing user by showing relevant comments so that the user may select ahead on the timestamp link and watch that segment if he or she chooses.
- implementations of the disclosure may vary the cluster segment that is selected for viewing without regard to popularity of the comment in that segment.
- Always showing the comments from the most popular comment group may not be beneficial in every case, as the popular comments get more popular while other comments may get “lost”.
- popular comment segments may be shown more often to some users, while other users may see comment segments that are not as popular so that it can be determined if comments in those segments can become popular as well.
- the comment clustering may also be utilized by promotion focusing component 150 for promotion selection and display during the content item playback.
- the comment grouping segments and popularity statistics of comments within a segment may be used as a parameter for promotion focusing within a content item.
- a promotion may be displayed during playback of a content item.
- the promotion placement module 240 may utilize the information about the popularity of each time interval segment to select a segment to display a promotion during playback of the content item.
- event-based comment clustering for a content item as described above is performed in the context of content item streaming to a mobile device that is executing a content sharing platform application specifically designed for playback of the content item.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 300 for event-based comment clustering according to some implementations of the disclosure.
- the method 300 may be performed by processing logic that comprises hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device to perform hardware simulation), or a combination thereof.
- hardware e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.
- software e.g., instructions run on a processing device to perform hardware simulation
- method 300 may be performed by comment sharing component 140 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- method 300 begins at block 310 when comments corresponding to a comment item are received.
- the comments include timestamp information that is transformed into selectable links to access the indicated time of the selectable link during playback of the content item.
- the content item is divided into discrete time interval segments. The time interval segments may be determined based on one or more of the length of the content item, the number of comments with fall within a time range, or the minimum interval length. The minimum time interval length may be configured by an administrator of a content sharing platform hosting the content item.
- the received comments are grouped into the time interval segments based on the timestamp information of each comment. For example, all comments with timestamp information occurring during a particular time interval segment are grouped into that time interval segment.
- a popularity of each time interval segment is determined based on the user interactions with comments of each time interval segment. In one implementation, popularity of a time interval segment is based on at least one of votes, likes, number of views (selections), number of comments within a segment, sharing of comments, and so on.
- the time interval segment that is determined to be most popular is selected for display. In other implementations, a random time interval segment may be selected without consideration of popularity. Lastly, at block 360 , comments of the selected time interval segment are displayed during playback of the content item.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating another method 400 for promotion focusing based on event-based comment clustering, according to an implementation of the disclosure.
- the method 400 may be performed by processing logic that comprises hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device to perform hardware simulation), or a combination thereof.
- method 400 may be performed by comment sharing component 140 , as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- method 400 begins at block 410 when a content item is identified for promotion selection and placement. Then, at block 420 , a grouping of comments (of the content item) into time interval segments is referenced. In one implementation, the grouping is performed according to method 300 of FIG. 3 described above.
- a most popular time interval segment of the content item is determined.
- the most popular time interval segment is based on user interactions with the comments of the time interval segments. For example, popularity of a time interval segment may be based on at least one of votes for a comment, likes for a comment, number of views (selections), number of comments within a segment, sharing of comments, and so on.
- a determined most popular time interval segment is selected for placement of a promotion during subsequent playback of the content item.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example screenshot of a content item playback UI 500 with event-based comment grouping of a content item, according to an implementation of the disclosure.
- the content item playback UI 500 may be provided to a user viewing a content item via a media player 510 at a client device.
- the content item playback UI 500 includes the media player 510 playing back the content item and a content item information section 520 .
- the media player 510 may include a playback control bar 515 providing a timeline of the content item indicating where a user is during playback of the content item and controls to control playback of the content item (e.g., stop, pause, volume, etc.).
- Content item information section 520 may detail identifying information of a currently-accessed content item shown in media player 510 .
- the content item information section 520 may include, but is not limited to, information such as a title of the content item, content owner of the content item, posting date of the content item, duration of the content item, number of views of the content item, number of “likes” (e.g., thumbs up) of the content item, number of “dislikes” (e.g., thumbs down) of the content item, and so on.
- the comment item playback UI 500 includes a comment section 530 .
- the comment section 530 may be part of the media player 510 . As shown in FIG. 5 , the comment section 530 is located below the content item information section 520 .
- the comments section 530 displays comments corresponding to a time interval segment grouping of the content item. For example, assume the content item shown in FIG. 5 is divided into three time interval segments: segment A from 0:00 to 2:00, segment B from 2:01 to 4:00, and segment C from 4:01 to 5:15. Using implementations described above, comments associated with the content item and including timestamp information may be grouped into the discrete time interval segments. The comments in one of the discrete time interval segments are selected for display in the comments section 530 during playback of the content item.
- the comments section 530 includes two comments, 532 , 534 including timestamp information (e.g., selectable links) 533 , 535 .
- the timestamp information 533 , 535 may include selectable links pointing to a particular time occurring in the playback of the content item. If a user selects the time stamp information 533 , 535 within a comment 532 , 534 , the playback of the content item jumps to that corresponding time in the playback of the content item.
- Both comments 532 , 534 include timestamp information 533 , 535 occurring during time interval segment B. This indicates that time interval segment B was selected for comment display during playback of the content item. As discussed above, this selection of time interval segment B may be based on popularity of the comments (as based on user interactions with the comments) within time interval segment B (as compared to the other comments in the other time interval segments of the content item). Other locations and configurations of the comments section 530 other than those described with respect to content item playback UI 500 may also be utilized in implementations of the disclosure.
