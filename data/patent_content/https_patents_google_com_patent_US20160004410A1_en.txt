Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to electronic messaging and user interfaces.
- the present disclosure relates to processing cursor movements for predictive fetching.
- a system for processing cursor movements for predictive fetching includes a notification server, a notification client module, and a movement processing and predictive fetching module.
- the notification server is coupled to other systems to receive notification information.
- the notification client module is coupled to retrieve notification information from the notification server.
- the movement processing and predictive fetching module is configured to capture and detect cursor movements on a client device.
- the movement processing and predictive fetching module determines the direction and deceleration of the cursor. If the movement is decelerating and in the direction of the notification button on the user interface, the movement processing and predictive fetching module generates a signal for the notification client module to pre-fetch notification information from the notification server.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include detecting movement of a cursor; determining whether movement of the cursor is towards a notification button; and requesting notification information from a notification server if the movement of the cursor is towards the notification button.
- implementations of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- the features include: determining a direction of cursor movement and whether movement in the direction is closer to the notification button; determining whether the cursor is with a predetermined distance of the cursor; the notification information includes a list of notifications; and the notification information includes pre-fetched notification detail information.
- the operations further include: determining whether a user has an unread notification, and requesting notification information from the notification server is performed if the user has at least one unread notification; determining an acceleration of the cursor movement, and requesting notification information from the notification server is performed if the cursor movement is decelerating; determining an amount of time since a notification item list was retrieved, determining whether the amount of time since the notification item list was retrieved is greater than a predetermined amount of time, and requesting notification information from the notification server is performed if the amount of time since the notification item list was retrieved is greater than a predetermined amount of time; and determining whether notification button has been selected, if the notification button has been selected, updating a user interface with the notification information, and providing the updated user interface including the notification information for display.
- the present disclosure is particularly advantageous because it pre-fetches notification information so that once the user selects the notification button the information can be displayed to the user instantaneously without perceived latency that the notification information needs to be fetched.
- the present disclosure also includes novel methods for determining how and when to pre-fetch the notification data.

- the request processing module 214 serves as a controller to process requests including sending notification information, formatting information, or state information back to the client devices 115 .
- the request processing module 214 is coupled to receive data formatting instructions from the data formatting module 216 and to retrieve user state and status information from the user state and status module 218 .
- the request processing module 214 uses both information from the data formatting module 216 and data from the user state and status module 218 to generate the novel user interfaces of the present disclosure as will be described below with reference to FIGS. 3-12B .
- the request processing module 214 is also coupled for communication with the activity streams backend 154 .
- the request processing module 214 retrieves information about notifications, notification lists and notification detail from the activity streams backend 154 .
- the request processing module 214 also passes on commands to the activity streams backend 154 for transmission to and execution by the notification sources 160 . In some implementations, some commands do not pass through the activity streams backend 154 , but instead go directly from the client devices 115 to the notification sources 160 .
- the data formatting module 216 can be software and routines for determining the proper format for notification information (the number of notifications, the notification list and the notification detail).
- the data formatting module 216 is coupled to receive requests from the request processing module 214 and state information from the user state and status module 218 .
- the data formatting module 216 prepares the data and specifies the format for presentation of the data. For example, the data formatting module 216 may reorder the notifications for presentation to the user based on various factors, for example, time, relevance, freshness, communication type, interest level to the user, popularity, etc. Particular examples will be described below with reference to FIGS. 8A and 8B , for example, the data formatting module 216 re-ordering the names of other users that are part of a notification.
- the data formatting module 216 only presents a predetermined number of notifications, for example, the top nine notifications ranked by a combination of relevance and time.
- the data formatting module 216 coalesces or groups multiple notifications into a single notification when they relate to the same topic, photo or have some other common characteristic. For example, a photo may be posted and there may be 13 other actions associated with that photo including tagging, posting, sharing etc.
- the data formatting module 216 determines a type of the notification, then determines the entity that the notification refers to (in this case the photo ID). Then the data formatting module 216 retrieves the activities related to that photo. The activities are sorted from most recent to the original.
- This notification item is then formatted for presentation to the user.
- the formatting includes putting in bold the names of any users that have performed an activity that has been unread or un-reviewed by the user. An example of this process is shown below with reference to FIGS. 8A and 8B .
- the user state and status module 218 can be used to keep records as to the user state and status of each user.
- the user state and status module 218 can be a storage device capable of storing numerous records.
- the user state and status module 218 keeps a record of which notifications have been reviewed by the user, which notifications have not been reviewed by the user and how many un-reviewed or unread notifications that the user has.
- the user state and status module 218 records the state of the web browser 150 being used by the user 120 , for example, selection of the notification button, the notifications that are being presented to the user in the list, or the selection of more detail for any particular notification.
- the request processing module 214 provides notification information in stages, for example, first only the number of notifications, then the list of notifications, and finally the details about individual notifications. This advantageously minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the notification server 103 to the client devices 115 . Depending on the state of the user, this information will be pre-fetched from the activity streams backend 154 and sent to the user's web browser 150 in these three steps thereby minimizing perceived user latency.
- the activity streams backend 154 includes an e-mail notification collector 202 , a calendar notification collector 204 , a social network notification collector 206 , an other source notification collector 208 , a notification database 210 and a real-time/push notification module 212 .
- These components 202 , 204 , 206 , 208 , 210 , and 212 are coupled to the bus 220 for communication with each other and other components of the notification server 103 .
- the bus 220 can be any type of conventional communication bus.
- the e-mail notification collector 202 can be software and routines for interacting with e-mail systems coupled to the activity streams backend 154 via the network 105 .
- the e-mail notification collector 202 interacts with the e-mail server 123 to retrieve e-mail information, for example, messages that have been received and sent, the status of messages as to whether they read, unread, forward, replied to, etc.
- the e-mail server 123 can be an e-mail service.
- the e-mail notification collector 202 in some implementations interacts with a credentials module (not shown) to retrieve the user's login name and password as well as any other information necessary to access the e-mail server 123 .
- the e-mail notification collector 202 also stores information that has been retrieved in the notification database 210 .
- the e-mail notification collector 202 is coupled for communication with other e-mail servers 123 and the storage 239 . It should be understood that even though the e-mail notification collector 202 has been described above as connecting and extracting information from a single e-mail system, the e-mail notification collector 202 may perform the same operation for a plurality of e-mail systems that are utilized by a particular user. For example, users often have several different e-mail accounts. In some implementations, the e-mail notification collector 202 connects and collects information from two or more of these several different e-mail accounts.
- the e-mail notification collector 202 also interacts with the e-mail server 123 to take action with regard to e-mails that have been received for the user. For example, if a user is notified of an unread e-mail, and then reviews the e-mail using the user interface that will be described below with reference to FIGS. 4-8B ; the user may respond, forward or take some other action with regard to the e-mail in the user interface. This action is transmitted from the web browser 150 to the notification response server 152 then to the e-mail notification collector 202 to deliver to the e-mail server 123 .
- the calendar notification collector 204 can be software and routines for interacting with the profile server 127 coupled to the activity streams backend 154 via the network 105 .
- the calendar notification collector 204 interacts with the profile server 127 to retrieve profile information, for example, calendar events.
- the profile server 127 can be a free time management web applications, for example, a calendar application.
- the calendar notification collector 204 also stores received calendar notification information in the notification database 210 .
- the calendar notification collector 204 also sends commands and instructions to the profile server 127 to change calendar events, add calendar events, modify parties associated with events, delete events, etc.
- the social network notification collector 206 can be a module for interacting with one or more social network servers 101 or systems. In some implementations, the social network notification collector 206 is coupled by network 105 for communication and interaction with the social network server 101 , social network software/application 109 and social graph 125 .
- the social network notification collector 206 can be similar to the e-mail notification collector module 202 except that it collects notification information related to a user's interaction and use of a social network.
- the social network notification collector 206 interacts with a credentials module to retrieve the user's login and password as well as other information necessary to access the social network software/application 109 and social graph 125 .
- the social network notification collector 206 retrieves and collects notification information about messages sent, messages received, information posted, posted information reviewed, change in status of friends, the addition of connections, removal of connections, and any other activity that can be undertaken by the user on the social network.
- the social network notification collector 206 also collects information from other individuals that are important or linked to the user.
- the application interface (API) of the social network is used by the social network notification collector 206 and extracts information.
- the social network notification collector 206 can retrieve any information related to the user from the social network.
- the social network notification collector 206 stores the information it collects in the notification database 210 .
- the social network notification collector 206 is coupled by the bus 220 to the storage 239 .
- Example notifications include friend requests, a post to a source being processed, or any other activity on the social network of importance to the user.
- the social network notification collector 206 also interacts with the social network to respond to any notifications, for example, accepting the friend request, replying to a post or any other action on the social network that is possible in response to the notification.
- the other source notification collector 208 can be software and routines for interacting with and extracting information from any other electronic messaging system or any other notification source 160 .
- the other source notification collector 208 has the credentials and the application interface for interacting with the other notification sources 160 .
- the other source notification collector 208 processes the other notification sources 160 for activities of which the user wants to be notified and also can take any action with regard to the activities that is allowed by the other sources.
- the other source notification collector 208 collects information related to the user's interaction with those other systems.
- the other source notification collector 208 stores the information collected in the notification database 210 .
- Example other sources include the third party server 107 , the micro-blogging server 121 , the SMS/MMS server 129 , the IM server 131 , the search server 135 and the web server 137 .
- the notification database 210 can be data storage for storing information received from any of the notification sources 160 .
- the notification database 210 can be a database organized by user. For each user, the notification database 210 stores any activity information received from any of the notification sources 160 . For example, this can include e-mails details (e.g., header, sender, date, subject, etc.), social network activity, for example, posts, shares, invitations, status changes, etc.
- the notification database 210 is coupled for communication with the notification collectors 202 , 204 , 206 and 208 .
- the notification database 210 is also coupled to the notification response server 152 to provide notification information responsive to queries by the request processing module 214 .
- the real-time/push notification module 212 can be software and routines for responding to notification sources 160 that push notification data to the activity streams backend 154 .
- the notification collectors 202 , 204 , 206 and 208 retrieve the notification information from the notification sources 160 by polling, or on a periodic basis as has been described above.
- the notification sources 160 push the data in real time to the activity streams backend 154 .
- the real-time/push notification module 212 is coupled for communication with those notification sources 160 that push data in real time.
- the real-time/push notification module 212 has a persistent connection or browser channel with the notification sources 160 that are pushing data.
- the real-time/push notification module 212 receives the pushed information, stores the pushed information in the notification database 210 and also sends a signal to the notification response server 152 to update the user interface and web browser 150 of the user corresponding to pushed information, in other words process the pushed activity information by generating and sending a new notification to the client devices 115 .
- notification information pushed in real time is a request for a video chat from the video chat server 144 .
- Another example of notification information pushed in real time is an invitation to hang out at a location in the social network.
- One or more of the e-mail notification collector 202 , the calendar notification collector 204 , the social network notification collector 206 , the other source notification collector 208 , the real-time/push notification module 212 , the request processing module 214 , the data formatting module 216 , and the user state and status module 218 are executable on the processor 235 .
- the e-mail notification collector 202 , the calendar notification collector 204 , the social network notification collector 206 , the other source notification collector 208 , the real-time/push notification module 212 , the request processing module 214 , the data formatting module 216 , and the user state and status module 218 store data that, when executed by the processor 235 , causes the collectors/modules to perform the operations described below.
- one or more of the e-mail notification collector 202 , the calendar notification collector 204 , the social network notification collector 206 , the other source notification collector 208 , the real-time/push notification module 212 , the request processing module 214 , the data formatting module 216 , and the user state and status module 218 are instructions executable by the processor 235 to provide the functionality described below with reference to FIGS. 4-17 .
- one or more of the e-mail notification collector 202 , the calendar notification collector 204 , the social network notification collector 206 , the other source notification collector 208 , the real-time/push notification module 212 , the request processing module 214 , the data formatting module 216 , and the user state and status module 218 are stored in the memory 237 of the notification server 103 and are accessible and executable by the processor 235 .
- the notification server 103 includes the e-mail/text interface 156 and the phone operating system interface 158 . It should be understood that these interfaces 156 , 158 are optional and shown with dashed lines in FIGS. 1B and 2 .
- the e-mail/text interface 156 allows the notification server 103 to be coupled and interact directly with e-mail servers 123 and SMS/MMS servers 129 owned and operated by other parties.
- the e-mail/text interface 156 allows these systems direct communication with the real-time/push notification module 212 .
- the phone operating system interface 158 allows mobile handsets operating a phone operating system, for example, Android to interact with the notification server 103 .
- These interfaces 156 , 158 allow more direct interaction between the notification server 103 and these other systems. This is advantageous to reduce latency and increase functionality.
- the method can include presenting 302 a user interface with a notification button 406 as will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the method includes retrieving 304 the number of notifications that are unread for this user. For example, the request processing module 214 retrieves this information from the notification database 210 .
- the method can continues by updating 306 the user interface with the number of notifications. For example, the request processing module 214 sends the number of notifications to the client device 115 a and the client device 115 a updates the user interface. An example of this is shown with the differences between FIGS. 4 and 5A as will be described below in more detail.
- the method can include determining 308 whether the user has selected the notification button 406 .
- the user 120 a inputs a selection of the notification button at the web browser 150 of the client device 115 a .
- the method determines whether there is an indication of user interest in the notification button. This indication of user interest in the notification button may be selection of the notification button, movement of a cursor over the notification button or movement of the cursor proximate the notification button.
- the client device 115 a sends this selection to the notification server 103 , in particular the request processing module 214 of the notification response server 152 . If not, the method can wait a predetermined amount of time and loops back to step 302 .
- the method can proceed to retrieve 310 a list of notifications. Again, in some implementations the request processing module 214 retrieves this information from the notification database 210 .
- the method can include displaying 312 a new user interface showing the list of notifications. An example of an interface 600 is shown in FIG. 6A and will be described in more detail below.
- the method can determine 314 whether the user requested more detail about a notification. If not, the user and notification states are updated 316 after which the method returns to step 302 . In some implementations, if the user has viewed a list of notifications, those notifications are changed in status from unread to read. The state as to the time at which the user reviewed notifications can also be recorded.
- the method can continue in step 318 by retrieving and displaying a new user interface with detailed information about the notification selected from the list.
- An example of an interface 700 is shown in FIG. 7A and will be described in more detail below.
- the method can include determining 320 whether the user is taking an action or responding to the notification.
- the user interface 700 of the present disclosure advantageously provides a way in which to seamlessly reply to notifications without having to open additional windows, tabs or applications, etc.
- the user interface 700 allows the user to input actions responsive to the notification, and in some implementations, includes only those actions or responses that are appropriate and most likely to be taken by the user for the given type of notification.
- the method can perform 322 that response or action after which the method continues in step 316 to update the user and notification states.
- the action can be sent from the client devices 115 to the notification server 103 and then to the notification sources 160 .
- the method can determine 324 whether the user has requested more information about another notification. If so, the method returns to step 318 , retrieves details about another notification and updates the user interface. If the user has not requested more information, the method returns to step 316 to update the user and notification states.
- the method of the present disclosure is particularly advantageous because it minimizes the amount of information that the notification server 103 must provide to the client devices 115 .
- the user interface 400 includes a browser window 402 having a number of components including a top label, a menu bar 404 , a notification button 406 , a tool bar/location bar 408 , one or more tabs 410 and a display area 412 .
- the menu bar 404 provides menus to access browser functionality.
- the tool bar/location bar 408 provides tools, for example, buttons for moving to a prior webpage, a next webpage, refreshing a webpage, etc.
- the present disclosure advantageously provides a new notification button 406 to provide feedback to the user as to any notifications specific to the user that are available on the notification server 103 .
- the notification button 406 is advantageously positioned near the top of the browser window 402 proximate the menu bar 404 .
- the notification button 406 is a square button; however, it should be understood that it could also be any other shape or symbol.
- the notification button 406 could also be of a different color, have shading, or be highlighted in various other ways to be presented in a visually distinct manner from the top label, menu bar 404 , and tool bar/location bar 408 or other components of the browser window 402 .
- the notification button 406 is of a first color (e.g., gray) when there are no unread notifications and the user interface is updated to a second color (e.g., red) when there are unread notifications.
- the same effect could be achieved by transitioning between shapes and symbols.
- the implementation shown in FIG. 4 is only one example for the user interface.
- the notification button 406 as well as the other components of the browser window 402 may be organized in different arrangements with different shades and different visual formatting.
- the user interface 500 includes an updated notification button 406 that includes a visual indication 502 as to the number of unread notifications that are available for this user.
- the visual indication 502 is a number that is positioned within the notification button 406 .
- the notification button 406 could animate in any of number of ways in order to draw the user's eye to the new information.
- This animation could be in place, or if the user has scrolled past the notification badge, the badge could peek from above the scrollable area into the scrollable area for a brief period of time.
- the notification button 406 may be shown in a different color as discussed above or a portion of the notification button 406 may be shaded or shown in a visually distinct manner to indicate a percentage of additional notifications that are unread, where the percentage of the notifications button with a different color or format indicates the percentage of notifications that are unread.
- the notification system 100 is particularly advantageous because it provides a uniform interface independent of the type of messaging that the user is undertaking For example, regardless of whether the user is interacting with any e-mail program, calendar program, a social network, a document program or Internet search program, the browser window 402 and the relative position of the notification button 406 remain the same. This is more clearly shown by a comparison of the position of the notification button 406 in FIGS. 5B-5G .
- FIG. 5B shows an implementation of the notifications user interface 550 on a web browser.
- FIG. 5C shows an implementation of the notifications user interface 552 on a web browser with the notifications filtered.
- FIG. 5D shows a first implementation of the notifications user interface 554 on an example social network feed.
- FIG. 5E shows an implementation of the notifications user interface 556 on a game window.
- FIG. 5F shows an implementation of the notifications user interface 558 on a photo window.
- FIG. 5G shows a second implementation of the notifications user interface 560 as part of a social network interface.
- the notification button 406 is included on a header bar that is present across multiple systems and has been described above with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the user interface transitions from that of FIG. 4 or 5 A to that of FIG. 6A .
- the user interface 600 displays a notification item list 602 that shows recent notifications of different types (e.g., users that have added you to their social graph, posts where people mention you, etc.).
- notifications are coalesced together by type, and/or by the post that they hang off of, and users can respond to these notifications without having to navigate away from the notification item list 602 (e.g., user can add people to their social graph and respond to posts in this box without having to navigate to the social network's homepage).
- the user interface 600 includes the browser window 402 having similar components as described above with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5A . Additionally, the user interface 600 presents a notification item list 602 with a plurality of menu/notification items 604 . Each menu/notification item 604 includes an identifier or profile 606 of the user, abstracted users and content information 608 , an icon 610 indicating notification types and a link 612 to transition to another interface that shows the full detail of the notification item 604 . In some implementations, this user interface 600 is created by code that creates an i-frame within the browser window 402 , and the data for the menu is fetched from the notification server 103 .
- notification server 103 filters the notifications and presents the notifications that are of greatest interest to the user.
- only the top nine menu/notification items 604 are shown in the notification item list 602 . This number can vary between two and n and in some cases may even be customizable by the user to any number desired by setting the user preference.
- the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in the notification item list 602 according to relevance to the user.
- the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in the notification item list 602 according to chronological order.
- the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in the notification item list 602 based on priority of whether a specific response by the user is required.
- the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in the notification item list 602 based on implied importance to the user based on their social graph. Finally, in some implementations, the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in the notification item list 602 according to a combination of the above factors.
- the notification server 103 also coalesces or groups individual notifications to minimize the number of items 604 that are in the notification item list 602 .
- the notifications are grouped according to type so that e-mail notifications are grouped together as one notification item 604 , calendar notifications are grouped together as one notification item 604 , social network notifications are grouped together as one notification item 604 , etc.
- the notifications can also be grouped by type, subtype and topic. For example, there might be three notification items 604 in the notification item list 602 for social networking: one notification item 604 for posts on the social network, one notification item 604 for friend requests on the social network, and one notification item for sharing of photos on the social network.
- the type is social networking
- the subtype is posts, friend requests, or photo sharing
- these pairings of type and subtype can be further grouped or coalesced by topic.
- the menu/notification items 604 are displayed in visually distinct manners based upon whether they are read or unread.
- the identifier or profile 606 of the user is information that the user can quickly view to ascertain the user that generated the notification.
- the identifier or profile 606 is a photo of the user.
- the identifier or profile 606 can be the name or system login of the user.
- the abstracted users and content information 608 can be abstracted information about users that are related to the notification and the content of the notification. In some implementations, this includes different usernames and some sample text. For example, the abstracted users and content information 608 could be the last three people that responded to the post and the topic of the post. Even more specifically, for the first menu/notification item 604 a , the users that have commented on the post are Charlie, Bob and Alice and the sample text is an abstract of the topic of the post. In some implementations, this abstracted users and content information 608 can be stored in the notification database 210 so that it can easily be fetched by the notification response server 152 for inclusion in the notification item list 602 .
- the icon 610 can be some symbol or text identifying the notification type.
- each of the notification sources 160 has a visually distinct symbol. This symbol is used for the icon 610 .
- the number of icons 610 is less than 10 and therefore some of the notification sources 160 share the same icon even though being a different type of notification.
- the link 612 can be provided to allow the user to transition to another interface (see e.g. FIG. 7A ) that shows the full detail of the notification item 604 .
- the link is shown as a greater than symbol, however, various other types of visual indications, for example, underlining the abstracted users and content information 608 could be used.
- the user interface shown in FIG. 6A can be also integrated with the web browser 150 so that it is interoperable for easy navigation using the direction keys. More specifically, if the user selects the up or down direction keys the notification item 604 selected in the notification item list 602 moves upward or downward, respectively. Similarly, the left and right direction keys are used to transition between the user interface of FIG. 6A and the user interface of FIG. 7A in terms of getting less or more detail about a notification. For example, if the notification item list 602 is shown and the user selects the right direction key, the user interface 600 transitions from FIG. 6A to the user interface 700 of FIG. 7A . Similarly, if the user interface 700 of FIG.
- the left and right direction keys are also used to transition between different notifications in the detailed notification view of FIG. 7A-7I .
- notification item lists 602 in a list view user interface 650 is shown.
- FIG. 6C another implementation of the list view user interface 652 over a social network interface is shown.
- FIG. 6D another implementation of the list view user interface 654 over an e-mail client is shown.
- FIG. 6E another implementation of the list view user interface 656 over a landing a page of a search engine is shown.
- FIG. 6F another implementation of the list view user interface 658 over a web page showing search results is shown.
- FIG. 7A some implementations of a user interface 700 for presenting detailed notification information according to the present disclosure is shown.
- the notification button 406 can be included on a header bar that is present across multiple systems and has been described above with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the user interface 700 of FIG. 7A is presented after a transition from user interface 600 of FIG. 6A .
- the user interface 700 replaces the notification item list 602 with a detailed notifications and action window 702 .
- the detailed notifications and action window 702 will present: 1) more detailed information specific to the type of notification; 2) users related to the notification; and 3) links or buttons to actions that can be taken in response to the notification.
- the window 702 will include the information that was posted, who posted it, other users that viewed it and a button posting a reply.
- the notification is about a photo
- the full photo will be displayed in the window 702 .
- More detailed information specific to the type of notification may be customized to be based upon the additional detail that is retrievable from the notification sources 160 .
- types of notifications includes: posts in a social network, photo sharing and social network, friending in a social network, other actions in a social network, e-mail notifications, instant message notifications, text messaging notifications, SMS notifications, calendar notifications, etc. As has been noted above, depending on the type of notification, different actions may be performed.
- the detailed notifications and action window 702 includes links, buttons or fields to input information and instructions to perform responses or actions.
- the detailed notifications and action window 702 includes any number of additional links to other users related to the notification, links to users that matter to the user, a link to comments since the user's last post, a link to retrieve similar notifications based on topic or type, a link to posts related to the notification, a link to similar material, etc.
- FIGS. 7B-7I additional implementations of the user interface 750 - 770 for presenting detailed information about notifications and interactions with other different types of notification sources 160 are shown.
- the notification system 100 is particularly advantageous because it allows the user to take actions with regard to any of the notification sources 160 without having to open additional windows or tabs or transition to other applications.
- the user can take action with regard to any type of messaging. For example, regardless of whether the user is interacting with any e-mail program, calendar program, a social network, a document program or Internet search program, the user can take action with regard to notifications from those systems using the standard interface shown in FIGS. 7B-7I .
- FIGS. 7B-7D show additional implementations of user interfaces 750 - 758 for presenting detailed information. It should be noted that each user interfaces 750 - 758 has a different format depending on the type of notification and a different set of actions that can be taken directly from the detailed view.
- FIG. 7E shows an implementation of a user interface 760 that shows the detailed views when the user wants to report abuse or hide a notification.
- FIGS. 7F and 7G show example detailed view user interfaces 762 , 764 , 766 for cases where the action selected by the user is not possible and results in an error condition.
- FIGS. 7H and 7I show example different detailed view user interfaces 768 , 770 for different types of notifications over search results presented by a search engine.
- FIG. 8A shows the user interface 800 with four unread notifications, including a first notification 802 indicating that other users Charlie, Bob and Alice have commented on a post on topic 1 ; a second notification 804 indicating that other users Mike and Larry have commented on a post on topic 2 ; and two other notifications 604 .
- the user accessible notification item list 602 is shown FIG. 8A with the first notification 802 and the second notification 804 in bold or other visually distinct presentation to indicate the messages are unread.
- the system 100 changes the status of the notifications to read.
- FIG. 8B shows the user interface 850 with four unread notifications, including the second notification 804 indicating that other users Nick, Mike and Larry have commented on a post on topic 2 , the first notification 802 indicates that other users Ed, David and Charlie have commented on a post on topic 1 ; and two other notifications 604 .
- the system 100 presents the message notifications in order from top to bottom based on likely relevance or importance to the user.
- the names of other users associated with notifications are modified. Comparing the second notification 804 from FIG. 8A to FIG. 8B illustrates that not only does the notification item indicate the number of notifications that have been grouped but also highlights the names of users in bold indicating that the notifications from the users with their names in bold have not been read.
- the second notification 804 is related to two posts from Mike and Larry on topic 2 , neither of which has been reviewed by the user.
- the second notification 804 has the highest priority ranking as it is at the top of the notification item list 602 , and also indicates that the user Nick has posted a response which has not been reviewed by the user since Nick's name is in bold. Also since the user already reviewed the second notification 804 from Mike and Larry when the interface of FIG. 8A was displayed to the user, the names of Mike and Larry are no longer in bold in the second notification 804 of FIG. 8B . There is similar formatting on the first notification 802 to signal to the user which users have added new posts on topic 1 . The differences between FIG. 8A and 8B show that after the initial review of the first notification 802 additional users Ed and David have commented on topic 1 since their names are in bold in FIG. 8B .
- the first notification 802 also shows how only few most recent users are shown in the notification item since Alice's and Bob's names are removed from the notification in FIG. 8B .
- the indications of what users are related to a notification may be shown in other ways. For example, the new notifications items 604 , 802 and 804 may be highlighted in a different color format from other notification items.
- the user's photos may be stacked in field 606 in order from the person who most recently commented to the person that originally commented on the post so that when the user hovers over the stack the photos of the different users are displayed.

- FIG. 11B depicts the interface 1120 at a second point in time after the user has manipulated the cursor 1102 to a position where it is over the notification button 406 .
- the system 100 updates the user interface 1140 to that shown in FIG. 11C .
- FIG. 11C shows the interface 1140 at a third point in time after the user selected the notification button 406 and the interface 1140 has been updated.
- the system 900 operates so that the interaction for the user is as close to instant as possible so the user is not left waiting for the notifications to be displayed.
- the system 900 processes mouse movements across the page.
- movement processing and predictive fetching module 904 detects that the mouse is moving closer to the notification button 406 , then it signals to the notification client module 902 to start pre-loading the data to display. That way the data will be readily rendered before the user clicks on the notification button 406 .
- the system 900 will only fetch when the unread count is not 0, and when the time since the last fetch is significant.
- the movement processing and predictive fetching module 904 also processes for mouse velocity to see if the user is decelerating as he gets closer to the notification button 406 . Deceleration is an indication that the user will click on the notification button 406 .
- FIG. 11D depicts the user interface 1160 at yet another point in time and considering other factors, for example, cursor position.
- FIG. 11D shows an area 1162 as indicated by dashed lines proximate the notification button 406 and within a predetermined distance of the notification button 406 that can also be used to determine whether to fetch data before the notification button 406 has been selected.
- the method 1200 can include processing 1202 for cursor movement.
- the movement processing and predictive fetching module 904 receives cursor movement signals from the input device 906 .
- the method 1200 can include determining 1204 whether the cursor is moving. If not, the method 1200 returns to step 1202 and continues to process cursor movement. On the other hand, if in step 1204 it was determined that the cursor was moving, the method 1200 can determine 1206 the direction of movement.
- the method 1200 can include determining 1208 whether the direction of movement was toward the notification button 406 . If not, the method 1200 returns to step 1202 and continues to process cursor movement. However, if the direction of movement of cursor was toward the notification button 406 , the method 1200 can determine 1210 the acceleration of the cursor movement. The method 1200 can include testing 1212 whether the cursor was decelerating, since this is a good indication that the user is going to click on the notification button 406 because the method 1200 already knows the direction the cursor is traveling. Moreover, using deceleration provides the notification client module 902 with more than 100 ms to pre-fetch the notification information for the notification item list 602 .
- the method 1200 returns to step 1202 and continues to process additional cursor movements. If the cursor is decelerating, the method 1200 can include testing 1214 whether the user has any unread notifications.
- the notification client module 902 has information as to whether there are any unread notifications because the notification server 103 routinely updates the notification button 406 to indicate the number of unread notifications. By checking whether there are any unread notifications, the method 1200 advantageously reduces the number of requests from the notification client module 902 to the notification server 103 . If there are not any unread notifications, no data is pre-fetched and a method 1200 returns to step 1202 .
- the method 1200 can determine 1216 the amount of time that has elapsed since the notification item list 602 was retrieved.
- the method 1200 can include testing 1218 whether the amount of time since the last request to the notification server 103 is above the predefined threshold.
- the threshold is customizable by the system administrator. For example, the threshold may be between 10 and 45 seconds.
- the present method 1200 advantageously prevents too many requests for the notification information from being generated before the user has selected the notification button 406 .
- the method 1200 can determine 1220 whether other conditions are satisfied. It should be understood that this step is optional for other conditions, for example, the position of the cursor. If the other conditions are not satisfied, the method 1200 returns to step 1202 .
- the movement processing and predictive fetching module 904 generates 1222 and sends a signal to the notification client module 902 to request or fetch notification information for the notification item list 602 from the notification server 103 .
- the method 1200 can include determining 1224 whether the user clicked or hovered over the notification button 406 . If not, the method 1200 returns to step 1202 of FIG. 12A . However, if the user has selected the notification button 406 , the user interface is updated 1226 to display the notification item list 602 using the pre-fetched data. The method 1200 also can request or fetch the data for the detailed notification view.
- the method 1200 can include determining 1228 whether the user has selected the detailed view. If not, the method 1200 returns to step 1202 otherwise the method 1200 updates the user interface and presents 1230 the pre-fetched detail notification information. After step 1230 , the method 1200 returns to step 1202 to process additional input from the user.

- the method 1600 can include opening 1602 a browser window including at least one tab 1302 . Once browser window is open, the notification client module 902 corresponding to the tab 1302 can send 1604 a request to the notification server 103 for the number of unread notifications for this user. The request can be processed by the notification server 103 which responds to the notification client module 902 with a number representing the number of notifications for the user.
- the synchronization module 1304 cooperates with the notification client module 902 and processes communications between the notification client module 902 and the notification server 103 .
- Any notification information is detected by the synchronization module 1304 , and can be processed by storing 1606 it in the shared synchronization storage 1306 .
- the synchronization module 1304 also assigns and stores a time stamp of when the notification information was received from the notification server 103 .
- the method 1600 can include providing or updating 1608 the user interface so that the notification button 406 can show the number of unread notifications there are for the user. It should be noted that the present disclosure is particularly advantageous because the shared synchronization storage 1306 stores data segregated by user. Thus, even if two users are using the same client device 115 a , the notification information for each user will not be shared between them.
- the method 1700 can include determining 1702 whether a preset time has elapsed. In some implementations, the preset time ranges from 5 to 180 seconds. This effectively says the rate at which the synchronization module 1304 polls the shared synchronization storage 1306 or the notification server 103 for notification information updates. If the preset time has not elapsed, the method 1700 can loop back and re-performs step 1702 . On the other hand, if the predetermined amount of time has elapsed, the method 1700 can continue by retrieving 1704 the number of notifications and the timestamp from the shared synchronization storage 1306 .
- the method 1700 can include determining 1706 whether the timestamp was recently updated. In some implementations, the timestamp is considered recently updated if less than 30 seconds have elapsed since the timestamp. If the timestamp is recently updated, the method 1700 does not contact the notification server 103 and instead just updates 1708 displays of the notification information from the shared synchronization storage 1306 . In particular, the display is updated with information retrieved in step 1704 . This advantageously ensures that only one tab 1302 polls the notification server 103 and there are not multiple tabs 1302 attempting to poll the notification server 103 for information. If in step 1706 , the timestamp was not recently updated, the method 1700 can include requesting 1604 the number of unread messages from the notification server 103 .
- the synchronization module 1304 cooperates with the notification client module 902 to request information from the notification server 103 .
- the information is then received by notification client module 902 .
- the synchronization module 1304 can store 1606 the received number of unread notifications and the time and a timestamp in the shared synchronization storage 1306 .
- the notification client module 902 can then update 1608 the notification button 406 with the information received from the notification server 103 .
- the method 1700 returns to 1702 and loops until a predetermined amount of time has elapsed.
- processing cursor movements for predictive fetching and synchronizing data across multiple browser tabs or windows are operable in other contexts beyond processing notification information.

Abstract
A system for processing cursor movements for predictive fetching includes a notification server, a notification client module, and a movement processing and predictive fetching module. The notification server is coupled to other systems to receive notification information. The notification client module is coupled to retrieve notification information from the notification server. The movement processing and predictive fetching module is configured to capture and detect cursor movements on a client device. The movement processing and predictive fetching module determines the direction and deceleration of the cursor. If the movement is decelerating and in the direction of the notification button on the user interface, the movement processing and predictive fetching module generates a signal for the notification client module to pre-fetch notification information from the notification server.
Description
- This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/501,572, entitled “MONITORING CURSOR MOVEMENTS FOR PREDICTIVE FETCHING” filed on Jun. 27, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
- The present disclosure relates to electronic messaging and user interfaces. In particular, the present disclosure relates to processing cursor movements for predictive fetching.
- While users once operated their computing devices with a single browser showing a single webpage, the use of web browsers, the Internet and other types of electronic messaging has changed dramatically. For example, many ordinary users often have several different tabs showing web pages open at a given time. For power users, the number of tabs open at a given time can be greater than 20. Furthermore, no longer is the web browser solely used for retrieving information from the Internet and displaying static web pages. Now the web browser is used as an interface to manage e-mail, social networking, blogging, posting photos, watching videos, editing documents, and any number of additional activities. Therefore, it is important for users to be able to manage these different types of messaging and switch between them.
- With the browser being used for so many different activities, the speed at which the browser can retrieve and present information from a server is impaired. Additionally, many users have installed extensions or plug-ins to their web browser and this also impacts how quickly the browser can retrieve and display information. When information is not shown and displayed quickly enough this degrades the user experience and in the more problematic cases causes users to reload or re-fetch information. This causes unnecessary network traffic and additional load on web servers.
- As noted above, users no longer have only a single browser tab or window with only one page being viewed at a time. In some cases, the information being delivered to multiple different tabs or windows is the same. For companies that deliver significant amounts of web content, the more requests that are sent to the servers, the more response bandwidth and processing power are required to service these requests. In some cases, this means that they have installed additional web servers to provide adequate bandwidth and processing power to respond to the requests for information.
- According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a system for processing cursor movements for predictive fetching includes a notification server, a notification client module, and a movement processing and predictive fetching module. The notification server is coupled to other systems to receive notification information. The notification client module is coupled to retrieve notification information from the notification server. The movement processing and predictive fetching module is configured to capture and detect cursor movements on a client device. The movement processing and predictive fetching module determines the direction and deceleration of the cursor. If the movement is decelerating and in the direction of the notification button on the user interface, the movement processing and predictive fetching module generates a signal for the notification client module to pre-fetch notification information from the notification server.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include detecting movement of a cursor; determining whether movement of the cursor is towards a notification button; and requesting notification information from a notification server if the movement of the cursor is towards the notification button.
- Other implementations of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance, the features include: determining a direction of cursor movement and whether movement in the direction is closer to the notification button; determining whether the cursor is with a predetermined distance of the cursor; the notification information includes a list of notifications; and the notification information includes pre-fetched notification detail information. For instance, the operations further include: determining whether a user has an unread notification, and requesting notification information from the notification server is performed if the user has at least one unread notification; determining an acceleration of the cursor movement, and requesting notification information from the notification server is performed if the cursor movement is decelerating; determining an amount of time since a notification item list was retrieved, determining whether the amount of time since the notification item list was retrieved is greater than a predetermined amount of time, and requesting notification information from the notification server is performed if the amount of time since the notification item list was retrieved is greater than a predetermined amount of time; and determining whether notification button has been selected, if the notification button has been selected, updating a user interface with the notification information, and providing the updated user interface including the notification information for display.
- The present disclosure is particularly advantageous because it pre-fetches notification information so that once the user selects the notification button the information can be displayed to the user instantaneously without perceived latency that the notification information needs to be fetched. The present disclosure also includes novel methods for determining how and when to pre-fetch the notification data.
- The disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.

FIG. 1A illustrates a block diagram of asystem 100 a (also referred to herein individually and collectively as 100) for generating and presenting notifications, processing cursor movements for predictive fetching, and synchronizing data across multiple browser tabs or windows according to some implementations of the present disclosure. The illustratedsystem 100 a for generating and presenting notifications includesclient devices users social network server 101 and anotification server 103. In the illustrated implementation, these entities are communicatively coupled via anetwork 105. Although only three client devices 115 are illustrated, it should be recognized that any number ofclient devices 115 n are available to any number ofusers 120 n. Moreover, it should be understood that while the present disclosure is described below primarily in the context of notifications, the present disclosure is applicable to any type of online messaging. - The
client devices FIG. 1A are used by way of example. WhileFIG. 1A illustrates three devices, the present disclosure applies to any system architecture having one or more client devices 115. Furthermore, while only onenetwork 105 is coupled to the client devices, 115 a, 115 b, 115 n, thesocial network server 101, thenotification server 103 and athird party server 107, in practice any number ofnetworks 105 can be connected to the entities. Furthermore, while only onethird party server 107 is shown, thesystem 100 a could include one or morethird party servers 107. - In some implementations, the
social network server 101 is coupled to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 104. Thesocial network server 101 also includes a social network software/application 109. Although only onesocial network server 101 is shown, multiple servers may be present. A social network is any type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature. The common feature includes relationships/connections, e.g., friendship, family, work, an interest, etc. The common features are provided by one or more social networking systems, for example, those included in the system 100, including explicitly-defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users, where the relationships form a social graph 125. In some examples, the social graph 125 can reflect a mapping of these users and how they are related. Furthermore, it should be understood thatsocial network server 101 and social network software/application 109 are representative of one social network and that there may be are multiple social networks coupled to thenetwork 105, each having its own server, application and social graph. For example, a first social network is more directed to business networking, a second is more directed to or centered on academics, a third is more directed to local business, a fourth is directed to dating and others of general interest or a specific focus. - While shown as stand-alone server in
FIG. 1A , in some implementations all or part of thenotification server 103 could be part of thethird party server 107 that is connected to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 106. Thenotification server 103 interacts with the other servers, 101, 107, 121, 123, 127, 129, 131, 135, 137 via thenetwork 105. Thenotification server 103 is also coupled for communication with theclient device 115 a, which is connected to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 108. Theuser 120 a interacts with theclient device 115 a viasignal line 110. Similarly, theclient device 115 b is coupled to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 112 and theuser 120 b interacts with theclient device 115 b viasignal line 114. Thenotification server 103 can be stored in any combination of the devices and servers, or in only one of the devices or servers. - The
network 105 is a conventional type, wired or wireless, and may have any number of configurations, for example, a star configuration, token ring configuration or other configurations. Furthermore, thenetwork 105 may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet), and/or any other interconnected data path across which multiple devices may communicate. In some implementations, thenetwork 105 may be a peer-to-peer network. Thenetwork 105 may also be coupled to or includes portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. In some implementations, thenetwork 105 includes Bluetooth communication networks or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data, for example, via short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), direct data connection, WAP, email, etc. - The
notification server 103 interacts withother systems 107, 115 a-n, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, and 135 to retrieve/receive activity information or an activity stream and generate notifications. Thenotification server 103 cooperates with the client devices 115 to generate and present user interfaces that allow the user to view the number of notifications, list of notifications, detail about notifications and take action on notifications. In some implementations, thenotification server 103 receives activity information from theother systems notification server 103 processes this information to generate a number of notifications, a list of notifications, and detail about notifications. Thenotification server 103 interacts with the user 120 via client devices 115 to present the notification information. In particular, thenotification server 103 interacts with theweb browser 150 of the client devices 115 to receive inputs and generate user interfaces as will be described in more detail below. In some implementations, thenotification server 103 also cooperates with theemail server 123 to generate notifications and respond to e-mail messages. In some implementations, thenotification server 103 also generates notifications and sends replies or commands to the related electronic messages from a Short Message Service (SMS)/Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)server 129, an instant messaging (IM)server 131, aweb server 137, and/or thethird party server 107. In some implementations, thenotification server 103 also receives data related to electronic messaging from asearch server 135 that includes asearch engine 143 and is coupled to thenetwork 105 viasignal line 136. In some implementations, thesearch server 135 includes thesearch engine 143 for retrieving results that match search terms from the Internet. Theweb browser 150 and thenotification server 103 are used to manage and send data to and from thethird party server 107 viasignal line 106, themicro-blogging server 121 viasignal line 122, theprofile server 127 viasignal line 128, the client devices 115 viasignal lines e-mail server 123 viasignal line 124, the social graph 125 viasignal line 126, the SMS/MMS server 129 viasignal line 130, theIM server 131 viasignal line 132 and theweb server 137 viasignal line 138. - In some implementations, the
social network server 101, thethird party server 107, themicro-blogging server 121, thee-mail server 123, theprofile server 127, the SMS/MMS server 129, theIM server 131, thesearch server 135 and theweb server 137 are hardware servers including a processor, memory, and network communication capabilities. - Referring now to
FIG. 1B , some implementations for thesystem 100 b (also referred to herein individually and collectively as 100) with thenotification server 103 shown in more detail will be described. As shown, thesystem 100 b includes a plurality of client devices 115 a-115 n, anotification server 103 and a plurality of notification sources 160. In some implementations, each of the plurality of client devices 115 a-115 n includes theweb browser 150 and is coupled for communication with thenotification server 103, in particular anotification response server 152. Thenotification server 103 and theweb browsers 150 cooperate to generate and present for the user of the novel user interface of the present disclosure. Thenotification server 103 includes thenotification response server 152, an activity streamsbackend 154, an e-mail/text interface (I/F) 156, and a phone operating system interface (OS I/F) 158. The operation of thenotification server 103 and its components will be described in more detail below with reference toFIG. 2 . The activity streamsbackend 154 is coupled to thenotification response server 152 to send notification information to theweb browsers 150. The activity streamsbackend 154 is also coupled to thenotification sources 160 to receive activity information which it translates into notifications. In some implementations, thenotification server 103 also includes the e-mail/text interface 156 and the phoneoperating system interface 158 to which the activity streamsbackend 154 is coupled. The notification sources 160 include one or more from the group of thesocial network server 101, thethird party server 107, themicro-blogging server 121, thee-mail server 123, theprofile server 127, the SMS/MMS server 129, theIM server 131, thesearch server 135 and theweb server 137, which have been described above. The notification sources 160 may also include: agame server 140 for sending information related to an online game and receiving commands related to that game, and avideo chat server 144 for sending information related to a video chat and receiving commands related to that video chat. Thegame server 140 is coupled to the activity streamsbackend 154 bysignal line 142. Thevideo chat server 144 is coupled to the activity streamsbackend 154 bysignal line 146. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of some implementations of thenotification server 103. In this implementation, thenotification server 103 includes: anetwork interface module 233, aprocessor 235, amemory 237,storage 239, thenotification response server 152 and the activity streamsbackend 154. - The
network interface module 233 can be coupled tonetwork 105 bysignal line 102 andbus 220. Thenetwork interface module 233 includes ports for wired connectivity, for example, but not limited to USB, SD, or CAT-5, etc. Thenetwork interface module 233 links theprocessor 235 to thenetwork 105 that may in turn be coupled to other processing systems. Thenetwork interface module 233 provides other conventional connections to thenetwork 105 using standard network protocols, for example, TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS and SMTP. In some implementations, thenetwork interface module 233 includes a transceiver for sending and receiving signals using WiFi, Bluetooth® or cellular communications for wireless communication. - The
processor 235 can include an arithmetic logic unit, a microprocessor, a general purpose controller or some other processor array to perform computations and provide electronic display signals to a display device. Theprocessor 235 is coupled to thebus 220 for communication with the other components.Processor 235 processes data signals and may include various computing architectures including a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture, or an architecture implementing a combination of instruction sets. Although only a single processor is shown inFIG. 2 , multiple processors may be included. Other processors, operating systems, sensors, displays and physical configurations are possible. - The
memory 237 can stores instructions and/or data that may be executed byprocessor 235. Thememory 237 is coupled to thebus 220 for communication with the other components. The instructions and/or data may include code for performing any and/or all of the techniques described herein. Thememory 237 may be a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, a static random access memory (SRAM) device, flash memory or some other memory device known in the art. - In some implementations,
storage 239 stores data, information and instructions used by thenotification server 103. The stored information includes information about users, information about messages, and other information retrieved by activity streams backend 154, in particular,collector modules notification database 210 and the real-time/push notification module 212. In some implementations, thestorage 239 also stores data and other information utilized by thenotification response server 152.Storage 239 can be a non-volatile memory or similar permanent storage device and media, for example, a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD-ROM device, a DVD-ROM device, a DVD-RAM device, a DVD-RW device, a flash memory device, or some other mass storage device known in the art for storing information on a more permanent basis. Thestorage 239 is coupled by thebus 220 for communication withother components notification server 103. - As shown in
FIG. 2 , thenotification response server 152 includes arequest processing module 214, adata formatting module 216 and a user state and status module 218. Each of thesemodules bus 220 for communication with each other and other components of thenotification server 103. At a general level, thenotification response server 152 is responsible for communication with the client devices 115. Thenotification response server 152 receives requests from the client devices 115 which can be a request for notification information or an input command to take a particular action with regard to a notification. Thenotification response server 152 is also coupled for communication with the activity streamsbackend 154. Thenotification response server 152 retrieves information from the activity streamsbackend 154 and also sends commands to the activity streamsbackend 154 for execution by the notification sources 160. - The
request processing module 214 can be software and routines for processing requests that are received from the client devices 115. Therequest processing module 214 is coupled for communication with the client devices 115, in particular, theweb browser 150. Therequest processing module 214 receives and processes requests from the client devices 115 for more information or requests to execute a command. Therequest processing module 214 serves as a controller to process requests including sending notification information, formatting information, or state information back to the client devices 115. Therequest processing module 214 is coupled to receive data formatting instructions from thedata formatting module 216 and to retrieve user state and status information from the user state and status module 218. In some implementations, therequest processing module 214 uses both information from thedata formatting module 216 and data from the user state and status module 218 to generate the novel user interfaces of the present disclosure as will be described below with reference toFIGS. 3-12B . Therequest processing module 214 is also coupled for communication with the activity streamsbackend 154. Therequest processing module 214 retrieves information about notifications, notification lists and notification detail from the activity streamsbackend 154. Therequest processing module 214 also passes on commands to the activity streamsbackend 154 for transmission to and execution by the notification sources 160. In some implementations, some commands do not pass through the activity streamsbackend 154, but instead go directly from the client devices 115 to the notification sources 160. - The
data formatting module 216 can be software and routines for determining the proper format for notification information (the number of notifications, the notification list and the notification detail). Thedata formatting module 216 is coupled to receive requests from therequest processing module 214 and state information from the user state and status module 218. Thedata formatting module 216 prepares the data and specifies the format for presentation of the data. For example, thedata formatting module 216 may reorder the notifications for presentation to the user based on various factors, for example, time, relevance, freshness, communication type, interest level to the user, popularity, etc. Particular examples will be described below with reference toFIGS. 8A and 8B , for example, thedata formatting module 216 re-ordering the names of other users that are part of a notification. In some implementations, thedata formatting module 216 only presents a predetermined number of notifications, for example, the top nine notifications ranked by a combination of relevance and time. In some implementations, thedata formatting module 216 coalesces or groups multiple notifications into a single notification when they relate to the same topic, photo or have some other common characteristic. For example, a photo may be posted and there may be 13 other actions associated with that photo including tagging, posting, sharing etc. Thedata formatting module 216 determines a type of the notification, then determines the entity that the notification refers to (in this case the photo ID). Then thedata formatting module 216 retrieves the activities related to that photo. The activities are sorted from most recent to the original. Since the notifications are related to the same type and entity they are coalesced or grouped into a single notification item. This notification item is then formatted for presentation to the user. The formatting includes putting in bold the names of any users that have performed an activity that has been unread or un-reviewed by the user. An example of this process is shown below with reference toFIGS. 8A and 8B . - The user state and status module 218 can be used to keep records as to the user state and status of each user. In some implementations, the user state and status module 218 can be a storage device capable of storing numerous records. For example, the user state and status module 218 keeps a record of which notifications have been reviewed by the user, which notifications have not been reviewed by the user and how many un-reviewed or unread notifications that the user has. Similarly, the user state and status module 218 records the state of the
web browser 150 being used by the user 120, for example, selection of the notification button, the notifications that are being presented to the user in the list, or the selection of more detail for any particular notification. In some implementations, therequest processing module 214 provides notification information in stages, for example, first only the number of notifications, then the list of notifications, and finally the details about individual notifications. This advantageously minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred from thenotification server 103 to the client devices 115. Depending on the state of the user, this information will be pre-fetched from the activity streamsbackend 154 and sent to the user'sweb browser 150 in these three steps thereby minimizing perceived user latency. - In some implementations, the activity streams
backend 154 includes ane-mail notification collector 202, acalendar notification collector 204, a socialnetwork notification collector 206, an othersource notification collector 208, anotification database 210 and a real-time/push notification module 212. Thesecomponents bus 220 for communication with each other and other components of thenotification server 103. Thebus 220 can be any type of conventional communication bus. - The
e-mail notification collector 202 can be software and routines for interacting with e-mail systems coupled to the activity streamsbackend 154 via thenetwork 105. In some implementations, thee-mail notification collector 202 interacts with thee-mail server 123 to retrieve e-mail information, for example, messages that have been received and sent, the status of messages as to whether they read, unread, forward, replied to, etc. For example, thee-mail server 123 can be an e-mail service. Thee-mail notification collector 202 in some implementations interacts with a credentials module (not shown) to retrieve the user's login name and password as well as any other information necessary to access thee-mail server 123. Thee-mail notification collector 202 also stores information that has been retrieved in thenotification database 210. Thee-mail notification collector 202 is coupled for communication withother e-mail servers 123 and thestorage 239. It should be understood that even though thee-mail notification collector 202 has been described above as connecting and extracting information from a single e-mail system, thee-mail notification collector 202 may perform the same operation for a plurality of e-mail systems that are utilized by a particular user. For example, users often have several different e-mail accounts. In some implementations, thee-mail notification collector 202 connects and collects information from two or more of these several different e-mail accounts. Thee-mail notification collector 202 also interacts with thee-mail server 123 to take action with regard to e-mails that have been received for the user. For example, if a user is notified of an unread e-mail, and then reviews the e-mail using the user interface that will be described below with reference toFIGS. 4-8B ; the user may respond, forward or take some other action with regard to the e-mail in the user interface. This action is transmitted from theweb browser 150 to thenotification response server 152 then to thee-mail notification collector 202 to deliver to thee-mail server 123. - The
calendar notification collector 204 can be software and routines for interacting with theprofile server 127 coupled to the activity streamsbackend 154 via thenetwork 105. In some implementations, thecalendar notification collector 204 interacts with theprofile server 127 to retrieve profile information, for example, calendar events. In some implementations, theprofile server 127 can be a free time management web applications, for example, a calendar application. Thecalendar notification collector 204 also stores received calendar notification information in thenotification database 210. Thecalendar notification collector 204 also sends commands and instructions to theprofile server 127 to change calendar events, add calendar events, modify parties associated with events, delete events, etc. - The social
network notification collector 206 can be a module for interacting with one or moresocial network servers 101 or systems. In some implementations, the socialnetwork notification collector 206 is coupled bynetwork 105 for communication and interaction with thesocial network server 101, social network software/application 109 and social graph 125. The socialnetwork notification collector 206 can be similar to the e-mailnotification collector module 202 except that it collects notification information related to a user's interaction and use of a social network. The socialnetwork notification collector 206 interacts with a credentials module to retrieve the user's login and password as well as other information necessary to access the social network software/application 109 and social graph 125. The socialnetwork notification collector 206 retrieves and collects notification information about messages sent, messages received, information posted, posted information reviewed, change in status of friends, the addition of connections, removal of connections, and any other activity that can be undertaken by the user on the social network. The socialnetwork notification collector 206 also collects information from other individuals that are important or linked to the user. In some implementations, the application interface (API) of the social network is used by the socialnetwork notification collector 206 and extracts information. Thus, it should be understood that the socialnetwork notification collector 206 can retrieve any information related to the user from the social network. The socialnetwork notification collector 206 stores the information it collects in thenotification database 210. The socialnetwork notification collector 206 is coupled by thebus 220 to thestorage 239. Example notifications include friend requests, a post to a source being processed, or any other activity on the social network of importance to the user. The socialnetwork notification collector 206 also interacts with the social network to respond to any notifications, for example, accepting the friend request, replying to a post or any other action on the social network that is possible in response to the notification. - The other
source notification collector 208 can be software and routines for interacting with and extracting information from any other electronic messaging system or anyother notification source 160. The othersource notification collector 208 has the credentials and the application interface for interacting with the other notification sources 160. The othersource notification collector 208 processes theother notification sources 160 for activities of which the user wants to be notified and also can take any action with regard to the activities that is allowed by the other sources. The othersource notification collector 208 collects information related to the user's interaction with those other systems. The othersource notification collector 208 stores the information collected in thenotification database 210. Example other sources include thethird party server 107, themicro-blogging server 121, the SMS/MMS server 129, theIM server 131, thesearch server 135 and theweb server 137. - The
notification database 210 can be data storage for storing information received from any of the notification sources 160. In some implementations, thenotification database 210 can be a database organized by user. For each user, thenotification database 210 stores any activity information received from any of the notification sources 160. For example, this can include e-mails details (e.g., header, sender, date, subject, etc.), social network activity, for example, posts, shares, invitations, status changes, etc. Thenotification database 210 is coupled for communication with thenotification collectors notification database 210 is also coupled to thenotification response server 152 to provide notification information responsive to queries by therequest processing module 214. - The real-time/
push notification module 212 can be software and routines for responding tonotification sources 160 that push notification data to the activity streamsbackend 154. For most of thenotification sources 160, thenotification collectors notification sources 160 by polling, or on a periodic basis as has been described above. However, for some data, thenotification sources 160 push the data in real time to the activity streamsbackend 154. In such cases, the real-time/push notification module 212 is coupled for communication with thosenotification sources 160 that push data in real time. In some implementations, the real-time/push notification module 212 has a persistent connection or browser channel with thenotification sources 160 that are pushing data. The real-time/push notification module 212 receives the pushed information, stores the pushed information in thenotification database 210 and also sends a signal to thenotification response server 152 to update the user interface andweb browser 150 of the user corresponding to pushed information, in other words process the pushed activity information by generating and sending a new notification to the client devices 115. One example of notification information pushed in real time is a request for a video chat from thevideo chat server 144. Another example of notification information pushed in real time is an invitation to hang out at a location in the social network. - One or more of the
e-mail notification collector 202, thecalendar notification collector 204, the socialnetwork notification collector 206, the othersource notification collector 208, the real-time/push notification module 212, therequest processing module 214, thedata formatting module 216, and the user state and status module 218 are executable on theprocessor 235. In some implementations, thee-mail notification collector 202, thecalendar notification collector 204, the socialnetwork notification collector 206, the othersource notification collector 208, the real-time/push notification module 212, therequest processing module 214, thedata formatting module 216, and the user state and status module 218 store data that, when executed by theprocessor 235, causes the collectors/modules to perform the operations described below. In some implementations, one or more of thee-mail notification collector 202, thecalendar notification collector 204, the socialnetwork notification collector 206, the othersource notification collector 208, the real-time/push notification module 212, therequest processing module 214, thedata formatting module 216, and the user state and status module 218 are instructions executable by theprocessor 235 to provide the functionality described below with reference toFIGS. 4-17 . In some implementations, one or more of thee-mail notification collector 202, thecalendar notification collector 204, the socialnetwork notification collector 206, the othersource notification collector 208, the real-time/push notification module 212, therequest processing module 214, thedata formatting module 216, and the user state and status module 218 are stored in thememory 237 of thenotification server 103 and are accessible and executable by theprocessor 235. - In some implementations, the
notification server 103 includes the e-mail/text interface 156 and the phoneoperating system interface 158. It should be understood that theseinterfaces FIGS. 1B and 2 . The e-mail/text interface 156 allows thenotification server 103 to be coupled and interact directly withe-mail servers 123 and SMS/MMS servers 129 owned and operated by other parties. In some implementations, the e-mail/text interface 156 allows these systems direct communication with the real-time/push notification module 212. Similarly, the phoneoperating system interface 158 allows mobile handsets operating a phone operating system, for example, Android to interact with thenotification server 103. Theseinterfaces notification server 103 and these other systems. This is advantageous to reduce latency and increase functionality. - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , amethod 300 for providing notifications according to some implementations of the present disclosure will be described. The method can include presenting 302 a user interface with anotification button 406 as will be described in more detail below with reference toFIG. 4 . The method includes retrieving 304 the number of notifications that are unread for this user. For example, therequest processing module 214 retrieves this information from thenotification database 210. The method can continues by updating 306 the user interface with the number of notifications. For example, therequest processing module 214 sends the number of notifications to theclient device 115 a and theclient device 115 a updates the user interface. An example of this is shown with the differences betweenFIGS. 4 and 5A as will be described below in more detail. The method can include determining 308 whether the user has selected thenotification button 406. For example, theuser 120 a inputs a selection of the notification button at theweb browser 150 of theclient device 115 a. In some implementations, the method determines whether there is an indication of user interest in the notification button. This indication of user interest in the notification button may be selection of the notification button, movement of a cursor over the notification button or movement of the cursor proximate the notification button. Theclient device 115 a sends this selection to thenotification server 103, in particular therequest processing module 214 of thenotification response server 152. If not, the method can wait a predetermined amount of time and loops back tostep 302. However, if the user has selected thenotification button 406, the method can proceed to retrieve 310 a list of notifications. Again, in some implementations therequest processing module 214 retrieves this information from thenotification database 210. The method can include displaying 312 a new user interface showing the list of notifications. An example of aninterface 600 is shown inFIG. 6A and will be described in more detail below. The method can determine 314 whether the user requested more detail about a notification. If not, the user and notification states are updated 316 after which the method returns to step 302. In some implementations, if the user has viewed a list of notifications, those notifications are changed in status from unread to read. The state as to the time at which the user reviewed notifications can also be recorded. On the other hand, if it is determined instep 314 that the user has requested more detail about a notification, the method can continue instep 318 by retrieving and displaying a new user interface with detailed information about the notification selected from the list. An example of aninterface 700 is shown inFIG. 7A and will be described in more detail below. The method can include determining 320 whether the user is taking an action or responding to the notification. Theuser interface 700 of the present disclosure advantageously provides a way in which to seamlessly reply to notifications without having to open additional windows, tabs or applications, etc. Theuser interface 700 allows the user to input actions responsive to the notification, and in some implementations, includes only those actions or responses that are appropriate and most likely to be taken by the user for the given type of notification. If the user inputs a response or action for the notification, the method can perform 322 that response or action after which the method continues instep 316 to update the user and notification states. The action can be sent from the client devices 115 to thenotification server 103 and then to the notification sources 160. On the other hand, if the user is not responding to the notification, the method can determine 324 whether the user has requested more information about another notification. If so, the method returns to step 318, retrieves details about another notification and updates the user interface. If the user has not requested more information, the method returns to step 316 to update the user and notification states. The method of the present disclosure is particularly advantageous because it minimizes the amount of information that thenotification server 103 must provide to the client devices 115. It does this by first providing the number of notifications (a very small amount of data and easily computed), by providing only the list of notifications (an additional amount of data but still relatively small), and providing full detail about only those notifications that are selected by the user. Thus, only if the user is actually interested in the information will it be sent from thenotification server 103 to the client devices 115. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , an implementation of auser interface 400 for presenting notifications according to the present disclosure is described. Theuser interface 400 includes abrowser window 402 having a number of components including a top label, amenu bar 404, anotification button 406, a tool bar/location bar 408, one ormore tabs 410 and adisplay area 412. The top label, themenu bar 404, the tool bar/location bar 408, the one ormore tabs 410 and thedisplay area 412. For example, themenu bar 404 provides menus to access browser functionality. The tool bar/location bar 408 provides tools, for example, buttons for moving to a prior webpage, a next webpage, refreshing a webpage, etc. as well as the address of the webpage being shown in thedisplay 412. Thetabs 410 are provided to access one or more web pages simultaneously. There can be any number of tabs from one to n at a specified time. The present disclosure advantageously provides anew notification button 406 to provide feedback to the user as to any notifications specific to the user that are available on thenotification server 103. In this implementation, thenotification button 406 is advantageously positioned near the top of thebrowser window 402 proximate themenu bar 404. In this example, thenotification button 406 is a square button; however, it should be understood that it could also be any other shape or symbol. Furthermore, thenotification button 406 could also be of a different color, have shading, or be highlighted in various other ways to be presented in a visually distinct manner from the top label,menu bar 404, and tool bar/location bar 408 or other components of thebrowser window 402. In some implementations, thenotification button 406 is of a first color (e.g., gray) when there are no unread notifications and the user interface is updated to a second color (e.g., red) when there are unread notifications. The same effect could be achieved by transitioning between shapes and symbols. The implementation shown inFIG. 4 is only one example for the user interface. Thenotification button 406 as well as the other components of thebrowser window 402 may be organized in different arrangements with different shades and different visual formatting. - Referring now to
FIG. 5A , an implementation of theuser interface 500 for presenting notifications when there are unread notifications is shown. In this implementation, theuser interface 500 includes an updatednotification button 406 that includes avisual indication 502 as to the number of unread notifications that are available for this user. In this example, thevisual indication 502 is a number that is positioned within thenotification button 406. There are other various ways to provide a visual indication that there are unread messages which are included and encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. Additionally, as the number of unread notifications increases, the number will increment. In addition to the number incrementing, thenotification button 406 could animate in any of number of ways in order to draw the user's eye to the new information. This animation could be in place, or if the user has scrolled past the notification badge, the badge could peek from above the scrollable area into the scrollable area for a brief period of time. For example, thenotification button 406 may be shown in a different color as discussed above or a portion of thenotification button 406 may be shaded or shown in a visually distinct manner to indicate a percentage of additional notifications that are unread, where the percentage of the notifications button with a different color or format indicates the percentage of notifications that are unread. - Referring now to
FIGS. 5B-5G , additional implementations of the user interface 550-560 for interaction with different types ofnotification sources 160 are shown. The notification system 100 is particularly advantageous because it provides a uniform interface independent of the type of messaging that the user is undertaking For example, regardless of whether the user is interacting with any e-mail program, calendar program, a social network, a document program or Internet search program, thebrowser window 402 and the relative position of thenotification button 406 remain the same. This is more clearly shown by a comparison of the position of thenotification button 406 inFIGS. 5B-5G . -
FIG. 5B shows an implementation of thenotifications user interface 550 on a web browser. -

FIG. 6A , theuser interface 600 for presenting anotification item list 602 according to the present disclosure will be described. Thenotification button 406 is included on a header bar that is present across multiple systems and has been described above with reference toFIG. 5 . When the user selects thenotification button 406, the user interface transitions from that ofFIG. 4 or 5A to that ofFIG. 6A . Theuser interface 600 displays anotification item list 602 that shows recent notifications of different types (e.g., users that have added you to their social graph, posts where people mention you, etc.). These notifications are coalesced together by type, and/or by the post that they hang off of, and users can respond to these notifications without having to navigate away from the notification item list 602 (e.g., user can add people to their social graph and respond to posts in this box without having to navigate to the social network's homepage). - The
user interface 600 includes thebrowser window 402 having similar components as described above with reference toFIGS. 4 and 5A . Additionally, theuser interface 600 presents anotification item list 602 with a plurality of menu/notification items 604. Each menu/notification item 604 includes an identifier orprofile 606 of the user, abstracted users andcontent information 608, anicon 610 indicating notification types and alink 612 to transition to another interface that shows the full detail of thenotification item 604. In some implementations, thisuser interface 600 is created by code that creates an i-frame within thebrowser window 402, and the data for the menu is fetched from thenotification server 103. - One advantage of the present disclosure is that
notification server 103 filters the notifications and presents the notifications that are of greatest interest to the user. In one example, only the top nine menu/notification items 604 are shown in thenotification item list 602. This number can vary between two and n and in some cases may even be customizable by the user to any number desired by setting the user preference. In some implementations, the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in thenotification item list 602 according to relevance to the user. In some implementations, the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in thenotification item list 602 according to chronological order. In some implementations, the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in thenotification item list 602 based on priority of whether a specific response by the user is required. In some implementations, the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in thenotification item list 602 based on implied importance to the user based on their social graph. Finally, in some implementations, the menu/notification items 604 are ordered in thenotification item list 602 according to a combination of the above factors. - Furthermore, it should be noted that the
notification server 103 also coalesces or groups individual notifications to minimize the number ofitems 604 that are in thenotification item list 602. In one example, the notifications are grouped according to type so that e-mail notifications are grouped together as onenotification item 604, calendar notifications are grouped together as onenotification item 604, social network notifications are grouped together as onenotification item 604, etc. It should be understood that the notifications can also be grouped by type, subtype and topic. For example, there might be threenotification items 604 in thenotification item list 602 for social networking: onenotification item 604 for posts on the social network, onenotification item 604 for friend requests on the social network, and one notification item for sharing of photos on the social network. In the above example, the type is social networking, the subtype is posts, friend requests, or photo sharing, and these pairings of type and subtype can be further grouped or coalesced by topic. In some implementations, the menu/notification items 604 are displayed in visually distinct manners based upon whether they are read or unread. - The identifier or
profile 606 of the user is information that the user can quickly view to ascertain the user that generated the notification. In some implementations, the identifier orprofile 606 is a photo of the user. In some implementations, the identifier orprofile 606 can be the name or system login of the user. - The abstracted users and
content information 608 can be abstracted information about users that are related to the notification and the content of the notification. In some implementations, this includes different usernames and some sample text. For example, the abstracted users andcontent information 608 could be the last three people that responded to the post and the topic of the post. Even more specifically, for the first menu/notification item 604 a, the users that have commented on the post are Charlie, Bob and Alice and the sample text is an abstract of the topic of the post. In some implementations, this abstracted users andcontent information 608 can be stored in thenotification database 210 so that it can easily be fetched by thenotification response server 152 for inclusion in thenotification item list 602. - The
icon 610, indicating notification type, can be some symbol or text identifying the notification type. In some implementations, each of thenotification sources 160 has a visually distinct symbol. This symbol is used for theicon 610. For example, there might be a first symbol for e-mail, a second symbol for social networking, a third symbol for a calendar notification, a fourth symbol for instant messages, etc. In some implementations, the number oficons 610 is less than 10 and therefore some of thenotification sources 160 share the same icon even though being a different type of notification. - The
link 612 can be provided to allow the user to transition to another interface (see e.g.FIG. 7A ) that shows the full detail of thenotification item 604. In this implementation, the link is shown as a greater than symbol, however, various other types of visual indications, for example, underlining the abstracted users andcontent information 608 could be used. - In some implementations, the user interface shown in
FIG. 6A can be also integrated with theweb browser 150 so that it is interoperable for easy navigation using the direction keys. More specifically, if the user selects the up or down direction keys thenotification item 604 selected in thenotification item list 602 moves upward or downward, respectively. Similarly, the left and right direction keys are used to transition between the user interface ofFIG. 6A and the user interface ofFIG. 7A in terms of getting less or more detail about a notification. For example, if thenotification item list 602 is shown and the user selects the right direction key, theuser interface 600 transitions fromFIG. 6A to theuser interface 700 ofFIG. 7A . Similarly, if theuser interface 700 ofFIG. 7A is shown and the user selects the left arrow, theuser interface 700 transitions from that ofFIG. 7A to theuser interface 600 ofFIG. 6A . In some implementations, the left and right direction keys are also used to transition between different notifications in the detailed notification view ofFIG. 7A-7I . - Referring now to
FIG. 6B , another implementation of notification item lists 602 in a listview user interface 650 is shown. - Referring now to

FIG. 6F , another implementation of the listview user interface 658 over a web page showing search results is shown. - Referring now to
FIG. 7A , some implementations of auser interface 700 for presenting detailed notification information according to the present disclosure is shown. Thenotification button 406 can be included on a header bar that is present across multiple systems and has been described above with reference toFIG. 5 . Theuser interface 700 ofFIG. 7A is presented after a transition fromuser interface 600 ofFIG. 6A . Theuser interface 700 replaces thenotification item list 602 with a detailed notifications andaction window 702. Depending on the type of notification, the detailed notifications andaction window 702 will present: 1) more detailed information specific to the type of notification; 2) users related to the notification; and 3) links or buttons to actions that can be taken in response to the notification. For example, if the notification is about a social network, thewindow 702 will include the information that was posted, who posted it, other users that viewed it and a button posting a reply. Similarly, if the notification is about a photo, the full photo will be displayed in thewindow 702. More detailed information specific to the type of notification may be customized to be based upon the additional detail that is retrievable from the notification sources 160. One example of types of notifications includes: posts in a social network, photo sharing and social network, friending in a social network, other actions in a social network, e-mail notifications, instant message notifications, text messaging notifications, SMS notifications, calendar notifications, etc. As has been noted above, depending on the type of notification, different actions may be performed. For example, if the type of notification is a post in a social network, possible actions include commenting on the post, reposting the post, calling out the post, etc. Similarly, if the type of the notification is a photo in a social network, the possible actions include sharing the photo with others, tagging the photo, requesting removal of the photo, etc. The detailed notifications andaction window 702 includes links, buttons or fields to input information and instructions to perform responses or actions. Furthermore, it should be understood that the detailed notifications andaction window 702 includes any number of additional links to other users related to the notification, links to users that matter to the user, a link to comments since the user's last post, a link to retrieve similar notifications based on topic or type, a link to posts related to the notification, a link to similar material, etc. - Referring now to
FIGS. 7B-7I , additional implementations of the user interface 750-770 for presenting detailed information about notifications and interactions with other different types ofnotification sources 160 are shown. The notification system 100 is particularly advantageous because it allows the user to take actions with regard to any of thenotification sources 160 without having to open additional windows or tabs or transition to other applications. From theweb browser 150, and using the interface ofFIG. 7B-7I , the user can take action with regard to any type of messaging. For example, regardless of whether the user is interacting with any e-mail program, calendar program, a social network, a document program or Internet search program, the user can take action with regard to notifications from those systems using the standard interface shown inFIGS. 7B-7I . -
FIGS. 7B-7D show additional implementations of user interfaces 750-758 for presenting detailed information. It should be noted that each user interfaces 750-758 has a different format depending on the type of notification and a different set of actions that can be taken directly from the detailed view. -
FIG. 7E shows an implementation of auser interface 760 that shows the detailed views when the user wants to report abuse or hide a notification. -
FIGS. 7F and 7G show example detailedview user interfaces -
FIGS. 7H and 7I show example different detailedview user interfaces - Referring now to
FIGS. 8A and 8B , theuser interface FIG. 8A shows theuser interface 800 with four unread notifications, including afirst notification 802 indicating that other users Charlie, Bob and Alice have commented on a post ontopic 1; asecond notification 804 indicating that other users Mike and Larry have commented on a post ontopic 2; and twoother notifications 604. The user accessiblenotification item list 602 is shownFIG. 8A with thefirst notification 802 and thesecond notification 804 in bold or other visually distinct presentation to indicate the messages are unread. When the user accessiblenotification item list 602 is presented to the user, the system 100 changes the status of the notifications to read. Some time elapses and additional notifications are received and thenotification button 406 is updated. At some later time, the user selects thenotification button 406 and thenotification item list 602 is presented inuser interface 850 as shown inFIG. 8B .FIG. 8B shows theuser interface 850 with four unread notifications, including thesecond notification 804 indicating that other users Nick, Mike and Larry have commented on a post ontopic 2, thefirst notification 802 indicates that other users Ed, David and Charlie have commented on a post ontopic 1; and twoother notifications 604. By comparing the differences between theuser interface 800 ofFIG. 8A and theuser interface 850 ofFIG. 8B , a number of novel features of the present disclosure are shown. First, the order of the first andsecond notifications notification item list 602 is reversed as reflected by a change in the importance or recentness of thenotifications second notification 804 fromFIG. 8A toFIG. 8B illustrates that not only does the notification item indicate the number of notifications that have been grouped but also highlights the names of users in bold indicating that the notifications from the users with their names in bold have not been read. For example inFIG. 8A , thesecond notification 804 is related to two posts from Mike and Larry ontopic 2, neither of which has been reviewed by the user. However, sometime later as shown inFIG. 8B , thesecond notification 804 has the highest priority ranking as it is at the top of thenotification item list 602, and also indicates that the user Nick has posted a response which has not been reviewed by the user since Nick's name is in bold. Also since the user already reviewed thesecond notification 804 from Mike and Larry when the interface ofFIG. 8A was displayed to the user, the names of Mike and Larry are no longer in bold in thesecond notification 804 ofFIG. 8B . There is similar formatting on thefirst notification 802 to signal to the user which users have added new posts ontopic 1. The differences betweenFIG. 8A and 8B show that after the initial review of thefirst notification 802 additional users Ed and David have commented ontopic 1 since their names are in bold inFIG. 8B . Thefirst notification 802 also shows how only few most recent users are shown in the notification item since Alice's and Bob's names are removed from the notification inFIG. 8B . The indications of what users are related to a notification may be shown in other ways. For example, thenew notifications items field 608, the user's photos may be stacked infield 606 in order from the person who most recently commented to the person that originally commented on the post so that when the user hovers over the stack the photos of the different users are displayed. - Referring now to
FIG. 9 , some implementations of asystem 900 for processing cursor movements for predictive fetching will be described. Thesystem 900 for processing cursor movements for predictive fetching includes thenotification server 103 and theclient device 115a having aweb browser 150. Theweb browser 150 includes anotification client module 902 and a movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904. - The
notification server 103 can be coupled for communication and interaction with theclient device 115a bysignal lines network 105. More specifically, thenotification server 103 interacts with thenotification client module 902 operable as part of theweb browser 150. The movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 can be also operable as part of theweb browser 150. - The
notification client module 902 can be software and routines for generating and presenting the user interfaces described above with reference toFIGS. 4-8A . In particular, thenotification client module 902 generates anotification button 406, thenotification item list 602 and the detailed notifications andaction window 702. Thenotification client module 902 also sends requests and commands to thenotification server 103 and receives and processes information received from thenotification server 103. More specifically, thenotification client module 902 sends requests and commands to therequest processing module 214 of thenotification response server 152. Thenotification client module 902 also interacts with therequest processing module 214 and thedata formatting module 216 of thenotification response server 152 to receive information that is utilized for the user interfaces that are described above. Finally, thenotification client module 902 receives signals from the movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 and in response generates signals to pre-fetch data for thenotification item list 602 before presenting to the user. The operation of thenotification client module 902 for predictive fetching is described in more detail below with reference toFIGS. 12A and 12B . - The movement processing and predictive fetching
module 904 can be software and routines for processing the movement of the cursor by the user and generating a signal to pre-fetch information necessary for thenotification item list 602. The movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 is coupled to theweb browser 150 and theclient device 115a to detect the movement of aninput device 906 by the user. In some implementations, the movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 performs the operations for detecting mouse or cursor movement as will be described below with reference toFIGS. 12A and 12B . The movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 generates a signal that is sent to thenotification client module 902 to fetch information for thenotification item list 602 before thenotification button 406 has been selected by the user. - Referring now to
FIG. 10 , some implementations of theclient device 115a including thesystem 900 for processing cursor movements for predictive fetching is described. This implementation of theclient device 115a includes theprocessor 235, thememory 237, thestorage 239, thenetwork interface module 233, theinput device 906 and theweb browser 150. Theweb browser 150 further includes thenotification client module 902 and the movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904. These components are coupled for communication with each other and the network by thebus 220. Theprocessor 235, thememory 237, thestorage 239, thenetwork interface module 233, theweb browser 150, thenotification client module 902 and the movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 have been described above so that description will not be repeated here. In some implementations, theinput device 906 can be a touch screen, keyboard, keypad or input buttons. The touch screen can be any conventional touch screen, sensors, digitizing tablet or graphics pad. The keyboard can be a QWERTY keyboard, a key pad, or representations of a keyboard created on a touch screen. Theinput device 906 includes cursor control to communicate positional data as well as command selections toprocessor 235. Cursor control may include a mouse, a trackball, a stylus, a pen, a touch screen, cursor direction keys or other mechanisms to cause movement of a cursor. Theinput device 906 is coupled by thebus 220 for communication with the processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904. - Referring now to
FIGS. 11A-11D , the cursor movements and pre-fetching according to the present disclosure will be described.FIG. 11A shows some implementations of theuser interface 1100 similar to that described above with reference toFIG. 5A . FIG. 11A depicts theuser interface 1100 at a first point in time. When the user has an unread notification, the system 100 indicates it on thebrowser window 402 in the top right corner in thenotification button 406. The interface includes acursor 1102. The user is inputting signals to manipulate thecursor 1102 towards thenotification button 406 as represented byline 1104. The movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 receives signals from theinput device 906 and processes them as described below with reference toFIGS. 12A and 12B .FIG. 11B depicts theinterface 1120 at a second point in time after the user has manipulated thecursor 1102 to a position where it is over thenotification button 406. When the user clicks on thenotification button 406, the system 100 updates theuser interface 1140 to that shown inFIG. 11C .FIG. 11C shows theinterface 1140 at a third point in time after the user selected thenotification button 406 and theinterface 1140 has been updated. Thesystem 900 operates so that the interaction for the user is as close to instant as possible so the user is not left waiting for the notifications to be displayed. Thesystem 900 processes mouse movements across the page. If movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 detects that the mouse is moving closer to thenotification button 406, then it signals to thenotification client module 902 to start pre-loading the data to display. That way the data will be readily rendered before the user clicks on thenotification button 406. To prevent over fetching data from the notification server 103 (and overloading the server 103), thesystem 900 will only fetch when the unread count is not 0, and when the time since the last fetch is significant. The movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 also processes for mouse velocity to see if the user is decelerating as he gets closer to thenotification button 406. Deceleration is an indication that the user will click on thenotification button 406.FIG. 11D depicts theuser interface 1160 at yet another point in time and considering other factors, for example, cursor position.FIG. 11D shows anarea 1162 as indicated by dashed lines proximate thenotification button 406 and within a predetermined distance of thenotification button 406 that can also be used to determine whether to fetch data before thenotification button 406 has been selected. - Referring now to
FIGS. 12A and 12B , amethod 1200 for processing cursor movements for predictive fetching is described. While thepresent method 1200 is described with a number of determining steps, the determining steps could be reordered in a variety of other orders without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. Themethod 1200 can includeprocessing 1202 for cursor movement. For example, the movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 receives cursor movement signals from theinput device 906. Themethod 1200 can include determining 1204 whether the cursor is moving. If not, the method1200 returns to step 1202 and continues to process cursor movement. On the other hand, if instep 1204 it was determined that the cursor was moving, themethod 1200 can determine 1206 the direction of movement. Themethod 1200 can include determining 1208 whether the direction of movement was toward thenotification button 406. If not, themethod 1200 returns to step 1202 and continues to process cursor movement. However, if the direction of movement of cursor was toward thenotification button 406, themethod 1200 can determine 1210 the acceleration of the cursor movement. Themethod 1200 can includetesting 1212 whether the cursor was decelerating, since this is a good indication that the user is going to click on thenotification button 406 because themethod 1200 already knows the direction the cursor is traveling. Moreover, using deceleration provides thenotification client module 902 with more than 100 ms to pre-fetch the notification information for thenotification item list 602. If not, themethod 1200 returns to step 1202 and continues to process additional cursor movements. If the cursor is decelerating, themethod 1200 can includetesting 1214 whether the user has any unread notifications. Thenotification client module 902 has information as to whether there are any unread notifications because thenotification server 103 routinely updates thenotification button 406 to indicate the number of unread notifications. By checking whether there are any unread notifications, themethod 1200 advantageously reduces the number of requests from thenotification client module 902 to thenotification server 103. If there are not any unread notifications, no data is pre-fetched and amethod 1200 returns to step 1202. However if there are unread notifications, themethod 1200 can determine 1216 the amount of time that has elapsed since thenotification item list 602 was retrieved. Themethod 1200 can includetesting 1218 whether the amount of time since the last request to thenotification server 103 is above the predefined threshold. The threshold is customizable by the system administrator. For example, the threshold may be between 10 and 45 seconds. Thepresent method 1200 advantageously prevents too many requests for the notification information from being generated before the user has selected thenotification button 406. Referring now also toFIG. 12B , themethod 1200 can determine 1220 whether other conditions are satisfied. It should be understood that this step is optional for other conditions, for example, the position of the cursor. If the other conditions are not satisfied, themethod 1200 returns to step 1202. If the other conditions are satisfied, the movement processing and predictive fetchingmodule 904 generates 1222 and sends a signal to thenotification client module 902 to request or fetch notification information for thenotification item list 602 from thenotification server 103. Themethod 1200 can include determining 1224 whether the user clicked or hovered over thenotification button 406. If not, themethod 1200 returns to step 1202 ofFIG. 12A . However, if the user has selected thenotification button 406, the user interface is updated 1226 to display thenotification item list 602 using the pre-fetched data. Themethod 1200 also can request or fetch the data for the detailed notification view. Themethod 1200 can include determining 1228 whether the user has selected the detailed view. If not, themethod 1200 returns to step 1202 otherwise themethod 1200 updates the user interface and presents 1230 the pre-fetched detail notification information. Afterstep 1230, themethod 1200 returns to step 1202 to process additional input from the user. - Referring now to
FIG. 13 , some implementations of asystem 1300 for synchronizing data across multiple browser tabs or windows will be described. Thesystem 1300 for synchronizing data across multiple browser tabs or windows includes: thenotification server 103 and theclient device 115 a having one ormore web browsers 150 and a sharedsynchronization storage 1306. Theweb browser 150 includes one or more tabs 1302 a-1302 n, one or morenotification client modules 902 a-902 n and one ormore synchronization modules 1304 a-1304 n. - The
notification server 103 is coupled for communication and interaction with theclient device 115 a bysignal lines network 105. More specifically, thenotification server 103 interacts with thenotification client module 902 operable as part of theweb browser 150. Thenotification server 103, theclient device 115 a, and theweb browser 150 have been described above and they have similar functionality in thesystem 1300. -
FIG. 13 shows some implementations for thesystem 1300 in which theweb browser 150 has a plurality of tabs 1302 a-1302 n open. The tabs 1302 a-1302 n are part of a tabbed document interface of theweb browser 150 that allows multiple documents to be contained within a single browser window. The tabs 1302 a-1302 n are used to navigate between different documents. As shown inFIG. 13 , each of the tabs 1302 a-1302 n includes a correspondingnotification client module 902 a-902 n and asynchronization module 1304 a-1304 n. More specifically, afirst tab 1302 a has a correspondingnotification client module 902 a and a synchronization module 1304 a. Similarly, asecond tab 1302 n has a correspondingnotification client module 902 n and asynchronization module 1304 n. In the implementation shown inFIG. 13 , thesynchronization modules 1304 a-1304 n cooperate with the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 for synchronizing notification data across multiple browser tabs. While the standardization of data across multiple browser tabs or windows is described herein in the context of synchronizing notification data, the system and methods for synchronization of data can be applied to various other information that needs to be synchronized across multiple browser tabs and windows. - The one or more
notification client modules 902 a-902 n are configured for communication withnotification server 103, arespective synchronization module 1304 a-1304 n and the sharedsynchronization storage 1306. - The one or
more synchronization modules 1304 a-1304 n are also operable as part of theweb browser 150. The one ormore synchronization modules 1304 a-1304 n are software and routines for synchronizing notification information across multiple tabs 1302 a-1302 n orweb browsers 150 a-150 n. In some implementations, the synchronization modules are implemented using JavaScript that stores notification information into HTML5 local storage. The operation of thesynchronization modules 1304 a-1304 n is described in more detail below with reference toFIGS. 16 and 17 . Eachsynchronization module 1304 operates in conjunction with its respectivenotification client module 902 to retrieve information related to notifications. In response to receipt of information from thenotification server 103, thesynchronization module 1304 causes that notification information to be stored in the sharedsynchronization storage 1306. Before requesting information from thenotification server 103, thesynchronization module 1304 determines whether the information is available in the sharedsynchronization storage 1306; and if so, retrieves the information from the sharedsynchronization storage 1306. If the information is not in the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 thesynchronization module 1304 cooperates with thenotification client module 902 to request information from thenotification server 103. Thesynchronization module 1304 is coupled for communication with the correspondingcommunication client module 902, tab 1302, and sharedsynchronization storage 1306. - The shared
synchronization storage 1306 can be data storage for storing information from thenotification server 103, thesynchronization modules 1304, and thenotification client modules 902. In some implementations, the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 is HTML5 local storage. In some implementations, the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 is a series of cookies that are sent with requests back to thenotification server 103. In some implementations, the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 is operable across different types ofweb browsers 150. The sharedsynchronization storage 1306 may be a temp file in Adobe Flash format or similar storage. -
FIG. 14 shows a second implementation for thesystem 1400 in which theclient device 115 a has a plurality ofweb browser windows 150 a-150 n open. Each of theweb browser windows 150 a-150 n has at least one tab 1302 a-1302 n open. More specifically, the firstweb browser window 150 a has afirst tab 1302 a open. In accordance with the present disclosure, thefirst tab 1302 a has a firstnotification client module 902 a and a corresponding synchronization module 1304 a. The secondweb browser window 150 n has asecond tab 1302 n open, and thesecond tab 1302 n has a correspondingnotification client module 902 n and asynchronization module 1304 n. As with the prior implementation, theclient device 115 a includes sharedsynchronization storage 1306. While eachweb browser window 150 a-150 n has only a single tab 1302 a-1302 n open, eachweb browser window 150 a-150 n can have any number of tabs 1302 a-1302 n open. Furthermore, while there are only twoweb browser windows 150 a-150 n shown, theclient device 115a could have any number of web browser windows open. Regardless of the number of tabs 1302 a-1302 n orweb browser windows 150 a-150 n, they share the sharedsynchronization storage 1306.FIG. 14 is provided to illustrate how present disclosure allows information to be shared acrossmultiple web browsers 150, multiple tabs 1302 or between any combination of tabs 1302 andweb browsers 150. - Referring now to
FIG. 15 , some implementations of theclient device 115 a including thesystems multiple web browsers 150 or multiple tabs 1302 is described. This implementation of theclient device 115 a includes theprocessor 235, thememory 237, thestorage 239, thenetwork interface module 233 and theweb browser 150. Theweb browser 150 further includes thenotification client module 902 and thesynchronization module 1304. Theclient device 115 a also includes the sharedsynchronization storage 1306. While the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 is shown as a separate component inFIG. 15 , in some implementations the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 could be a dedicated portion ofmemory 237 or a dedicated portion ofstorage 239. These components are coupled for communication with each other and thenetwork 105 by thebus 220. Theprocessor 235, thememory 237, thestorage 239, thenetwork interface module 233, theweb browser 150, thenotification client module 902, thesynchronization module 1304 and the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 have been described above so that description will not be repeated here. - Referring now to
FIG. 16 , amethod 1600 for initializing the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 according to some implementations will be described. Themethod 1600 can include opening 1602 a browser window including at least one tab 1302. Once browser window is open, thenotification client module 902 corresponding to the tab 1302 can send 1604 a request to thenotification server 103 for the number of unread notifications for this user. The request can be processed by thenotification server 103 which responds to thenotification client module 902 with a number representing the number of notifications for the user. Thesynchronization module 1304 cooperates with thenotification client module 902 and processes communications between thenotification client module 902 and thenotification server 103. Any notification information is detected by thesynchronization module 1304, and can be processed by storing 1606 it in the sharedsynchronization storage 1306. In some implementations, thesynchronization module 1304 also assigns and stores a time stamp of when the notification information was received from thenotification server 103. Themethod 1600 can include providing or updating 1608 the user interface so that thenotification button 406 can show the number of unread notifications there are for the user. It should be noted that the present disclosure is particularly advantageous because the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 stores data segregated by user. Thus, even if two users are using thesame client device 115 a, the notification information for each user will not be shared between them. - Referring now to
FIG. 17 , amethod 1700 for synchronizing data across multiple browser tabs or windows according to some implementations will be described. Themethod 1700 can include determining 1702 whether a preset time has elapsed. In some implementations, the preset time ranges from 5 to 180 seconds. This effectively says the rate at which thesynchronization module 1304 polls the sharedsynchronization storage 1306 or thenotification server 103 for notification information updates. If the preset time has not elapsed, themethod 1700 can loop back andre-performs step 1702. On the other hand, if the predetermined amount of time has elapsed, themethod 1700 can continue by retrieving 1704 the number of notifications and the timestamp from the sharedsynchronization storage 1306. Themethod 1700 can include determining 1706 whether the timestamp was recently updated. In some implementations, the timestamp is considered recently updated if less than 30 seconds have elapsed since the timestamp. If the timestamp is recently updated, themethod 1700 does not contact thenotification server 103 and instead just updates 1708 displays of the notification information from the sharedsynchronization storage 1306. In particular, the display is updated with information retrieved instep 1704. This advantageously ensures that only one tab 1302 polls thenotification server 103 and there are not multiple tabs 1302 attempting to poll thenotification server 103 for information. If instep 1706, the timestamp was not recently updated, themethod 1700 can include requesting 1604 the number of unread messages from thenotification server 103. For example, thesynchronization module 1304 cooperates with thenotification client module 902 to request information from thenotification server 103. The information is then received bynotification client module 902. Thesynchronization module 1304 can store 1606 the received number of unread notifications and the time and a timestamp in the sharedsynchronization storage 1306. Thenotification client module 902 can then update 1608 thenotification button 406 with the information received from thenotification server 103. Afterstep 1608, themethod 1700 returns to 1702 and loops until a predetermined amount of time has elapsed. Some of the steps discussed above can be performed in different order than that shown inFIG. 17 . - Systems and methods for generating and presenting notifications, processing cursor movements for predictive fetching, and synchronizing data across multiple browser tabs or windows have been described above. In the preceding description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosure.
