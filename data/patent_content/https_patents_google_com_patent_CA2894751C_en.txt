Description
MANAGING AUDIO AT THE TAB LEVEL FOR
USER NOTIFICATION AND CONTROL
[0ow]
TECHNICAL FIELD
USER NOTIFICATION AND CONTROL
[0ow]
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] This description relates to multimedia, and more specifically to controlling an audio and/or visual signal within an application.
BACKGROUND
BACKGROUND
[0003] In many applications several documents can be displayed at once in a graphical user interface (GUI). In the area of GUIs, a tabbed document interface (TDI) or multiple document interface (MDI) allows multiple documents to be contained within a single window. Often tabs can be used as containers to provide different content (e.g., documents, webpages, etc.) to a user within a single window of an application, and to allow the user to easily switch between viewing and interacting with the different content in the different tabs. TDI's and MDI's are interface styles most commonly included with web browsers, web applications, text editors and preference panes.
[0004] Generally, laptops that include a camera provide some indication when that camera is being used. For example, frequently a light or light-emitting diode (LED) is coupled or placed next to the camera. This light is often turned on when the camera is turned on to indicate to a user that the camera is recording or taking Date Recue/Date Received 2020-07-10 pictures. However, there is generally no similar indication when a computer's microphone is recording. Further, not all cameras include a similar indication feature.
[0005] Many modern web pages allow a user to make use of a connected camera or microphone to record audio/visual information. In modern web browsers, a web page is often displayed and controlled within a tab. Users generally interact with a web browser using one web page at a time, but often leave several tabs open simultaneously in order to quickly switch between pages. When a user interacts with only one tab at a time, while other tabs execute in the background, a user may forget or not be aware that the contents of a background tab is making use of an input device (e.g., camera, microphone, etc.).

[0036] In various embodiments, one or more tabs 112 open in the tabbed application 102 may cause an audio signal to be recorded. For example, as explained above, in a specific example, the tabbed application 102 may include a web browser that may open a plurality of tabs, one or more of which may cause audio and/or video content to be recorded from the environment of the computer 101 (e.g., a video conference, a picture, a chat session, etc.). The audio and/or video content recorded for each respective tab may cause audio signals to be recoded, gathered, or generated via the microphone 106. In various embodiments, the techniques disclosed herein may be configured to provide a user 190 with a fine granularity of control of the content in the various tabs, which are responsible for the audio signal(s).
[0037] In various embodiments, the audio controller 114 may be configured to determine which tab or tabs 112 of the tabbed application 102 contain the content that causes the audio signal(s) to be generated or which respective audio signal is being generated for which tab 112. In various embodiments, this task may be performed by the global audio manager 104, in which case, the global audio manager may first determine which application (e.g., tabbed application 102 or other audio consumers 108, etc.) caused the audio signal to be generated or consumer or receive the audio signal.
[0038] The determination of the tab(s) included with the audio signal(s) may be performed in various ways. For example, in the case of a tab 112 that includes an audio element (e.g., the HTML Input tag or Capture field, etc.) the renderer 110 may identify the tab 112 as being a consumer of the audio signal. In another embodiment, the audio signal may be indirectly associated by the tab 112. In various embodiments, the audio signal may be consumed by a plug-in (e.g., plug-ins 120 and 122).
[0039] In this context, a "plug-in" is generally a component that adds specific capabilities (e.g., the ability to play a certain filetype, the ability to communicate in a secure fashion, etc.) to a larger application 102. In various embodiments, a plug-in may not be capable of being executed without the assistance of the larger application 102. Generally, there are two types of plug-ins, a per tab plug-in 120 and a global plug-in 122, although it is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0040] A per tab plug-in 120 may include a plug-in configured to be instantiated a single time per tab 112 or per element on the tab 112. For example, if the renderer 110 detects that the tab 112 includes an element included with the per tab plug-in 120, the renderer 110 may invoke or cause a version of the per tab plug-in 120 to be instantiated or executed to handle or process the associated element. If multiple tabs 112 include elements included with the plug-in 120, multiple instantiations of the plug-in 120 may occur. In such an embodiment, the audio controller 114 may easily determine if a per tab plug-in is the source or included with an audio signal.
[0041] In various embodiments, the elements included by or included with a tab 112 may include HTML tags, Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements, GUI
elements (e.g., buttons, fields, panes, etc.), embedded objects (e.g., Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects, Component Object Model (COM) objects, etc.), etc., although it is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
elements (e.g., buttons, fields, panes, etc.), embedded objects (e.g., Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects, Component Object Model (COM) objects, etc.), etc., although it is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0042] In the case of a global plug-in 122, the global plug-in 122 may be instantiated or executed once per computer 101 or application 102. In such an embodiment, a single version of the global plug-in 122 may process or handle a number of elements or tabs 112 comprising elements included with the global plug-in 122. In various embodiments, the global plug-in 122 may handle or process elements regardless of which application (e.g., application 102 or other audio consumers 108) consumes or is included with the element. In such an embodiment, it may be very difficult for the audio controller 114 to determine on its own which tab 112 or application 102 or 108 is associated with an audio signal.
[0043] In one embodiment, the audio controller 114 may query the global plug-in 122 to determine which application (e.g., application 102 or 108) is included or associated with an audio signal. In another embodiment, the audio mixer 130 or global audio manager 104 may query the global plug-in 122 to determine the application or tab included with the audio signal. In such an embodiment, if the audio signal is included with an application 102 that supports fine grain audio control, the global audio manager 104 may inform the application's 102 audio controller 114 of the results and tab's 112 association with the audio signal.
[0044] In yet another embodiment, the global plug-in 122 may proactively inform either the global audio manager 104 or the application's 102 audio controller 114 that the global plug-in 122 is generating or included with an audio signal and which tab 112 and/or element is included with that audio signal. In various embodiments, the global plug-in 122 may inform the global audio manager 104 or the application's 102 audio controller 114 of a list of commands or other operations (e.g., record, pause, mute, stop, resume, etc.) which may be performed upon the audio signal.
[0045] A number of possible message formats and messaging fields may be used or employed to communicate between the global plug-in 122 and the global audio manager 104 or audio controller 114. In various embodiments, a message may include an audio signal identifier to indicate which of a plurality of audio signals is the subject of the message. In another embodiment, the message may include a plug-in identifier configured to indicate that plug-in associated with the recorded audio signal. In yet another embodiment, the message may include a tab identifier configured to indicate that tab associated with the recorded audio signal. It is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0046] Once the tab(s) 112 included with an audio signal has been determined (e.g., by the audio controller 114 or the global audio manager 104), the audio controller 114 may determine if the tab 112 is allowed or permitted to record the audio signal. In one embodiment, the audio controller 114 may cause the audio user interface (UI) generator 116 to generate or display a UI element (e.g., a modal dialog box, a notification message, etc.) asking the user 190 if they wish to allow the recording to take place. If the user 190 grants permission to record the audio signal, the audio controller 114 may allow the recording and the audio UI generator 116 may provide the Ul indication, as described below. If the user 190 does not give their permission, the audio controller 114 may block or prevent the recording of the audio signal. In some embodiments, this may include turning the microphone 106 off.
In another embodiment, this may include instructing the audio mixer 130 or other portion of the global audio manager 104 to mute or not provide to the tab 112 or the tabbed application (in some embodiments) the audio signal produced by the microphone 106. It is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
In another embodiment, this may include instructing the audio mixer 130 or other portion of the global audio manager 104 to mute or not provide to the tab 112 or the tabbed application (in some embodiments) the audio signal produced by the microphone 106. It is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0047] In some embodiments, the audio controller 114 may be configured to store or access a list of permissions 115. In various embodiments, these permissions may include permissions previously granted/denied by the user 190, one or more default permissions (e.g., based upon a communications protocol, such as, for example, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), based on an address or uniform resource locator (URL) of a web page associated with the tab 112, based on a third party report of the trustworthiness of the web page associated with the tab 112, etc.), one or more rules, etc. In some embodiments, these permissions 115 may be stored temporarily (e.g., for a single execution of the tabbed application 102, the time the tab 112 is open or exists, etc.), permanently, or a combination thereof. In various embodiments, each recording device 106 (e.g., built-in microphone, built-in camera, Bluetooth headset, etc.) may be associated with a permission. In such an embodiment, the user 190 may have allowed or granted recording via the built-in microphone and camera, but not a Bluetooth microphone. In another embodiment, the permission may be valid across all devices capable of or configured to record a certain type of sensory input (e.g., all microphones, all cameras, etc.) It is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0048] In a preferred embodiment, if the web page associated with the tab does not make use of a secure or encrypted communications protocol (e.g., HTTP
as opposed to IITTP Secure (IITTPS), etc.) a permission granted may not be stored beyond the existence of the tab 112 within the tabbed application 102. In such an embodiment, if the user 190 grants permission for a tab 112 to record an audio signal, then closes the tab 112, and then opens the web page that was previously associated with the tab 112, the audio controller 114 will ask the user 190 a second time for permission to the record the audio signal.
as opposed to IITTP Secure (IITTPS), etc.) a permission granted may not be stored beyond the existence of the tab 112 within the tabbed application 102. In such an embodiment, if the user 190 grants permission for a tab 112 to record an audio signal, then closes the tab 112, and then opens the web page that was previously associated with the tab 112, the audio controller 114 will ask the user 190 a second time for permission to the record the audio signal.
[0049] Conversely, in a preferred embodiment, if the tab 112 does make use of a secure or encrypted communications protocol, the user 190's granting or denying of the ability to record the audio signal may be stored within the permissions 115 and may be used the next time the user 190 accesses the web page associated with the tab 112. In such an embodiment, if the user 190 grants or denies permission for a tab 112 to record an audio signal, then closes the tab 112, and then opens the web page that was previously associated with the tab 112, the audio controller 114 will not ask the user 190 a second time for permission to the record the audio signal. It is understood that the above is merely one illustrative example to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0050] In various embodiments, the audio controller 114 and/or the audio Ul generator 116 may be configured to provide a UI interface via which a user 190 may modify their permission selection. In such an embodiment, the user 190 may revoke or authorize a web page to record the audio signal (or other signal, e.g., video, etc.).
In some embodiments, such a UI interface may allow the user 190 to establish one or more rules based upon a variety of criteria, such as those discussed above.
In some embodiments, such a UI interface may allow the user 190 to establish one or more rules based upon a variety of criteria, such as those discussed above.
[0051] In various embodiments, the computer 101 or even the tabbed application 102 may be used by a plurality of users 190. In such an embodiment, the permissions 115 may each be associated with individual users or users identifiers (e.g., usernames, email addresses, etc.). In such an embodiment, a first user 190 may grant permission for a tab to record the audio signal and a second may deny permission to record the audio signal. The audio controller 114 may allow or deny permission based upon the user associated with eh particular tab 112 at the given time of recording. In various embodiments, another set of permissions 115 may be associated with the event in which no particular user is logged in or discernible. In some embodiments, the set of permissions 115 may be transmitted to or received from a central storage device (not shown). In such an embodiment, the permissions 115 for each user 190 may be synchronized between a plurality of computing devices 101. It is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0052] In some embodiments, once the tab(s) 112 included with an audio signal has been granted permission to record the audio signal, the audio user interface (UI) generator 116 may create a graphical UI (GUI) from which the user 190 may manipulate the audio signal or the audio signal's processing by the computer 101.
The audio UI generator 116 may be configured to provide the GUI in the context of a handle of the tab 112, where a "tab" can be the container of all the content of the webpage and a "handle of a tab" can be a UI element that is included with the tab but displays none of the content, or less than the full content, of the tab.
The audio UI generator 116 may be configured to provide the GUI in the context of a handle of the tab 112, where a "tab" can be the container of all the content of the webpage and a "handle of a tab" can be a UI element that is included with the tab but displays none of the content, or less than the full content, of the tab.
[0053] A "handle of a tab" or a "tab handle" may include a GUI element configured to facilitate the selection of a tab (e.g., to bring the tab into "focus," as described in more detail in the context of FIG. 2), or to move the position of a tab's content within a GUI displayed to a user. For example, a tab handle may be selected through the action of a mouse and dragged to move the content included with the tab to a new location on a display screen.
[0054] Additionally, by creating the graphical UI (GUI) from which the user 190 may manipulate the audio signal or the audio signal's processing and by providing a tab handle to include the UI, the tab handle may facilitate the control of the gathering or recording audio/visual content within the tab. Thus, a tag handle may include GUI elements that provide information about the audio content or status of a tab (e.g., that indicate whether content of the tab is currently responsible for recording an audio signal via the microphone 106) and may provide selectable control elements with which a user may control audio content within the tab (e.g., that may allow a user to mute/unmute or control the volume of the recorded audio signal of the tab, stop recording from the microphone 106, etc.). Thus, tag handles provide a quick way through which a user can understand which one(s) of many tabs that may be open is/are responsible for recording audio/video signals, without the user having to review the content of each open tab to understand this or may simply make the user aware that the tabbed application 102 is still recording an audio/video signal.
Furthermore, the tag handles allow the user to adjust (e.g., mute, unmute, pause, etc.) an audio signal recorded by content of a tab when many tags are open, without the user having to review the content of each open tab to make such adjustments.
Furthermore, the tag handles allow the user to adjust (e.g., mute, unmute, pause, etc.) an audio signal recorded by content of a tab when many tags are open, without the user having to review the content of each open tab to make such adjustments.
[0055] While many types of tab handles may exist and are contemplated within the scope of the disclosed subject matter, three types are described in detail below, each in turn and in reference to their specific figures. A "label handle" 201 (seen in Figs. 2 & 3) is often a small rectangular GUI element protruding from the main rectangular element of the tab itself, and generally shows the label or title (e.g., filename, HTML page title, etc.) of the tab it is included with. A label handle is analogous to and often modeled after traditional card tabs inserted in paper files or card indexes. A "thumbnail handle" 406 (seen in Fig. 4) often includes a miniature picture or representation of the contents or a subset of the contents of a tab. In various embodiments, the thumbnail handle may be active or dynamic, in that the miniature picture may change as the contents of the tab change (e.g., as a video is played or recorded, etc.). Although, it is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0056] As described above, the audio UI generator 116 may be configured to provide the GUI in a way that is included with a handle of the tab 112 that include the audio consumer 113. In various embodiments, the audio Ul generator 116 may be configured to provide a GUI included with the tab handle that facilitates or allows a user 190 to manipulate the audio signal. In such an embodiment, the tab handle GUI
may generate commands, at a user's 190 request or user interaction (e.g., by selecting a button, shaking the device, etc.), that instruct the application 102 or global audio manager 104 to manipulate the audio signal. For example, a user 190 may command that the recorded audio be muted, increased in volume, decreased in volume, paused, that the application 102 or other audio controlling component (e.g., plug-in 120) stop or end the recording of the audio signal, etc., although it is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.

[0057] In various embodiments, the audio controller 114 may be configured to process or act upon the received audio command and manipulate the audio signal that is generated based on the contents of a tab. In some embodiments, if the command is one that may be performed by the audio mixer 130 (e.g., muting, input volume control, etc.) the command may be passed, in whole or in, part or essence, to the audio mixer 130; although the audio controller 114 may process the command internally to the application 102. In another embodiment, the command may be included with a plug-in (e.g., plug-ins 120 and 122). In which case, the audio controller 114 may pass the command, in whole, part or essence, to the respective plug-in for processing.
Likewise, in embodiments in which the global audio manager 104 is the controlling component, commands may be passed to the respective application's 102 audio controller 114, plug-ins 120 & 112, or handled internally by the audio mixer 130.
Likewise, in embodiments in which the global audio manager 104 is the controlling component, commands may be passed to the respective application's 102 audio controller 114, plug-ins 120 & 112, or handled internally by the audio mixer 130.
[0058] FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example embodiment of an application 200 in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In the illustrated embodiment, the application 200 may include a web browser, although it is understood that the above is merely one illustrative example to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
In various embodiments, the application 200 may include a plurality of tabs, such as tabs 202, 204, 206, and 208, where the tabs are used as containers to provide different content to a user within the a single window of the application 200.
In various embodiments, the application 200 may include a plurality of tabs, such as tabs 202, 204, 206, and 208, where the tabs are used as containers to provide different content to a user within the a single window of the application 200.
[0059] In one embodiment, shown in the top portion of FIG. 2, the tab 202 may be in the foreground or have focus, as illustrated by the tab's 202 label handle 201 being highlighted, such that content contained in tab 202 is displayed to a user.
In the computing context, a UI element is considered to "have focus" if the operating system or computer has selected or identified that UI element as the proper element to receive user input. The content of other tabs 204, 206, 208 are not in focus and therefore the content of tabs 204, 206, 208 is not displayed, and only the label handles of tabs 204, 206, and 208 are displayed.
In the computing context, a UI element is considered to "have focus" if the operating system or computer has selected or identified that UI element as the proper element to receive user input. The content of other tabs 204, 206, 208 are not in focus and therefore the content of tabs 204, 206, 208 is not displayed, and only the label handles of tabs 204, 206, and 208 are displayed.
[0060] In the bottom portion of Fig. 2 tab 206 is in focus, while tabs 202, 204, 208 are not in focus, and therefore the content of tabs 202, 204, and 208 is not displayed. Tab 206 may contain a number of content elements or portions of a document that include various elements. A first content element 210 may not include any audio recording or gathering elements, for example, documents, fill-able forms, pictures, etc., whereas a second element 212 may include an audio recording or gathering content element, for example, an HTML Input tag, an AdobeTM FlashTM
application, etc.
application, etc.
[0061] In various embodiments, this audio element 212 may rudely begin to record the audio (gathering the audio signal) automatically once the audio element 212 is loaded by the tab 206. In some embodiments, this may occur even if the tab 206 is in the background or does not have focus (e.g., if tab 202 has focus, etc.). This may be inconvenient or embarrassing for a user. Further, if the user was not aware that the tab 206 includes an audio element (e.g., a video chat, a teleconference, etc.), the user may not be sure which tab 204, 206, or 208 or even which application (if multiple applications are being executed) is associated with or included with the audio signal that is being recorded. Therefore, the user may find it difficult to quickly turn off, mute, or manipulate the recording of the audio signal.
[0062] In another embodiment, the user may initially be aware the audio element 212 is recording an audio signal (e.g., the user initialed a video conference, etc.), but the user may have then switched to another tab (e.g., tab 202). In such an embodiment, the user may have forgotten that the audio element 212 is still recording the audio signal. In some embodiments, this may occur even if the tab 206 is in the background or does not have focus (e.g., if tab 202 has focus, etc.). Again, this may be inconvenient or embarrassing for a user. Therefore, the user may find it useful or helpful for an UI element (e.g., that described in Figs. 3 and 4) to indicate that the tab element 212 is still recording of the audio signal.
[0063] FIG. 3 is a diagram of an example embodiment of a graphical user interface 300 in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. In the illustrated embodiment, the application 200 of FIG. 2 is shown with a GUI included with the label handle 306 of the tab 206, although it is understood that the illustrated is merely one illustrative example to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0064] In one embodiment, once it has been determined that the application 200 and that tab 206 are recording or are included with the audio signal (generated by element 212 of FIG. 2), a GUI for controlling or manipulating the audio signal may be included with the label handle 306 of tab 206. In the illustrated embodiment, the GUI
may be included with tab handle 306 even if the tab 206 is not in the foreground or given focus. In the illustrated embodiment, the tab 202 is highlighted to show that its content is currently in the foreground and given focus and that tab 206 is in the background and is not given focus. In such an embodiment, the user may manipulate the audio signal recorded by content of tab 206 without opening tab 306 and without causing the contents of tab 206 to be displayed or brought to the foreground.
may be included with tab handle 306 even if the tab 206 is not in the foreground or given focus. In the illustrated embodiment, the tab 202 is highlighted to show that its content is currently in the foreground and given focus and that tab 206 is in the background and is not given focus. In such an embodiment, the user may manipulate the audio signal recorded by content of tab 206 without opening tab 306 and without causing the contents of tab 206 to be displayed or brought to the foreground.
[0065] In one embodiment, the GUI included with label handle 306 may include a badge or icon 310 (e.g., a pulsating or blinking red circle, etc.) configured to indicate that the tab 206 is associated or included with a recorded audio signal. In various embodiments, if a plurality of tabs (e.g., tabs 206 and 208) are both recording audio signals, each tab may be included with its own audio manipulation GUI
and icon 310. In one embodiment, if the user selects or clicks on the icon or badge 310, the audio signal may be muted or unmated, in a toggling fashion. In such an embodiment, the icon 210 may be changed (e.g., to static red circle with a red "X"
over it, to two red parallel bars, etc.) to indicate the status of the audio signal. In another embodiment, a user may hover the mouse or cursor (not shown) over the icon 310 and use a scroll wheel or dynamically displayed slide-bar to control the recording volume level. Once again, the icon 310 may dynamically change (e.g., gaining or shedding audio wave bars, changing the diameter of the circle, etc.) to reflect any manipulation of the recorded audio signal. It is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.

It is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.
[0066] In another embodiment, the GUI included with the label handle 306 may include a menu 312. In various embodiments, if a user right-clicks or otherwise selects the label handle 306 in a predetermined fashion, a menu 312 may be displayed.
In some embodiments, the menu 312 may include a variety of audio manipulation commands (e.g., record, pause, etc.) that may be issued by the user to the application.
In such an embodiment, the selection of the GUI included with the label handle 306 to display menu 312 may not cause the tab 206 to have focus and may not cause the content of tab 206 to be brought to the foreground. Thus, the content of tab 202 may continue to be displayed to the user while menu 312 is also displayed. The menu may or may appear in association in association with the tab 206.
In some embodiments, the menu 312 may include a variety of audio manipulation commands (e.g., record, pause, etc.) that may be issued by the user to the application.
In such an embodiment, the selection of the GUI included with the label handle 306 to display menu 312 may not cause the tab 206 to have focus and may not cause the content of tab 206 to be brought to the foreground. Thus, the content of tab 202 may continue to be displayed to the user while menu 312 is also displayed. The menu may or may appear in association in association with the tab 206.
[0067] In various embodiments, the audio manipulation commands may vary by the type of audio consumer (e.g., HTML Input tag, HTML Container property, a FlashTM object, etc.). In such an embodiment, a plug-in may instruct the audio UT
generator which commands are supported for an audio consumer. For example, a plug-in may only support recording the audio signal at a default volume level (e.g., gain, if any, may be applied after recording the audio signal, etc.). In another example, a plug-in or the file played by the plug-in may support switching between microphones or devices that are configured to record or produce the audio signal etc.
In another embodiment, the commands related to volume control (e.g., muting, quieter, louder, etc.) may be universally supported and controlled by the audio controller or audio mixer, regardless of the plug-in support, while other commands are supported based upon the plug-in, as described above. It is understood that the above are merely a few illustrative examples to which the disclosed subject matter is not limited.

[0068] In a preferred embodiment, the GUI may also include a badge or icon 316 displayed within or alongside an address bar or omnibox. In various embodiments, the address bar or omnibox may be configured to display the URL
or address of a web page associated with the respective tab. In the illustrated embodiment, the icon 316 may indicate whether or not the user has previously granted or denied permission for the associated web page to record an audio (or other) signal.
In one such an embodiment, if the user has previously made no indication and the web page is not requesting to record an audio signal, the icon 316 may not be displayed.
In such an embodiment, the icon 316 may include not only the permission state (granted, denied, etc.) but the type of device or sensory input the permission concerns.
