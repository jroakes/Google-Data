Definitions
- the present invention concerns determining the number of unique users behind a single Internet protocol (IP) address (or a given set of IP addresses) for a specific period of time.
- IP Internet protocol
- the present invention concerns determining the number of unique users behind a single IP address (or a given set of IP addresses) using various techniques and building an IP address-user number database for storing and retrieving such data.
- a single user might also have multiple computers; each with its own IP address, or using a shared IP address, depending on the network configuration. This makes it hard to establish, conclusively, whether requests from multiple IP addresses are from a single user or multiple users.
- IP addresses An additional complication is that of shared IP addresses. Because the Internet is growing so rapidly, the finite number of available IP addresses is a bit problematic. This has led to dynamic IP addresses allocation (e.g., shared IP addresses that can be provisioned as needed by an Internet Service Provider (“ISP”)) as described in more detail below.
- ISP Internet Service Provider
- Many Internet users do not have a particular IP address assigned to their computer. Usually, when they log on to the Internet, the computer that they are using is assigned an IP address from a pool of available IP addresses by their ISP. When they log off, the assigned IP address becomes available and may then used by someone else. This means that an ISP, which only has a pool of a certain number of IP addresses, can service more subscribers than the number of IP addresses in its pool.
- Firewalls raise additional considerations when trying to estimate the number of users behind a given IP address. Often corporations, and even smaller businesses, individuals and families, will want to limit access to and from the Internet. Firewalls are useful (a) when trying to make the home or office network more secure, or (b) when there are a limited number of IP addresses at the home or the office.
- a firewall When a firewall is used, all of the computers behind the firewall are separated from the Internet by one computer (usually called a proxy server). All communications into or out of the network pass through the proxy server. If users behind a firewall access Web pages, they will all show up under the same IP address (i.e., the proxy server's IP address).
- Different machines behind a firewall can sometimes be distinguished by examining operating systems (OS) and browser information, monitor setting information, etc. For example, if there are two different Operating Systems showing up under the same IP address at about the same time, there are probably at least two different machines behind a firewall.
- OS operating systems
- monitor setting information etc. For example, if there are two different Operating Systems showing up under the same IP address at about the same time, there are probably at least two different machines behind a firewall.
- a Web cache is a store of the HTML pages, CSS files, images, etc., for Web pages that a user has visited. Subsequent visits to the same Webpage (within a certain time) will result in files being read from the Web cache rather than being downloaded again from the remote Web server. This makes the Web pages quicker to load and reduces the consumption of network and/or server resources since the Web browser will not request Web pages from a Web server every time a user revisits the Website. Consequently these accesses often won't appear in the server logs or statistics. Caching can occur at the Web browser or at the ISP level—users can control caching at a Web browser level (by changing the cache settings) but usually not at the ISP level. In addition, some ISPs (e.g.
- America Online for example
- AOL America Online
- proxy servers prevent a website from directly learning about the numbers of different users accessing the website due to both (1) obscuring or masking the source of the request, and (2) web caching.
- the number of users behind an IP address may be tracked using cookies. However this is not always feasible. For example, a user might have “disabled” cookies on their browser.
- estimates are useful for determining whether or not visits to a Web page from one or more IP addresses are from a single user, or from multiple users.
- estimates are useful for determining whether or not on-line advertisement selections from one or more IP addresses are from a single user or from multiple users.
- estimates are useful for determining whether or not server resources from one or more IP addresses are from a single user or from multiple users.
- the number of unique users might be a useful indicator of (a) how widespread the popularity of a Website, an advertisement, etc., is, (b) “stickiness” of a Website, (c) click fraud on an advertisement, etc.
- IP address-user number estimates may be determined by accepting IP address usage information associating various IP addresses with various client identifiers, and generating an estimate of a number of users for at least one of the IP addresses using the IP address usage information.
- the client identifiers include cookies. If so, the estimate of a number of users for at least one of the IP address might be generated, in part, by determining a number of cookies for the at least one IP address for a given period of time, and multiplying the first ratio by a second, predetermined, ratio of a number of users per cookie for the given time period.
- the client identifiers are user-agent parameters and/or browser parameters (e.g., screen setting information, time zone, history length, whether or not Java enabled, number of plug-ins, mime types, etc.). If so, the estimate of a number of users per IP address might be generated, in part, by determining a ratio of unique sets of user agent and/or browser parameters for an IP address.
- user-agent parameters and/or browser parameters e.g., screen setting information, time zone, history length, whether or not Java enabled, number of plug-ins, mime types, etc.

- FIG. 2 is a bubble diagram of exemplary operations that may be performed in a manner consistent with the present invention, as well as information that may be used and/or generated by such operations, shown below dashed line 200 , in the context of an environment such as that 100 of FIG. 1 .
- the system may include IP address-usage tracking operations 205 , cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 210 , non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 220 , and IP address-user number determination operations 230 .
- the IP address-usage tracking operations 205 may be used to generate network usage logs and information 215 .
- the network logs and information 215 may be made available to the cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 210 , as well as the non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 220 .
- the cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 210 may determine cookie-based IP address-user number estimates 225 .
- the non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 220 may determine non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimates 235 .
- the IP address-user number determination operations 230 may accept both cookie-based IP address-user number estimates 225 , as well as non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimates 235 , and use one or both of such estimates to determine a final IP address-user number estimate.
- the final IP address-user estimates may be stored in an IP address-user number estimates database 240 .
- the IP-usage tracking operations 205 are responsible for collecting miscellaneous network information such as cookies from users, IP addresses, usage logs, browser parameters, etc.
- Information 215 might include an index including entries, each entry mapping an IP address to one or more unique cookies (e.g., corresponding to applications or browsers that have accessed the Internet via the IP address), and perhaps a count number of unique cookies.
- information 215 may include an index including entries, each entry mapping an IP address to one or more unique user agent and browser parameter sets (e.g., corresponding to client devices that have accessed the Internet via the IP address).
- the cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 210 are responsible for determining an IP address-user number estimate. Specifically, operations 210 may use the network log information 215 in order to determine IP address-cookie associations. Next, using the determined IP-cookie associations, as well as predetermined cookie-user ratios (e.g., a number of cookies per user over different time periods determined through experimentation and studies), the cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 210 may be able to generate cookie-based IP address-user number estimates 225 .
- predetermined cookie-user ratios e.g., a number of cookies per user over different time periods determined through experimentation and studies
- the non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 220 are also responsible for determining an IP address-user number estimate. Specifically, it may use and analyze network log information 205 in order to determine user agent and browser parameter set to IP address associations. Using such sets of user agent and browser parameters, the non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimation operations 220 may generate non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimates 235 .
- the IP address-user number determination operations 230 are responsible for determining a final IP address-user number estimate.

The final IP address-user number estimates are saved at a database 240 for further use.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 300 for determining cookie-based IP address-user estimates in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- the method 300 may determine a number of IP-cookie and cookie-IP associations from usage logs over a time period. (Block 310 ) Subsequently, the method 300 may filter out cookies (e.g., newly created cookies and cookies with short lifetime (e.g., less than a day old)). (Block 320 ) Further, the method 300 may accept predetermined cookie-user ratios for the given time period. (Block 330 ) The method 300 may then determine IP address-user number associations using determined IP address-cookie number associations and accepted cookie-user ratios. (Block 340 ) Finally, the method 300 may perform cookie-IP address de-duplication where necessary. (Block 350 ).
- cookies e.g., newly created cookies and cookies with short lifetime (e.g., less than a day old)
- the method 300 may accept predetermined cookie-user ratios for the given
- the method 300 may start with network usage logs (e.g., Google log sources) to analyze IP addresses and associated cookies (e.g., Google PREF cookies) over a period of time. (As a result this would provide the IP address-cookie associations for google.com traffic).
- network usage logs e.g., Google log sources
- associated cookies e.g., Google PREF cookies
- the method 300 could track a single user appearing across a number of IP addresses. It 300 could also estimate the number of users behind a single IP address by looking at the number of cookies associated with an IP address.
- the following IP address and cookie permutations may be considered:
- the method 300 might filter out newly created cookies and cookies with short lifetime (e.g., less than one day old). These are most likely from browsers that do not accept cookies, or only accept session cookies. A lot of spam IP addresses fall into this category too. It may also be the case that users clear cookies in less than one day, or the requests come from first time users. In the later case, the cookie might be counted when it re-appears after more than one day.
- the method 300 may accept predetermined cookie-user ratios for a given time period.
- These cookie-user ratios may be determined experimentally. For example, to determine cookie-user ratios for a given time period, a property or a domain where each user is uniquely identifiable (e.g., using a user login and/or password at the domain) independently of the cookie may be analyzed. In this way, given the number of unique users visiting the domain, as well as the number of unique cookies observed by the domain, the number of cookies an average user uses over a period of time can be determined. Different cookie-user ratios might be determined for different domains and/or for different types of domains. The ratio is expected to increase as the time period increases. Naturally, the ratios might be determined in other ways, or obtained from third parties.
- the cookie-user ratio is probably higher for email users than for search users, since it is not uncommon for users to log in from different locations to check emails, and also since users might not check emails as frequently as they perform searches.
- the method 300 may perform cookie-IP de-duplication where necessary. Specifically, a user may have different IP addresses at different times (due to dynamic IP address assignment or the user moving between different locations) with a single cookie associated with multiple IP addresses. The method 300 should perform some de-duplication for these scenarios.
- the method 300 might generate an IP address-number of cookies pair log ⁇ IP i ⁇ #cookies ⁇ as well as a cookie-number of IP address pair log ⁇ cookie i ⁇ #IPs ⁇ .
- the method 300 may initiate the de-duplication process. For instance, assume that cookie A has five IP addresses. As a result the method 300 may generate a “revised” log as follows:
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 400 for determining non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimates in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- the method 400 may analyze network logs and get user agent and browser parameters.
- the method 400 may determine an estimated number of users behind IP addresses.
- the method 400 might check the browser header as an aid to further discriminate users behind IP addresses.
- Block 430
- the method 400 may analyze traffic from Web sites that do not cookie users. For example, when ad impressions are shown on Websites participating in the Google AdSense advertising network, “show ads” java script gathers values for the following parameters from the user browser:
- a browser “user agent” might be obtained from the log source.
- a “user agent” is the client application used with a particular network protocol; the phrase is most commonly used in reference to those which access the Web.
- Web user agents range from Web browsers to search engine crawlers (“spiders”), as well as mobile phones, screen readers and braille browsers used by people with disabilities.
- spiders search engine crawlers
- the method 400 may determine a good indication of how many users are behind a single IP address. Note that the order of browser parameters (e.g., in the browser header of an HTTP request) might also be used to distinguish different users.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method for determining IP address-user number estimates in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- the method 500 may accept both cookie-based and non-cookie-based IP address-user number estimates. (Block 510 ) Using these estimates, the method 500 may then determine a final IP address-user number estimate using the non-cookie-based estimates, and perhaps the cookie-based estimates. (Block 520 ) Further, the resulting IP address-user number estimate (Block 530 ) may be stored in the IP address-user number estimates database.
- the method 500 may need to reconcile estimates for IP addresses that appear in both analysis.
- the following are a set of rules/assumptions/heuristics that might be employed in order to determine a final estimated number of IP-user number associations.
- an IP address has a single cookie associated with it over a period of time, but has several combinations of user-agent and browser parameters, it might be assumed that it has multiple users behind it. The variation of user-agent and browser parameters is a good indication that the same cookie is copied over intentionally or accidentally. Thus, the non-cookie-based estimate might be used as the final estimate in such instances.
- IP address has several cookies associated with it over a period of time and is considered to have a single user behind it (based on cookie user ratio), and the same IP address has several combinations of user-agent and browser parameters, it might be assumed that there are multiple users behind it. Thus, the non-cookie-based estimate might be used as the final estimate in such instances.
- an IP address has many cookies associated with it over a period of time and is considered to have n users behind it, and the same IP address has many user-agent and browser parameter combinations and is considered to have m users behind it, to be conservative, it might be assumed that the smaller of the two estimates (MIN ⁇ m,n ⁇ ) is the number of users behind the IP address. Alternatively, it might be assumed that the average ((m+n)/2) is the number of users behind the IP address. Alternatively, some other combination of the two estimates might be used.

Abstract
Description
-
- (1) a single cookie and IP address only—this is most likely a single user behind the IP address (unless it is a shared computer);
- (2) a cookie appears multiple times with a mix of IP addresses—it may be a single user whose ISP assigns a new dynamic IP address each time the user connects to the Internet, or a user who moves between locations. If these IP addresses fall under a reasonably long (e.g., 16 bits or more) prefix, a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (“DHCP”) address pool may have been identified; and
- (3) a single IP address with multiple cookies—if the number of cookies are small (e.g., less than five) over a period of time, it could be an indication that a single user appears through different browsers or computers; it could also be an indication that a single user clears or resets cookies. If the number of cookies is large, this is most likely a proxy server's IP address. The number of users behind the proxy could be estimated on a daily basis, a weekly basis, a monthly basis, etc.
Themethod 300 may also perform traffic analysis on IP address-cookie associations, to find out the percentage of traffic represented by IP address segments with various cookie number and cookie age combinations. This would provide an indication of the volume of cookied traffic and allow themethod 300 to focus cookie analysis on high-volume traffic IP address segments.
As is evident, the five IP addresses that were associated with cookieA are now only associated with one fifth of cookieA in the revised log. The revised log may then be regenerated to form a final IP address-number of cookies log wherein the number of cookies in the revised regenerated log may be the sum of whole and fractional cookies.
