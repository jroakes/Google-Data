Detailed Description
Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to identifying new viewers for content of a content provider. Content providers typically select certain viewers that may be interested in the content of the content provider. Each viewer may contain a group of end users having one or more content sharing platforms that share interests. The content of the content provider may then be presented to the end user in the selected audience based on the probability p. A selection of a content provider may be considered successful if a large number of end users perform one or more specific actions while presenting the content of the content provider (e.g., selecting content, registering a category identified in/facilitated by content, downloading a mobile application identified in/facilitated by content, subscribing to a channel of the content provider, etc.). After making the initial selection, and after seeing its initial success, the content provider may decide to focus on a different set of viewers to increase the number of end users that may be interested in the content of the content provider. Selecting an appropriate group of viewers that may be interested in the content of a content provider may be difficult for the content provider.
Existing mechanisms that generate recommendations for content providers of targeted new viewers do not include an indication of an increase in the number of content-related user actions that would occur if a new viewer were added to the group of viewers being targeted. Instead, existing mechanisms simply show how many end users of a particular new audience have performed actions related to a particular content. If the content provider decides which new viewers are targeted based only on the number of end users in the viewers that have performed the content-related actions, the selection of that viewer may result in the presentation of the content to a large number of users that are not interested in the content, resulting in an inefficient use of processing resources and a lack of trust of the users in the content sharing platform.
Implementations of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by identifying new viewers for content of a content provider using a function that estimates a possible number of additional content-related user actions that would result if the new viewers were added to an existing viewer designated for receiving the content of the content provider. The estimation function uses data collected from presenting content to an existing viewer and information about potential new viewers to generate an estimated number of added content-related user actions. The subset of best new viewers is then presented to the content provider. To generate the best estimate, data from past content presentations from existing viewers may be used offline to evaluate and improve the accuracy of the estimation function.
In some implementations, a user interface is provided with an option to view a new viewer to be added to a user currently designated for receiving content of a content provider for display to the content provider. Upon receiving a user selection of an option to view a new viewer to be added, information identifying the new viewer is displayed. For each new viewer, the information identifying the new viewer may include a viewer identifier, an indication of an estimated number of user actions related to the content of the content provider, and an option to request that the corresponding new viewer be added to the user currently designated for receiving the content of the content provider. If a user from a corresponding new viewer is added to the user currently designated for receiving content, the indication of the estimated number of user actions related to the content may be in the form of an estimated increase in the number of user actions related to the content. The option requesting the addition of the corresponding new viewer to the existing viewer may be in the form of a selectable User Interface (UI) element (e.g., button, link, etc.) presented in association with the identifier of the corresponding new viewer.
In reviewing the estimated increase in new viewers, the content provider may decide to add one or more new viewers to the existing viewers by selecting a UI element for each new viewer to be added. In response, each selected new viewer is added to the existing viewer designated to receive the content of the content provider by associating the identifier of each selected new viewer with the identifier of the content provider in the data store. For example, if the content is part of an advertising campaign for a content provider, the data store may include information defining the advertising campaign, such as an identifier of the advertising campaign, an identifier of the associated content (e.g., video advertisement, audio advertisement, etc.), an identifier of one or more target viewers, one or more parameters for presenting the content to the target viewers (e.g., timing of presenting advertisements with respect to the primary media item, browsable settings, etc.), one or more content-related actions that result in the conversion (user actions performed when presented with the content), and so forth. When a new viewer is selected by the content provider as described above, the information defining the advertising campaign in the data store is updated to include the identifier of the selected new viewer. The content sharing platform may then use this information to present the content of the content provider to the user from the selected new viewer (e.g., as auxiliary content associated with the primary media item).
In some implementations, the new viewer may be identified based on content-related metrics collected for existing viewers previously designated to receive content of the content provider. These content-related metrics may relate to the presentation of content of a content provider to users of an existing viewer (a first user group having shared interests) and user actions related to the content of the content provider through the first user group. The first user group may include some users (user sub-groups) that also have shared interests with another user group (second user group) that is not currently designated for receiving content of the content provider. For example, the first user group may include users on the automotive market, the second user group may include homeowners, and the user sub-group may include users on both the homeowner and the automotive market. The second user group is not currently designated for receiving content of the content provider.
The content-related metrics collected for the first user group may be used to determine content-related metrics for a subset of users belonging to both the first user group and the second user group. The content-related metrics determined for the subset of users may include, for example, a plurality of presentations of the content provider to the users of the subset, and a plurality of actions related to the content of the content provider by the users of the subset. The content-related metrics determined for the subset of users may also be used to estimate content-related metrics for a second group of users that have not been previously designated for receiving content of the content provider. Then, using the estimated content-related metrics of the second user group, an increase in the number of content-related user actions resulting from adding the second user group to the first user group is predicted using the estimation function. If the estimated increase exceeds a certain threshold, information identifying the second group of users and the estimated increase are provided for presentation to the content provider.
In some implementations, estimating the function includes one or more formulas that use several parameters and corresponding weights. The parameters may include a number of users in the second group that are not currently designated to receive content of the content provider, a number of presentations of the content to users in the second group, and a number of actions related to the content of the content provider by the users in the second group.
In some implementations, the estimation function may be optimized using an offline process that utilizes content-related metrics collected for existing viewers (e.g., viewer a and viewer B) that were previously designated to receive content of the content provider and have received the content in the past. Audience a may be selected as the base audience and its content correlation metrics may be applied to an estimation function to predict the content correlation metrics for audience B. The predicted content-related metrics of audience B are then compared to the collected content-related metrics of audience B to evaluate how accurately the estimation function predicts the content-related metrics of the audience. If the difference between the two sets of metrics is significant (e.g., tuning conditions are met), the weights of the estimation function are adjusted (modified) so that the estimation function generates an accurate prediction of the content-related metrics for viewer B. Alternatively, if the difference between the two sets of metrics is insignificant (e.g., the tuning condition is not satisfied), no adjustment of the weights of the estimation function is performed.
Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure provide a mechanism for content providers to simplify the viewer selection process by identifying possible new viewers for their content and presenting each identified new viewer with a predicted increase in the number of content-related user actions that would occur if the corresponding new viewer were also designated for receiving the content of the content provider. This prevents the content provider from guessing which additional viewers should also receive the content of the content provider in order to increase the number of desired user actions related to the content of the content provider. By preventing the content provider from guessing which additional viewers should receive the content, processing resources are not wasted in presenting the content to users of the content sharing platform that are not interested in the content, the user's trust and/or interest in the content sharing platform is improved, and the content is now provided to the appropriate user group. Furthermore, by optimizing the estimation function offline, improved accuracy is achieved in predicting an increase in the number of user actions related to the content of the content provider without consuming processing resources and network bandwidth for the estimation function optimization during live operation of the content sharing platform.
Fig. 1 illustrates an example system architecture 100 according to an implementation of the present disclosure. The system architecture 100 (also referred to herein as a "system") includes end user devices 102A-N, a data store 110, a content sharing platform 120, one or more server machines 130-140, content provider devices 152A-N, and a third party platform 165, each connected to a network 104.
In implementations, the network 104 may include a public network (e.g., the internet), a private network (e.g., a Local Area Network (LAN) or a Wide Area Network (WAN)), a wired network (e.g., an ethernet network), a wireless network (e.g., an 802.11 network or a Wi-Fi network), a cellular network (e.g., a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network), a router, a hub, a switch, a server computer, and/or combinations thereof.
The end user devices 102A-N and content provider devices 152A-N may each include computing devices such as Personal Computers (PCs), laptops, mobile phones, smart phones, tablet computers, netbook computers, network-connected televisions, and the like. In some implementations, the end-user devices 102A-N may also be referred to as "user devices" or "client devices. Each end user device may include a content viewer. In some implementations, the content viewer may be an application that provides a User Interface (UI) for a user to view or upload content (e.g., images, video items, web pages, documents, etc.). For example, the content viewer may be a web server capable of accessing, retrieving, presenting, and/or navigating content served by the web server (e.g., a web such as hypertext markup language (HTML) pages, digital media items, etc Pages). The content viewer may render, display, and/or present the content to the user. The content viewer may also include an embedded media player (e.g.,a player or HTML5 player). In another example, the content viewer may be a stand-alone application (e.g., a mobile application or app) that allows a user to view digital media items (e.g., digital video items, digital images, electronic books, etc.). In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, the content viewer may be a content sharing platform application that a user records, edits, and/or uploads content for sharing on the content sharing platform 120. In this way, the content viewer may be provided to the end user devices 102A-N by the content sharing platform 120. For example, the content viewer may be an embedded media player embedded in a web page provided by the content sharing platform 120.
The media items 121 may be consumed via the Internet or via a mobile device application (e.g., content viewers of the end user devices 102A-N). As previously described, a user of the content sharing platform 120 may request the requested media item 121 for presentation to the user. As used herein, "media," "media item," "online media item," "digital media item," "content," and "content item" may include electronic files that may be executed or loaded using software, firmware, or hardware configured to present the digital media item to an entity. In one implementation, the content sharing platform 120 may use the data store 110 to store media items 121. In another implementation, the content sharing platform 120 may use the data store 110 to store media items 121 or fingerprints as electronic files in one or more formats. The media item 121 may be provided to a user, wherein the providing of the media item 121 may include one or more of: allowing access to the media item 121, transmitting the media item 121, and/or rendering or permitting rendering of the media item 121.
In one implementation, the media item 121 is a video item. A video item is a set of consecutive video frames (e.g., image frames) representing a scene in motion. For example, a series of consecutive video frames may be captured consecutively or later reconstructed to produce an animation. Video items may be provided in a variety of formats including, but not limited to, analog, digital, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional video. Further, the video items may include movies, video clips, or any collection of animated images to be displayed sequentially. Further, the video item may be stored as a video file including a video component and an audio component. The video component may refer to video data in a video encoding format or an image encoding format (e.g., H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC), H.264MPEG-4 part 2, graphics Interchange Format (GIF), webP, etc.). The audio component may refer to audio data in an audio coding format (e.g., advanced Audio Coding (AAC), MP3, etc.). It may be noted that the GIF may be saved as an image file (e.g., GIF file) or as a series of images of an animated GIF (e.g., GIF89a format). It may be noted that h.264 may be a video coding format, for example, as a block-oriented motion compensation based video compression standard for recording, compression or distribution of video content.
In some implementations, the data store 110 is a persistent store that is capable of storing media items 121 as well as data structures that mark, organize, and index the media items 121. The data store 110 can be hosted by one or more storage devices (e.g., main memory, magnetic or optical storage-based disks, tape or hard drives, NAS, SAN, etc.). In some implementations, the data store 110 may be a network-connected file server, while in other embodiments the data store 110 may be some other type of persistent store, such as an object-oriented database, a relational database, or the like, that may be hosted by the content sharing platform 120 or one or more different machines coupled to the server content sharing platform 120 via the network 104.
In one implementation, the content sharing platform 120 or server machines 130-140 may be one or more computing devices (e.g., rack-mounted servers, router computers, server computers, personal computers, mainframe computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, desktop computers, etc.), data stores (e.g., hard disk, memory, database), networks, software components, and/or hardware components that may be used to provide a user with access to the media items 121 and/or to provide a user with the media items 121. For example, the content sharing platform 120 may allow a user to consume, upload, search, approve ("like"), disapprove ("dislike") the media item 121, or comment on the media item 121. The content sharing platform 120 may also include a website (e.g., a web page) or application backend software that may be used to provide the user with access to the media items 121.
In implementations of the present disclosure, a "user" may be represented as a single individual. However, other implementations of the present disclosure contemplate that a "user" is an entity controlled by a user and/or an automated source collection. For example, a collection of individual users that are joined into a community in a social network may be considered a "user. In another example, the automated consumer may be an automated ingest pipeline of the content sharing platform 120, such as a theme channel.
The content sharing platform 120 may include multiple channels (e.g., channels a through Z). A channel may include one or more media items 121 available from a common source or media items 121 having a common theme, topic or substance. The media item 121 may be digital content selected by a user, digital content available to the user, digital content uploaded by the user, digital content selected by a content provider, digital content selected by a broadcast device, and so forth. For example, channel X may include videos Y and Z. The channel may be associated with an owner, which is a user that may perform an action on the channel. Different campaigns may be associated with a channel based on actions by the owner, such as the owner making digital content available on the channel, the owner selecting (e.g., enjoying) digital content associated with another channel, the owner commenting on digital content associated with another channel, etc. The activity associated with the channel may be collected into an activity feed for the channel. In addition to the owners of the channels, users may subscribe to one or more channels of interest to them. The concept of "subscription" may also be referred to as "like", "follow", "friend-of", and so forth.
Third party platform(s) 165 may be used to provide video advertisements. Alternatively, the third party platform(s) 165 may provide other services. For example, the third party platform(s) 165 may be a video streaming service provider that generates media streaming services for users via a communication application for playing video, television programs, video clips, audio clips, and movies on the end-user devices 102A-N via the third party platform(s) 165.
In some implementations, the content provider may upload or otherwise provide the media items 121 to the content sharing platform 120 (e.g., via the third party platform 165) for presentation to one or more users. The content provider may identify the viewer to which the media item 121 is to be provided. Viewers can be defined by specifying interest categories that are shared by groups of users. The categories may correspond to one or more states (e.g., in the marketplace of automobiles, in green life, in romantic movies, in baseball, property ownership states, etc.) or attributes (e.g., profession, industry associated with profession, size of company that hires the user, etc.) of the user of the content sharing platform 120. If a user is associated with a state or attribute corresponding to a category, the user may belong to the corresponding category. If a user is associated with each state or each attribute corresponding to each category, the user may belong to multiple categories. For example, the content provider may indicate that the media item 121 should be provided to a user on the automotive market. In this way, the media item 121 may be provided to a user having a status in the automotive market. In another example, the content provider may indicate that the media item 121 should be provided to the agent. In this way, the media item 121 may be provided to a user having attributes that are agents. In another example, the content provider may indicate that the media item 121 should be provided to a user on the automobile market or as an agent. In this way, the media item 121 may be provided to a user having a status in the automotive market or as an attribute of an agent.
The user may be associated with a state or attribute corresponding to the respective category based on one or more weights associated with the user, wherein each of the one or more weights indicates a probability that the user belongs to the respective category. A user of the content sharing platform 120 may create a user profile and specify particular information (e.g., name, email address, occupation, etc.) in the user profile. The content sharing platform 120 may also include one or more weights in the user profile, each weight indicating a probability that the user belongs to a respective category. The user profile may also include historical data associated with the respective user. In some implementations, the historical data may include data provided by the user (e.g., data provided when the user created a user profile for the content sharing platform 120, data provided by the user in response to questions prompted by the content sharing platform 120, etc.). In other or similar implementations, the historical data may include data collected as a result of a user interacting with the content sharing platform 120. The historical data of the respective user may be used to determine one or more weights associated with the user.
After the content provider has indicated that the media item 121 should be presented to the viewer(s), content-related metrics may be collected as the end user is shown and interacts with the content. The content-related metrics may be stored in the data store 110. The content-related metrics may include, for example, information about when the media item 121 (content) was shown to the end user, the amount of time the end user viewed the media item 121, which viewers the end user belonged to, whether the end user performed any actions related to the content, what actions the end user performed, and so forth.
The server machine 140 may include a new audience identification subsystem 142. The new viewer identification subsystem 142 may include a user content related action estimator 146 and a new viewer GUI creator 144. In some implementations, the user content-related action estimator 146 can predict the number of additional user actions that will occur in relation to the content of the content provider if a new viewer is added to a viewer that has been designated to receive the content of the content provider. The user content-related action estimator 146 can use content-related metrics collected from viewers who have been designated for receiving content to make predictions about the effect of adding new viewers, as will be further discussed with reference to the example Venn diagram shown in fig. 4.
Referring to fig. 4, a content provider may initially designate two viewers (e.g., viewer B420 and viewer C430) to receive content. Content-related metrics may be collected when content is shown to end users in either audience B420 or audience C430. Metrics may include how many end users in audience B420 have been shown content (e.g., the number of impressions) and how many end users in audience B420 have performed actions related to the content (e.g., the number of transitions). Metrics may also include how many end users in audience C430 have been shown content (e.g., the number of impressions) and how many end users in audience C430 have performed actions related to the content (e.g., the number of transitions). The impression rate for the viewer B420 may be calculated based on the number of end users (impression number) in the viewer B420 that have shown the content, as compared to the total number of end users in the viewer B420. The conversion rate for the viewer B420 may be calculated based on the number of end users (the number of conversions) in the viewer B420 performing the action related to the content, as compared to the number of impressions of the viewer B420. For example, if viewer B420 contains 1000 end users and content is shown to 430 end users, the impression rate will be 43% (i.e., 430/1000). If 43 of the end users showing the content performed the content-related action, the conversion rate would be 10% (i.e., 43/430). The impression rate and conversion rate for viewer C430 may be calculated in a similar manner.
In one example, the user content related action estimator 146 may predict an increased number of user actions related to content of the content provider in response to the viewer a 410 being added to the viewer B420 and the viewer C430 when designated for receiving content. The user content related action estimator 146 has content related metrics associated with the end users currently designated for receiving content (i.e., end users in viewer B420 and end users in viewer C430). Because an end user may belong to more than one audience (e.g., be associated with more than one interest category), the user content related action estimator 146 may also have content related metrics associated with some end users in audience a 410. For example, the hatched area 440 shows the end user in either viewer B420 or viewer C430 (or both) and in viewer a 410. The user content-related action estimator 146 can estimate content-related metrics for end users in the hashed shadow area 415, the hashed shadow area 415 depicting end users not currently designated for receiving content (i.e., end users not in audience B420 and not in audience C430).
The user content related action estimator 146 may operate based on the following assumptions: the impression rate of the end user in hashed shadow area 415, the impression rate of the end user in online shadow area 440, the impression rate of the end user in audience B420, and the impression rate of the end user in audience C430 are all the same. Based on this assumption, the user content related action estimator 146 can estimate the number of impressions for end users in audience A410 by multiplying the impression rate of the end users in the line shaded area 440 by the total number of end users belonging to audience A410.
In another example, the user content related action estimator 146 may estimate the number of impressions for end users in audience a410 by calculating an average impression rate for end users in the line shadow area 440 using the impression rates for end users in audience B420 and the impression rates for end users in audience C430 and multiplying the average impression rate by the total number of end users in audience a 410.
The user content related action estimator 146 may also operate based on the following assumptions: the conversion rate of the end user in hashed shadow area 415 is the same as the conversion rate of the end user in online shadow area 440. In some implementations, user content-related action estimator 146 may calculate the conversion rate of end users in line shadow area 440 as an average of the conversion rate of end users in audience B420 and the conversion rate of end users in audience C430, and using these assumptions, user content-related action estimator 146 may estimate the number of increases in content-related end user actions (e.g., the number of increases in conversion) that occur in response to audience a410 being added to audience B420 and audience C430 when designated to receive content of a content provider. The increased number of content-related end user actions by the end users in audience a410 (e.g., the estimated number of transitions of audience a 410) may be equal to the transition rate of the line shaded area 440 times the estimated number of impressions of the end users in audience a410 calculated as described above. In some implementations, since the actions performed by the users in the linear shadow region 440 have been considered in calculating the conversion rates for the users in audience B420 and audience C430, the increased number of content-related end user actions by the end users in audience a410 (e.g., the estimated number of conversions of audience a 410) may be equal to the conversion rate of the linear shadow region 440 times the estimated number of impressions of the end users in the hashed shadow region 415 calculated as described above.
In some implementations, the user content related action estimator 146 may operate based on the following assumptions: the content-related metrics of the end users in hashed shadow area 415 are substantially different from the content-related metrics of the end users in line shadow area 440. In such an implementation, the trained machine learning model may be used to provide content-related metrics for end users in hashed shadow area 415 based on: the content-related metrics of the end users in audience B420 and the content-related metrics of the end users in audience C430 as well as the characteristics of the end users in audience B420, the characteristics of the end users in audience C430, and the characteristics of the end users in audience a 410. The machine learning model may be trained on historical content-related metrics and features collected for existing viewers that were previously designated to receive content from content providers and have received the content in the past.
In some implementations, the user content-related action estimator 146 uses weights to calculate estimated content-related metrics for end users in viewer a 410. Initially, weights may be assigned using default values and then tuned to improve results. For example, the user content related action estimator 146 may compare additional feature sets associated with end users in the hashed shadow region 415 to additional feature sets associated with end users in the linear shadow region 440. Based on how similar or different the additional feature sets are between the two end user groups, the user content related action estimator 146 may add multiple weights to the formula used to calculate the estimated content related metrics for the end users in viewer a 410. For example, if the difference between the additional feature sets is greater than a certain threshold (e.g., tuning conditions are met), the estimated number of impressions for the end users in viewer a 410 may be equal to the weight value times the impression rate of the end users in the line shadow area 440 and also times the total number of end users belonging to viewer a 410. The weight value may also be added to a formula for calculating an estimated number of transitions for end users in viewer a 410 based on the transition rate of the end users in the line shadow region 440. The weight values used in the formula to estimate the number of impressions of the end user in viewer a 410 may be different from the weight values used in the formula to estimate the number of transitions of the end user in viewer a 410.
In some implementations, the weight values used by the user content related action estimator 146 in the estimation formula may be tuned using the estimation function optimizer 132 of the server machine 130. In some implementations, the estimation function optimizer 132 may be part of the same server machine 140 that estimates user-related content actions. The estimation function optimizer 132 may use historical content related metrics collected for existing viewers that were previously designated to receive content from content providers and have received the content in the past to tune the weight values used by the user content related action estimator 146. For example, content-related action estimator 146 may use historical content-related metrics from viewer D and viewer E. Audience D may be selected as the primary audience and its content correlation metrics may be applied to an estimation function to predict the content correlation metrics for audience E. The predicted content-related metrics of viewer E are then compared to the collected content-related metrics of viewer E to evaluate how accurately the estimation function predicts the content-related metrics of the viewer. If the difference between the two sets of metrics is significant (e.g., tuning conditions are met), the weights of the estimation function are adjusted (modified) so that the estimation function generates an accurate prediction of the content-related metric for viewer E. Alternatively, if the difference between the two sets of metrics is insignificant (e.g., the tuning condition is not satisfied), no adjustment of the weights of the estimation function is performed. The estimation function optimizer 132 may run offline (e.g., as a back-end process that is performed independently and not in response to content provider interactions or requests) such that resources do not need to be expended on live operations of the content sharing platform.
In some implementations, the user content-related action estimator 146 can calculate an estimated increase in the number of user actions related to content of the content provider for a number of viewers that are not currently designated for receiving content of the content provider, regardless of whether the viewers overlap with existing viewers that have been or are currently being targeted with respect to the content provider. Alternatively, the user content-related action estimator 146 may only calculate an estimated increase in the number of content-related user actions for each viewer for which the content provider is not currently designated for receiving content, for which some content-related metrics have been collected as a result of a particular end user belonging to multiple viewers.
After computing the estimated increase associated with the new viewer, the user content related action estimator 146 may select a subset of the new viewer for recommendation to the content provider. For example, the user content related action estimator 146 may select the viewer with the highest predicted conversion rate. In another example, the user content related action estimator 146 may select the audience predicted to generate the most transitions. The user content related action estimator 146 may select all viewers whose predicted increase in conversion exceeds a threshold. In some implementations, the threshold may be selected by the content provider.
Once the subset of viewers recommended to the content provider is selected, information associated with each new viewer in the subset may be used by the new viewer GUI creator 144 to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to be presented to the content provider. The created GUI may include a representation of an identifier of the new viewer, an estimated increase in the number of end user actions associated with the content that would result if the new viewer were added to a viewer designated for receiving content of the content provider, and an option to add a corresponding viewer to a viewer currently designated for receiving content of the content provider. The content provider devices 152A-N may present the GUI 154 provided by the new viewer GUI creator 144. Example GUI 154 is discussed in more detail below with reference to fig. 2 and 3.
In addition to the above description, a user (end user or content provider) may be provided with controls that allow the user to make selections as to whether and when the systems, programs, or features described herein are able to collect user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions, content-related actions, or activities, professions, user preferences, or the user's current location) and send content or communications to the user from a server. In addition, some data may be processed in one or more ways to delete personal identity information before it is stored or used. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personal identity information of the user cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user may be summarized (e.g., city, zip code, or state level) with the location information obtained such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user can control what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.
FIG. 2 illustrates an example user interface that presents a content provider with a recommendation summary that adds a new viewer to be designated for receiving content of the content provider, in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. The user interface 200 may include at least a side menu 202, a recommendation options UI element (e.g., button) 204, an overall optimization score indicator 206, and a new viewer recommendation card 208. The user interface 200 may also include other recommendation cards and other UI components.
Upon user selection of the recommendation options button 204, the user interface 200 may present an interface with one or more recommendations to the content provider. The interface may include an overall optimization score indicator 206 and a new viewer recommendation card 208. The overall optimization score indicator 206 may indicate to content providers how close to optimal their content presentation configurations are. The overall optimization score indicator 206 may represent a percentage of optimization that is outside of 100%. The new viewer recommender 208 may contain text describing recommendations to the content provider. The new viewer recommender 208 may include a representation of the total estimated increase of the transition 210 that would be expected if all current new viewer recommendations were accepted by the content provider. The new viewer recommender 208 may include an indication of the increase in the overall optimization score 212 that would occur if all current new viewer recommendations were accepted by the content provider. The new viewer recommender 208 may include a view recommendation button 214. When selected, the view recommendation button 214 may trigger presentation from the example user interface 300 of fig. 3. The new viewer recommender 208 may include an apply all button 216. When selected, the apply all button 216 may trigger the new viewer identification subsystem 142 to add a viewer corresponding to the new viewer associated with each of the new viewer recommendations to the viewer designated to receive the content of the content provider.
FIG. 3 illustrates an example user interface providing details regarding a new viewer being recommended to add to an existing viewer designated for receiving content of a content provider, in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. The user interface 300 may include at least a side menu 302, a recommendation options UI element (e.g., button) 304, a reach new viewer profile card 306, and a new viewer recommendations table 318. The user interface 300 may also include other recommendation cards and other UI components.
Upon user selection of the view recommendation button 214, the user interface 300 may present an interface with one or more recommendations to the content provider. The interface may include reach new viewer profile card 306 and new viewer recommendations table 318. Reaching the new viewer profile card 306 may include an increased representation of the overall optimization score 212 that would occur if the content provider accepted all current new viewer recommendations. Reaching the new viewer profile card 306 may include a return recommendation button 310. When selected, the return recommendation button 310 may trigger the presentation of the example user interface 200. Reaching the new viewer profile card 306 may include a download button 312, a cancel all button 314, and an apply all button 316. The download button 312, when selected, may trigger the new viewer identification subsystem 142 to generate a digital file to be downloaded by the content provider. The digital file may include information related to new viewer recommendations. For example, the digital file may include some or all of the information in the new viewer recommendations table 318. The cancel all button 314, when selected, may trigger the new viewer identification subsystem 142 to remove the current new viewer recommendation from presentation to the content provider. The apply all button 316, when selected, may trigger the new viewer identification subsystem 142 to add a viewer corresponding to the new viewer associated with each of the new viewer recommendations to the viewer designated to receive the content of the content provider.
The user interface 300 may include a new viewer recommendation table 318. The new viewer recommendations table 318 may include one or more new viewer recommendation lines 320. The new viewer recommendation line 320 may include a recommendation check box 322, an ad group identifier 324, an campaign identifier 326, a viewer identifier 328, an indication of an estimated increase in the transition 330, an apply recommendation button 332, and a cancel recommendation button 334. The recommendation check box 322, when selected in one or more rows, may trigger an apply recommendation button 332 or a cancel recommendation button 334 to appear at the corresponding row. The apply recommendation button 332, when selected, may trigger the new viewer identification subsystem 142 to add a viewer corresponding to a new viewer associated with the new viewer recommendation to a viewer designated to receive content of the content provider. The cancel recommendation button 334, when selected, may trigger the new viewer identification subsystem 142 to remove the new viewer recommendation line 320 from presentation to the content provider.
Fig. 5 depicts a flowchart of an example method 500 for providing a content provider with a user interface containing new viewer recommendations, in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 6 depicts a flowchart of an example method 600 for determining new viewers recommended to a content provider, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 7 depicts a flowchart of an example method 700 for estimating a conversion rate of a user group that is not currently designated for receiving content of a content provider, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. Fig. 8 illustrates a flow chart of an example method 800 for optimizing an estimation function for predicting an increased number of user actions related to content of a content provider, in accordance with some aspects of the present disclosure. Methods 500, 600, 700, and 800 may be performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof. In one implementation, some or all of the operations of methods 500, 600, 700, and 800 may be performed by one or more components of system 100 of fig. 1.
Referring now to fig. 5, at block 510, processing logic may provide a user interface including an option to view a new viewer to be added to a plurality of users currently designated for receiving content of a content provider for display to the content provider. As described above, the user interface may be similar to user interface 200.
At block 520, processing logic may receive a user selection of an option to view a new viewer to be added to a plurality of users currently designated to receive content of a content provider. The user selection may be through interaction of the content provider with the user interface 200. For example, as described above, the user selection may include the content provider clicking on or selecting the view recommendation button 214.
At block 530, processing logic may cause display of information identifying new viewers, the information identifying the new viewers including, for each new viewer: a viewer identifier, an indication of an estimated number of user actions related to the content of the content provider, and an option requesting that a corresponding viewer be added to a plurality of users currently designated for receiving the content of the content provider. The display of information may be similar to user interface 300. For example, as described above, the viewer identifier, an indication of an estimated number of user actions related to the content of the content provider, and an option to request that the corresponding viewer be added to a plurality of users currently designated for receiving the content of the content provider may be the viewer identifier 328, an indication of an estimated increase in the transition 330, and the apply recommendation button 332, respectively.
At block 540, processing logic may receive a user selection of an option to request that a corresponding viewer be added to a plurality of users currently designated for receiving content of a content provider. The user selection may be through interaction of the content provider with the user interface 300. For example, as described above, the user selection may include the content provider clicking or selecting the application recommendation button 332.
At block 550, processing logic may add users from the corresponding viewer to a plurality of users currently designated for receiving content of the content provider.
As described above, fig. 6 depicts a flowchart of an example method 600 for determining new viewers recommended to a content provider in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. At block 610, processing logic may collect content-related metrics for a first group of users, the content-related metrics including a number of presentations of content to the first group and a number of content-related user actions through the first group. In an example, the first group of users may include end users in viewer B420 and viewer C430.
At block 620, processing logic may identify a subset of users in the first user group that belong to a second user group that is not currently designated for receiving content of the content provider. For example, the second user group that is not currently designated for receiving content of the content provider may be viewer A410, and the subset of users in the first user group may include end users in the line shaded area 440.
At block 630, processing logic may determine content-related metrics for the identified subset of users. The content-related metrics may include, for example, a number of impressions of the user subgroup, a number of transitions of the user subgroup, an impression rate of the user subgroup, a transition rate of the user subgroup, and the like. The content-related metrics of the subgroups may be determined according to the previously described implementations.
At block 640, processing logic may estimate content correlation metrics for the second user group based on the content correlation metrics for the identified subset of users. The content-related metrics for the second user group may include, for example, a number of impressions of the second user group, a number of transitions of the second user group, an impression rate of the second user group, a transition rate of the second user group, and so forth. In some implementations, the content-related metrics for the second group of users may be estimated according to method 700.
At block 650, processing logic may predict an increase in a number of user actions related to content of the content provider based on the estimated content related metrics of the second user group in response to adding the second user group to the first user group. For example, according to the previously described implementations, processing logic may add the viewer a 410 to the viewer B420 and the viewer C430 in response to content currently being designated for receiving the content provider to predict an increase in the number of user actions related to the content of the content provider.
At block 660, processing logic may provide information identifying the second user group and the estimated increase for presentation to the content provider in response to the estimated increase satisfying the threshold condition, as described above.
As described above, fig. 7 depicts a flowchart of an example method 700 for estimating a conversion rate of a user group that is not currently designated for receiving content of a content provider, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. At block 710, processing logic may determine a number of presentations of content of the content provider to a subset of users. At block 720, processing logic may determine a number of user actions related to content of the content provider by the subset of users. At block 730, processing logic may determine a conversion rate for the second user group based on the number of presentations of the content provider to the subset of users and the number of user actions related to the content of the content provider by the subset of users. As described above, in some implementations, processing logic may operate based on the following assumptions: the conversion rate for the second user group is the same as the conversion rate for the subgroup of users. Alternatively, processing logic may operate based on the following assumptions: the conversion rate for the second user group is substantially different from the conversion rate for the user subgroup, in which case a comparison of the additional characteristics of the trained machine learning model or group may be used to determine the conversion rate for the second user group, as described above.
As described above, fig. 8 illustrates a flow chart of an example method 800 for optimizing an estimation function for predicting an increased number of user actions related to content of a content provider, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. At block 810, processing logic may determine a content-related metric for the first group of users and a content-related metric for the third group of users. Both the first user group and the third user group may have been previously designated in the past for receiving content of the content provider and may have previously received the content. The content-related metrics for each group may include, for example, the number of presentations of the content provider's content to the group, the number of user actions related to the content provider's content through the group, the impression rate for the group, the conversion rate for the group, and so forth.
At block 820, processing logic may estimate content-related metrics for a third user group using the determined content-related metrics for the first user group and an estimation function. The estimation function may be the same function used to estimate the content-related metric in block 640.
At block 830, processing logic may modify a plurality of weights of the estimation function based on a comparison of the estimated content correlation metric for the third user group and the determined content correlation metric for the third user group. As described above, the plurality of weights of the estimation function may be modified to reduce the difference between the estimated content related metrics of the third user group and the determined content related metrics of the third user group.
Fig. 9 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system in accordance with an implementation of the present disclosure. Computer system 900 may be server machines 130-140, end user devices 102A-N, or content provider devices 152A-N of fig. 1. The machine may operate in the capacity of a server or an endpoint machine in an endpoint server network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment. The machine may be a television, a Personal Computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a network appliance, a server, a network router, switch or bridge, or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine. Furthermore, while only a single machine is illustrated, the term "machine" shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set (or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.
The example computer system 900 includes a processing device (processor) 902, a main memory 904 (e.g., read Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) such as Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM), etc.), a static memory 906 (e.g., flash memory, static Random Access Memory (SRAM), etc.), and a data storage device 916, which communicate with each other via a bus 630.
The processor (processing device) 902 represents one or more general-purpose processing devices, such as a microprocessor, central Processing Unit (CPU), or the like. More specifically, the processor 902 may be a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) microprocessor, a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor, a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) microprocessor, or a processor implementing other instruction sets or processors implementing a combination of instruction sets. The processor 902 may also be one or more special-purpose processing devices such as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), a network processor, or the like. The processor 902 includes processing logic 922 for performing the operations discussed herein (e.g., identifying a new viewer for content of a content provider and/or providing suggestions relating to the identified new viewer for presentation to the content provider).
Computer system 900 may also include a network interface device 908. Computer system 900 may also include a video display unit 910 (e.g., a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)), an input device 912 (e.g., a keyboard and an alphanumeric keyboard, a motion-sensing input device, a touch screen), a cursor control device 914 (e.g., a mouse), and a signal generation device 918 (e.g., a speaker).
The data storage device 916 may include a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium 924 (also a computer-readable storage medium) having stored thereon one or more sets of instructions 926 (e.g., identifying new viewers for content of a content provider and/or providing suggestions related to the identified new viewers for presentation to the content provider) embodying any one or more of the methods or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory 904 and/or within the processor 902 during execution thereof by the computer system 900, the main memory 904 and the processor 902 also constituting machine-readable storage media. The instructions may also be transmitted or received over a network 920 via the network interface device 908.
In one implementation, the instructions 926 include instructions for identifying a new viewer for the content of the content provider and/or providing suggestions related to the identified new viewer for presentation to the content provider. While the computer-readable storage medium 924 (machine-readable storage medium) is shown in an example implementation to be a single medium, the terms "computer-readable storage medium" and "machine-readable storage medium" should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions. The terms "computer-readable storage medium" and "machine-readable storage medium" should also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by a machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present disclosure. Accordingly, the terms "computer-readable storage medium" and "machine-readable storage medium" should be construed to include, but are not limited to, solid-state memories, optical media, and magnetic media.
Reference throughout this specification to "one implementation" or "an implementation" means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the implementation is included in at least one implementation. Thus, the appearances of the phrase "in one implementation" or "in an implementation" in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily referring to the same implementation, depending on the circumstances. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more implementations.
To the extent that the terms "includes," "including," "has," "contains," variants thereof, and other similar words are used in either the detailed description or the claims, these terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term "comprising" as an open transition word without precluding any additional or other elements.
As used in this disclosure, the terms "component," "module," "system," and the like are generally intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware (e.g., a circuit), software, a combination of hardware and software, or an entity related to an operating machine having one or more particular functions. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor (e.g., a digital signal processor), a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a controller and the controller can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. Furthermore, the "device" may be in the form of specially designed hardware; general purpose hardware specialized by executing software thereon that enables the hardware to perform specific functions (e.g., generate points of interest and/or descriptors); software on a computer readable medium; or a combination thereof.
The foregoing systems, circuits, modules, etc. have been described in terms of interactions between components and/or blocks. It is to be understood that such systems, circuits, components, blocks, etc. can include those components or specified sub-components, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components, and in accordance with various permutations and combinations of the above. Sub-components may also be implemented as components communicatively coupled with other components rather than included within parent components (hierarchical). In addition, it should be noted that one or more components may be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality or divided into several separate sub-components, and any one or more intermediate layers, such as a management layer, may be provided to communicatively couple to these sub-components to provide integrated functionality. Any of the components described herein may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described herein but known by those of skill in the art.
Furthermore, the word "example" or "exemplary" is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Rather, the use of "example" or "exemplary" terms is intended to present concepts in a concrete fashion. As used in this disclosure, the term "or" is intended to mean an inclusive "or" rather than an exclusive "or". That is, unless otherwise indicated, or clear from context, "X employs A or B" is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; x is B; or X employs both A and B, then "X employs A or B" holds true under any of the above examples. Furthermore, the articles "a" and "an" as used in this disclosure and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean "one or more" unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form.
Finally, implementations described herein include collection of data describing a user and/or user activity. In one implementation, such data is collected only when the user agrees to collect such data. In some implementations, the user is prompted to explicitly allow data collection. Further, the user may choose to join or leave participation in such data collection activities. In one implementation, the collected data is anonymized before any analysis is performed to obtain any statistical patterns, such that the identity of the user cannot be determined from the collected data.
