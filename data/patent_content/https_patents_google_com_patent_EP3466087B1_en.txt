Definitions
- An example of this is a content broadcast system.
- Conventional content broadcast systems typically relied on an "over the air" broadcast of content or a dedicated delivery system that requires specialized equipment (e.g., cable or satellite system) to broadcast content such as television and radio.
- specialized equipment e.g., cable or satellite system
- techniques have then been developed by the content broadcast systems to stream the content over a network.
- these conventional techniques rely on complicated and expensive hardware systems that are specialized by the content broadcast systems to do so. Accordingly, this complexity and expense limits availability of these hardware systems and functionality made available by these systems.
- US2012127363 proposes a method and system for capturing, storing, and streaming over the air broadcasts based on user requests.
- the system and method utilize subarrays of antenna elements for receiving over the air broadcasts.
- Processing pipelines are used to demodulate, transcode and index the content transmissions to produce content data that are streamed to users. In this way, the feeds from antennas can be accessed by users over a network connection.
- US2013276048 proposes systems and methods for processing a live video stream.
- An ingestion component receives segments of a live video stream in association with a request to process the live video stream.
- a control component generates an instruction graph for the live video stream based on predetermined criteria.
- the instruction graph defines a workflow for processing the live video stream, the workflow comprising a set of services for processing the segments.
- a transcoding component employs a subset of the services to process the segments based at least in part on the instruction graph and a distribution component then streams the segments to a device in response finishing process of the segments.
- US2012008719 proposes a digital broadcast reception apparatus that allows a stable viewing even if a reception environment changes along with a movement.
- a search-mode switching control section instructs a tuning control section to select a diversity operation mode if the current position is close to a boundary of a broadcast area, and select an independent reception operation mode if the current position is not close to the boundary of the broadcast area.
- a first system and a second system are tuned to the same physical channel, and cooperate with each other to demodulate a digital broadcast signal and a make an output through a diversity process.
- the independent reception operation mode the first system and the second system individually and independently demodulate the digital broadcast signal and make an output.
- a content distribution system as set out in claim 1.
- a method as set out in claim 9.
- Content capture and distribution systems are described in the following that are configured to capture "over the air” broadcasts of content and make this content available via a network, e.g., the internet.
- a content capture system is deployed at a geographic location to capture radio signals from a content broadcast system, e.g., using an antenna system.
- a signal conversion module is then employed by the content capture system to convert the radio signals into internet protocol (IP) data that has the content, such as in accordance with an MPEG transport stream.
- IP internet protocol
- This IP data (e.g., raw video feed) is then transmitted by the content capture system using a network transfer protocol (e.g., as full bit-rate "chunks" using a secure hypertext transfer protocol) for distribution by a content distribution system.
- a network transfer protocol e.g., as full bit-rate "chunks" using a secure hypertext transfer protocol
- the content distribution system then receives the content via the network transfer protocol and configures the content for distribution via a network streaming protocol, e.g., MPEG-DASH.
- Client devices such as mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers, smart televisions, and so forth may then receive and render a stream of the content for output to a user.
- the content distribution system along with the content capture system, may make this content available to a wide variety of devices.
- the content distribution system may be implemented in a variety of ways.
- the content distribution system is implemented "in the cloud" via a collection of computing devices (e.g., a plurality of server farms).
- This implementation enables a variety of operations to be performed external to, and remotely from, the content capture system, such as data processing, transcoding, distribution, and so on. Further benefits include a reduction in hardware required at the capture site, as well as a reduction in cost because the bulk of the computing can be performed more cheaply and reliably in the cloud, in comparison to conventional systems.
- the content distribution system may also include a variety of other functionality. In one example, this includes functionality to repair the content.
- the content capture systems for instance, as described above are implemented using relatively inexpensive hardware that costs a fraction of conventional dedicated hardware. Because of this, multiple content capture systems may be deployed in a cost effective manner to capture radio signals from a single content broadcast system, e.g., to capture matching content. Redundancy provided by the multiple content capture systems in the capture of data may be used to repair errors encountered in the capture of this content, support switching between content capture systems (e.g., due to outages), and so forth. Functionality of the content distribution system may also be distributed across a plurality of server farms, thereby protecting against failure. In this way, the content capture and distribution systems have increased robustness over conventional systems.
- the content distribution system is configured to control operation of the content capture systems remotely.
- a user accessing the content distribution system may interact with a user interface to control when content capture systems capture content, frequencies used by the content capture systems to capture the radio signals having the content, and so forth.
- a user may control operation of a multitude of content capture systems distributed across a variety of geographic locations.
- Other examples are also contemplated as further described in the following.
- Example procedures are then described which may be performed in the example environment as well as other environments. Consequently, performance of the example procedures is not limited to the example environment and the example environment is not limited to performance of the example procedures.
- FIG. 1 is an illustration of an environment 100 in an example implementation that is operable to employ techniques described herein.
- the illustrated environment 100 includes a content broadcast system 102, a content capture system 104, a content distribution system 106, and a plurality of client devices 108 that are configured to consume content received from the content distribution system 106 via a network 110, e.g., the internet.
- a network 110 e.g., the internet.
- the client devices 108 may be configured in a variety of ways.
- the client devices 108 may be configured as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile device (e.g., assuming a handheld configuration such as a tablet or mobile phone as illustrated), and so forth.
- the client devices 108 may range from full resource devices with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., personal computers, game consoles) to a low-resource device with limited memory and/or processing resources (e.g., mobile devices).
- the content broadcast system 102 is implemented using hardware (e.g., a transmitter and antenna) to transmit radio frequency signals 112 "over the air" that include content, such as television or radio content.
- the radio frequency signals 112 may carry the content as an analog signal or digital signal, e.g., numerically encoded form.
- the content capture system 104 is positioned at a geographic location 114 having a proximity to the content broadcast system 102 sufficient to receive the radio signals 112, e.g., within the same city.
- the content capture system 104 includes an antenna system 116 that is configured to receive the radio frequency signals 112 having the content.
- the content capture system 104 also includes a signal conversion module 118 that is representative of hardware configured to convert the content carried by radio frequency signals 112 into an Internet Protocol (IP) format, such as MPEG-TS.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the content capture system 104 then employs a network transmission module 120 to transmit the content using the IP format using a network transfer protocol, such as in accordance with a secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS).
- HTTPS secure hypertext transfer protocol
- the content capture system 104 may be configured as a "light" system for deployment at geographic locations at a fraction of the cost of conventional hardware systems, which implement signal and data processing hardware at the geographic locations. Further discussion of operation of the content capture system 104 is described in relation to FIG. 2 .
- the content distribution system 106 then receives the content in the IP format via the network 110, e.g., the internet.
- the content distribution system 108 includes a distribution management module 122 that is implemented at least partially in hardware to manage distribution of the content received by the content capture system 104 via the network 110 to the plurality of client devices 108.
- the distribution management module 112 may configure the content in accordance with a network streaming protocol such as MPEG-DASH.
- the plurality of client devices 108 may then receive the content via a stream in accordance with the network streaming protocol and render it for output to a user, e.g., via a browser, a dedicated application, and so forth. In this way, the content from the content broadcast system 102 may be disseminated for consumption across a wide range of client devices 108 as further described in relation to FIG. 3 .
- the content distribution system 106 also includes a capture management module 124.
- the capture management module 124 is representative of functionality implemented at least partially in hardware to manage operation of the content capture system 104. This may include scheduling of when and how (e.g., what frequencies and protocols) the content capture system 104 captures and converts the content via the radio frequency signals 112. Further discussion of management of the content captures system is described in the following in relation to FIG. 5 .
- FIG. 2 depicts a system 200 in an example implementation showing operation of the content capture system 104 of FIG. 1 in greater detail as capturing "over the air” content.
- the system 200 is illustrated using first, second, and third stages 202, 204, 206.
- the content capture system 104 employs an antenna system 116 to capture a broadcast of radio frequency signals 112 from a content broadcast system 102 "over the air.”
- the radio frequency signals 112 are used to carry the content 208 as an analog signal or a digital signal, i.e., in a numerically encoded form. As previously described, this may include a variety of types of content, such as television or radio content.
- a signal conversion module 118 of the content capture system 104 converts the content 208 as carried by the radio frequency signal 112 into an internet protocol format 210.
- a variety of internet protocol formats 210 may be used to store and transport the content 208 digitally, an example of which includes an MPEG transport stream (MPEG-TS).
- MPEG transport stream is a digital content format for transmission and storage of audio, video, or other data that specifies a container format to encapsulate packetized elementary streams.
- the signal conversion module 118 may be implemented in a variety of ways.
- the signal conversion module 118 is implemented as an RF to IP video processor as part of a rack-mounted system.
- the system includes a plurality of interchangeable components (e.g., circuit boards) that are configured to decode different formats of the content 208 as received via the radio frequency signal 112 that are employed by different content broadcast systems 102.
- the content capture system 104 may be deployed across a variety of geographic locations across the globe by providing a corresponding component that is configured to decode the broadcast.
- the signal conversion module 118 may assign a timestamp 212 to respective portions of the content, e.g., packets as part of a header.
- the timestamp 212 may be used to control an order of output and navigation within the content 208 when rendering, as well as for synchronization with other content captured by other content capture systems as further described in relation to FIG. 5 .
- a network transmission module 120 is employed to communicate the content 208 via a network 110 to a content distribution system 106. To do so, the network transmission module 120 configures the content 208 in the internet protocol format 210 according to a network transfer protocol 214, e.g., through use of a transmission server and a network deployment switch.
- a network transfer protocol 214 e.g., through use of a transmission server and a network deployment switch.
- a variety of different network transfer protocols 214 may be used, such as HTTPS.
- the network transmission module 120 may form a plurality of "chunks" of the content 208. These chunks are included as a payload 216 that is transferred over the network 110 as specified by the HTTPS protocol, e.g., supporting authentication and encryption to protect against potentially malicious parties.
- the content 208 included as the payload 216 is a full-bitrate version of the content 208 as converted by the signal conversion module 118 and thus preserves an output richness of the content 208 for receipt by the content distribution system 106.
- the content capture system 104 may be implemented using relatively inexpensive devices that cost a fraction of conventional proprietary systems, e.g., cost less than twenty percent of these conventional systems, which use data processing hardware at the capture site.
- the content capture system 104 is a "light" system in this example in that the system is responsible for capture and communication of the content 208 with minimal processing. Further processing of the content 208, such as packetizing or error correction, is then performed by the content distribution system 106 (e.g., "in the cloud") and thus can take advantage of efficiencies and robustness of server farms and large backend systems, an example of which is further described in the following.
- FIG. 3 depicts a system 300 in an example implementation showing operation of the content distribution system 106 to distribute content 208 received via the network 110 from the content capture system 104 of FIG. 2 .
- This system 300 is also illustrated using first, second, and third stages 302, 304, 306.
- the content distribution system 106 receives the content via a network transfer protocol 214 from the content capture system 104.
- the content 208 for instance, is a full bitrate version as captured by the content capture system 104 that is communicated via the internet using HTTPS.

- the distribution management module 112 is configured to automatically select a particular copy of a chunk of the content 208 based on a redundancy comparison between different copies of the chunk. The comparison may indicate that the particular copy of the chunk is healthier, e.g., has less data corruption, than another copy of the chunk. In this way, the healthiest copy of each chunk is used for streaming the content 208 to the client devices 108. Further, the comparison of chunks of the same content and the selection of the healthiest chunk can be performed automatically at the content distribution system and without user intervention.

- Implementation of the content distribution system 106 may also be distributed, e.g., across a plurality of server farms. For example, a first server farm may receive content 208(1) while another server farm receives content 208(N).

Description
- Users have access to an ever expanding variety of devices that may be used to consume content. For example, users have progressed from dedicated devices such as television and radio to mobile phones and tablet computers to consume content. To address this, content providers have also expanded the ways in which this content may be accessed.
- An example of this is a content broadcast system. Conventional content broadcast systems typically relied on an "over the air" broadcast of content or a dedicated delivery system that requires specialized equipment (e.g., cable or satellite system) to broadcast content such as television and radio. In order to make this content available to users of mobile phones and tablets, techniques have then been developed by the content broadcast systems to stream the content over a network. However, these conventional techniques rely on complicated and expensive hardware systems that are specialized by the content broadcast systems to do so. Accordingly, this complexity and expense limits availability of these hardware systems and functionality made available by these systems.
-
US2012127363 proposes a method and system for capturing, storing, and streaming over the air broadcasts based on user requests. The system and method utilize subarrays of antenna elements for receiving over the air broadcasts. Processing pipelines are used to demodulate, transcode and index the content transmissions to produce content data that are streamed to users. In this way, the feeds from antennas can be accessed by users over a network connection. -
US2013276048 proposes systems and methods for processing a live video stream. An ingestion component receives segments of a live video stream in association with a request to process the live video stream. A control component generates an instruction graph for the live video stream based on predetermined criteria. The instruction graph defines a workflow for processing the live video stream, the workflow comprising a set of services for processing the segments. A transcoding component employs a subset of the services to process the segments based at least in part on the instruction graph and a distribution component then streams the segments to a device in response finishing process of the segments. With the live video processing system, segments of a video stream are processed and distributed as they are received. Thus, segments of the video stream are processed and distributed prior to processing of the entire video stream. -
US2012008719 (A1 ) proposes a digital broadcast reception apparatus that allows a stable viewing even if a reception environment changes along with a movement. Based on current position information indicating a current position detected by a current position detection section and broadcast area information stored in a broadcast area information storage section, a search-mode switching control section instructs a tuning control section to select a diversity operation mode if the current position is close to a boundary of a broadcast area, and select an independent reception operation mode if the current position is not close to the boundary of the broadcast area. In the diversity operation mode, a first system and a second system are tuned to the same physical channel, and cooperate with each other to demodulate a digital broadcast signal and a make an output through a diversity process. In the independent reception operation mode, the first system and the second system individually and independently demodulate the digital broadcast signal and make an output. - According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a content distribution system as set out in
claim 1. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provide a method as set out in claim 9. - This Summary introduces a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. As such, this Summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

FIG. 6 is a flow diagram depicting a procedure in an example implementation in which over-the-air content is captured and distributed. -
FIG. 7 illustrates an example system including various components of an example device that can be implemented as any type of computing device as described and/or utilize with reference toFIGS. 1-6 to implement embodiments of the techniques described herein. - Conventional hardware systems relied upon by content broadcaster systems (e.g., television and radio broadcasters) to expand availability of content are complicated, expensive, and rely on specialized hardware. As such, this complexity and expense limits availability, use, and even operation of these conventional hardware systems.
- Content capture and distribution systems are described in the following that are configured to capture "over the air" broadcasts of content and make this content available via a network, e.g., the internet. As part of this, a content capture system is deployed at a geographic location to capture radio signals from a content broadcast system, e.g., using an antenna system.
- A signal conversion module is then employed by the content capture system to convert the radio signals into internet protocol (IP) data that has the content, such as in accordance with an MPEG transport stream. This IP data (e.g., raw video feed) is then transmitted by the content capture system using a network transfer protocol (e.g., as full bit-rate "chunks" using a secure hypertext transfer protocol) for distribution by a content distribution system. In this way, the content capture system may be implemented using relatively inexpensive hardware at the geographic location and provide the content in high quality without human interaction.
- The content distribution system then receives the content via the network transfer protocol and configures the content for distribution via a network streaming protocol, e.g., MPEG-DASH. Client devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers, smart televisions, and so forth may then receive and render a stream of the content for output to a user. As a result, the content distribution system, along with the content capture system, may make this content available to a wide variety of devices.
- The content distribution system may be implemented in a variety of ways. In one example, the content distribution system is implemented "in the cloud" via a collection of computing devices (e.g., a plurality of server farms). This implementation enables a variety of operations to be performed external to, and remotely from, the content capture system, such as data processing, transcoding, distribution, and so on. Further benefits include a reduction in hardware required at the capture site, as well as a reduction in cost because the bulk of the computing can be performed more cheaply and reliably in the cloud, in comparison to conventional systems.
- The content distribution system, along with functionality used to stream the content, may also include a variety of other functionality. In one example, this includes functionality to repair the content. The content capture systems, for instance, as described above are implemented using relatively inexpensive hardware that costs a fraction of conventional dedicated hardware. Because of this, multiple content capture systems may be deployed in a cost effective manner to capture radio signals from a single content broadcast system, e.g., to capture matching content. Redundancy provided by the multiple content capture systems in the capture of data may be used to repair errors encountered in the capture of this content, support switching between content capture systems (e.g., due to outages), and so forth. Functionality of the content distribution system may also be distributed across a plurality of server farms, thereby protecting against failure. In this way, the content capture and distribution systems have increased robustness over conventional systems.
- In another example, the content distribution system is configured to control operation of the content capture systems remotely. A user accessing the content distribution system, for instance, may interact with a user interface to control when content capture systems capture content, frequencies used by the content capture systems to capture the radio signals having the content, and so forth. As such, a user may control operation of a multitude of content capture systems distributed across a variety of geographic locations. Other examples are also contemplated as further described in the following.
- In the following discussion, an example environment is first described that may employ the techniques described herein. Example procedures are then described which may be performed in the example environment as well as other environments. Consequently, performance of the example procedures is not limited to the example environment and the example environment is not limited to performance of the example procedures.
-
FIG. 1 is an illustration of anenvironment 100 in an example implementation that is operable to employ techniques described herein. The illustratedenvironment 100 includes acontent broadcast system 102, acontent capture system 104, acontent distribution system 106, and a plurality ofclient devices 108 that are configured to consume content received from thecontent distribution system 106 via anetwork 110, e.g., the internet. - The
client devices 108 may be configured in a variety of ways. For instance, theclient devices 108 may be configured as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile device (e.g., assuming a handheld configuration such as a tablet or mobile phone as illustrated), and so forth. Thus, theclient devices 108 may range from full resource devices with substantial memory and processor resources (e.g., personal computers, game consoles) to a low-resource device with limited memory and/or processing resources (e.g., mobile devices). - The
content broadcast system 102 is implemented using hardware (e.g., a transmitter and antenna) to transmit radio frequency signals 112 "over the air" that include content, such as television or radio content. The radio frequency signals 112 may carry the content as an analog signal or digital signal, e.g., numerically encoded form. - The
content capture system 104 is positioned at ageographic location 114 having a proximity to thecontent broadcast system 102 sufficient to receive the radio signals 112, e.g., within the same city. Thecontent capture system 104 includes anantenna system 116 that is configured to receive the radio frequency signals 112 having the content. Thecontent capture system 104 also includes asignal conversion module 118 that is representative of hardware configured to convert the content carried by radio frequency signals 112 into an Internet Protocol (IP) format, such as MPEG-TS. Thecontent capture system 104 then employs anetwork transmission module 120 to transmit the content using the IP format using a network transfer protocol, such as in accordance with a secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS). Thus, thecontent capture system 104 may be configured as a "light" system for deployment at geographic locations at a fraction of the cost of conventional hardware systems, which implement signal and data processing hardware at the geographic locations. Further discussion of operation of thecontent capture system 104 is described in relation toFIG. 2 . - The
content distribution system 106 then receives the content in the IP format via thenetwork 110, e.g., the internet. Thecontent distribution system 108 includes adistribution management module 122 that is implemented at least partially in hardware to manage distribution of the content received by thecontent capture system 104 via thenetwork 110 to the plurality ofclient devices 108. Thedistribution management module 112, for instance, may configure the content in accordance with a network streaming protocol such as MPEG-DASH. The plurality ofclient devices 108 may then receive the content via a stream in accordance with the network streaming protocol and render it for output to a user, e.g., via a browser, a dedicated application, and so forth. In this way, the content from thecontent broadcast system 102 may be disseminated for consumption across a wide range ofclient devices 108 as further described in relation toFIG. 3 . - The
content distribution system 106 also includes acapture management module 124. Thecapture management module 124 is representative of functionality implemented at least partially in hardware to manage operation of thecontent capture system 104. This may include scheduling of when and how (e.g., what frequencies and protocols) thecontent capture system 104 captures and converts the content via the radio frequency signals 112. Further discussion of management of the content captures system is described in the following in relation toFIG. 5 . -
FIG. 2 depicts asystem 200 in an example implementation showing operation of thecontent capture system 104 ofFIG. 1 in greater detail as capturing "over the air" content. Thesystem 200 is illustrated using first, second, andthird stages first stage 202, thecontent capture system 104 employs anantenna system 116 to capture a broadcast of radio frequency signals 112 from acontent broadcast system 102 "over the air." The radio frequency signals 112 are used to carry thecontent 208 as an analog signal or a digital signal, i.e., in a numerically encoded form. As previously described, this may include a variety of types of content, such as television or radio content. - At the
second stage 204, asignal conversion module 118 of thecontent capture system 104 converts thecontent 208 as carried by theradio frequency signal 112 into an internet protocol format 210. A variety of internet protocol formats 210 may be used to store and transport thecontent 208 digitally, an example of which includes an MPEG transport stream (MPEG-TS). An MPEG transport stream is a digital content format for transmission and storage of audio, video, or other data that specifies a container format to encapsulate packetized elementary streams. - The
signal conversion module 118 may be implemented in a variety of ways. In one example, thesignal conversion module 118 is implemented as an RF to IP video processor as part of a rack-mounted system. The system includes a plurality of interchangeable components (e.g., circuit boards) that are configured to decode different formats of thecontent 208 as received via theradio frequency signal 112 that are employed by differentcontent broadcast systems 102. In this way, thecontent capture system 104 may be deployed across a variety of geographic locations across the globe by providing a corresponding component that is configured to decode the broadcast. - As part of the conversion, the
signal conversion module 118 may assign atimestamp 212 to respective portions of the content, e.g., packets as part of a header. Thetimestamp 212 may be used to control an order of output and navigation within thecontent 208 when rendering, as well as for synchronization with other content captured by other content capture systems as further described in relation toFIG. 5 . - At the
third stage 206, anetwork transmission module 120 is employed to communicate thecontent 208 via anetwork 110 to acontent distribution system 106. To do so, thenetwork transmission module 120 configures thecontent 208 in the internet protocol format 210 according to anetwork transfer protocol 214, e.g., through use of a transmission server and a network deployment switch. A variety of differentnetwork transfer protocols 214 may be used, such as HTTPS. - For example, the
network transmission module 120 may form a plurality of "chunks" of thecontent 208. These chunks are included as apayload 216 that is transferred over thenetwork 110 as specified by the HTTPS protocol, e.g., supporting authentication and encryption to protect against potentially malicious parties. In an implementation, thecontent 208 included as thepayload 216 is a full-bitrate version of thecontent 208 as converted by thesignal conversion module 118 and thus preserves an output richness of thecontent 208 for receipt by thecontent distribution system 106. - Thus, as described above the
content capture system 104 may be implemented using relatively inexpensive devices that cost a fraction of conventional proprietary systems, e.g., cost less than twenty percent of these conventional systems, which use data processing hardware at the capture site. Thecontent capture system 104 is a "light" system in this example in that the system is responsible for capture and communication of thecontent 208 with minimal processing. Further processing of thecontent 208, such as packetizing or error correction, is then performed by the content distribution system 106 (e.g., "in the cloud") and thus can take advantage of efficiencies and robustness of server farms and large backend systems, an example of which is further described in the following. -
FIG. 3 depicts asystem 300 in an example implementation showing operation of thecontent distribution system 106 to distributecontent 208 received via thenetwork 110 from thecontent capture system 104 ofFIG. 2 . Thissystem 300 is also illustrated using first, second, andthird stages - At the
first stage 302, thecontent distribution system 106 receives the content via anetwork transfer protocol 214 from thecontent capture system 104. Thecontent 208, for instance, is a full bitrate version as captured by thecontent capture system 104 that is communicated via the internet using HTTPS. - At the
second stage 304, thecontent 208 received via thenetwork transfer protocol 214 is configured by adistribution management module 122 for streaming via anetwork streaming protocol 308. Thedistribution management module 122, for instance, may form thecontent 208 into a plurality of segments and generate a manifest that describes those segments, e.g., in accordance with MPEG-DASH. Thedistribution management module 122 may then store thecontent 208 instorage 310 for streaming via the network to a plurality of client devices 108(1), ..., 108(n), ..., 108(N) as shown at thethird stage 306. -
FIG. 4 depicts anexample user interface 400 that is output by thecontent distribution system 106 to the plurality ofclient devices 108 to select content from thecontent distribution system 106 for output and rendering. Theuser interface 400 is generated by thecontent distribution system 106 and distributed for output by the plurality ofclient devices 108. Theuser interface 400 may be output by theclient devices 108 in a variety of ways, such as via a browser, dedicated application, and so forth. In the illustrated example, theuser interface 400 includes atitle originator picture content distribution system 106. In this way, a user of theclient devices 108 may access a wide range of content from a variety of geographic locations. -
FIG. 5 depicts asystem 500 in an example implementation in which thecontent distribution system 106 is configured to control operation of and leverage content obtained from a plurality of content capture systems 104(1)-104(N). Content capture and distribution is bifurcated across thecontent capture system 104 andcontent distribution system 106. As such, thecontent capture system 104 may be implemented using relatively inexpensive devices when compared to conventional dedicated hardware systems. Because of this, a plurality ofcontent capture systems 104 may be employed to capture a same (i.e., matching) broadcast of content from acontent distribution system 102. - In the illustrated example, a plurality of content capture systems 104(1)-104(N) are configured to capture radio frequency signals 112 having the same broadcast of content. The content capture systems 104(1)-104(N) each include respective antenna systems 116(1)-116(N), signal conversion modules 118(1)-118(N), and network transmission modules 120(1)-120(N) as previously described in relation to
FIG. 2 . Accordingly, the plurality of content capture systems 104(1)-104(N) provide a plurality of content 208(1)-208(N) via thenetwork 110 to thecontent distribution system 106. - The
content distribution system 106 may leverage redundancy of this content 208(1)-208(N) in a variety of ways. In one example, thedistribution management module 112 uses the content 208(1)-208(N) to repair errors that may be caused as part of capture (e.g., interference in the radio frequency signals), conversion, and/or transmission over thenetwork 110 to thecontent distribution system 106. Thedistribution management module 112 is configured to automatically select a particular copy of a chunk of thecontent 208 based on a redundancy comparison between different copies of the chunk. The comparison may indicate that the particular copy of the chunk is healthier, e.g., has less data corruption, than another copy of the chunk. In this way, the healthiest copy of each chunk is used for streaming thecontent 208 to theclient devices 108. Further, the comparison of chunks of the same content and the selection of the healthiest chunk can be performed automatically at the content distribution system and without user intervention. - In another example, the content 208(1)-208(N) may be used to address potential outages, e.g., of the content capture systems 104(1)-104(N) or network functionality used to communicate the content 208(1)-208(N) over the
network 110. This may be performed by switching between transmissions due to these outages. - Implementation of the
content distribution system 106 may also be distributed, e.g., across a plurality of server farms. For example, a first server farm may receive content 208(1) while another server farm receives content 208(N). In this way, operation of thecontent distribution system 106 itself is also protected against potential outages of the server farms, thereby improving robustness of the overall system. - The
content distribution system 106 also includes acapture management module 124. Thecapture management module 124 is representative of functionality implemented at least partially in hardware of thecontent distribution system 106 to manage capture of content by respective content capture systems 104(1)-104(N). Thecapture management module 124, for instance, may control "when" and "how" the content capture systems 104(1)-104(N) capture content, e.g., times to turn on and frequencies used to capture the content. In this way, bifurcation of the system used to capture and distribute content may provide rich content in an efficient manner. - The following discussion describes techniques that may be implemented utilizing the previously described systems and devices. Aspects of each of the procedures may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The procedures are shown as a set of blocks that specify operations performed by one or more devices and are not necessarily limited to the orders shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference will be made to
FIGS. 1-5 . -
FIG. 6 depicts aprocedure 600 in an example implementation in which over-the-air content is captured and distributed. Remote capture of radio frequency signals that carry content by a plurality of content capture systems in each of a plurality of geographic areas is managed (block 602). As shown inFIG. 2 , for instance, thecontent capture system 104 includes anantenna system 116 configured to capture radio frequency signals 112 from acontent broadcast system 102. This functionality is managed by thedistribution management module 122 of thecontent distribution system 106 inFIG. 3 . The content is then converted from radio frequency signals that carry the content into an internet protocol format by the content capture system, such as in accordance with an MPEG-TS - Transmission of the content is managed according to a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for receipt by a content distribution system via a network (block 604). For instance, multiple copies of the content captured by the plurality of content capture systems from a same broadcast source can be transmitted to the content distribution system to enable redundancy checks and error correction of one or more of the copies.
- Upon receipt, the content is configured by the content distribution system for streaming via a network streaming protocol (block 606), such as through use of a manifest and segments in accordance with MPEG-DASH. The content is then streamed by the content distribution system via the network using the network streaming protocol for receipt and rendering by at least one client device (block 610). The plurality of
client devices 108, for instance, may interact with theuser interface 400 ofFIG. 4 to select particular items of interest for streaming to theclient device 108. -
