Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method, apparatus, and system of user-managed coupons in a geo-spatial environment.
- a coupon may increase sales of a particular product and/or service.
- the coupon may be distributed through postal mail or through the Internet.
- the coupon may be inserted in a newspaper, a magazine, a pamphlet, and/or a coupon book (e.g., Valpak®).
- the coupon may be posted on a website or included as part of an electronic communication (e.g., email).
- distribution of the coupons can be very expensive.
- the coupons may be discarded and/or ignored by recipients (e.g., postal mail recipients and/or electronic communication recipients) who are not interested in the particular product and/or service promoted by the coupons.
- mailing costs to distribute the coupons can be enormous (e.g., in aggregate totaling billions of dollars in the United States alone). As such, sharing and/or distribution of coupons is inefficient, expensive, and time consuming.
- a method includes automatically applying a location meta-data to a coupon when a user provides the coupon to the geo-spatial environment based on a geographic marker of the user (e.g., the user who provides the coupon may scan in a coupon received by the user through printed mail and may upload the coupon to the geo-spatial environment after registering location information in a geo-spatial environment), storing the coupon in a library of coupons, searching the library of coupons based on the location meta-data based on a user request, and flagging certain coupons in the library of coupons as being expired based on a user response.
- a geographic marker of the user e.g., the user who provides the coupon may scan in a coupon received by the user through printed mail and may upload the coupon to the geo-spatial environment after registering location information in a geo-spatial environment
- the method may further include providing an incentive (e.g., the incentive may be a portion of the value of the coupon applied as a credit) to the user who provides the coupon to the geo-spatial environment in exchange of providing the coupon and/or in exchange of sharing a content meta-data that tags and identifies a source, a duration, a value, and/or a description of the coupon.
- the coupon may be debited against the user who provides the coupon to the geo-spatial environment when it is flagged as expired prior to being redeemed by another user in the geo-spatial environment.
- the method may also include providing an added bonus to the user who provides the coupon when the coupon is redeemed by another user in the geo-spatial environment prior to expiry of the coupon. Moreover, the method may include enabling another user to purchase an offering identified through the coupon in the geo-spatial environment and applying the coupon to the offering when a transaction between another user and a seller is processed.
- the method may include generating a premium coupon in the geo-spatial environment which is highlighted in a search result when an advertiser pays the geo-spatial environment to place the premium coupon in the geo-spatial environment (e.g., the advertiser may bid along with other advertisers to place the premium coupon in the search result based on a bidding competition between advertisers tagged to the location meta-data and/or the content meta-data).
- the method may include enabling users to browse the library of coupons in a singular and/or group fashion.
- the method may further include enabling the users to print out a coupon page and/or a coupon book based on location, topic, description, interest, value, and/or business name.
- An optical character recognition technology may be applied to the coupon when it is uploaded, to automatically add the location and/or content meta-data in the library of coupons.
- the method may include performing a modify operation on the coupon to correct and/or improve indexing of the coupon when any user of the geo-spatial network updates, modifies, creates, and/or tags the coupon.
- the method may include placing a rating and/or a comments board of uploaded coupons in the geo-spatial environment based on a user feedback provided in the geo-spatial environment and/or enabling the ratings and/or the comments board to recognize prolific and popular ones of the users who provide coupons to be shared in the geo-spatial environment.
- the method may include applying a marker to graphically show the coupon in a geo-spatial wiki based social network along with other markers highlighting profiles of neighbors and/or businesses in a neighborhood.
- a system in another aspect, includes a geo-spatial environment having any number of business profiles and/or any number of residential profiles each marked above a three-dimensional view of a neighborhood, a set of markers (e.g., the set of markers may appear only for a determined amount of time based on a meta-data identifying a valid term of the coupons and/or may automatically disappear from the geo-spatial environment when the valid term expires) indicating particular ones of the business profiles which have coupons in the geo-spatial environment as being available for redemption, and a central module to manage the recognition, rewards, and/or promotion of user-generated coupons in the geo-spatial environment between interested ones of users each having residential profiles and/or business profiles and each indicating a physical location of the users. Furthermore, the central module may enable businesses to place premium coupons in the geo-spatial environment which are ordered in search results based on bidding across location-based and/or category-based dimensions.
- a method in yet another aspect, includes capturing a location information of each user of a social network through an identification of a location of each user in a map, providing an incentive to the users of the social network to scan and upload coupons to the social network, automatically tagging the uploaded coupons based on the location information of each user and enabling debits and/or credits between users who participate in a user generated coupon exchange between parties in the social network by providing credits and/or debits between business and residential users of the social network based on validity and/or redemption of the coupons in the social network.
- the method may include recognizing popular ones of the users of the social network through ratings and/or popularity score in exchange of sharing coupons with other parties in the social network. Furthermore, the method may include placing a set of premium coupons in the social network that are visually displayed along with other coupons in the map through a set of pushpins that highlight particular locations at which the set of premium coupons and/or the other coupons are redeemable.

Abstract
Description
- This patent application is being filed simultaneously with an international PCT patent application, titled “USER-MANAGED COUPONS IN A GEO-SPATIAL ENVIRONMENT.”
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method, apparatus, and system of user-managed coupons in a geo-spatial environment.
- A coupon (e.g., a discount, a rebate, an incentive, etc.) may increase sales of a particular product and/or service. The coupon may be distributed through postal mail or through the Internet. When the coupon is distributed through postal mail, the coupon may be inserted in a newspaper, a magazine, a pamphlet, and/or a coupon book (e.g., Valpak®). When the coupon is distributed through the Internet, the coupon may be posted on a website or included as part of an electronic communication (e.g., email).
- In many neighborhoods, there are individuals (e.g., moms, dads, grandmas, etc.) who love coupons. Such individuals may regularly cut coupons received in postal mail and store them at home (e.g., a drawer in a kitchen). These individuals may share printed coupons with friends and/or family members by searching through their drawer in hope of saving money for their friends and/or family. These individuals may take pride in being recognized for their thriftiness. In addition, such individuals may enjoy helping others save money and find good deals. Sometimes, the coupons in the drawer may be expired and/or unusable. In addition, manually searching for a particular coupon in a drawer can be inefficient and time consuming. As such, the individuals who love coupons may find it difficult to share them with others.
- In addition, distribution of the coupons can be very expensive. The coupons may be discarded and/or ignored by recipients (e.g., postal mail recipients and/or electronic communication recipients) who are not interested in the particular product and/or service promoted by the coupons. In addition, mailing costs to distribute the coupons can be enormous (e.g., in aggregate totaling billions of dollars in the United States alone). As such, sharing and/or distribution of coupons is inefficient, expensive, and time consuming.
- A method, apparatus, and system of user-managed coupons in a geo-spatial environment is disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes automatically applying a location meta-data to a coupon when a user provides the coupon to the geo-spatial environment based on a geographic marker of the user (e.g., the user who provides the coupon may scan in a coupon received by the user through printed mail and may upload the coupon to the geo-spatial environment after registering location information in a geo-spatial environment), storing the coupon in a library of coupons, searching the library of coupons based on the location meta-data based on a user request, and flagging certain coupons in the library of coupons as being expired based on a user response.
- The method may further include providing an incentive (e.g., the incentive may be a portion of the value of the coupon applied as a credit) to the user who provides the coupon to the geo-spatial environment in exchange of providing the coupon and/or in exchange of sharing a content meta-data that tags and identifies a source, a duration, a value, and/or a description of the coupon. The coupon may be debited against the user who provides the coupon to the geo-spatial environment when it is flagged as expired prior to being redeemed by another user in the geo-spatial environment.
- The method may also include providing an added bonus to the user who provides the coupon when the coupon is redeemed by another user in the geo-spatial environment prior to expiry of the coupon. Moreover, the method may include enabling another user to purchase an offering identified through the coupon in the geo-spatial environment and applying the coupon to the offering when a transaction between another user and a seller is processed.
- Furthermore, the method may include generating a premium coupon in the geo-spatial environment which is highlighted in a search result when an advertiser pays the geo-spatial environment to place the premium coupon in the geo-spatial environment (e.g., the advertiser may bid along with other advertisers to place the premium coupon in the search result based on a bidding competition between advertisers tagged to the location meta-data and/or the content meta-data).
- In addition, the method may include enabling users to browse the library of coupons in a singular and/or group fashion. The method may further include enabling the users to print out a coupon page and/or a coupon book based on location, topic, description, interest, value, and/or business name. An optical character recognition technology may be applied to the coupon when it is uploaded, to automatically add the location and/or content meta-data in the library of coupons. The method may include performing a modify operation on the coupon to correct and/or improve indexing of the coupon when any user of the geo-spatial network updates, modifies, creates, and/or tags the coupon.
- Furthermore, the method may include placing a rating and/or a comments board of uploaded coupons in the geo-spatial environment based on a user feedback provided in the geo-spatial environment and/or enabling the ratings and/or the comments board to recognize prolific and popular ones of the users who provide coupons to be shared in the geo-spatial environment. Moreover, the method may include applying a marker to graphically show the coupon in a geo-spatial wiki based social network along with other markers highlighting profiles of neighbors and/or businesses in a neighborhood.
- In another aspect, a system includes a geo-spatial environment having any number of business profiles and/or any number of residential profiles each marked above a three-dimensional view of a neighborhood, a set of markers (e.g., the set of markers may appear only for a determined amount of time based on a meta-data identifying a valid term of the coupons and/or may automatically disappear from the geo-spatial environment when the valid term expires) indicating particular ones of the business profiles which have coupons in the geo-spatial environment as being available for redemption, and a central module to manage the recognition, rewards, and/or promotion of user-generated coupons in the geo-spatial environment between interested ones of users each having residential profiles and/or business profiles and each indicating a physical location of the users. Furthermore, the central module may enable businesses to place premium coupons in the geo-spatial environment which are ordered in search results based on bidding across location-based and/or category-based dimensions.
- In yet another aspect, a method includes capturing a location information of each user of a social network through an identification of a location of each user in a map, providing an incentive to the users of the social network to scan and upload coupons to the social network, automatically tagging the uploaded coupons based on the location information of each user and enabling debits and/or credits between users who participate in a user generated coupon exchange between parties in the social network by providing credits and/or debits between business and residential users of the social network based on validity and/or redemption of the coupons in the social network.
- In addition, the method may include recognizing popular ones of the users of the social network through ratings and/or popularity score in exchange of sharing coupons with other parties in the social network. Furthermore, the method may include placing a set of premium coupons in the social network that are visually displayed along with other coupons in the map through a set of pushpins that highlight particular locations at which the set of premium coupons and/or the other coupons are redeemable.
- The methods, systems, and apparatuses disclosed herein may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects, and may be executed in a form of a machine-readable medium embodying a set of instructions that, when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform any of the operations disclosed herein. Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows:

In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident, however to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.
- In one embodiment, a method includes automatically applying a location meta-data to a coupon when a user (e.g., the
user 122A-N ofFIG. 1 ) provides the coupon to a geo-spatial environment (e.g., the geo-spatial environment 120A-N ofFIG. 1 ) based on a geographic marker of the user, storing the coupon in a library of coupons (e.g., the library of coupons database 218 ofFIG. 2 ), searching the library of coupons based on the location meta-data based on a user request, and/or flagging (e.g., using the flagging module 216 ofFIG. 2 ) certain coupons in the library of coupons as being expired based on a user response. - In another embodiment, a system includes a geo-spatial environment (e.g., the geo-
spatial environment 120A-N ofFIG. 1 ), having any number of business profiles and any number of residential profiles each marked above a three-dimensional view (e.g., 3D map view) of a neighborhood, a set of markers indicating particular ones of the business profiles which have coupons in the geo-spatial environment as being available for redemption and a central module (e.g., thecentral module 100 ofFIG. 1 ) to manage the recognition, rewards, and/or promotion of user-generated coupons in the geo-spatial environment between interested users, each having residential profiles and/or business profiles and/or each indicating a physical location of the users. - In yet another embodiment, a method includes capturing a location information of each user of a social network through an identification of a location of each user in a map, providing an incentive (e.g., using the
incentive module 306 ofFIG. 3 ) to the users of the social network to scan and upload coupons to the social network, automatically tagging (e.g., using thetagging module 210 ofFIG. 2 ) the uploaded coupons based on the location information of each user and enabling debits and/or credits between users who participate in a user generated coupon exchange between parties in the social network by providing credits and/or debits between business and residential users of the social network based on a validity and/or redemption of the coupons in the social network. -
FIG. 1 is a system view of acentral module 100 communicating with a geo-spatial environment 120A-N through anetwork 114, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 1 illustrates thecentral module 100, acoupon module 102, anadvertisement module 104, amap module 106, anexchange module 108, asearch module 110, aprofile module 112, thenetwork 114, aresidence 116, a business 118, the geo-spatial environment 120A-N,users 122A-N,distributors 124 andadvertisers 126, according to one embodiment. - The
central module 100 may manage recognition, rewards and/or promotion of user generated coupons having a profile (e.g., residential profile, business profile, etc.) associated with a location meta-data in the geo-spatial environment 120A-N. Thecentral module 100 may also enable theadvertisers 126 to place premium coupons in the geo-spatial environment 120A-N. Thecoupon module 102 may contain a set of coupons stored in the library of coupons (e.g., the library of coupons database 218 illustrated inFIG. 2 ) representing the products and/or services and/or may differentiate the premium coupons from the other coupons by highlighting the profiles of the premium coupons in the geo-spatial environment as being available for redemption. - The
advertisement module 104 may enable theadvertisers 126 to upload coupons online. Themap module 106 may render the geo-spatial environment 120A-N concurrently representing neighboring places and profiles, using a set of markers indicating the availability status of the coupons. Theexchange module 108 may provide an incentive (e.g., the incentive may be a portion of the value of the coupon) to theusers 122A-N when theusers 122A-N upload the valid coupon(s) and/or share a content meta-data that tags and identifies a source, a duration, a value and/or a description of the coupon in the geo-spatial environment 120A-N. Theexchange module 108 may barter the credits and/or debits between users (e.g., a businesses and/or residential user) in the geo-spatial environment based on the validity and/or redemption of coupons in the social network. - The
search module 110 may search the library of coupons (e.g., the library of coupons database 218 ofFIG. 2 ) based on the location meta-data upon request (e.g., requests for the type of the coupon, value of the coupon etc.) by theusers 122A-N. Theprofile module 112 may include business profiles and/or residential profiles indicating the location meta-data of theuser 122A-N in the geo-spatial environment. Thenetwork 114 may enable efficient communication between thecentral module 100 and the geo-spatial environment 120A-N. - The
residence 116 may represent a residential profile of an occupant and the business 118 may represent the business profile associated with the location meta-data of the user in the geo-spatial environment. The geo-spatial environment 120A-N may contain any number of business and/or residential profiles (e.g., each marked above the 3-dimensional view in the neighborhood). - The
users 122A-N may be business and/or residential users who participate in the user generated coupon exchange between parties in the social network. Thedistributors 124 may dispense the set of coupons acquired from the business and/or residential users in the geo-spatial environment 120A-N. The advertisers 126 may be the entities interested in placing the premium coupons in the geo-spatial environment 120A-N through a bidding competition. - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 1 , thecentral module 100 communicates with the geo-spatial environment 120A-N through thenetwork 114.
