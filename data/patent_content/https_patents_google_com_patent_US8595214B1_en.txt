Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to methods and systems for information retrieval.
- the present invention relates particularly to systems and methods for article location and retrieval.
- the file-open command causes a dialog to be displayed in which the user can enter a file name or a path into a text box, which the application uses to locate the document.
- the text-box entry is typically limited to a short text string, which must match a file name or path exactly, either in whole or in part. For example, if the user enters “*budget*” (in this example, the asterisk represents a wildcard) in the text-entry box, the file name or path must include the term “budget” somewhere in the file name or path.
- a file or path including the term “financial” or the term “accounting” would not be found although a file that contained those terms may be relevant to what the user is seeking.
- the user may also have access to a find dialog, allowing the user to search on additional attributes of a file, such as the text in the file.
- Hummingbird's DOCS Open® (Hummingbird Ltd.; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; www.hummingbird.com) can be integrated into a user's desktop applications.
- DOCS Open® When the user attempts to open or save a file, a DOCS Open® interface is displayed. The user is able to enter text into any one of a number of attributes for a document in order to search for the document.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for article location and retrieval.
- a computer program such as a program for processing display output, interrupts the normal processing of an operating system call associated with a dialog control and causes a search dialog control to be displayed.
- the search dialog control may be associated with an index comprising a plurality of events that are associated with at least one client application. At least some of the events are captured in real time. Each event may be associated with one or more articles.
- a computer-readable storage medium (such as, for example random access memory or a computer disk) comprises code for carrying out such a method.

Each of the plurality of events is associated with at least one of a plurality of client applications, and at least some of the plurality of events are captured in real time. Each event may be associated with an article.
- a word-processing program or other application program transmits an operating system call to open a common “File/Open” dialog control.
- the display processor 128 interrupts the normal processing of the call, i.e., prevents the common dialog from being displayed, and instead, displays a custom dialog control.
- the display processor 128 displays a modified version of the common dialog, preserving existing functionality while adding additional features.
- the operating system call may identify the type of application program so that application-specific functionality can be invoked.
- the original dialog control is displayed as normal, and an additional dialog control is displayed. This additional control may appear next to the original dialog control, or may appear within appear within an existing content display, for example.
- Interrupting the system call may be performed in various ways in embodiments of the present invention. For example, in a Microsoft® Windows® operating system, interrupting the system call may be accomplished via hooking or via standard API calls.
- the dialog control that the display processor 128 displays may comprise a common dialog control or a custom dialog control.
- the dialog control may comprise a modified version of a common dialog control.
- the dialog control may appear substantially the same as the “File/Open” dialog but function differently or include only somewhat different controls, such as an additional button.
- the dialog may be substantially similar to other common dialog controls, such as the find dialog control.
- the dialog control may comprise an additional button that is specific to the functionality described herein, such as a custom “Browse” button.
- the dialog control comprises a text box.
- the user enters a search term in the text box and indicates that the search should begin by, for example, clicking an “Open” or “Search” button or by way of some other mechanism for issuing a search request.
- the display processor receives the input and causes a search to be performed on the index.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a process for intercepting an operating system call in one embodiment of the present invention.
- a client application 128 makes a call to the operating system on the client 102 a to display the file open common dialog.
- a program executing on the client 102 a such as the display processor 128 , receives the operating system call 202 .
- the display processor 128 then interrupts the normal processing of the operating system call 204 .
- Intercepting an operating system call and providing an application-specific function is known in the art of applications development. Such functionality is sometimes referred to as spying or hooking.
- an application executing in a Microsoft® Windows® environment can utilize the SetWindowsHookEx function to install a hook procedure at the beginning of a hook chain.
- Microsoft® Windows® supports a number of chains, including, for example, the WH_CALLWNDPROC and WH_CALLWNDPROCRET hook chains.
- the operating system calls the WH_CALLWNDPROC before passing a message to a receiving window procedure and calls the WH_CALLWNDPROCRET after the window procedure has processed the message.
- An application can utilize these hooks to intercept any calls between windows executing within the operating system. Once the calls are intercepted, application specific functions can be inserted in the processing chain in addition to or instead of the standard or default functions. From the foregoing description, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention may, with some modification, similarly be implemented in conjunction with other (e.g., non-Windows) operating systems.
- the display processor 128 then causes a custom search dialog to be displayed 206 .
- a custom search dialog is shown in, and described below in relation to, FIG. 3 .
- the search dialog may comprise a textbox in which a computer user enters a search query.
- Other types of dialogs may also be used.
- a list of articles is displayed to the user.
- the dialog may take the form of, for example, another button or an extra field.
- the articles displayed in a content display of such an embodiment are articles that the user has recently viewed, edited, printed, or otherwise interacted with.
- the custom dialog control allows configuration of indexing options. For example, upon interception of a “File Save” dialog box, or a file write operating system event, the custom dialog control can display indexing options, allowing the user to select whether or not they would like the saved file to be indexed. Additional options may include an indexing level, such as whether the full content with images should be indexed, or whether only the text should be indexed. In one embodiment, this dialog is displayed each time and defaults to the user's last selection for the file type.
- the custom dialog control is only displayed the first time a particular file type is encountered, and the user's option is automatically used in the future.
- the user is not required to select an indexing option at that time.
- the system may display the custom dialog within a section of a content display, which maintains a list of pending indexing options. The user may respond to these options when he or she prefers.
- the options are only displayed on the screen for a short period, but an option in the user interface allows the user to display and respond to these options.
- an indexing preferences control is displayed to the user.
- the indexer utilizes these preferences when indexing files and/or events.
- the indexing preferences control allows the user to specify preferences, such as, for example, whether the system stores and/or indexes files and/or events of a particular type. For example, in one embodiment, the user specifies that the indexer index files which are of the same type as the file the user is editing.
- the user specifies whether or not to store native and/or processed content in the data store 140 . In another embodiment, the user specifies how much storage space each file or event may occupy (e.g., only store the first 50 KB of a file or index).
- the user may not wish to alter preferences each time an event occurs that might trigger display of the dialog control.
- the user is presented with the dialog control only on the first occurrence of a file and/or event type (e.g., only the first time a Word document is opened or saved).
- the control is presented to the user each time, but the setting in the dialog are set to the last known settings for the particular user/file/event combination.
- the display processor 128 receives the search query 208 and causes the search to be executed on an index associated with the custom dialog 210 .
- code associated with the press of the button causes a search to be executed on a particular index or on particular indices.
- the index may be stored locally, e.g., in the data store 140 , or may be a global index.
- the index comprises one or more events.
- An event may include, for example, information indicating that the user printed a particular word-processing document within the previous hour.
- the event is associated with a client application, e.g., the word-processing application. At least some of the events are captured in real time. For example, in the case of the user printing a document, a program, such as the capture processor 124 in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , captures the event and stores it in the index. The event can be subsequently accessed.
- a query system or search engine such as query system 132 , executes the query on the index and returns a result.
- the display processor receives the result 212 .
- the result may comprise zero, one, or many articles or article identifiers.
- the result may comprise a formatted page, e.g., an HTML page, or may comprise a data set.
- the display processor 128 causes the result to be output 216 .
- the output may comprise a list, an HTML page, audio output, or any other type of suitable output of the results.
