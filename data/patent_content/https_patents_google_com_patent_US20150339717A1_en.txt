- Many companies derive revenue from selling space for content items such as advertisements (“ads”). The space being sold may be in traditional media, such as television, radio, newspaper, and magazines, as well as interactive media, such as the Internet.
- To reach a more responsive audience, advertisers and sellers of ad space have used various ways (e.g., demographic studies) to target particular ads to particular audiences. In the case of online advertising, certain systems may be configured to analyze text on a web page and determine which ads to show based on that text.
- Various aspects of the subject technology relate to a system for generating a textual representation of points of interest (POIs) in a geographic area. The system may include one or more processors and a machine-readable medium comprising instructions stored therein, which when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations. The operations may include identifying a plurality of points of interest (POIs) in a geographic area displayed in a mapping interface, each POI having corresponding POI information, calculating a rank score for each POI of the plurality of POIs in the geographic area based on the POI information for each POI, and selecting a subset of the plurality of POIs in the geographic area based on the rank scores for the plurality of POIs.

- It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized, the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.
- The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide further understanding and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate disclosed aspects and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the disclosed aspects.

FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a computer system with which any of the clients, servers, computing devices, or systems described herein may be implemented. - The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.
- Various aspects of the subject technology involve identifying one or more content items (e.g., advertisements) associated with a mapping interface. Once the content items are identified, they may be displayed to a user along with the mapping interface. To this end, systems known as content generators (e.g., ad generators) may be configured to identify and provide content items (e.g., advertisements) that are related to text that appears on a user interface. For example, when a user views a web page on a browser, an ad generator may be configured to analyze the text on the web page, determine one or more keywords associated with the user interface, and select content items (e.g., advertisements) related to those identified keywords to be displayed to the user. However, the content generators may be unable to select content items based on non-textual components on a web page or other user interface, such as a mapping interface that displays an image of a map of a geographic area.
- In accordance with one aspect of the subject technology, a system may be configured to identify a number of points of interest (POIs) in a geographic area displayed in a mapping interface. Each point of interest may be, for example, a business, a landmark, a neighborhood, or any other location.
- The system may calculate a rank for each POI identified and generate a textual representation of the mapping interface based on the identified POI and its respective rank. After the textual representation of the mapping interface is generated, it may be submitted to a content generator to be used to select content items (e.g., advertisements) associated with the mapping interface that may be displayed to a user along with the mapping interface.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating anexample network environment 100 in which one or more content items associated with a mapping interface may be identified and provided to a user, in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology. The architecture includes one ormore servers 130 andclients 110 connected over anetwork 150 such as the Internet. AlthoughFIG. 1 illustrates a client-server network environment 100, other aspects of the subject technology may include other configurations including, for example, peer-to-peer environments or single system environments. - The
clients 110 may include, for example, desktop computers, mobile computers, tablet computers, mobile devices (e.g., a smart phone or a global positioning system (GPS) device), set top boxes (e.g., for a television), video game consoles, thin clients, televisions with one or more processors embedded therein and/or coupled thereto, or any other devices having appropriate processor, memory, and communications capabilities. Theclients 110 may be configured to run applications (e.g., a GPS program, a routing application, a web browser, etc.) with a display that may show a mapping interface (e.g., map including various points of interest) to a user. For example, a client machine may request a mapping interface (e.g., a webpage containing a viewport) displaying a portion of a map in order to locate a particular place or find a route from one location to another. - The
servers 130 may be any system or device having a processor, a memory, and communications capability for generating a mapping interface that shows an image of a geographic area and transmitting the mapping interface to one ormore clients 110. Eachserver 130 can operate on a single computing device or multiple computing devices. For example,FIG. 2 is a user interface illustrating anexample mapping interface 200, in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology. Themapping interface 200 may include a geographic area in aviewport 210. - The
servers 130 may also transmit one or more content items, such ascontent items 250, to theclients 110. In one aspect, the content items may be advertisements that are related to the geographic area in the mapping interface. Although inFIG. 2 , thecontent items 250 are interface elements that appear in themapping interface 200, the content items transmitted to theclients 110 may come in other forms as well. For example, they may appear as interactive interface elements on the viewport 210 (e.g., a clickable icon) or they may appear on separate user interface elements. Furthermore, the content items may be transmitted as visual media (e.g., pictures, text, video, or a combination) or other media such as an audio transmission that includes an audible message that may be played on a client device. - The
content items 250 may be selected to be transmitted to theclients 110 by a content generator (e.g., an ad generator) configured to select content items from a repository of content items based on a text in a document. For example, the content generator may analyze the text in a web page document (e.g., a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page) and identify keywords in the web page document. In some cases, any keywords found may be ranked according to, for example, how many times the keyword appears in the web page document or where the keywords are located in the web page document (e.g., in the metadata, in the title, in a heading or subheading, etc.). The content generator may then search through an index of content items and select content items to deliver to the clients based on the ranked keywords. - However, the content generator may not be configured to use non-textual input such as a geographic area displayed in a
view port 210 in a web page or other amapping interface 200. Accordingly, to find content items associated with a geographic area displayed in a mapping interface, theservers 130 may use a system that converts the geographic area into a format that is readable by the content generator (e.g., text). One such system is illustrated inFIG. 3 . -
FIG. 3 is a conceptual block diagram illustrating anexample system 300 for generating a textual representation of points of interest in a geographic area, in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology. Thesystem 300 may be hosted on one or more of theservers 130 inFIG. 1 or on a separate machine. While thesystem 300 is shown in one configuration inFIG. 3 , in other configurations, thesystem 300 may include additional, alternative, and/or fewer components. - The
system 300 may include a point of interest (POI)module 310, arank module 320, and anoutput module 330. ThePOI module 310 may be configured to identify a number of points of interest that are located within or near the geographic area in themapping interface 200. According to one aspect of the subject technology, the points of interest may be identified using a POI database such as the one shown inFIG. 4 . -
FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example point of interest (POI)database 400, in accordance with one aspect of the subject technology. ThePOI database 400 may contain information for a number of points of interest known to the system. For example, thePOI database 400 may have aPOI listing 410 for each point of interest known to the system. ThePOI listing 410 may hold various information for the point of interest such as the name of a point of interest, location coordinates for a point of interest, a phone number for the point of interest, a POI type (e.g., business, retail store, government office, restaurant, hotel, etc.), one or more rank scores assigned to the point of interest by various systems, or other information about the point of interest. - Referring back to
FIG. 3 , thePOI module 310 may search thePOI database 400 for POI listings with location coordinates that fall within the geographic area of themapping interface 200. Therank module 320 may be configured to calculate a rank score for each of the POI listings with location coordinates that fall within the geographic area of themapping interface 200. The POI listings may be ranked based on, for example, one or more POI types associated with the POI listings, a number of reviews, one or more ranking values assigned by other systems, the distance from the POI location coordinates to the center of the geographic area of the mapping interface, the distance from the POI location coordinates to another reference location, profile information for a user, or any other information associated with the point of interest. - The
output module 330 may be configured to use the ranked POI listings and generate a textual representation of the points of interest found in the geographic area of themapping interface 200. The textual representation may be for example, a list of POI listings, an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file, an HyperText Markup Language (HTML) file, or a file in any other format. According to one aspect of the subject technology, the POI listings in the textual representation may also be prioritized, for example, by being ordered, being associated with a ranking value, or by being associated with some other indicator of priority (e.g., HTML or XML tags). - The
output module 330 may then submit the textual representation of the points of interest found in the geographic area of themapping interface 200 to acontent generator 340 so that thecontent generator 340 may select a number of content items (e.g., ads) to be presented to the user based on the textual representation. According to one aspect of the subject technology, thecontent generator 340 may be incorporated into thesystem 300 or located on another one of theservers 130. - The
content generator 340 may be configured to select content items to be presented to the user by for example, identifying content items that are associated with one or more of the POI listings in the textual representation. According to one aspect, each POI listing may be associated with keywords and thecontent generator 340 may select content items to present to the user based on the keywords. -
FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating anexample process 500 for presenting content items associated with a geographic area in a mapping interface, in accordance with various aspects of the subject technology. Although the blocks inFIG. 5 are discussed with respect to the modules ofsystem 300 illustrated inFIG. 3 , the blocks are not limited to these modules. Furthermore, although the blocks are shown in one particular order, other orderings of blocks are also possible. - The
process 500 may involve converting a geographic area associated with a mapping interface into a textual representation. For example, a system may receive a mapping interface containing a geographic area or simply information that may be used to define a geographic area (e.g., a set of location coordinates defining the boundaries of a geographic area). - At
block 505, thePOI module 310 may identify a number of points of interest (POIs) associated with the mapping interface by, for example, finding points of interest that are located inside the geographic area. According to one aspect, thePOI module 310 may search aPOI database 400 for points of interest that have location coordinates within the geographic area. - At
block 510, therank module 320 may calculate a rank score for each POI in the geographic area that was identified by thePOI module 310. A POI's rank score may be calculated based on various factors and signals such as, but not limited to, POI types associated with the POI, reviews associated with the POI, one or more ranking values for the POI that may have been assigned by another system or process, or the distance from the POI's location coordinates to the center of the geographic area of the mapping interface. - For example, POIs of a certain type (e.g., restaurants, retail stores, hotels, etc.) may be assigned higher rank scores that POIs of other types (e.g., fire stations, bus stops, etc.) with all other factors being equal. Furthermore, POIs with location coordinates near the center of the geographic area may be assigned higher rank scores than POIs with location coordinates further away from the center of the geographic area, all other factors being equal. Similarly, POIs with more reviews or more positive reviews may be ranked higher than POIs with fewer reviews or less positive reviews.
- According to one aspect, a formula that assigns various weights to the various factors and signals may be used. One example formula may be in the format provided below:
-
Rank Score=(w1·f1)+(w2·f2)+(w3·f3) . . . - where f1, f2, and f3 are factors and w1, w2, and w3 are weights assigned to the factors. Other formulas with different formats may also be used.
- At
block 515, theoutput module 330 may generate a textual representation of the POIs in the geographic area based on the respective rank scores of the POIs. The textual representation may include references to one or more POIs in the geographic area. For example, the textual representation may have references to all of the POIs identified by the POI module, a number of POIs with the top rank scores, or all POIs with a rank score above a threshold rank score. - According to one aspect, the references to the one or more POIs in the textual representation may be prioritized based on their respective rank scores in order to more clearly illustrate what the geographic area in the mapping interface may be depicting. For example, if the textual representation is an ordered list, the ordered list may be ordered based on the rank scores of each POI included in the textual representation or the list may also include the rank score.
- In another example, if the textual representation is a document such as a HTML file, the POIs included in the textual representation may be prioritized by placing the POIs or references to the POIs in order and/or by using different delimiters. For example, references to a POI with the highest rank score may be associated with heading or paragraph HTML tags (e.g., <h1> . . . </h1>, <h2> . . . </h2>, <h3> . . . </h3> or <p1> . . . </p1>, <p2> . . . </p2>, <p3> . . . </p3>) while other references to POIs may be associated with other HTML tags (e.g., header tags, title tags, line break tags, comment tags, etc.) depending on their rank scores. Additionally, keywords, terms, or characteristics associated with of each of the POIs included in the textual representation may also be included in the document. Furthermore, in addition to HTML files or lists, the textual representation may be similarly embodied in any other document or data structure (e.g., XML files).
- Once the textual representation is generated, the
output module 330 may submit it to a content generator 340 (e.g., an advertisement generator) atblock 520. Although thecontent generator 340 may be able to handle only textual input, thesystem 300 is able to use the content selection capabilities of thecontent generator 340 to select content items that are related to a mapping interface because the system has converted the contents of the mapping interface into a format that may be understood by thecontent generator 340. - The
content generator 340 may use the textual representation of the points of interest found in the geographic area of the mapping interface to select content items (e.g., advertisements) to be presented to a user. Thecontent generator 340 may select one or more content items to present to the user based on the textual input and transmit the selections to thesystem 300. Atblock 525, theoutput module 330 may receive the one or more content items selected by thecontent generator 340 and transmit them to a client device to be presented to a user. - According to some aspects, certain POIs may be removed from the set of identified POIs within the geographic area before they are ranked (e.g., before
block 510 inFIG. 5 ) in order to reduce the use of computing resources and time needed to calculate a rank score for these POIs. These POIs may be removed based on, for example, the type or category of POI that they belong to (e.g., government office, airport, police station, etc.) - According to one aspect of the subject technology, content items may include advertisements, messages, public service announcements, or any other form of content that may be presented to a user of a client device.
