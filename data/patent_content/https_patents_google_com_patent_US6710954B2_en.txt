- the typical configuration of the tape drive 12 is shown in FIG. 2 .
- the tape drive 12 in FIG. 2 comprises a deck 24 including movable parts, and a control card 26 including various circuits and buses.
- the deck 24 includes a head assembly 28 which contacts the tape 20 of the tape cartridge inserted into the tape drive 12 to read and write data and read a servo pattern, and motors 34 and 36 for respectively rotating a supply reel 30 and a take-up reel 32 .

- the control card 26 includes a microprocessor (MPU) 38 for the overall control of the tape drive 12 ; a memory 42 , a servo control unit 44 , a data flow unit 46 and an interface control unit 48 all of which are connected to the MPU 38 via an internal bus 40 ; a motor control unit 50 and a head control unit 52 which are connected to the servo control unit 44 ; and a data channel unit 54 which is connected to the data flow unit 46 .
- the memory 42 is shown as a single hardware component in FIG. 2, it is actually preferably constituted by a read only memory (ROM) storing a program to be executed by the MPU 38 , and a working random access memory (RAM).
- ROM read only memory
- RAM working random access memory
- the servo control unit 44 manages speed control for the motors 34 and 36 and position control for the head assembly 28 by transmitting the respective control signals to the motor control unit 50 and the head control unit 52 .
- the motor and head control units 50 and 52 respond to these control signals by physically driving the motors 34 , 36 and the head assembly 28 , respectively.
- the data flow unit 46 compresses data to be written on the tape 20 , decompresses data read from the tape 20 and corrects errors, and is connected not only to the data channel unit 54 but also to the interface control unit 48 .

That is, when data is written to the tape 20 , it performs digital-analog conversion and modulation for data received from the data flow unit 46 , and when data is read from the tape 20 , it performs analog-digital conversion and demodulation for data read by the head assembly 28 .
- FIG. 3 An exemplary arrangement of data and servo tracks on the tape 20 is shown in FIG. 3 in which blank portions represent data track regions, and shaded portions represent servo track regions. As illustrated, the data and servo tracks are alternately arranged in parallel with each other along the longitudinal direction of the tape 20 .
- Such an arrangement of data and servo tracks is well known and is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,432,652 and 5,629,813.
- FIG. 4 Exemplary servo patterns recorded on the servo tracks are shown in FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 (A) illustrates two pattern types of slash and backslash pairs (one pattern type consists of five pairs and the other pattern type consists of four pairs) which appear alternately and repetitively, and (B) illustrates two pattern types of chevron pairs having different orientations (again, one pattern type consists of five pairs and the other pattern type consists of four pairs) which appear alternately and repetitively.
- These servo patterns are also well known, for example, the pattern of (A) is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/370256, and the pattern of (B) is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,689,384 and 5,930,065.
- the timing based servo is based on these servo patterns which consists of magnetic transitions recorded in non-parallel directions, as is apparent from the drawing, and are read by a special servo head (not shown) included in the
- FIG. 5 The process for reading the servo pattern consisting of the slash and backslash pairs shown in FIG. 4 (A) will now be described with reference to FIG. 5 . It should be noted that a similar process is performed for reading the servo pattern of FIG. 4 (B).
- a servo head (not shown) is positioned on a center line of the servo track which is denoted by a chain line 60 .
- the servo head reads the servo pattern and transmits its read signal to the MPU 38 via the data channel unit 54 and the data flow unit 46 .
- the MPU 38 Upon receipt of the servo pattern read signal, the MPU 38 measures an intra-pattern interval A and an inter-pattern interval B shown in FIG.
- the interval A is an interval between non-parallel paired stripes in one repetitive pattern, and as the head moves across the width of the tape 20 (vertical direction in FIG. 5 ), its value increases or decreases accordingly.
- the interval B is an interval between two adjacent repetitive patterns, and its value does not change even when the head moves across the width of the tape 20 .
- the timing based servo uses such characteristics of the intervals A and B to position the head.
- the MPU 38 uses the count values A and B to calculate a position error signal (PES) according to the following equation.
- PES position error signal
- the denominator “Filter(B)” denotes that a low-pass filter is applied to the B counter in accordance with the present invention.
- a low-pass filter may have a structure such as shown in FIG. 6 .
- the filter coefficients Bi are set to optimum values through simulation at design time. Although the number of filter coefficients Bi in the example of FIG. 6 is five, it may be varied in accordance with filter design.
- the servo system may not be stabilized depending on the combination of a particular tape cartridge and tape drive. That is, if a singular frequency overlaps in the count value B included in the denominator of the PES calculation equation (1), the frequency component is amplified so that the head positioning is adversely affected. Therefore, the present invention stabilizes the servo system by re-setting the coefficients of the low-pass filter each time a tape cartridge is inserted into the tape drive, in accordance with the process shown in FIG. 7 .
- the re-setting of the filter coefficients is started when the cartridge 14 is inserted into the tape drive 12 (step 71 ).
- the servo pattern is read, and the above described A and B counts included in a portion of the pattern having a predetermined length (e.g., 1000 to 2000 count values) are stored in the memory 42 .
- a fast Fourier transform FFT
- windows having a predetermined width are set in order to find any singularity in the frequency components. In this embodiment, the following two windows having center frequencies 1.5 KHz and 2.0 KHz, respectively, and extending by ⁇ 250 Hz therefrom are set up.
- Second window 2.0 KHz ⁇ 250 Hz
- step 75 it is determined whether a singularity is present in the windows.
- the following expression is used to find the singularity.
- med(f) denotes a median for a string of signals in the windows centering around the above two frequencies
- x(i) denotes the i-th signal value (spectrum value of frequency) in each window
- (Th) denotes a predetermined threshold value.
- the spectrum obtained by the FFT has a resolution of 2 8 , ranging from 0 to 255.
- the threshold value (Th) is set to 2 5 .
- a mere average value is not preferable in the above expression (2) because it becomes large if multiple singularities are present.
- a median denotes a center value when the spectrum values in the window are arranged in order of magnitude.
- step 75 If no singularity is found in either window at step 75 , the process proceeds to step 76 to use default filter coefficients.
- the default filter coefficient BD 1 shown in FIG. 6 is one, and the others (BA 1 , BA 2 , BB 1 and BB 2 ) are zero.
- Such a filter is called “identity filter” which outputs its input as it is.
- step 77 determines whether the singularity falls within the range of the simulation.
- predetermined sets three sets in the following example
- step 78 one of three filters is selected in accordance with the singularity found. These filters are ( 1 ) an identity filter, ( 2 ) a low-pass filter having a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz, and ( 3 ) a low-pass filter having a cutoff frequency of 1 KHz.
- the low-pass filters ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are designed to cancel out the power spectrum at a singularity. These filters can be obtained by properly setting the above described filter coefficients Bi. Of course, as different designs of tape drives and tape cartridges are adopted, the number of filters to be prepared in advance and the cutoff frequencies may be varied accordingly.
- the identity filter ( 1 ) is selected because, as is apparent from the PES calculation equation, the singularities are normalized and no particular problem arises.
- the identity filter is synonymous with no filter. A problem would arise, however, if a frequency component overlaps in the B count. Therefore, if a singularity is found in the B count in the first window, the low-pass filter ( 2 ) is selected to remove its adverse effects. Also, if a singularity is found in the B count in the second window, the low-pass filter ( 3 ) is selected.
- FIG. 8 illustrates the waveforms of the A and B counts obtained at step 72
- FIG. 9 illustrates the waveforms obtained by the fast Fourier transform at step 73
- the vertical axes in FIG. 8 represent the pulse count values of the A and B counters, and the horizontal axes represent time (milliseconds).
- the vertical axes in FIG. 9 represent the frequency spectrum (intensity of each frequency for the pulse counts) after the fast Fourier transform, and the horizontal axes represent frequencies (Hz).
- the graphs in FIG. 9 indicate that each of the A and B counts has a singularity S near 1.8 KHz. Therefore, the identity filter ( 1 ) is selected in this case.
- Other waveforms for the A and B counts are shown in FIG.
- FIG. 11 waveforms after the fast Fourier transform are shown in FIG. 11 .
- the A count does not satisfy the condition of the expression ( 2 ) (no singularity), and only the B count has a singularity S near 1.8 KHz. Therefore, the low-pass filter ( 3 ) is selected.
- FIGS. 9 and 11 there is a region in which a projected portion (singularity S) is found in a relatively flat waveform, and another region in which multiple such projected portions or impulse-like signals are present.
- an impulse-like singularity may be detected in a flat portion by calculating a difference between the average value and each signal value in a range (window) of a signal string, and determining a signal value having a large difference as a singularity.
- a singularity is very large, or if multiple impulse-like signals are present in one window, it would be difficult to detect a correct singularity merely by using the average value.
- a median is used instead of the average value as described above.
- a rank order value may be used instead of a median.
- a median is classified as a special rank order value.
- rank(f,r) represents a rank order filter
- f is a signal string within some range
- r is a position where a rank value is obtained.
- a rank order filter is described, for example, in Ryo Taguchi, “Nonlinear Digital Filter—Median Filter and Load Median Filter”, System Control Information Institute, System/Control/Information, Vol. 40, No. 9, pp. 410-418, 1996.
- the servo pattern may be a non-parallel pattern other than the slash and backslash pair pattern and the chevron pattern.
- the coefficients may be recalculated each time a tape cartridge is inserted, instead of preparing the filter coefficients in advance.
