Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to encoding speech, and more particularly to encoding speech at low bit rates using lookup tables.
- Vocoders compress and decompress speech data. Their purpose is to reduce the number of bits required for transmission of intelligible digitized speech.
- Most vocoders include an encoder and a decoder.
- the encoder characterizes frames of input speech and produces a bitstream for transmission to the decoder.
- the decoder receives the bitstream and simulates speech from the characterized speech information contained in the bitstream. Simulated speech quality typically decreases as bit rates decrease because less information about the speech is transmitted.
- CELP-type Code Excited Linear Prediction
- the encoder estimates a speaker's speech characteristics, and calculates the approximate pitch.
- the vocoder also characterizes the "residual" underlying the speech by comparing the residual in the speech frame with a table containing pre-stored residual samples. An index to the closest-fitting residual sample, coefficients describing the speech characteristics, and the pitch are packed into a bitstream and sent to the decoder.
- the decoder extracts the index, coefficients, and pitch from the bitstream and simulates the frame of speech.
- Computational methods employed by prior-art vocoders are typically user independent. These vocoders employ a generic speech characteristic model which contains entries for an extremely broad and expansive set of possible speech characteristics. Accordingly, regardless of who the speaker is, the vocoder uses the same table and executes the same algorithm. In CELP-type vocoders, generic speech characteristic models can be optimized for a particular language, but are not optimized for a particular speaker.

- the method and apparatus of the present invention provide a low bit-rate vocoder which produces high quality transmitted speech.
- the vocoder of the present invention uses a dynamic user-specific speech characteristics model (SCM) table and a user-specific input stimulus table.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM is optimized to include entries from an appropriate underlying generic speech characteristics model (SCM) based on the speech patterns and characteristics of the user.
- SCM generic speech characteristics model
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table is adapted to include user-specific speech patterns and characteristics from the optimal available underlying generic SCMs.
- the optimal underlying generic SCM chosen provides the most efficient speech encoding within the minimum specified error rates.
- the ability to update and change the dynamic user-specific SCM table based on different underlying generic SCMs allows more efficient use of memory space, faster sorting time, and fewer bits required to encode a speech pattern for transmission. This results because it allows the dynamic user-specific SCM table to contain only those speech characteristic model entries actually used by the user.
- a dynamic user-specific SCM table is built by choosing an optimal generic SCM which most closely matches the speech characteristics of the user, and then extracting a subset of the optimal generic SCM including only those optimal generic SCM entries that the user actually uses. Furthermore, the dynamic user-specific SCM table is updated during the call such that if the user's voice has changed slightly, as for example when the user has a cold, the table is updated in realtime to more accurately represent the user's voice.
- Standardized models published by the ITU include Recommendation G.728 (coding of speech at 16 Kbits/sec using low-delay code-excited linear prediction methods) and Recommendation G.279 (coding of speech at 8 Kbits/sec using conjugate structure algebraic-code-excited linear prediction methods).
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimulus table are stored within a communication unit (CU) or in an external storage device (e.g., a User Information Card (SIM card) or a control facility memory device).
- a "transmit vocoder” is a vocoder that is encoding speech samples and a "receive vocoder” is a vocoder that is decoding the speech.
- the transmit vocoder or the receive vocoder can be located within a CU or in a control facility that provides service to telephones which do not have vocoder equipment.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimulus table for the transmit vocoder user are sent to the receive vocoder to be used in the decoding process.
- the speech from the transmit vocoder user is characterized by determining table entries which most closely match the user's speech. Information describing these table entries is sent to the receive vocoder.
- information and statistics of the user's speech characteristics are collected and compared to the current information in the dynamic user-specific SCM.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table is updated on the user's CU, and changes to the user-specific SCM table are sent to the remote CU which updates its copy of the user's dynamic user-specific SCM table. Accordingly, changes in the user's speech characteristics are updated in realtime as the call progresses. Because the method and apparatus utilize user customized tables, speech quality is enhanced and the same quality is achieved throughout the call even when the user's voice changes. In addition, the use of tables allows the characterized speech to be transmitted at a low bit rate.

- a CF that has the registered user's tables in storage sends the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimulus table to both the transmit vocoder and the receive vocoder. Subsequently, during the call itself, the dynamic user-specific SCM table is continuously updated as the user's speech characteristics change. This allows variations in the user's voice to be reflected accurately when reproduced by the receiving end of the call.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table stored on the SIM card, in CU memory, or in CF memory can be updated with the changes contained in the updated user-specific SCM table.

- CF 44 includes a vocoder which enables CF 44 to decode encoded speech signals before sending the speech signals through PSTN 50 to conventional telephone 52.

- satellites e., satellites 14, FIG. 1
- MCUs e.g., MCUs 42, MG. 2
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an operational system in accordance with the principles of the invention.
- the flow diagram assumes in step 501 that the user is setting up a new account (e.g., when the user buys a new phone or registers a different person to the phone).
- the phone enters training mode to learn the user's voice and speech patterns.
- the training task is performed by the CU.
- the training task can be performed by other devices (e.g., a CF).
- speech data is collected from the user and an dynamic user-specific SCM table and an input stimulus table am created for that user.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimulus table can be generated in a compressed or uncompressed form.
- the user is also given a user identification ID number.
- the training task is either performed before a call attempt is made, or is performed during vocoder initialization.
- the training task is performed, for example, when the user executes a series of keypresses to reach the training mode. These keypresses can be accompanied by display messages from the CU designed to lead the user through the training mode.
- the CU prompts the user to speak.
- the user can be requested to repeat a predetermined sequence of statements.
- the statements can be designed to cover a broad range of sounds.
- the user can be requested to say anything that the user wishes.
- a frame of speech data is collected.
- a frame of speech data is desirably a predetermined amount of speech (e.g., 30 msec) in the form of digital samples.
- the digital samples are collected by a speech input device (e.g., speech input device 66, FIG. 3) which includes an analog-to-digital converter that converts the analog speech waveform into the sequence of digital samples.
- an SCM entry from an optimal generic SCM for the speech frame is determined.
- the optimal generic SCM for the speech frame is preferably the generic SCM available which most closely matches the speech characteristics of the user over the majority of collected speech frames.
- the SCM entry is a representation of the characteristics of the speech frame.
- the SCM entry is added to the user's dynamic user-specific SCM table.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table contains a list of optimal generic SCM entries obtained from the user's speech frames. Each of the dynamic user-specific SCM table entries represent different characteristics of the user's speech.
- the size of the dynamic user-specific SCM table is somewhat arbitrary. The table should be large enough to provide a representative range of dynamic user-specific SCMs, but should be small enough that the time required to search the dynamic user-specific SCM table is not unacceptably long.
- each dynamic user-specific SCM table entry has an associated counter which represents the number of times the same or a substantially similar dynamic user-specific SCM entry has occurred during the training task.
- Each new dynamic user-specific SCM entry is analyzed to determine whether it is substantially similar to a dynamic user-specific SCM table entry already in the dynamic user-specific SCM table.
- the counter is incremented.
- the counter represents the frequency of each dynamic user-specific SCM table entry. In a preferred embodiment, this information is used later in when sorting the dynamic user-specific SCM table and in encoding collected speech frames.
- the input stimulus table contains a list of input stimulus from the user.
- the input stimulus can be raw or filtered speech data. Similar to the dynamic user-specific SCM table, the size of the input stimulus table is arbitrary. In a preferred embodiment, a counter is also associated with each input stimulus table entry to indicate the frequency of substantially similar input stimuli occurring.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table entries and the input stimulus table entries are sorted, preferably by frequency of occurrence. As indicated by the dynamic user-specific SCM and input stimulus counters associated with each entry, the more frequently occurring table entries will be placed higher in the respective tables. In an alternate embodiment, the dynamic user-specific SCM table entries and input stimulus table entries are left in an order that does not indicate the frequency of occurrence.
- the input stimulus table entries and dynamic user-specific SCM table entries are then preferably assigned transmission codes.
- the frequency statistics can be used to develop a set of transmission codewords for the input stimuli entries and dynamic user-specific SCM entries, where the most frequently used stimuli and dynamic user-specific SCM table entries are the shortest transmission codeword.
- the purpose of encoding the input stimulus table entries is to minimize the number of bits that need to be sent to the receive vocoder during the update task.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table, input stimulus table, and user ID are stored on the user's SIM card.
- they are stored on the user's SIM card. Storing the information on the SIM card allows rapid access to the information without using the CU's memory storage space.
- the user can remove the SIM card from the CU and carry the SIM card just as one would carry a credit card.
- the SIM card can also contain other information the user needs to use a CU.
- the information can be stored in the CU's memory storage device (e.g., memory device 64, FIG. 3).
- the CU can send the dynamic user-specific SCM table and the input stimulus table through the communication system to a control facility (e.g., CF 20, FIG. 1).
- a control facility e.g., CF 20, FIG. 1).
- the tables are needed (i.e., during vocoder initialization), they are sent to the transmit vocoder and the receive vocoder.
- Information for one or more users can be stored on a SIM card
- a generic SCM is chosen as the underlying generic SCM and pared down to a more compact table, namely the dynamic user-specific SCM table, which allows the same quality voice to be transmitted using fewer bits.
- the phone learns the user's speech patterns and impediments.
- the phone evaluates the user's speech patterns and impediments in light of one or more generic SCMs, chooses the generic SCM which contains the closest match to the user's speech, develops a set of user-specific input stimuli and enters them into a user specific input stimuli table, extracts those model entries from the chosen generic SCM that are actually used by the user during speech into a dynamic user-specific SCM table, correlates the input stimuli table entries with the dynamic user-specific SCM table entries, sorts the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimuli table preferably in order of frequency of use, and assigns a transmission code to each dynamic user-specific SCM table entry.
- the transmission code is shortest in length for the most frequently used speech and longest for the least frequently used speech.
- a suitable sorting algorithm for this approach is the well-known Huffman coding algorithm.
- step 507 the user operates the phone.
- the user inserts the SIM card into a CU 12, 28, 42, 54 in step 509.
- the SIM card contains the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimuli, and preferably a number of different generic SCMS.
- the call is set up in step 511 by dialing the destination number and exchanging dynamic user-specific SCM tables and input stimuli tables. This allows each phone to encode speech according to the user's specific speech configuration parameters, and also to decode speech encoded using the user's specific configuration parameters.
- the transmitting CU encodes and transmits speech data according to the dynamic user-specific SCM table, while the receiving CU then decodes the encoded speech using the transmitting CU's dynamic user-specific SCM table.
- a speech frame is collected and compared with entries from the user's user-specific input stimulus table.
- a least squares error measurement between the speech frame and each input stimulus table entry can yield error values that indicate how close a fit each input stimulus table entry is to the speech frame.
- Other comparison techniques can also be applied.
- the input stimulus table entries are stored in a compressed form. The speech frame and the input stimulus table entries should be compared when both are in a compressed or an uncompressed form.
- the entire table need not be searched to find a table entry that is sufficiently close to the speech frame.
- Table entries need only be evaluated until the comparison yields an error that is within an acceptable limit.
- the CU then preferably stores the index to the closest input stimulus table entry.
- an SCM is calculated for the speech frame.
- the SCM can be calculated by using vocoder techniques common to those of skill in the art. Where multiple generic SCMs exist, an SCM is calculated for the speech frame using each generic SCM. The calculated SCM which generates the most efficient encoding while meeting a minimum specified error rate is preferably chosen as the returned calculated SCM. The calculated SCM is then compared with the user's dynamic user-specific SCM table entries. The comparison can be, for example, a determination of the least squares error between the calculated SCM and each dynamic user-specific SCM table entry. The most closely matched dynamic user-specific SCM table entry is determined. The closest dynamic user-specific SCM table entry is the entry having the smallest error.
- the entire table need not be searched to find a table entry that is sufficiently close to the calculated SCM.
- Table entries need only be evaluated until the comparison yields an error that is within an acceptable limit.
- the CU then desirably stores the index to the closest dynamic user-specific SCM table entry.
- a bitstream is then generated by the transceiver.
- the bitstream contains the closest dynamic user-specific SCM index and the closest input stimulus index.
- the bitstream also includes error control bits to achieve a required bit error ratio for the channel.
- the receiving CU decodes the transmitted bitstream using the user's dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimulus table that were previously sent to the receiving CU during call setup.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM index is extracted from the bitstream. This index is used to look up the dynamic user-specific SCM table entry in the user's dynamic user-specific SCM table.
- the input stimulus information is also extracted from the bitstream. This index is used to look up the input stimulus table entry in the user's user-specific input stimuli table that was sent to the receiving CU during call setup.
- the vocoder processor then excites the uncampressed version of the dynamic user-specific SCM table entry, which models the transmitting user's speech characteristics for this speech frame, is excited with the input stimulus table entry. This produces a frame of simulated speech which is output to an audio output device.
- the transmitting CU sends encoded speech data and the receiving CU decodes it to generate speech that sounds like the transmitting CU's user, while using fewer transmitted bits.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table is continuously updated, as shown in step 515. This is useful, for example, when the transmitting user has a cold.
- the transmitting CU preferably operates to fine tune the dynamic user-specific SCM table during the course of the conversation. This fine tuning can include finding a more optimal underlying generic SCM from the available generic SCMs which matches the changing speech characteristics of the user, and adding, modifying, and deleting entries from the copies of the dynamic user-specific SCM table used by both the transmitting CU and the receiving CU.
- the determination of whether a change should be made to the dynamic user-specific SCM table is preferably determined by comparing the calculated SCM of the speech frame with the dynamic user-specific SCM table entries. When the calculated SCM is substantially the same as any entry, the entry's counter is incremented and the dynamic user-specific SCM table is restored if necessary. When the calculated SCM is not substantially the same as any entry, the calculated SCM can replace a dynamic user-specific SCM table entry having a low incidence of occurrence.
- the input stimulus table is preferably updated in a similar fashion.
- Updates to the receiving CU's copy of the dynamic user-specific SCM are preferably accomplished by sending table updates to the receiving CU as part of the bitstream for the speech frame that is generated and sent to the receiving CU, or during gaps in the conversation. Table updates are thus performed during the call as the user's speech characteristics change.
- Step 515 is shown as a branch in the flow chart to indicate that this feature can be implemented to be switched on or off as the user desires by a switch, a button on the phone, or by programming a sequence of numbers via the keyboard on the phone.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimuli table can be saved to the SIM card, CU memory, or CF memory as shown in step 521.
- the CU can be configured to maintain the original dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimuli table.
- One reason for maintaining the original tables occurs in the situation where the registered user allows a new user to use the CU. If an unregistered user speaks into a CU that is registered to a registered user, the quality of speech is likely to be low initially. As the unregistered user speaks, the CU updates the dynamic user-specific SCM table to match the unregistered user's voice, as shown in step 515, or alternatively can be configured to maintain the initial registered user's dynamic user-specific SCM and input stimuli tables by not storing the updated tables upon termination of the call (i.e., by not performing step 521). The determination of whether or not to update the user-specific tables upon termination of the call can be switchably configurable.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating a procedure for setting up a call (see step 511 in FIG. 5).
- a user initiates a call.
- the transmitting CU reads information from the inserted SIM card, including the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimuli unique to the user.
- the receiving CU answers the transmitting CU in step 605.
- the transmitting CU determines whether it is connecting through a control facility to connect to a public switched telephone network (PSTN). This step is necessary because the setup is slightly different between the two types of connections. If it is not a control facility, then the receiving CU is another cellular phone, so a cellular-phone-to-cellular-phone connection must be made.
- PSTN public switched telephone network
- step 609 the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimuli table are transferred from the transmitting CU to the receiving CU to allow the receiving CU to be able to decode the transmitted speech that is encoded by the transmitting CU.
- step 611 the receiving CU's dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimuli table are transferred from the receiving CU to the transmitting CU so that the transmitting CU can decode speech sent to it by the receiving CU. If the call is connecting through a control facility, then the receiving CU is connected through a PSTN. In this case, all of the speech decoding must be performed at the control facility since conventional telephones do not have this capability.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table and input stimuli table is transferred from the transmitting CU to the control facility, where it is stored and used to decode speech received from the transmitting CU before sending the speech on to the receiving CU over the PSTN.
- a default SCM model is transferred to the control facility for use in encoding speech received from the receiving CU before transferring the speech to the transmitting CU.
- the control facility itself could comprise one or more generic SCM models and training means for optimizing the receiving party's speech encoding as the call progresses.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating a process for updating the dynamic user-specific SCM table in accordance with the invention.
- the dynamic user-specific SCM table can be updated during setup of a new account, during an initialization process, and dynamically during a conversation while a call is in progress.
- the phone can include a switch or button which is set to one mode to store updates of the dynamic user-specific SCM table, or can be programmed to do so by pressing a combination of buttons, or can be set to automatically store updates.
- the transmitting CU collects new speech information. The new speech information is compared to the old speech information contained in the dynamic user-specific SCM and input stimuli tables, if they exist, in step 703.
- transmitting CUs have access to more than one generic SCM, each of which being tailored to a different type of speaker.
- a determination must be made of which model to use when calculating an SCM for a speech frame and for updating the dynamic user-specific SCM table.
- FIG. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment for determining a calculated SCM for a speech frame.
- a speech frame is collected in step 802.
- An SCM is calculated for the speech frame using each available generic SCM in step 804.
- a determination is made as to whether more than one generic SCMs exist.
- the multiple calculated SCMs are compared and the calculated SCM which generates the most efficient encoding while meeting a minimum specified error rate is preferably chosen in step 808.
- the calculated SCM, or chosen calculated SCM if more than one generic SCM exists, is returned as the calculated SCM in step 810.
- One embodiment of the above-described method and apparatus for transmitting high-quality low-bit-rate speech employs a SIM card which stores the dynamic user-specific SCM table and user-specific input stimuli tables. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that dynamic user-specific SCM tables and input stimulus tables for more than one user can be stored on a single SIM card. Furthermore, information for multiple users can be stored in a CU memory device. In another alternate embodiment multiple user information could be stored in a CF memory device. One method for operating with multiple users' information stored is to include user ID information for each user. One embodiment for determining the current user's user ID information is to require the user to enter a passcode on the keypad of the communication unit. Alternatively, the communication unit could contain signal processing means to determine the user's user ID information based on the speech characteristics of the current user's voice.
- the method and apparatus for transmitting high-quality low-bit-rate speech described herein provides many significant improvements over the prior art.
- a dynamic user-specific SCM table which is unique to the user, speaker recognition and resolution is greatly improved, and background and quantization noise is reduced.
- the use of a user-specific input stimuli table adds another layer of quality and speaker recognition to the speech signal at the receiver's terminal.
- the user-specific input stimuli table operates as a statistically-derived "dictionary" of the user's most frequently used input stimuli, further compressed in codeword output by use of Huffman coding, or any other similar compression algorithm, and permits the input stimuli to be transmitted with the lowest possible overall bit rate.
