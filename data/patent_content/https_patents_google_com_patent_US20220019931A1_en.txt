Description
- This specification relates to quantum computing.
- Applications of quantum computing include quantum simulation. The simulation of quantum systems has applications in a variety of different areas ranging from pharmaceutical synthesis to the design of novel catalysts and materials. However, simulating complex quantum systems using classical techniques is untenable due to the exponential scaling of required resources as a function of system size N. Quantum computers and quantum simulation techniques offer potential solutions to this task.

- The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular ways so as to realize one or more of the following advantages.
- Applications of quantum computing for quantum chemistry typically focus on the solutions of hard problems within a reduced space, called the active space. Restricting to the active space enables the number of qubits required to solve parts (e.g., essential parts) of hard chemistry problems to be reduced. However, this reduction is not exact. While the essential physics of the problem may be captured, important effects such as electronic cusps that make quantitative accuracy difficult to achieve are neglected. Computation and/or simulation results can therefore be inaccurate.
- To capture these additional important effects additional basis functions—which can translate to additional qubits and increased quantum gate complexity during the physical implementation of the quantum simulations—are required. In most applications, the number of additional basis functions/qubits can be very large. Therefore, determining accurate solutions to such problems can be extremely difficult and costly—particularly when using near- or intermediate-term quantum computers, e.g., noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices with numbers of qubits ranging from tens to hundreds.
- The present specification introduces quantum simulation techniques that extend beyond the active space without requiring additional qubits or quantum gate complexity. Accordingly, quantum simulations performed using the presently described techniques reintroduce important physical effects and can achieve improved simulation accuracy. The methods achieve an exponential advantage over their classical counterparts in the treatment of the active space and active-space reference. In addition, optional approximations that can be implemented to increase the efficiency of the quantum simulation scheme are introduced. These optional approximations can reduce the number of measurement operations required by the quantum simulation scheme, thus decreasing the amount of quantum computational resources used in the quantum simulation.
- The presently described techniques are particularly suitable for performing quantitatively accurate calculations for chemical systems on near-term or intermediate-term quantum computers. In the long term, the techniques may also be used for the competitiveness of fault-tolerant approaches to simulating quantum systems, e.g., chemical systems. By determining matrix elements and overlap matrices in the active space using the quantum computing device, and using a classical computing device to perform pre-computation and/or post processing to determine physical properties of the system from the matrix elements and overlap matrices, the method is effectively optimized to run on a hybrid quantum-classical computing device.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- This specification describes techniques for simulating quantum systems, e.g., systems characterized by the electronic structure Hamiltonian. When simulating a quantum system, a discretization of space (or basis set) can be selected to represent the quantum system. The blocks used to divide space are called basis functions, and a number of canonical choices of bases are known, e.g., linear combinations of atomic orbitals and plane waves. Once the basis is selected, the Hamiltonian that characterizes the quantum system can be expressed using the selected basis. For example, the electronic structure Hamiltonian can be written in its canonical form as
-
- where each index i,j,k,l corresponds to one basis function in the chosen basis, hij and kijkl represent standard integrals over the involved basis functions, and the ladder operators at, a satisfy the canonical fermionic anti-commutation relations {ai †, aj}=δij, {ai, aj}={ai †,aj †}=0.
- The accuracy that can be achieved for a simulation of a quantum system is dependent on the number of basis functions in the selected basis. That is, generally, increasing the number of basis functions increases the accuracy of the simulation. However, using too many basis functions can make the simulation task impractical or can be wasteful of resources when more insightful treatments may instead be used.
- One method that was first used in traditional quantum chemistry and has been adopted by the quantum computing community is the active space approximation. The physical intuition behind the active space approximation is that the discretized space may be divided into a portion which exhibits strong correlations or entanglement—the active space—and a portion that while important, exhibits only low rank contributions that can be well treated perturbatively—the virtual space. However, the size of the essential quantum component or active space remains limited on a classical computer, and to date the contributions of virtuals have remained absent on a quantum computer.
- This specification describes quantum simulation techniques and systems that extend beyond the active space approximation without requiring additional qubits or gate complexity. One example technique includes leveraging quantum subspace expansion to reintroduce contributions from the virtual space in a systematic manner to improve simulation accuracy. Another example technique uses orbital relaxations to remove the active-space approximation and reduce circuit depth.

FIG. 1 depicts anexample system 100 for simulating a quantum system. Theexample system 100 is an example of a system implemented as classical and quantum computer programs on one or more classical computers and quantum computing devices in one or more locations, in which the systems, components, and techniques described in this specification can be implemented. - The
system 100 may receive as input data specifying a physical system that is to be modeled or simulated, e.g., input data 106. For example, the received data may represent a material, e.g., a metal or polymer, a single molecule or a chemical. The input data may include data representing a Hamiltonian characterizing the physical system that is to be modeled or simulated, e.g., an electronic structure Hamiltonian. - The
system 100 may generate as output data representing results of a simulation of the physical system of interest, e.g., output data 108. The generated output data may be provided for further processing or analyzing. For example, in cases where the physical system is a material, e.g., a metal or polymer, the generated output data may include data representing a simulated ground state of the physical system that may be used to determine properties of the material, e.g., its resistance or conductivity. As another example, in cases where the physical system is a chemical, the generated output data may be used to determine properties of the chemical, e.g., a rate of a chemical reaction. - The
system 100 includesquantum hardware 102 in data communication with aclassical processor 104. For convenience, theclassical processor 104 andquantum computing hardware 102 are illustrated as separate entities, however in some implementations theclassical processor 104 can be included inquantum computing hardware 102, e.g., thequantum computing hardware 102 can include one or more components for performing classical computing operations. - The
quantum hardware 102 includes components for performing quantum computation, e.g., the quantum simulation procedures described in this specification. For example, thequantum hardware 102 includesmultiple qubits 110 andcontrol devices 112 for controlling thequbits 110 and causing algorithmic operations or quantum computations to be performed. - The
multiple qubits 110 are physical qubits used to perform algorithmic operations or quantum computations. The specific physical realization of thequbits 110 included in thequantum computing hardware 102 and how they interact with one another is dependent on a variety of factors including the type of quantum computations that thequantum computing hardware 102 is performing (which in turn can depend on the physical system being simulated). For example, in some implementations the qubits may include qubits that are physically realized via atomic, molecular or solid-state quantum systems. In other implementations the qubits may include superconducting qubits, e.g., Gmon qubits, or semi-conducting qubits. In other implementations ion traps, photonic devices or superconducting cavities (with which states may be prepared without requiring qubits) may be used. Further examples of physical realizations of qubits include fluxmon qubits, silicon quantum dots or phosphorus impurity qubits. - The type of
control devices 112 included in thequantum hardware 102 depends on the type ofqubits 110 included in thequantum hardware 102. For example, in some cases thequbits 110 can be frequency tunable. In these cases, each qubit may have associated operating frequencies that can be adjusted using one ormore control devices 112, e.g., an excitation pulse generator and control lines that couple the qubits to the excitation pulse generator. Example operating frequencies include qubit idling frequencies, qubit interaction frequencies, and qubit readout frequencies. Different frequencies correspond to different operations that the qubit can perform. For example, setting the operating frequency to a corresponding idling frequency may put the qubit into a state where it does not strongly interact with other qubits, and where it may be used to perform single-qubit gates. As another example, in cases where qubits interact via couplers with fixed coupling, qubits can be configured to interact with one another by setting their respective operating frequencies at some gate-dependent frequency detuning from their common interaction frequency. In other cases, e.g., when the qubits interact via tunable couplers, qubits can be configured to interact with one another by setting the parameters of their respective couplers to enable interactions between the qubits and then by setting the qubit's respective operating frequencies at some gate-dependent frequency detuning from their common interaction frequency. Such interactions may be performed in order to perform multi-qubit gates. - The
control devices 112 may further include devices, e.g., readout resonators, that are configured to perform measurements on thequbits 110 and provide measurement results to theclassical processors 104 for processing and analyzing. - The
classical processor 204 includes components for performing classical computation, e.g., the classical post-processing procedures described in this specification. -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of anexample process 200 for simulating a quantum system characterized by a respective Hamiltonian using quantum subspace expansion. For convenience, theprocess 200 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more classical and quantum computing devices located in one or more locations. For example, a quantum computation system, e.g., thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform theprocess 200. - The system selects a first set of basis functions for the simulation (step 202). The system may then define the Hamiltonian using the selected first set of basis functions. For example, as described above, in some cases the Hamiltonian may be an electronic structure Hamiltonian. In these cases the electronic structure Hamiltonian can be written in the canonical form given by Equation (1) above where each index value for i,j,k,l in Equation (1) corresponds to a respective basis function.
- The first set of basis functions includes a set of core orbitals
- The system can determine which elements of the first set of basis functions belong in each subset
- The system defines a set of expansion operators Oi (step 204). The expansion operators include operators that approximate fermionic excitations on the active space
- In Equation (2), a†, a represent fermionic annihilation and creation operators. The number of expansion operators in the defined set is determined by the number of original basis functions, in combinations with which have been labeled as core, active, or virtual by the classical pre-step described above. If the indices in Equation (2) are counted for the size of
- The system performs multiple quantum computations to determine a matrix representation of a target operator (corresponding to a target observable for the simulation) in a second set of basis functions (step 206). For convenience, the below description continues using the example of the electronic structure Hamiltonian as the target operator (where energy is the target observable), however other target operators and observables may be used (depending on the simulation being performed). The calculation of such matrix elements by a classical computational device is typically highly computationally costly, especially for states that exhibit strong correlations and/or entanglement. By contrast, the use of quantum computation to determine the matrix elements inherently takes the strong correlations and/or entanglement into account.
- Each basis function in the second set of basis functions is defined via application of a respective expansion operator Oi to a reference wavefunction |Ψref
- To determine each matrix element Hij, the system can repeatedly prepare the wavefunction |Ψref
- In some implementations the second set of basis functions {Oi|Ψref
- Again, to determine each matrix element Sij, the system can repeatedly prepare the wavefunction |Ψref
- The expansion operators defined in
step 204 and Equation (2) above include expansion operators that act, in principle, on qubits that define the active space - For example, in some implementations step 206 may include determining, through measurement, a matrix element given by Equation (5) below.
- In Equation (5), Greek letters represent virtual orbitals. Performing a classical pre-computation in this case may include contracting the operators on the virtual space in Equation (5) using Wick's theorem to obtain an alternative representation as given below in Equation (6).

- In Equation (6), Δξη,μv=δξvδημ−δξμδηv,
x (y ) represents x(y) changing to another value in the summation (e.g., ī=j for x) andx †ay apaq - The expansion operators defined in Equation (2) include single and double excitations with respect to the reference wavefunction |Ψref
process 200 will grow as NA (4+2k). As this number is increased, the expected accuracy of both the ground state and approximations to excited states will increase, however the cost of measurement will as well. - The system uses the determined matrix representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian H and the determined overlap matrix S to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the electronic structure Hamiltonian (step 210). That is, the system may perform classical computations to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem given by Equation (7) below.
-
HC=SCE (7) - In Equation (7), C represents a matrix of eigenvectors in the basis {Oi|Ψref
- The system determines properties of the quantum system using the computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors (step 212). For example, in some cases the electronic structure Hamiltonian may characterize the electronic structure of a semiconductor. In these cases simulating the physical system may include simulating properties of the semiconductor, e.g., simulating the conductivity or resistance of the semiconductor. Such simulation results may be used to fabricate semiconductor devices, e.g., integrated circuits. As another example, in some cases the electronic structure Hamiltonian may characterize a catalyst. In these cases simulating the physical system may include simulating properties of the catalyst, e.g., simulating catalytic activity. Such simulation results may be used to fabricate catalysts, e.g., electrocatalysts or biocatalysts.

FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram 300 of the presently described virtual quantum subspace expansion techniques for quantum simulation of a quantum system, e.g., steps 202-210 ofexample process 200 described above. - As described above with reference to step 202 of example process, the techniques separate the orbitals (e.g., including orbital 102) of the quantum system into their core components 104 a, active components 104 b, and virtual components 104 c.
- As described above with reference to steps 204-208 of
example process 200, a quantum computing device 106 simulates the quantum system (i.e., the state of the quantum system represented by a wavefunction) within the active space. Additional measurements are taken within this space. A classical computer 108 combines these additional measurements with classical post-processing from data on the virtual space 104 c to improve the simulation using no additional qubits or circuit depth. - As described above with reference to steps 210-212 of
example process 200, a resulting improved simulated wavefunction(s) can be stored in a mixed quantum-classical representation that may be used to derive target properties of the wavefunction(s). - In some implementations one or more approximations can be introduced into the
example process 200 described above to improve tractability. - One example approximation includes the division of the active space
example process 200 ofFIG. 2 with - Another approximation includes estimating matrix elements of reduced density matrices (RDMs) via cumulant approximations or ensemble variational methods. For example, a series of approximations to a 4-RDM, e.g., as the 4-RDM defined in Equation (6), can be formed using products of lower RDMs and perturbative corrections. Such truncations can reduce the required number of terms to measure back to the number of active space orbitals NA 4, but introduces some approximation to the target observable (e.g., energetic) values. An alternative is to stochastically sample the elements of the approximation to the 4-RDM to measure with increasing degrees of accuracy as time proceeds within a calculation.
-
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of anexample process 400 for simulating a quantum system characterized a respective Hamiltonian using full space orbital relaxation. For convenience, theprocess 400 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more classical and quantum computing devices located in one or more locations. For example, a quantum computation system, e.g., thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 , appropriately programmed in accordance with this specification, can perform theprocess 400. - The system obtains a simulation output from a quantum simulation of the quantum system (step 402). The quantum simulation can be a quantum simulation in active space, e.g., a quantum simulation performed using the active space approximation. The simulation output can be an estimated energy of the quantum system, e.g., an estimated energy associated with the Hamiltonian in active space. For example, in some implementations the Hamiltonian characterizing the quantum system can be an electronic structure Hamiltonian, as given by Equation (1) above. In these implementations the simulation output may include a 2-RDM from the ground state of a corresponding active-space Hamiltonian (the Hamiltonian that results from integrating out the virtual and core degrees of freedom). The system can obtain the simulation output from an active space method such as complete active space configuration interaction (CAS-CI), multi-configuration self-consistent field methods (MCSCF), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), or more generally from any method that outputs a 2-RDM (or N-representable 2-RDM).
- The system performs a classical computation to adjust the simulation output using multiple single-particle rotations U in the full space to obtain an estimated energy of the quantum system characterized by the respective Hamiltonian (i.e., the Hamiltonian in full space) (step 404). Because of Thouless's theorem, the multiple single-particle rotations U can be efficiently implemented as a rotation of the underlying basis of the Hamiltonian (in full space), e.g., Uaj †U†. This rotation of the underlying basis can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. The nonlinear optimization problem follows the variational principle of quantum mechanics by minimizing an objective function that is based on the expected value of the energy for a measured 2-RDM with respect to multiple constraints (unitary rotations of the orbitals) that ensure the wavefunctions remain normalized, physical, and a one-body fermionic rotation. The constraints also ensure that the equations are efficient to evaluate classically once the 2-RDM is known. The nonlinear optimization problem can be given by Equation (8) below.
-
- In Equation (8), U represents a unitary transformation that rotates the underlying basis, i.e., the multiple single-particle rotations, ui,i′ are representations of U in the underlying basis (e.g., ui,i′ is the i-i′th entry of a matrix representation of U), hij and kijkl are as defined in Equation (1) above, and
- In some implementations the system can solve the nonlinear optimization problem given by Equation (8) by parameterizing the unitary transformation U as an exponentiated anti-Hermitian matrix. For example, the system can set
-
U=e X -
with X=Σ p,q t p,q a p † a q -
where t p,q =−t q,p* (9) - In Equation (9), X represents a generator of the unitary U and is an anti-Hermitian matrix.
- In other implementations the system can parametrize the unitary U using Givens rotations. This parametrization uses a set of angles {θ} associated with the set of nonredundant orbital rotation generators. For 2-RDMs obtained from an exact diagonalization of the active-space Hamiltonian, the only non-redundant parameters are single-particle generators associated with pairs of orbitals involving rotations from the active space to the virtual space and active space to the core space. Therefore, the unitary U in Equation (8) can be expressed as a product of Givens matrices:
-
- The optimal rotation of a single angle with respect to the input 2-RDM, one-, and two-electron integrals and a sweep procedure to find an energy minimizing U can be computed using known techniques, e.g., using multi-configurational self-consistent-field method (MCSF) methods for ground and excited states based on full optimizations of successive Jacobi rotations.
- In some implementations the system can iterate between solving the active-space Schrödinger equation (step 402) and full-space single-particle rotations (404), e.g., iteratively perform
example process 400. When the system iteratively performsexample process 400, at the end of each iteration a new basis determined by minimizing the expected value of the Hamiltonian with respect to unitary rotations of the orbitals (determined by solving Equation 8 above) is used as an input for solving the active-space Schrödinger equation in a subsequent iteration. The iterative process can stop when a change in energy between iterations is lower than a predetermined threshold. In other implementations the system can perform a single orbital-relaxation procedure (step 404) once as a post-processing step. - Because of the variational principle, relaxing the orbitals in a single step as post-processing is guaranteed to reduce the energy. Furthermore, if the ground state of the active space is not achieved due to an approximate wave-function ansatz, the system can include additional single-particle orbital rotations between orbital pairs inside the active space in the relaxation. Including these rotations would correspond to an additional linear depth circuit that would have been executed perfectly on the quantum computer at
step 402. However, any circuit that contains single-particle rotations at the end of the circuit can be made shorter by replacing the single particle rotations at the end of the circuit with a classical post-processing step based on single particle rotations as described above (e.g., within the active space and not the full space). - In some
implementations example process 400 can be combined with one or more techniques described above with reference toexample process 200. For example, step 402 may be performed using the techniques described at steps 202-208 ofexample process 200, where the contraction of the expansion operators that act on the virtual space via classical pre-computation in example process 200 (as described insteps 206 and 208) can be replaced with orbital relaxation via classical post processing (step 404).Steps FIG. 3 can then be performed. - Implementations of the digital and/or quantum subject matter and the digital functional operations and quantum operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, suitable quantum circuitry or, more generally, quantum computational systems, in tangibly-embodied digital and/or quantum computer software or firmware, in digital and/or quantum computer hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.

- For a system of one or more digital and/or quantum computers to be “configured to” perform particular operations or actions means that the system has installed on it software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them that in operation cause the system to perform the operations or actions. For one or more digital and/or quantum computer programs to be configured to perform particular operations or actions means that the one or more programs include instructions that, when executed by digital and/or quantum data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions. A quantum computer may receive instructions from a digital computer that, when executed by the quantum computing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the operations or actions.
- Digital and/or quantum computers suitable for the execution of a digital and/or quantum computer program can be based on general or special purpose digital and/or quantum processors or both, or any other kind of central digital and/or quantum processing unit.

- While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features that may be specific to particular implementations. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable sub-combination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a sub-combination or variation of a sub-combination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system modules and components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- Particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. As one example, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In some cases, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
