Definitions
- a web search engine searches for information on the World Wide Web in response to queries submitted by users. Search results can be presented in a list ordered by relevance and can include web pages, images, videos, information and other types of content deemed to be responsive to queries. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or other types of data repositories.
- a web crawler is a tool that systematically visits web sites in order to index their contents. Search engines use indexes built by web crawlers in order to find documents that are relevant to queries. When a user enters a query into a search engine, the engine examines its index and provides a listing of best-matching documents, usually with a short snippet containing the document's title and a portion of the document's text.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method that includes creating a first label on behalf of a first user and a second label on behalf of a second user; receiving an association by the first user of the first label to a first search result in a plurality of first search results that were presented to the first user in response to a query submitted by the first user, and wherein the second user is unable to view the association; receiving an association by the second user of the second label to a second search result in a plurality of second search results that were presented to the second user in response to a query submitted by the second user, and wherein the first user is unable to view the association; granting permission on behalf of the first user to allow the second user to share the second label; and subsequent to granting permission, receiving an association of the first label by the second user to a third search result in a plurality of third search results that were presented to the second user in response to a query submitted by the second user.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program
- a search result can be a web page, an image, a video, a news article or an advertisement.
- the first label and the second label can be identical.
- Concepts can be derived by analyzing content of search results associated with the first label.
- Ad categories can be associated with the first user based on the derived concepts.
- Advertising can be targeted to the first user based on the derived concepts.
- Search results associated with the first label can be published. Receiving an association by the first user of the first label to the first search result can include storing a portion of the first search result as part of the association.

- FIG. 1B illustrates a label repository
- FIG. 2A illustrates an example graphical user interface for presenting query search results.
- FIG. 2B illustrates an example graphical user interface for managing a user's labels.
- FIG. 2C illustrates an example graphical user interface for accepting invitations to share labels.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example online advertising system.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example technique for sharing labels.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of an example label sharing system.
- FIG. 1A illustrates an example of label use.
- a label is a text string that includes one or more characters or symbols.
- a label is an image or a combination of an image and a text string.
- Users can create labels and use them to label content such as web search results (e.g., web pages, images, videos, news articles, products), documents (e.g., word processing and spreadsheet documents), electronic mail (email) messages, and advertisements (“ads”), for example.
- Other types of content which can be labeled are possible.
- Labeled content can be retrieved by the user who created the label. Users can also share their labels with others so that groups of users can collaboratively view and label content.
- labels can be organized in hierarchies.
- Client devices 100 , 102 , and 104 are capable of interacting with server devices (search engine 106 , label server 108 and document server 110 ), by transmitting and receiving data through one or more computer networks such as, for example, the Internet. While the server devices are illustrated as single devices in FIG. 1A , server devices can themselves comprise networks of devices or processes that cooperate to handle requests from, and provide responses to, the client devices. The client devices and the server devices can reside on the same network or on different networks. In further implementations, the functionality of some or all of the server devices can be combined into a single server device.
- User 1 interacting with client device 100 through a software application such as a web browser or other application, submits a query 112 to a search engine 106 .
- the query can comprise text, one or more images, or sounds (e.g., spoken words or phrases), for example.
- the search engine 106 uses one or more indexes of content on the world wide web, or indexes of other content, to identify results responsive to the query.
- the search engine 106 transmits search results 114 to the client device 100 , and the software application executing on the client device 100 presents the results to User 1 .
- the search results can consist of, for instance, references or links to content that satisfy the query, the actual content itself, or combinations thereof.
- FIG. 2A illustrates an example graphical user interface 200 for presenting query search results A, B, C and D.
- the user interface 200 includes four general areas: a query area 201 where users can submit their queries by entering text 202 and selecting a search button 204 with a mouse, or other input device; a search results area for presenting search results responsive to the query, a primary ads area 208 for presenting ads, and a secondary ads area 210 for presenting additional ads.
- Other configurations of the user interface 200 are possible.
- one or more of the search results and/or the ads include an interactive display element ( 208 a - b , 210 a - b , 114 a - d ) of the user interface 200 for optionally assigning a label to the respective search result or ad.
- a label can be assigned to a search result or an ad without the use of a display element.
- a keyboard command, a finger gesture, a voice command, or other type of input can be used instead.
- Other user interfaces are possible, however.
- menu 216 allows the user to select a preexisting label to assign to the search result B or create a new label for the search result B.
- Menu 216 includes label 216 a “Hawaii Trip”, label 216 b “Paris Trip”, label 216 c “AI Project”, and a special menu item 216 d which allows the user to create new labels.
- the menu 216 grows as new labels are added to it.
- client device 100 sends a message 116 to the label server 108 requesting association of search result B with the label “Hawaii Trip”.
- the label server 108 maintains a label repository 142 (see FIG. 1B ) which stores label associations 143 for different users.
- label association 143 a identifies for the label “Hawaii Trip” that the label's owner is User 1
- the label's writer is User 1
- the labeled item is the search result B (see FIG. 2A ).
- a snippet or portion of the search result (e.g., text, images or combinations thereof from the search result) can also be saved in the label association 143 a .
- a label's owner is the user that created the label.
- the label's writer identifies the user who assigned the label to the labeled item. In this case, the owner and the writer are the same user. However, they need not be as in the case of a shared label. Label sharing is described further below.
- FIG. 2B illustrates an example graphical user interface 250 for managing a user's labels.
- One region of the interface presents a list of interactive display elements representing some or all of the user's existing labels 224 .
- An interactive display element 222 can be selected to create a new label.
- Selection of an existing label, such as label 224 a for “Hawaii Trip”, will cause contents associated with that label, or references/links thereto, to be displayed in region 230 according to a content category 228 a - f display element selected in region 228 .
- the content categories in this illustration include web search results 228 a , video search results 228 b , news articles 228 c , product search results 228 d , documents 228 e . Other categories are possible, however.
- the display element 228 f allows the user to select other categories that are not displayed in region 228 .
- the user can select category 228 a “Web”.
- the user can select category 228 d.
- a text field display element 232 where users can enter queries and submit them by selecting a button display element 234 to search content of the currently selected label (e.g., 224 a ), or by selecting a button display element 236 to search the content of all of the user's labels.
- One or more regions (e.g., 226 ) of the user interface 250 , or other user interface, can be reserved for ads.
- Ads can be selected automatically based on the relevance of the ad to the labeled content for a given category (e.g., video 228 b ), to the labeled content for all categories for the currently selected label, or to all content associated with some or all of the user's labels. Ads can also be selected automatically based on keywords, for example. Ads that are presented in region 226 can themselves be labeled by selection of display elements 226 a or 226 b .
- users can also publish their label content to a publicly accessible web page or social networking sites such as Orkut, facebook, and so on, to let a broader audience know about their labeled content.
- Ads can also be selected for these publications based on relevance to the label content or keywords, for instance. Ads are described further below with reference to FIG. 3 .
- a graphical display element 240 Users can invite others to share their labels by selecting a graphical display element 240 , for example.
- graphical user interface 260 shown in FIG. 2C can be presented to the invitee when they log into their account or at another point in time.
- the user interface 260 includes a summary of recently used labels 262 and invitations to share labels 264 , 266 .
- the invitations are to share label 264 a “AI Project” with John, and to share the label 266 a “Home Furniture” with Sally.
- an invitation to share a label can give the invitee permission to view the label's associated content, permission to use the label to label content, or both.
- a user can also revoke label permissions they have granted to others.
- User 1 next invites User 2 to share label “Hawaii Trip”, such as by selecting the display element 240 of user interface 250 in FIG. 2B .
- User 1 's client device 100 sends a sharing request 118 to label server 108 .
- the label server 108 then sends an invitation 120 to user to User 2 's client device 102 .
- User 2 accepts the invitation as indicated by message 122 to the label server 108 , and begins labeling content.
- User 2 then performs a search for “Hawaiian Waterfalls” as indicated by query 124 sent from the client device 102 to the search engine 106 .
- the search engine 106 returns search results E, F and G in message 126 .
- User 2 then labels search result F with the label “Hawaii Trip” as indicated by message 128 .
- the label server 108 adds an entry 143 b to the label associations 143 in the repository 142 to indicate that label “Hawaii Trip” owned by User 1 was associated with search result F by User 2 .
- User 2 is the label “writer” in this case since User 2 created the association 143 b.
- user 3 using a word processor application executing on the client device 104 creates a new document entitled “Hawaii Hiking Trails” by causing the word processor application to send the content of the document 130 to the document server 110 for storage. User 3 then labels the document “Hawaii Trip”.
- the word processor causes the client device 104 to send a label request 132 to the label server 108 .
- the label server 108 creates a new association 143 c which indicates that the label “Hawaii Trip,” which is owned by user 3 , is associated with the document by user 3 , the label “writer” in this case.
- users can have identical labels but will not be able to see each others' labels unless the labels are shared.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example online advertising system 300 .
- one or more advertisers 304 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in an ad management system 308 .

- the ads may be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads may also include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 306 may submit requests for ads or ad link units to the system 308 .
- Link units display a list of topics that are relevant to the content of a page. When a user clicks a topic, a page of ads related to the topic are shown.
- the system 308 responds by sending ads, ad link units, or information that will allow for the retrieval of ads or ad link units to the requesting publisher 306 for placement/serving on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content such as the labels user interface 250 in FIG. 2B ).
- the ads or ad link units can be placed with or embedded in the publisher's content (e.g., videos, articles, search results), which can be stored in a repository 310 at the publisher 306 , and/or placed with content received from other sources (e.g., other publishers, advertisers).
- content e.g., videos, articles, search results
- other sources e.g., other publishers, advertisers
- Other entities can provide usage information to the system 308 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or click-through related to an ad has occurred.
- conversion data can be stored in a repository 312 , where it can be used by the system 308 to improve ad targeting performance.
- the usage information provided to the system 308 can include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served.

- a publisher 306 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, electronic mail messages, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, networked games, search results, labels and associated label content, web page listings, information feeds, dynamic web page content, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server may submit a request (either directly or indirectly) for ads or ad link units to an ad server in the system 308 .
- the ad request may include the number of ads desired.
- the ad link unit request may include the number of ad link units desired and the number of ad links per ad link unit.
- the ad or ad link unit request may also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category or keyword corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), the structure of the publisher's content (e.g., news articles, videos, images, products, and so on), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, demographic information related to the content, keyword, web property, and the like.

- concepts for a given user's labeled content can be automatically derived by system 308 and used to match the user with ad categories or verticals so that ads can be targeted to the user.
- all of user's labeled content, or the content for a specific label can be treated as a single document from which concepts can be extracted by concept extraction engines. Examples of a concept extraction engines are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,231,393, filed Feb. 26, 2004, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Learning a Probabilistic Generative Model for Text,” and U.S. Pat. No. 7,383,258, filed Sep. 30, 2003, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Characterizing Documents Based on Clusters of Related Words.” Other concept extraction engines or techniques are possible, however.
- the content server (or a browser rendering content provided by the content server) can combine the requested content with one or more of the ads or ad link units provided by the system 308 .
- the combination can happen prior to delivery of the content to the user or contemporaneously where the advertising server can serve the ads or ad link units directly to an end user.
- the combined content and ads or ad link units can be delivered to the user 302 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the ads or ad link units back to the ad server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the ads or ad link units are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).

- labels are created (e.g., by the label server 108 or the search engine 106 ) on behalf of a first user (e.g., User 1 of client device 100 ) and a second user (e.g., User 2 of client device 104 ).
- An association is received (e.g., by the label server 108 or the search engine 106 ) of the first user's label to a search result (step 404 ).
- the second user is unable to view the first user's association because the first user has not shared the label with the second user.
- the label server 108 creates the association in a label repository 142 in response to receiving the association.
- Another association is received (e.g., by the label server 108 or the search engine 106 ) of the second user's label to a search result (step 406 ).
- the first user is unable to view the association because the second user has not shared the label with the first user.
- the label server 108 creates the association in a label repository 142 in response to receiving the association.
- the first user invites the second user to share the first user's label and permission is granted (e.g., by the label server 108 ).

- Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- inter-network e.g., the Internet
- peer-to-peer networks e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks.
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device).
- client device e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device.
- Data generated at the client device e.g., a result of the user interaction
