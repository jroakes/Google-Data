- the conversation engine 110 can respond to a variety of requests from the client assistant 134 related to messages and return conversation-based responses via its connection with the communication network 104 .
- a conversation may include one or more relevant messages relating to a conversation topic.
- Various criteria can be used to determine which messages are parts of each distinct conversation. For example, an analysis can be made of the contents of messages received and/or sent by a user. Messages whose contents are found to be related can be grouped together.
- a thread identifier found in a message header can also be used to identify related messages.
- a subject line in the message header can be used to identify related messages. The senders and recipients of the messages are participants in the conversation.
- All messages directed to a user of the information service 106 can be grouped into a plurality of conversations and presented to the user in a conversation-based format, individually or jointly.
- a conversation list view a user can see in a summary form a list of conversations in which the user participates.
- a conversation view the user can see in an expanded form one or more of messages associated with a particular conversation.
- the information service 106 can create a snippet of a conversation or a message.
- a snippet provides a user with a preview of the contents of the conversation or message without the user having to open the conversation or the message.
- the snippet can be generated from the most recent message in the conversation.
- the snippet can also be extracted from the first message (i.e., the oldest message) in the conversation.
- the snippet can also be extracted from all the messages in the conversation according to predefined heuristic rules, e.g., listing a set of keywords appearing most frequently in the conversation.
- the information service 106 can create a snippet for each conversation in the list, or for each conversation is a displayed portion of the list, the snippet including a portion of the conversation that matches user-submitted query terms.
- These snippets may be similar in one or more respects to snippets included in search results returned by a search engine, such as the Google search engine.
- a snippet can be generated for one or more messages in the conversation.
- the SMTP gateway 122 is also connected to the communication network 104 .
- the SMTP gateway 122 can be directly involved in receiving and sending messages between the information service 106 and other email systems, messaging systems or information services.
- the SMTP gateway 122 for example, transmits and receives messages using the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP).
- SMTP simple mail transfer protocol
- the SMTP gateway 122 can receive a new message from the communication network 104 and send the message to conversation engine 110 for additional processing. Additionally, the SMTP gateway 122 can receive messages from the conversation engine 110 and then transmit (via the communication network 104 ) those messages to recipient addresses specified in the messages.
- the one or more auxiliary services servers 120 can provide additional services to the conversation engine 110 .
- the auxiliary services servers 120 include a spam detection module 121 for detecting and processing spam, an attachment management module 123 for managing the storage and retrieval of documents attached to messages, and a geographical information module 125 for extracting user geographical information from a login or message access request.
- the information service 106 when the information service 106 receives a login request initiated by a user from a client 102 , it extracts an IP address of the client from the login request.
- the IP address is typically a 32-bit digital number that uniquely identifies the client on the Internet.
- the information service 106 includes an IP-Geo mapping database 127 .
- the IP-Geo mapping database 127 includes many entries, each entry mapping one or more IP addresses to a specific geographical location. For example, the entry “171.64.*.* ⁇ Stanford, Calif. 94305” indicates that any IP address whose first eight bits correspond to the decimal value “171” and second eight bits correspond to the decimal value “64” refers to a computer located at Stanford, Calif. 94305.
- the geographical information module 125 is responsible for converting the IP address of the client into the client user's geographical location. This geographical location is used subsequently by the advertisement server 128 and the information item server 130 for selecting one or more information items relevant to the user's geographical location.
- the service provided by the geographical information module 125 and the IP-Geo mapping database 127 may be delegated to a geographical information server that is connected to the information service 106 .
- the information service 106 Upon receiving a login or message access request, the information service 106 forwards the IP address included in the request to the geographical information server.
- the geographical information server returns to the information service 106 the geographical location corresponding to the IP address.
- the conversation engine 110 can be connected to the targeted information processor 124 .
- the targeted information processor 124 can provide geo-targeted and/or content-targeted information for display to a user at client 102 .
- the targeted information processor 124 can provide, for example, advertisements and/or other information items related to the user's messages being handled by the conversation engine 110 .
- the messages include not only messages received by the user but also messages authored and sent by the user.
- the advertisements may be only related to a user's geographical location, not to the message content at all. This scenario may be appropriate in some special circumstances, e.g., when the user is on a business trip and away from the location where the user usually logs into his or her account. Advertisements are herein defined to include information items, or links to information items, that offer or promote products, services, events, companies, organizations, ideas or the like.
- the targeted information processor 124 can be connected to popular keywords information 126 .
- the popular keywords information 126 includes a plurality of keywords associated with a set of advertisements deemed to be most popular by a group of users within a predefined time period.
- the popular keywords information can be used to determine whether there are any popular advertisements whose associated keyword(s) are found in a message being processed by the conversation engine 110 .
- popular advertisements may also have associated geographical locations, and a list of geographical locations associated with the popular advertisements may be compared with the user's current geographical location to determine whether there are any popular advertisements targeted at users at the same geographical location as the user.
- the targeted information processor 124 may obtain popular advertisements and other popular information items from advertisement server 128 and information item server 130 , respectively.
- FIG. 1 is exemplary.
- the information service 106 contains a subset or superset of those elements illustrated in the figure.
- FIG. 1 shows the information service 106 as a number of discrete elements, this figure is intended more as a functional description of the various features which may be present in the information service 106 than as a structural schematic of the various embodiments.
- some elements shown separately could be combined and some elements could be further divided into sub-elements or parallel elements.
- some separate elements in the figure could be implemented by a single server or module and some single elements could be implemented by one or more servers or modules.
- the actual number of servers in information service 106 and how features are allocated among the servers will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods.
- the message database 118 can be implemented using a plurality of servers if the information service 106 manages a large volume of messages associated with a large number of user accounts.
- the client 102 can include client application 132 and client assistant 134 .
- Client application 132 can provide a window to be displayed on a displaying device (e.g., a monitor) for rendering conversations and targeted information.
- the conversations, targeted information and messages in the conversations can be encoded using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), XML, or any other appropriate markup language or encoding scheme, and then rendered by the client application 132 .
- HTML HyperText Markup Language
- XML XML
- the information service 106 identifies conversations in the user's account in accordance with the user's request and transfers them as well as a set of display instructions back to the client 102 .
- Client assistant 134 can, in response, generate one or more forms in accordance with the display instructions, where each form can include information of some of the conversations. The forms can then be submitted to and rendered by client application 132 . In another embodiment, client assistant 134 may alternatively exist and operate in the information service 106 .
- the information service 106 and client assistant 134 work in concert to allow a user to view, compose, send and/or search messages in the user's message account and to present the search results in a highly intuitive fashion.
- the information service 106 extracts information from a user's message account by processing messages received, sent and/or being composed by the user, and the client assistant 134 assists in rendering the information prepared by the information service 106 .
- a different division of duties between the information service 106 and the client assistant 134 can be implemented. Because many of the tasks performed by the system can be performed by either the information service 106 or the client assistant 134 or by the two working together, these two components are sometimes herein referred to jointly as the “conversation system”.
- the conversation system can provide at least two different views, including a conversation list view and a conversation view as mentioned briefly above.
- a conversation list view a plurality of conversations can be displayed where each conversation can be displayed in a summary form.
- each conversation can be represented by a number of conversation elements.
- the conversation elements can include one or more of: a number indicating the number of messages in the conversation, a list of one or more of the identifiers or names of the senders of messages in the conversation, a conversation description (e.g., a subject line of the message), a date/time value of the conversation (e.g., a date/time value of the last received message in the conversation), and a snippet from one or more of the messages in the conversation.
- each conversation can be represented as a single row in the conversation list view.
- one or more messages from a conversation can be displayed.
- Each message can be displayed in one of a number of various modes, for example an expanded mode, a compacted mode, or a compressed mode.
- an expanded mode the body of the message can be displayed along with, for example, header information including names or other identifiers of the sender and the recipients of the message, a date/time value indicative of when the message is received or sent, routing information, and other properties of the message.
- An expanded mode can be used, for example, for messages which are marked as “unread.”
- a compacted mode the message body can be hidden and a snippet from the message is provided in its place. The snippet can be chosen to occupy less space than the body.
- a snippet can be chosen to occupy only one line in a display window.
- the compacted mode can be used for messages which have been read or marked as read.
- the compacted mode allows messages in a conversation to be displayed within the same window more densely than if the expanded mode were used.
- a message can be represented with a small bar.
- the small bar can contain no message information.
- the visual effect of such a mode can be that multiple compressed messages appear like the edges of cards in a deck of cards.
- a user can toggle between the various display modes by selecting a message or using various controls in the display window.
- additional, targeted information can be displayed in the display window.
- additional, targeted information can be displayed in the display window.
- one or more advertisements relevant to, or related to, one or more of the messages in the conversation can be displayed.
- one or more other types of information can be displayed.
- Such other information can include, but is not limited to news items or links to news items, map links, phone numbers, links to product information, stock prices or links to stock prices, links to weather forecasts, web page links, dictionary entries or links to dictionary entries, images or links to images, RSS feeds or links to RSS feeds, links to blog (web log) events, links to user polls, links to files or other content on the client 102 , and other types of information.
- RSS feeds can be content distributed from various sources on a network (e.g., the Internet).
- RDF Site Summary (RSS) (and sometimes, Real Simple Syndication) is an XML-based lightweight multi-purpose extensible metadata description and syndication format. RSS is typically used for distributing various types of content to a number of receivers simultaneously.
- News items can be news items from one or more sources.
- Blog events can be events generated from one or more web logs (blogs).
- User polls can be polls that the user may participate in which may come from a variety of sources.
- Stock prices can be stock prices of companies whose names or stock ticker symbols are mentioned in the conversation.
- Weather forecasts can be weather forecasts of locations like cities or states whose names are directly or indirectly referred to by a message in the conversation.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a process of generating targeted information items in response to a message access request in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- the user's geographical information is identified ( 202 ).
- the user's geographical information may be generated and stored in the information service 106 when the user logs into his or her account at the information service 106 .
- the information service 106 extracts from the message access request the IP address of the requesting client and identifies the user's geographical information using the IP address.
- a conversation including the requested message(s) is identified ( 204 ).
- the requested message(s) may include an identifier of a conversation associated with the message.
- a conversation can include one or more related messages.
- the identification at 204 can identify all of the messages in a conversation or selected messages in a conversation.
- Various selection criteria can be used when identifying selected messages in a conversation. For example, messages can be identified based on whether they were authored and sent by the user. Alternatively, messages can be identified based on whether a message was authored by the user within a predefined time period (e.g., the messages authored within the last 24 hours are identified).
- a conversation may be associated with a pool of messages of different types received or sent by the user, such as email messages, IM messages, transcribed voice messages, SMS messages and search query results. In this event, messages can be identified based on whether a message is of a particular type or types or a combination of two or more of the criteria mentioned above.
- FIG. 2 For illustrative purposes, the following discussion assumes that the process of FIG. 2 is triggered by a user's act of clicking a conversation link in a conversation list view and is applied to one or more messages identified as members of the same conversation. But one skilled in the art will appreciate that the process of FIG. 2 could be triggered by other types of events as well.
- the information service 106 Before the identified messages are transferred back to the requesting client, the information service 106 needs to determine if there are any popular advertisements targeted at the identified messages or targets at the user's current geographical location ( 206 ). Within the information service 106 , the targeted information processor 124 is typically responsible for determining whether there are any popular advertisements associated with a requested message by checking if any advertisement-related keyword is found in the message. Optionally, the targeted information processor 124 may also determine whether there are any popular advertisements associated with the user's geographical location (or alternately stated, that are targeted at users at the user's current geographical location).
- the information service 106 may finish the process by bypassing the remaining steps 208 - 212 as indicated by line 207 of FIG. 2 .
- the message or conversation identified at 204 may be displayed to the requesting user without being accompanied by any targeted information items.
- the message or conversation identified at 204 may be displayed to the requesting user without being accompanied by any popular advertisements. Additional processes may be used to identify other targeted information to display to the requesting user along with the identified message or conversation.
- the information service 106 performs operations 208 , 210 , 212 in order to obtain those targeted information items. Note that operation 206 may be delegated to the advertisement server 128 or the information item server 130 in some embodiments.
- the information service 106 sends the user geographical information and the messages to the information servers ( 208 ).
- the information servers e.g., the advertisement server 128 , search through a pool of candidate information items for those items that are most relevant to the user geographical information and the message content.
- the information service 106 receives from the information servers a set of popular information items targeted at the user geographical information and/or the messages ( 210 ) and transfers these geo-targeted and/or content-targeted information items to the requesting client for display ( 212 ).
- a more thorough description of the process of identifying relevant information items is provided below in connection with FIG. 4 .
- the information service 106 may provide formatting information directing the display of the information obtained from the information servers.
- the obtained information is preferably displayed in a manner consistent with the user's expectation. For example, if the obtained information is associated with a conversation or a message in the conversation requested by the user, it is simultaneously displayed next to the requested conversation or message in a corresponding conversation view. If the obtained information items are associated with a message just sent by the user and the user expects to return to the conversation list view, the information items may be displayed at the top of the conversation list view in order to attract the user's attention. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the aforementioned schemes of rendering the obtained information items in a display device are exemplary. Other rendering schemes may be used in other embodiments. Typically, the information items are displayed at a location within an application or browser window that is prominent, but consistent with the normal experience that users have with a particular information service.
- the task of identifying targeted information items is accomplished by, or primarily by the information service 106 .
- the targeted information processor 124 that is responsible for conducting semantic analysis of the message contents.
- the semantic analysis may include extracting concepts from the message contents, inferring from the concepts other relevant keywords, and grouping the concepts and keywords into categories.
- the information servers 128 , 130 are only responsible for choosing advertisements matching the concepts, keywords and categories.
- the information servers 128 , 130 play a more significant role in the process of identifying targeted information items.
- this process is divided into two sub-processes: (1) periodically identifying a set of keywords associated with the most popular advertisements under certain circumstances; and (2) selecting those advertisements and other information items whose associated keywords appear in the message.
- the one or more keywords associated with an advertisement may be the one or more keywords on which the provider of the advertisement has bid, as part of an auction process for determining placement of online advertisements. Keywords may be associated with other information items by automated content analysis or by human assignment of the keywords, or a combination of these techniques.
- the relevancy of an on-line advertisement to a user viewing a web page or an email message depends on two factors: (1) how close the subject of the advertisement is to the web page or message content and (2) how likely the user is going to click the link to the advertisement when noticing its existence.
- the first factor can be measured, e.g., by the frequencies that keywords associated with the advertisement are found in the web page or message content. When the number or percentage of words within a message that match keywords associated with an advertisement or information item reaches a predetermined threshold, the advertisement or information item is deemed relevant to that message.
- the relevancy of the keywords to the message can be measured by the number of unique keywords present in the message.
- the latter factor can be approximated by a popularity metric, such as the click-through rate of the advertisement during a predefined time period.
- the click-through rate of an advertisement is defined as the number of times that users clicked on links to the advertisement divided by the number of times that the advertisement was displayed to different users during a predefined time period.
- a shorthand version of this definition is “number of click-throughs divided by number of impressions,” where each “impression” is the display or presentation of an item to a user.
- An advertisement having a high click-through rate (CTR) is more likely to be clicked than one having a low click-through rate provided that other conditions of the two advertisements are relatively equal.
- the actual click-through rate of an advertisement is treated as a proxy for its predicted click-through rate for the purpose of determining its relevancy to a user.
- this predicted click-through rate may be further modulated by the user's personal profile. For example, a user's age, gender, educational, income level, and known or stated interests may affect the relevancy of an advertisement to the user. Therefore, in order to select more relevant information items for a message, it is necessary to determine their respective predicted click-through rates.
- FIG. 7 is a conceptual block diagram of a database 700 for storing advertisements, or other information items, and associated information.
- the information in the database may be stored in multiple data structures, or even multiple computers, and need not be organized in the specific manner shown in FIG. 7 .
- the database 700 may be stored and/or accessed by the information item server 130 and/or the advertisement server 128 of FIG. 1 .
- the database 700 includes a set of information items 702 , which may include advertisements and/or other types of information items. For ease of explanation, both advertisements and other information items are herein called information items.
- Each information item 702 includes content 704 , keywords 706 associated with the information item and click-through information 708 .
- a subset of the information items include geo-targeting information 710 .
- other fields or types of information may also be stored with or associated with one or more of the information items.
- Content 704 may include text, graphics, links to URLs or other content storage locations.
- the content 704 of one or more of the items 702 may optionally be preformatted for display, for example by including HTML tags. Keywords 706 are one or more keywords used to identify or select information items.
- Bids are used in an auction or similar process for determining advertisement or information item selection and placement. Alternately, or in addition, bids may be used to determine debits or credits to be applied to one or more financial accounts when predefined events occur with respect to the associated advertisements or information items.
- Geo-targeting information 710 when provided for an information item or advertisement, may be used to limit the users who receive the information item or advertisement to users whose current location is consistent with the geo-targeting information 710 for that information item or advertisement.
- Geo-targeting information 710 for particular information items may specify geographic regions of different sizes, including large regions (e.g., Canada, or New York State), small regions (e.g., locations within 1000 yards of a particular address in New York City), and regions of any intermediate size, such as a county (e.g., Santa Clara County, California), a metropolitan area (e.g., “the Bay area of Northern California”), a city (e.g., Palo Alto, Calif.), or any other well defined geographic region that is suitable for use in geo-targeting.
- large regions e.g., Canada, or New York State
- small regions e.g., locations within 1000 yards of a particular address in New York City
- regions of any intermediate size such as a county (e.g., Santa Clara County,
- a user's current location may be determined by the current IP address of user, or may be determined using other positioning mechanisms (e.g., if the client 102 is a cell phone, the cell phone network for the client 102 may provide information about the user's current location). In some embodiments, information items or advertisements that do not have geo-targeting information associated with them are assumed to be targeted to all users.
- Click-through rate (CTR) information 708 for an information item includes one more CTR values.
- the CTR information 708 for an information item is a single value representing the click-through rate for the information items for a predefined period of time.
- separate CTR values may be provide for a plurality of time periods (e.g., the last month, the last week, etc.), and/or for a plurality of geographic regions, and/or for a plurality of categories of users, and/or other groupings of the CTR information for the information item.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary process of identifying most popular advertisements and their associated keywords in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- the advertisement server 128 periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) gathers information about popular advertisements ( 302 ).
- the popularity of an advertisement may be measured by its click-through rate.
- the gathered information may also include the demographic and geographical distribution of users who have accessed the advertisement during this time period, e.g., the number of clicks on the links to the advertisement from a city or specific region.
- the gathered information may further include the communication channels through which the advertisement is served, which may include, but is not limited to websites, search engine, email/IM/SMS services, etc.
- This information helps to rank the popularity of the advertisement among different groups of users. For instance, the gathered information may be used to compute different click-through rates for different categories of users.
- the categories of users may be defined differently in different embodiments, using one or more factors such as location, time, communication channel, age and/or other personal characteristics.
- only a subset of the popular advertisements may be selected as the candidates according to predefined criteria in order to save processing time and reduce the latency between a request and a response.
- the advertisement server extracts their respective keywords ( 304 ). Each advertisement may has an associated bid on one or more keywords.
- an advertisement is not considered relevant to a message if (A) none of its associated keywords are found in the message, or (B) the current location of the user is outside the targeted geographical region associated with the advertisement.
- the advertisement when an advertisement include geo-targeting information, the advertisement is only considered relevant to a message if the client 102 receiving or sourcing the message is located within (or optionally nearby) the advertisement's targeted geographical region, and at least one of the keywords of the advertisement are found in the message.
- the extracted keywords associated with the candidate popular advertisements are transferred to the information service ( 306 ).
- the information service may use these keywords to determine whether a message contains any keywords in a proactive manner ( 206 of FIG. 2 ).
- FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary process of identifying popular advertisements for a requested electronic message in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.
- this process is performed by an advertisement server or information item server.
- this process corresponds to operation 210 of the process shown in FIG. 2 .
- the advertisement server Upon receipt of the user geographical information and the messages ( 402 ), the advertisement server applies the user geographical information to the candidate popular advertisements to filter out geo-targeted advertisements whose targeted geographical region does not include the user's current location ( 404 ).
- the advertisement server applies the user geographical information to the candidate popular advertisements to filter out geo-targeted advertisements whose targeted geographical region does not include the user's current location ( 404 ).
- operation 404 may include filtering out advertisements whose CTR for the geographic region that includes the user's current location is below a predefined CTR threshold.
- operation 404 if the user's current location is unknown, operation 404 is skipped. In some embodiments, geographic information is not used to select advertisements, in which case operation 404 is not part of the advertisement selection process. Other uses of the user geographical information can be found in the co-pending U.S. patent application entitled “System and Method for Targeting Advertisements or Other Information Using User Geographical Information,” which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- the process After selecting a group of popular advertisements, the process identifies a set of keywords associated with the group of advertisements ( 406 ). Next, the process determines whether any of the keywords are found in the message ( 408 ). If a keyword has a match in the message ( 408 , Yes), an advertisement associated with the keyword are returned to the information service ( 410 ). If there is more than one advertisement associated with the same keyword, one or more of the advertisements (from the set of advertisements associated with the keyword found in the message) having the highest CTR are selected and returned to the information server.
- the CTR used for selecting the most popular advertisements whose keyword(s) are found in the message is the most geographically specific CTR for each advertisement that is consistent with the user's current location. Thus, if an advertisement includes an overall CTR, a national CTR and a state CTR, all of which are applicable to the user's current location, the state CTR would be used.
- a predefined selection process may be used to determine which advertisements associated with those keywords are returned to the information service. For example, a round robin selection process may be used, in which the highest CTR advertisement (among the not-yet selected advertisements) for each matching keyword is selected, until a predefined maximum number of advertisements have been selected. Alternately, a relevancy metric may be computed for each candidate advertisement, and then the advertisements with the best (e.g., highest) relevancy metric are selected for return to the information service.
- the relevancy metric of an advertisement may be based on a number of factors, including one or more of the following factors: the number of keywords associated with the advertisement found in the message, the number of matching keywords in the message, the advertisement's click-through rate, the number of times the advertisement has previously been displayed to the user, whether the user has previously seen and clicked through the advertisement, and possibly other factors as well.
- information corresponding to the relevancy metrics of the selected advertisements may be provided along with the selected advertisements, for use in determining the positioning or display order of the selected advertisements.
- filtering based on geo-targeting may be performed after using keyword matching to identify candidate advertisements.
- a set of candidate advertisements associated with the matching keywords is identified, and that set is then optionally filtered based on geo-targeting so as to produce a filtered set of candidate advertisements.
- Selection of advertisements from the filtered set can be based on a popularity metric, as described above.
- the operations of geo-target filtering and selection of advertisements based on a popularity metric may be combined into a single operation (i.e., performed together instead of performed in sequence).
- FIGS. 3 and 4 are independent from each other.
- the process of FIG. 3 is performed periodically so as to refresh the set of popular advertisements and their associated keywords.
- the process of FIG. 4 is performed in response to requests for targeted information.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a client 102 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the client 102 typically includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 902 , one or more network or other communications interfaces 504 , memory 506 , and one or more communication buses 508 for interconnecting these components.
