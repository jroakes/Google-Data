- the present specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with the web page, for example, along with search results.
- a content consumer may perform various actions, such as interacting with (e.g., clicking) a content item, navigating to a content provider's (e.g., an advertiser's) web site, and/or purchasing a product or service from the content provider.
- the behavior of content consumers may be simulated to model online activity and purchasing patterns.
- Attribution modeling can be used to attribute the actions of content consumers to content items to which the consumers have previously been exposed.
- attribution models are correlational, and may include position and/or rules-based techniques for attribution.
- the estimated value (e.g., return on advertising spend) of a campaign (e.g., a marketing campaign) calculated using an attribution model may vary, depending on the type of attribution model used.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods for evaluating an effectiveness or applicability of an attribution model for a campaign that include the actions of specifying parameters that describe how users behave in an absence of advertising, parameters that describe how users react to advertising, and parameters that regulate injection of advertising in a simulation; generating, by one or more processors, a first set of simulated activity streams with advertising turned on, based on the specified parameters; determining observational metrics associated with the first set of simulated activity streams; applying an attribution model to the generated first set of simulated activity streams and determining a first fraction of incremental conversions associated with one or more advertising channels; generating, by one or more processors, one or more further sets of simulated activity streams, each with a single advertising channel turned off, based on the specified parameters; determining observational metrics associated with the one or more further sets of simulated activity streams; determining a second fraction of incremental conversions for each advertising channel by evaluating the further set of simulated activity streams with the single advertising channel turned off; and comparing the first
- Specifying parameters that describe how users behave in an absence of advertising can include one or more of specifying an activity level that influences a length of a simulated activity stream, an activity preference from among a plurality of possible activities, or a conversion rate for a given activity.
- Specifying parameters that describe how users behave in an absence of advertising can include generating a transition matrix that includes columns and rows that represent activities and corresponding entries in the transition matrix that define a probability of progressing from a given activity to a corresponding next activity.
- Specifying parameters that describe how users react to advertising can include specifying a probability that a user's behavior will change with advertising exposure and a modification to the transition matrix based on exposure to a given advertisement.
- Specifying parameters that regulate injection of advertising in a simulation can include specifying one or more of a probability that an advertisement is served in a respective channel of the campaign, a budget cap per channel, a minimum threshold for impressibility for each channel, or a cost of advertising per channel.
- Generating the first set of simulated activity streams can include for a first stream, identifying a starting point on the transition matrix that corresponds with an initial activity, traversing the transition matrix in accordance with defined probabilities, impressing advertising from the channels in accordance with a probability that an advertisement will be served in association with a respective activity, adjusting the transition matrix in accordance with the modification, and continuing to generate the first stream until an end of session activity is determined.
- Determining observational metrics associated with the first set of simulated activity streams can include, for each type of advertising channel, determining one or more of impressions, clicks, spend, reach, frequency, or share. Applying the attribution model can include determining an estimate of a number of conversions associated with each advertising channel. Determining the first fraction of incremental conversions associated with one or more advertising channels can include calculating an estimated fraction of incremental conversions for each of the channels. Generating the one or more further sets of simulated activity streams can include, for a first stream, identifying a starting point on the transition matrix that corresponds with an initial activity, traversing the transition matrix in accordance with defined probabilities, and continuing to generate the first stream until an end of session activity is determined.
- Total spend can be used as a budget, an optimal mix of spend can be determined across all advertising channels that generates a most incremental conversions using the budget, observational metrics can be generated in association with the optimal mix, a fraction of incremental spend can be found and assigned to each channel, and applicability of the attribution model can be determined, including comparing the fraction of incremental spend with the first fraction of incremental conversions.
- One or more of the further sets of simulated activity streams can have multiple advertising channels turned off, based on the specified parameters.
- the actions of the method can be repeated for a second attribution model and results can be compared for each attribution model to determine a most effective attribution model.
- the parameters can be varied and the actions of the method can be repeated to evaluate the attribution model in view of the varied parameters.
- Attribution models can be evaluated under many different assumptions about how and to what extent distribution and different types of content or serving parameters may impact user behavior. Attribution models can be compared, and the conditions for the applicability of any particular attribution model may be identified. Content providers can perform comparisons of standard or custom attribution models by varying simulation parameters. Quantitative guidance can be provided to content sponsors for use in selecting an attribution model for a particular type of campaign.

- Attribution models can be used to attribute user actions, interactions, conversions (e.g., a click of a content item, a visit to a web site, a subscription to a mailing list, a following on a social networking site, or a purchase of a product or service.) or other activities to one or more content items (e.g., display, search, or video content) to which the users have previously been exposed in association with a campaign.
- the campaign e.g., a marketing campaign
- attribution models are correlational, and may be used to calculate an estimate of the proportion of conversions that may be attributed to each channel of a campaign, and an estimated value (e.g., return on advertising spend or cost per action) of the user actions performed during or in association with the campaign.
- the calculated estimates may vary, however, depending on the type of model used.
- Campaign simulations can be conducted to generate simulated activity streams that represent the online actions (e.g., searches, visits to websites, video views, or conversions) of users.
- an activity transition matrix may be used in association with various simulation parameters to describe/determine a progression of a virtual user from one activity to the next during a simulated web session.
- a virtual experiment may be conducted by turning on or off one or more distribution channels (e.g., advertising distribution channels) to simulate the presence or absence of a particular channel.
- An attribution model can be applied to a set of simulated activity streams with the channels turned on to identify estimated conversions associated with each of the channels, as determined by the attribution model.
- the set of simulated activity streams with the channels turned on can be compared to one or more sets of simulated activity streams with one or more channels turned off to identify causal results of the virtual experiment in regard to the effectiveness of each channel.
- the estimated conversions identified using the attribution model can be compared with the causal results of the virtual experiment to determine the applicability of the attribution model for a campaign. Comparison information can be presented to a campaign sponsor to provide guidance for selecting a suitable attribution model for use in identifying campaign performance.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content management system that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating monetizable parameters (e.g., monetizable demographic parameters).
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level

- the short-term and long-term impacts of user exposure to a particular content format may be specified.
- the activity transition matrix scaling parameters 402 include a set of long-term scaling parameters for search content that can have a persistent impact on the activity transition matrix 400 , and a set of short-term parameters that can have a temporary impact.
- a persistent impact for example, can indicate that scaling applied to the activity transition matrix 400 persists for all downstream activity.
- a temporary impact for example, can indicate that the impact only exists until a transition to the next activity. For example, exposure to a search ad may increase the probability of a visit to the advertiser's website while the ad is visible.
- the activity transition matrix scaling parameters 402 can indicate an amount of scaling that is to be applied to the activity transition matrix 400 as a result of exposure of a content item.
- the parameters h,j,k,l,z ⁇ (1, ⁇ ).
- the column BS of the activity transition matrix 400 is scaled by h, the column GS by one, and the column VTA by j.

- an impact of a content item may increase over the first several impressions (burn-in) and may decline after additional impressions (fatigue). Display and video content item distribution may work this way, for example.
- n represents a number of ads in a specified channel that have been served to a user
- the parameter n_o specifies an impression that is most impactful to a user's behavior (i.e., the impression after which burn-in ends and fatigue begins).
- specifying parameters that regulate injection of content in a simulation may include specifying one or more of a probability that a content item is served in a respective channel of the campaign, a budget cap per channel, a minimum threshold for impressibility for each channel, or a cost of distributing content per channel.

- Impressibility threshold parameters can represent a minimum impressibility for presenting a content item, for example. For example, a virtual user that is associated with a higher search impressibility parameter may be more likely to search with a relevant keyword (than a virtual user that is associated with a lower search impressibility parameter), may be more likely to be presented with a content item (e.g., a search advertisement) that is provided in response to the keyword, and may be more likely to change behavior as a result of the presentation.
- impressibility threshold parameters may indicate an extent of an audience for content presentation. For search advertisements, for example, an audience may be determined by the size and/or relevance of a keyword set for presenting the ads. For display advertisements, for example, an audience may be determined by the size and/or relevance of a publisher website that presents the ads.
- Share of voice parameters can represent a probability that an opportunity for serving a content item may be realized for a user that meets a minimum impressibility threshold, for example.
- share of voice parameters may be adjusted, based at least in part by one or more cost factors.
- the share of voice parameter p can be regulated by one or more keyword bids—higher bids, for example, may positively affect p.
- a cost of presenting content may be determined, based on base cost parameters, cost scaling parameters, and share of voice parameters.
- a base cost parameter for example, can represent a minimum cost of an advertising impression per click.
- a cost scaling parameter for example, can be a binary parameter that indicates whether it may be more expensive to serve advertisements to users with lower impressibility.
- content serving parameters may include one or more frequency cap parameters.
- the content frequency cap parameters 408 include frequency cap parameters ( ⁇ , v, w) for the respective format types of search, display, and video, where v, w ⁇ [1, ⁇ ].
- content may not be served for a channel after a user has reached the frequency cap for that channel.

- the content simulation system 210 can use the activity stream generator 212 to generate a set of activity streams 242 with advertising turned on for all channels (e.g., a channel for presenting search ads, a channel for presenting display ads, and a channel for presenting video ads) of a campaign, based on the activity transition matrix 400 , the content serving parameters 406 , and the content frequency parameters 408 .
- Each of the activity streams in the set of activity streams 242 can represent a simulated web session of an individual user, as the user transitions from activity to activity.
- each ad channel's share of voice parameter from the content serving parameters 406 can be set to a non-zero value, to simulate an active campaign.
- generating the first set of simulated activity streams may include for a first stream, identifying a starting point on the transition matrix that corresponds with an initial activity, traversing the transition matrix in accordance with defined probabilities, impressing content from the channels in accordance with a probability that a content item will be served in association with a respective activity, adjusting the transition matrix in accordance with the modification, and continuing to generate the first stream until an end of session activity is determined.

- search ads may be compatible with branded and generic searching
- display ads may be compatible with visits to websites
- video ads may be compatible with video viewing.
- a search ad is determined to be compatible with the user's current branded search activity.
- a determination ( 606 ) is made of whether a content item may be served to a user. For example, based on the content serving parameters 406 and the content frequency parameters 408 , the activity stream generator 212 can determine whether the user's impressibility meets an impressibility threshold for serving the content item, and whether the exposure frequency cap has been exceeded. In the present example, the user's impressibility meets the threshold, and a particular frequency cap is not identified for the search content item.
- a determination ( 608 ) is made of whether the content item is served to the user during the user's current activity. For example, based on the share of voice parameter for the content item's format, and/or the cost of serving the content item, the activity stream generator 212 can determine whether the content item is to be served. In the present example, a search ad is served to the user during the user's current branded search activity.
- a determination ( 610 ) is made of whether user behavior is impacted by the content item. For example, the user's impressibility probability can be used to determine whether the user is impacted. If the user is not impacted, for example, a cost of serving the content item (if applicable) can be recorded ( 612 ), and the next content item format and user activity can be identified ( 602 ). If the user is impacted, for example, an activity transition matrix can be modified ( 614 ), the cost can be recorded (if applicable) ( 612 ), and the next content item format and user activity can be identified ( 602 ).
- a cost of presenting the ad may be applied if a simulation determines that a virtual user clicks the ad, and an impact on user behavior may include a click on the ad or an impact on downstream behavior.
- a cost may be incurred if the ad is presented, independent of whether the presentation impacted user behavior.
- the activity transition matrix 400 is modified based on the activity transition matrix scaling parameters 402 .
- the temporary scaling parameter z can be applied to the column BS and to the column VTA in the activity transition matrix 400 .
- the matrix rows can be renormalized, and a next activity can be randomly determined, based on the updated matrix probabilities.
- subsequent activities for the user's session may be determined to be a visit to the advertiser's website (VTA), followed by a conversion (C), followed by an end of session (EOS).
- VTA advertiser's website
- C conversion
- EOS end of session
- observational metrics associated with the first set of simulated activity streams are determined ( 506 ).
- determining observational metrics associated with the first set of simulated activity streams includes, for each type of distribution channel, determining one or more of impressions, clicks (e.g., for search ads), spend, reach, frequency, or share of voice.
- Other observational metrics may include, for example, conversion volume, conversion rates (e.g., at a user level), activity stream length, or activity fraction for each type of activity.
- An attribution model is applied ( 508 ) to the generated first set of simulated activity streams and a first fraction of incremental conversions associated with one or more distribution channels is determined.

- one or more of a last click attribution model 252 , a first click attribution model 254 , and/or a data-driven attribution model 256 can be applied to the activity streams 242 .
- applying the attribution model may include determining an estimate of a number of conversions associated with each distribution channel. For example, an estimate of a number of conversions attributed to a search ad channel, an estimate of a number of conversions attributed to a display ad channel, and an estimate of a number of conversions attributed to a video ad channel can be determined, based on each of the attribution models 252 , 254 , and 256 .
- determining the first fraction of incremental conversions associated with one or more channels includes calculating an estimated fraction of incremental conversions for each of the channels.

- estimated fractions 264 and 266 of incremental conversions can be determined for each of the respective attribution models 254 and 256 , each estimated fraction associated with the search ad channel, the display ad channel, and the video ad channel, respectively.
- One or more further sets of simulated activity streams are generated ( 510 ), for example, each with a single distribution channel turned off, based on the specified parameters. Similar to step ( 504 ), for example, the content simulation system 210 can use the activity stream generator 212 to generate a set of activity streams 244 with content turned off for one of the channels (e.g., the channel for presenting search ads, the channel for presenting display ads, or the channel for presenting video ads) of a campaign, based on the activity transition matrix 400 , the content serving parameters 406 , and the content frequency parameters 408 . To generate the set of activity streams 244 with a particular channel turned off, for example, the channel's share of voice parameter from the content serving parameters 406 can be set to zero.

- the channel's share of voice parameter from the content serving parameters 406 can be set to zero.
- generating one or more further sets of simulated activity streams can include, for a first stream, identifying a starting point on the activity transition matrix 400 that corresponds with an initial activity, traversing the transition matrix in accordance with defined probabilities, and continuing to generate the first stream until an end of session activity is determined.
- one or more of the further sets of simulated activity streams may have multiple distribution channels turned off, based on the specified parameters. For example, by turning off all advertising channels of a campaign, the results of a simulation can be used to generate baseline metrics for determining an effectiveness of the entire campaign. As another example, two or more channels may be turned off in combination as part of a virtual experiment to determine an impact that different channels may have on each other during a campaign.
- Observational metrics associated with the one or more further sets of simulated activity streams are determined ( 512 ). Similar to step ( 506 ), for example, determining observational metrics associated with the one or more further sets of simulated activity streams (e.g., the activity streams 244 ) can include, for each type of distribution channel, determining one or more of impressions, clicks, or share.
- a second fraction of incremental conversions is determined ( 514 ) for each distribution channel by evaluating the further set of simulated activity streams with the single distribution channel turned off.
- determining the second fraction of incremental conversions for each channel may include determining a number of incremental conversions for the single channel, repeating the generating and determining for each channel, and calculating a total number of incremental conversions for each channel.
- the second fraction of incremental conversions for each channel can be based on a respective number of incremental conversions for a given channel divided by the total number of incremental conversions.
- the campaign simulation system 210 can use the activity stream evaluator 216 to evaluate activity streams 244 that have the channel for presenting search ads turned off and can subtract the number from a total conversion volume associated with all advertising channels being turned on (e.g., as determined in step ( 506 )) to determine a number of incremental conversions for the search ad channel.
- the activity stream generator 212 and activity stream evaluator 216 can determine a respective number of incremental conversions for each of the display ad and video ad channels. By dividing the number incremental conversions for a particular channel by the total number of incremental conversions, for example, a set of second fractions of incremental conversions 268 can be determined for the search ad, display ad, and video ad channels, respectively.

- the campaign simulation system 210 can use the report generator 218 to generate a comparison report 270 that compares the second fraction of incremental conversions for a particular channel (e.g., the search advertising channel) with the first fraction of incremental conversions for the channel as estimated by an attribution model (e.g., the last click attribution model 252 ).
- the method 500 may be repeated for a second attribution model and results may be compared for each attribution model to determine a most effective attribution model.
- the comparison report 270 includes a comparison between the second fraction of incremental conversions for the search channel with the first fraction of incremental conversions for the search channel as estimated by each of the attribution models 252 , 254 , and 256 , respectively.
- the comparison report 270 can be provided to the client device 202 of the content sponsor 202 , to assist the content sponsor in the selection of (or creation of) a suitable attribution model for a particular type of campaign or distribution channel.
- the parameters may be varied and the method 500 may be repeated to evaluate the attribution model in view of the varied parameters.

- the optimal mix can be determined, for example, by trial and error, or by using a standard optimization technique.

Abstract
Description
where F={display ads, search ads, video ads}
and where IMPi={impif}f in F′
and where yijεO
where M[x]={Mij[x]} is a N[O]×N[O] matrix with each element Mij[x] being a function of x. The parameter α, for example, can reflect the probability that a user's downstream activity may change after a particular exposure to a particular content item. In some implementations, user heterogeneity may be introduced into a simulation by varying a value of α to represent a different impressibility for different users. For example, αif˜Beta(af, bf), where αif indicates user i's tolerance to ad format ƒ. The function M[x], for example, can reflect the effectiveness of multiple content item exposures and how a user's behavior may change with respect to all the content items the user was exposed to.
P(y ij |y i,j−1 ,M ij)=M ij(y i,j−1 ,y ij)
where Mij is an O×O activity transition matrix with its element M(x, y) indicating the probability of moving from state x, and y being any of the values in O.
ƒ(n)=1 if n_o=0
ƒ(n)=n/n_o if 0<n<=n_o
ƒ(n)=2−n/n_o if n_o<n<=2*n_o
ƒ(n)=0 if n>2*n_o
In the present example, the parameter n_o specifies an impression that is most impactful to a user's behavior (i.e., the impression after which burn-in ends and fatigue begins).
