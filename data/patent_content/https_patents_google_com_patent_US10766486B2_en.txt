Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles such as vehicles that do not require a human driver, can be used to aid in the transport of passengers or items from one location to another. Such vehicles may operate in a fully autonomous mode where passengers may provide some initial input, such as a destination, and the vehicle maneuvers itself to that destination.
- One aspect of the disclosure provides a method of controlling a first vehicle autonomously.
- the method includes planning, by one or more processors, to maneuver the first vehicle to complete an action; predicting that a second vehicle will take a responsive action; maneuvering, by the one or more processors, the first vehicle towards completing the action in a way that would allow the first vehicle to cancel completing the action prior without causing a collision between the first vehicle and the second vehicle, and in order to indicate to the second vehicle or a driver of the second vehicle that the first vehicle is attempting to complete the action; determining, by the one or more processors, whether the second vehicle is taking the particular responsive action in response to the maneuvering; and when the first vehicle is determined to be able to take the action, completing the action, by the one or more processors, by controlling the first vehicle autonomously using the determination of whether the second vehicle begins to take the particular responsive action.
- the action is making a right turn from a first roadway to a second roadway in order to pull in front of the second vehicle on the second roadway.
- the action is making a left turn from a first roadway to leave the first roadway and requires crossing in front of the second vehicle on the first roadway.
- the action is making a left turn into a parking lot or driveway.
- the action is making a left turn onto a second roadway at an intersection.
- the second vehicle is in a same lane as the first vehicle and the action is passing the second vehicle.
- the particular responsive action includes slowing the second vehicle down to a particular speed.
- the particular responsive action includes changing a current lane of the second vehicle.
- the action is completed before a time when the second vehicle would have passed by the first vehicle had the first vehicle not completed the action.
- the method also includes controlling, by the one or more processors, the first vehicle autonomously along a route, and prior to maneuver the first vehicle to complete the action, determining, by the one or more processors, that the first vehicle must take the action to proceed along the route.
- predicting that the second vehicle will take the responsive action includes generating a prediction that the second vehicle will take the particular responsive action which would allow the first vehicle to comply with accommodation protocols of the first vehicle if the first vehicle were to complete the action at a particular point in time, wherein the accommodation protocols prohibit actions by the first vehicle which would require certain types of responsive actions by another vehicle.
- the system includes one or more processors configured to plan to maneuver the first vehicle to complete an action; predict that a second vehicle will take a responsive action; maneuver the first vehicle towards completing the action in a way that would allow the first vehicle to cancel completing the action without causing a collision between the first vehicle and the second vehicle, and in order to indicate to the second vehicle or a driver of the second vehicle that the first vehicle is attempting to complete the action; determine whether the second vehicle is taking the particular responsive action in response to the maneuvering; and when the first vehicle is determined to be able to take the action, complete the action by controlling the first vehicle autonomously using the determination of whether the second vehicle begins to take the particular responsive action.
- the particular responsive action includes slowing the second vehicle down to a particular speed. In another example, the particular responsive action includes changing a current lane of the second vehicle. In another example, when the second vehicle is determined to have begun to take the particular responsive action, the one or more processors are configured to complete the action before a time when the second vehicle would have passed by the first vehicle had the first vehicle not completed the action. In another example, the one or more processors are further configured to, prior to the maneuvering, predict that the second vehicle is likely to take the particular responsive action. In another example, the action is making a right turn from a first roadway to a second roadway in order to pull in front of the second vehicle on the second roadway. In another example, the action is making a left turn from a first roadway to leave the first roadway and requires crossing in front of the second vehicle on the first roadway. In another example, the action is making a left turn into a parking lot or driveway.
- a further aspect of the disclosure provides a non-transitory computer readable storage medium on which instructions are stored.
- the instructions when executed by one or more processors cause the one or more processors to perform a method of controlling a first vehicle autonomously.
- the method includes planning, by one or more processors, to maneuver the first vehicle to complete an action; predicting that a second vehicle will take a responsive action; maneuvering, by the one or more processors, the first vehicle towards completing the action in a way that would allow the first vehicle to cancel completing the action without causing a collision between the first vehicle and the second vehicle, and in order to indicate to the second vehicle or a driver of the second vehicle that the first vehicle is attempting to complete the action; determining, by the one or more processors, whether the second vehicle is taking the particular responsive action in response to the maneuvering; and when the first vehicle is determined to be able to take the action, completing the action, by the one or more processors, by controlling the first vehicle autonomously using the determination of whether the second vehicle begins to take the particular responsive action
- FIG. 1 is a functional diagram of an example vehicle in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is an example representation of detailed map information in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIGS. 3A-3D are example external views of a vehicle in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 4 is a functional diagram of an example system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment.
- FIG. 5 is a pictorial diagram of the system of FIG. 6 in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIGS. 6-11 are example situations in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- FIG. 12 is a flow diagram in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the autonomous vehicle may first predict what will occur if the vehicle were to take the action.
- an action may include making a left turn in front of another vehicle (turning left in front of someone), passing another vehicle (i.e. on a town lane road), or making a right turn in front of a vehicle (pulling out in front of the vehicle) in order to follow a particular route to a destination.
- the prediction may indicate that the autonomous vehicle would be able to complete the behavior safely (i.e. not coming within a certain distance of the other vehicle depending upon the speed of the vehicles) so long as the other vehicle took some responsive action, such as slowing down, etc.
- the action may be considered an assertive action. In this regard, if the action was not an assertive action, the autonomous vehicle would simply complete the action.
- the predictions themselves may be based on behavior models for the type of object.
- These behavior models may be pre-stored and configured to provide one or more predictive behavior outcomes for the type of object given a particular scenario.
- These behavior models may thus be created from human studies, intuition about how objects will behave, learned from data gathered by the vehicle's perception system.
- the behavior models may provide prediction information, for instance, include expected reaction times, speed changes, changes in headings, etc.
- the autonomous vehicle may act to “test” the prediction for the assertive behavior.
- This action may include physically initiating a turn or movement around a vehicle, but doing so and then stopping (where appropriate) or slowing down so as to not fully commit to the assertive action.
- This act may be a very small step towards completing the action, but is sufficient to put the other vehicle on notice that the autonomous vehicle intends to complete the assertive action.
- a very small movement towards completing the assertive action can put other human drivers on notice of the vehicle's “intention” to complete the assertive action as soon as possible.
- the vehicle's computers can delay completing the assertive action and leave room to stop completely and not complete the assertive action.
- the autonomous vehicle's computers may determine whether the other object has begun to take the responsive action according to the prediction. If this does not occur according to the prediction or occurs too late, because the autonomous vehicle has only taken some small step towards the aggressive behavior, the autonomous vehicle may “abort” the aggressive behavior. In this way, the autonomous vehicle can act to prevent an accident or the vehicles coming too close to one another.
- the autonomous vehicle may fully commit to the aggressive behavior and proceed. In this way, the autonomous vehicle can be more certain that the aggressive behavior is understood by the other vehicle and can be completed safely.
- the features described herein may allow the autonomous vehicle to drive with more finesse or rather, more like a human driver. This, in turn, can make the experience as a passenger in the vehicle less stressful and annoying, without compromising on safety as discussed above.
- a vehicle 100 in accordance with one aspect of the disclosure includes various components. While certain aspects of the disclosure are particularly useful in connection with specific types of vehicles, the vehicle may be any type of vehicle including, but not limited to, cars, trucks, motorcycles, busses, recreational vehicles, etc.
- the vehicle may have one or more computing devices, such as computing device 110 containing one or more processors 120 , memory 130 and other components typically present in general purpose computing devices.
- the memory 130 stores information accessible by the one or more processors 120 , including instructions 132 and data 134 that may be executed or otherwise used by the processor 120 .
- the memory 130 may be of any type capable of storing information accessible by the processor, including a computing device-readable medium, or other medium that stores data that may be read with the aid of an electronic device, such as a hard-drive, memory card, ROM, RAM, DVD or other optical disks, as well as other write-capable and read-only memories.
- Systems and methods may include different combinations of the foregoing, whereby different portions of the instructions and data are stored on different types of media.
- the instructions 132 may be any set of instructions to be executed directly (such as machine code) or indirectly (such as scripts) by the processor.
- the instructions may be stored as computing device code on the computing device-readable medium.
- the terms “instructions” and “programs” may be used interchangeably herein.
- the instructions may be stored in object code format for direct processing by the processor, or in any other computing device language including scripts or collections of independent source code modules that are interpreted on demand or compiled in advance. Functions, methods and routines of the instructions are explained in more detail below.
- the data 134 may be retrieved, stored or modified by processor 120 in accordance with the instructions 132 .
- data 134 of memory 130 may store behavior models.
- the behavior models may be configured to provide predictions for the actions of specific types of objects such as different vehicles (passenger vehicle, motorcycles, large trucks (e.g. tractor trailers), busses, etc.) or pedestrians or bicyclists. These behavior models may thus be created from human studies, intuition about how objects will behave, learned from data gathered by the vehicle's perception system.
- the behavior models may provide prediction information, for instance, include expected reaction times, speed changes (how quickly will the object accelerate or declerate and how aggressively will the object brake or accelerate), changes in headings, etc.
- the data may also store accommodation protocols for the vehicle.
- accommodation protocols may include addition requirements for a vehicle intended to allow the vehicle to operate in a way which promotes the comfort and security of a passenger of the vehicle.
- the accommodation protocols may require that when vehicle 100 makes a turn in front of another vehicle, the two vehicles may come no closer than some predetermined distance such as 5 to 10 meters. While this may not be a “legal” requirement, having such accommodation protocols allows passengers of vehicle 100 (as well as other vehicles on the roadway) to feel safe and more comfortable.
- the accommodation protocols may require that any actions of the vehicle 100 may not require other vehicles to take actions which would compromise the comfort and security of passengers of the other vehicles. For instance, the vehicle may not take an action that would require another vehicle to change that other vehicle's current behavior “too much”. In other words, the accommodation protocols may limit an amount of action or type of action by another vehicle in response to an action by the vehicle 100 .
- the vehicle's computing devices may prohibit the vehicle 100 from taking that action. For instance, actions that would require another vehicle to accelerate or decelerate too quickly (too high a rate of acceleration or deceleration would be uncomfortable for passengers), change lanes or drive on a shoulder, or drive in a way which is contrary to legal requirements for vehicles such as at too high a speed or making an illegal turn in order to avoid a collision would be prohibited by the accommodation protocols. At the same time, however, some actions by the vehicle 100 which would cause smaller amounts of deceleration or acceleration by another vehicle, as discussed further below, may be acceptable according to or fall within the accommodation protocols.
- the one or more processor 120 may be any conventional processors, such as commercially available CPUs. Alternatively, the one or more processors may be a dedicated device such as an ASIC or other hardware-based processor.
- FIG. 1 functionally illustrates the processor, memory, and other elements of computing device 110 as being within the same block, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the processor, computing device, or memory may actually include multiple processors, computing devices, or memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing.
- internal electronic display 152 may be controlled by a dedicated computing device having its own processor or central processing unit (CPU), memory, etc. which may interface with the computing device 110 via a high-bandwidth or other network connection.
- CPU central processing unit
- this computing device may be a user interface computing device which can communicate with a user's client device.
- the memory may be a hard drive or other storage media located in a housing different from that of computing device 110 . Accordingly, references to a processor or computing device will be understood to include references to a collection of processors or computing devices or memories that may or may not operate in parallel.
- Computing device 110 may all of the components normally used in connection with a computing device such as the processor and memory described above as well as a user input 150 (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, touch screen and/or microphone) and various electronic displays (e.g., a monitor having a screen or any other electrical device that is operable to display information).
- the vehicle includes an internal electronic display 152 as well as one or more speakers 154 to provide information or audio visual experiences.
- internal electronic display 152 may be located within a cabin of vehicle 100 and may be used by computing device 110 to provide information to passengers within the vehicle 100 .
- the one or more speakers 154 may include external speakers that are arranged at various locations on the vehicle in order to provide audible notifications to objects external to the vehicle 100 .
- computing device 110 may be an autonomous driving computing system incorporated into vehicle 100 .
- the autonomous driving computing system may capable of communicating with various components of the vehicle.
- computing device 110 may be in communication with various systems of vehicle 100 , such as deceleration system 160 (for controlling braking of the vehicle), acceleration system 162 (for controlling acceleration of the vehicle), steering system 164 (for controlling the orientation of the wheels and direction of the vehicle), signaling system 166 (for controlling turn signals), navigation system 168 (for navigating the vehicle to a location or around objects), positioning system 170 (for determining the position of the vehicle), perception system 172 (for detecting objects in the vehicle's environment), and power system 174 (for example, a battery and/or gas or diesel powered engine) in order to control the movement, speed, etc.

- the perception system 172 also includes one or more components for detecting and performing analysis on objects external to the vehicle such as other vehicles, obstacles in the roadway, traffic signals, signs, trees, etc.
- the perception system 172 may include lasers, sonar, radar, one or more cameras, or any other detection devices which record data which may be processed by computing device 110 .
- the vehicle is a small passenger vehicle such as a car
- the car may include a laser mounted on the roof or other convenient location.
- the computing device 110 may control the direction and speed of the vehicle by controlling various components.
- computing device 110 may navigate the vehicle to a destination location completely autonomously using data from map information and navigation system 168 (discussed further below).

- the computing devices 110 may then maneuver the vehicle autonomously (or in an autonomous driving mode) as described above along the route towards the destination.
- the computing devices 110 may determine that the first vehicle must take a particular action. For instance, an action may include making a left turn onto another roadway, parking lot or driveway, passing another vehicle where the other vehicle is driving erratically or well below the speed limit, or making a right turn onto another roadway. Many of these actions may be completed by simply waiting, for instance, until there are no other vehicles around with which there is any likelihood of a collision. However, especially in high traffic areas, this type of tactic can be frustrating for passengers and cause undue delays.
- the vehicle may determine whether it can take a more assertive action, for instance by making a turn in front of a vehicle (pulling out in front of the vehicle), proceeding into a bottleneck, finding a gap between two vehicles (for instance when changing lanes), proceeding through an intersection with a multi-way stop (i.e. a four or two-way stop), or passing a vehicle in order to follow a particular route to a destination.
- a more assertive action can be dependent upon how other vehicles on the roadway are likely to respond to that assertive action.
- FIGS. 6-10 are examples of different situations in which a vehicle may need to take such an assertive action, such as those noted above, in order to proceed along a route and avoid uncomfortable or inconvenient delays for any passenger or passengers of the vehicle.
- the examples are not intended to be limiting, but provide real-world situations in which an autonomous vehicle may take an assertive behavior. In that regard, the examples are somewhat simplified and do not depict all situations in which the features described herein may be utilized.
- the examples provided herein are specific to left-hand drive countries, but may be equally as relevant to right-hand drive countries (assuming the directions of lanes and turns were reversed, etc.).

- vehicle 100 is driving towards intersection 604 and following a route that requires the vehicle 100 to make a left turn at intersection 604 .
- the route is represented by dashed arrow 670 .
- vehicle 100 is driving out of and away from intersection 604 and following a route represented by dashed arrow 770 .
- vehicle is making a right turn and following a route represented by dashed arrow 870 .
- the perception system 172 may provide the computing devices 110 with information about the vehicle's environment. This may include, for instance information identifying objects in the vehicle's environment and characteristics of those objects, such as type, location, speed, heading, size, shape, etc. For example, the computing device 110 may receive information identify other vehicles in the roadway, the type of the vehicles (passenger vehicle, bus, truck, etc.) as well as their speed, heading, size, etc.
- the computing devices 110 may receive information regarding the location of vehicle 680 as well as its type, speed, and heading (shown by the direction of arrow 682 ). In FIG.
- the computing devices 110 may receive information regarding the location of vehicle 680 as well as its type, speed, and heading. In this example, the information may indicate that vehicle 780 is stopped or nearly stopped in the roadway or otherwise driving erratically, for instance, by swerving in the lane or driving partially on a shoulder, etc.
- the computing devices 110 may receive information regarding the location of vehicle 880 as well as its type, speed, and heading (shown by the direction of arrow 882 ).
- the computing devices 110 may also determine whether the action can be completed at a particular point in time, according to the accommodation protocols and without requiring a responsive action from another vehicle. In other words, the computing devices may determine whether the action is an assertive action as discussed above. For example, returning to FIG. 6 , given the speed of vehicle 680 and the distance between vehicle 680 and intersection 604 , there may not be enough time for the vehicle 100 to enter the intersection 604 and complete the left turn without coming too close to vehicle 680 . In other words, assuming vehicle 680 's speed were consistent, if vehicle 100 made a left turn in front of vehicle 680 , the vehicles may come so close to one another that vehicle 100 would violate the accommodation protocols. Similarly, in the example of FIG.
- vehicle 100 if vehicle 100 made a right turn in front of vehicle 880 (for instance by merging onto the roadway in front of vehicle 880 ), the vehicles may come so close to one another that vehicle 100 would violate the accommodation protocols.
- the vehicle 100 would typically not be able to pass vehicle 780 as the vehicles are driving on a two-lane road and passing would require vehicle 780 to cross lane lines 610 to enter the lane of opposing traffic and again would violate the accommodation protocols.
- the vehicle 100 could simply complete the action, as the action would not be considered assertive.
- the computing devices 110 may make a prediction about how another object would react to vehicle 100 attempting to complete the assertive action. For instance, the computing device 100 may generate a prediction that the other object will take a particular responsive action which would allow the vehicle 100 to comply with accommodation protocols of the first vehicle if the first vehicle were to complete the action at a particular point in time.
- the prediction may indicate that the autonomous vehicle would be able to complete the assertive action safely or while complying with the accommodation protocols if the other vehicle were to take the predicted responsive action. For instance, completing a left or right turn as in FIG. 6 or 8 would require that the vehicles not a certain distance of one another, such as 5 or 10 meters, etc. depending upon the speed of the vehicles in order to comply with the accommodation protocols. In some instances, completing the turn may still comply with the accommodation protocols so long as the other vehicle took some responsive action, such as slowing down, etc. in order to maintain the minimum distance between the vehicles. Thus, because the action would require the other vehicle to take some responsive action, the action may be considered an assertive action. In this regard and as noted above, if the action was not an assertive action, the vehicle 100 would simply complete the action because the vehicle would be able to do so while complying with the accommodation protocols.
- passing vehicle 780 safely may require that vehicle 100 do so as quickly as possible so that vehicle 100 spends as little time as possible in the lane of opposing traffic.
- passing a vehicle by entering a lane of opposing traffic may always be considered an assertive action.
- the predictions themselves may be based on the behavior models. For instance, regarding FIG. 6 , the locations, headings and speeds of vehicles 100 and 680 with respect to the intersection 604 may be used as inputs to a behavior model for objects such as vehicles like vehicle 680 (i.e. small passenger vehicles). The behavior model may then provide a prediction about how the vehicle 680 would respond if vehicle 100 attempted to make the left turn in front of vehicle 680 (i.e. without waiting for vehicle 680 to pass through the intersection). For example, in the situation of FIG. 6 , vehicle 680 may be expected to slow down if vehicle 100 were to attempt to make the left turn along route 670 in front of vehicle 680 .
- a behavior model for objects such as vehicles like vehicle 680 (i.e. small passenger vehicles).
- the behavior model may then provide a prediction about how the vehicle 680 would respond if vehicle 100 attempted to make the left turn in front of vehicle 680 (i.e. without waiting for vehicle 680 to pass through the intersection).
- vehicle 680 may be expected to slow down if
- the vehicle 100 may be able to complete the action without violating the accommodation protocols.
- the left turn of FIG. 6 may be considered an assertive behavior.
- the vehicle 100 were to wait until vehicle 680 had passed vehicle 100 in the intersection, the left turn would not be considered an assertive behavior.
- completing a passing maneuver around vehicle 780 safely may require that vehicle 100 do so as quickly as possible so that vehicle 100 spends as little time as possible in the lane of opposing traffic.
- the behavior model may predict that in order to complete the action safely, vehicle 780 must take one or more of various actions including slowing down, pulling towards the closest shoulder, changing lanes (where applicable), etc. In other words, if vehicle 780 were to speed up, this would make completing the action too dangerous, such that the computing device 110 would not complete the passing maneuver.
- the behavior model may provide a prediction about how the vehicle 880 would respond if vehicle 100 attempted to make the right turn in front of vehicle 880 (i.e. without waiting for vehicle 880 to pass by vehicle 100 ).
- vehicle 880 may be expected to slow down if vehicle 100 were to attempt to make the right turn along route 870 in front of vehicle 880 .
- the vehicle 100 may be able to complete the action without violating the accommodation protocols.
- the right turn of FIG. 8 may be considered an assertive behavior.
- the left turn would not be considered an assertive behavior.
- the vehicle may act to “test” the prediction for the assertive behavior.
- This action may include maneuvering the vehicle towards completing the action, but doing so very slowly, stopping (where appropriate), or slowing down so as to not fully commit to the assertive action.
- This act may be a very small step towards completing the action, but is sufficient to put the other vehicle on notice that the vehicle 100 intends to complete the assertive behavior.
- a very small movement towards completing the assertive action can put other human drivers on notice of the vehicle's “intention” to complete the assertive action as soon as possible.
- the vehicle's computers can delay completing the assertive action and leave room to stop completely and not complete the assertive behavior.
- the computing devices 110 may move vehicle 100 to the position shown in example 900 of FIG. 9 .
- vehicle 100 has moved into the intersection 604 and angled itself towards the right turn.
- the positioning has vehicle 100 moved slightly towards and into the lane of vehicle 680 , but still provides vehicle 680 with sufficient room to pass through the intersection 604 without colliding with vehicle 100 .
- This positioning of the vehicle 100 may indicate to vehicle 680 (or to the driver of vehicle 680 as the case may be) that vehicle 100 intends to make a left turn.
- Other signals, such as a turn signal may also be used to indicate the intent of the vehicle's computing devices.
- the computing devices 110 may move vehicle 100 to the position shown in example 1000 of FIG. 10 .
- vehicle 100 has moved partially into the lane of opposing traffic and has increased its speed slightly to prepare to pass vehicle 780 .
- This positioning of the vehicle 100 may indicate to vehicle 780 (or to the driver of vehicle 780 as the case may be) that vehicle 100 intends to pass vehicle 780 .
- other signals such as a turn signal may also be used to indicate the intent of the vehicle's computing devices.
- the computing devices 110 may move vehicle 100 to the position shown in example 1100 of FIG. 11 .
- This positioning has vehicle 100 moved slightly towards and into the lane of vehicle 880 , but still provides vehicle 880 with sufficient room to pass by vehicle 100 without colliding with vehicle 100 .
- This positioning of the vehicle 100 may indicate to vehicle 880 (or to the driver of vehicle 880 as the case may be) that vehicle 100 intends to make a right turn.
- Other signals, such as a turn signal may also be used to indicate the intent of the vehicle's computing devices.
- the autonomous vehicle's computers may determine whether the other object has begun to take the responsive action according to the prediction. If this does not occur according to the prediction or occurs too late, because the vehicle 100 has only taken some small step towards the assertive action, the autonomous vehicle may “abort” the assertive action. In this way, the autonomous vehicle can act to prevent an accident or the vehicles coming too close to one another (e.g. within 5 or 10 meters as noted above). In this way, the autonomous vehicle can be more certain that the assertive behavior is understood by the other vehicle (or driver of the other vehicle) and can be completed safely.
- vehicle 680 As vehicle 100 moves into intersection 604 , vehicle 680 also moves closer to intersection 604 (compare with FIG. 6 ). If vehicle 680 has slowed down to a particular speed or at a particular rate of deceleration that meets the predicted responsive action (in other words, that vehicle 680 has slowed down enough), vehicle 100 may simply complete the assertive action and making the left turn without waiting for vehicle 680 to pass vehicle 100 or through the intersection. If vehicle does not take an action that meets the predicted responsive action, for instance, if vehicle 680 does not slow down enough or speeds up, vehicle 100 may abort the assertive action and simply wait for vehicle 680 to pass vehicle 100 before making the left turn.
- vehicle 780 may move forward slightly or remain stopped (or as in the other example, continue to drive erratically). If vehicle 780 has slowed down to a particular speed or at a particular rate of deceleration or pulls towards a shoulder in a way that meets the predicted responsive action, vehicle 100 may simply complete the assertive action and pass vehicle 780 using the lane of opposing traffic. If vehicle does not take an action that meets the predicted responsive action, for instance, if vehicle 680 does not slow down enough, speeds up, or moves towards lane lines 610 , vehicle 100 may abort the assertive action and pull back into the lane of vehicle 780 . Of course, vehicle 100 may attempt the passing maneuver again in the future.
- vehicle 880 As vehicle 100 moves into the lane of vehicle 880 , vehicle 880 also moves into intersection 604 (compare with FIG. 8 ). If vehicle 880 has slowed down to a particular speed or at a particular rate of deceleration that meets the predicted responsive action, vehicle 100 may simply complete the assertive action and make the right turn without waiting for vehicle 680 to pass vehicle 100 . If vehicle does not take an action that meets the predicted responsive action, for instance, if vehicle 880 does not slow down enough or speeds up, vehicle 100 may abort the assertive action and simply wait for vehicle 880 to pass vehicle 100 before making the right turn.
- predictions for various other types of assertive maneuvers may be made and tested in accordance with the examples above. For instance, when vehicle 100 is proceeding into a bottleneck, such as where a garbage truck, emergency vehicle, or construction is partially blocking a lane of a two-lane road, the computing devices may make and test predictions about the reaction of other vehicles. This may require vehicle 100 to take an assertive action by driving partially into the lane of oncoming traffic in order to move around the object or move as far right as possible to give an oncoming vehicle enough room to pass the object as well.
- a bottleneck such as where a garbage truck, emergency vehicle, or construction is partially blocking a lane of a two-lane road
- the computing devices may make and test predictions about the reaction of other vehicles. This may require vehicle 100 to take an assertive action by driving partially into the lane of oncoming traffic in order to move around the object or move as far right as possible to give an oncoming vehicle enough room to pass the object as well.
- the computing devices may predict that the other vehicle will or will not provide vehicle 100 with enough room to safely pass the object, and the computing devices may test the prediction by beginning to move the vehicle 100 around the object slowly and waiting for the oncoming vehicle to react according to the prediction before completing the assertive action.
- predictions may be made and tested when finding a gap between two vehicles. For instance, when the vehicle 100 needs to change to an adjacent lane, but there is not sufficient room according to the accommodation protocols between two vehicles in the adjacent lane.
- the computing devices may predict whether the two vehicles will increase the gap if the vehicle 100 begins to move towards the gap. Again, the computing devices may test the prediction by beginning to move the vehicle towards the gap and using a turn signal to indicate that the vehicle intends to move between the two vehicles. The computing devices may wait to complete the assertive action until one or both of the two vehicles begins to react (for instance by closing, maintaining, or increasing the gap).
- the computing devices may make and test predictions when stopped before proceeding through an intersection with a multi-way stop (i.e. a four or two-way stop), where there is another vehicle also stopped at the intersection.
- the computing devices may predict whether the other vehicle will allow vehicle 100 to proceed first. Again, the computing devices may maneuver the vehicle in order to test the prediction, for instance, but rolling vehicle 100 into the intersection and waiting to complete the assertive action until the other vehicle begins to react (for instance, by also proceeding into the intersection or remaining stationary).
- FIG. 12 is an example flow diagram 1200 of controlling a first vehicle, such as vehicle 100 , autonomously which may be performed by one or more computing devices, such as computing device 110 .
- the one or more computing devices determine whether the first vehicle is able to take an action at block 1210 .
- the action is completed by controlling the first vehicle autonomously using the determination of whether the second vehicle begins to take the particular responsive action.
