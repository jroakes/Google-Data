Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to a system and method for searching on the World Wide Web; specifically, a system and method for locating URLs based on incomplete or partially specified URL entries.
- search engines such as those mentioned above build site databases by crawling pages of the Internet, extracting keywords, and building an index of Web pages based on the keywords appearing on the Web pages. A site is found when the keywords entered match keywords in the index.
- Some search sites include the URL of a Web page as part of the text description of the Web page. Thus, there is no real differentiation between searching the URL and the body of the text. For example, if one specifies “apple” as a search term, sites having the word “apple” in the URL such as www.apple.com or www.appledaily.com would be returned as well as sites which contain “apple” somewhere in the text.
- Wildcards are commonly used in directory searches in operating systems like UNIX and in text editor searches in editors such as Emacs. For example, when a file search using “*.exe” as a search term is entered, all execution files having the “.exe” extension will be shown as found by the computer, with “*” being a wildcard representing any length of characters.
- the present invention is directed to a system and method for supporting the searching of a partially specified URL address with wild card characters.
- An object of the present invention is to provide a system for facilitating return of URL addresses based on partially specified URL entries.
- Another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method for searching URL addresses based on a partially specified URL address that may be incomplete or contain wild card characters, and taking into account user-specified related keywords, the user profile, and recently accessed URL addresses for pruning and ranking the search results.
- a system for providing service to a user for searching URL addresses on an electronic network comprises: a search site server node having a search request handler for handling partially entered URL addresses and matching incomplete URL addresses to partial URL addresses having a wildcard symbol; a search site server logic for storing, ranking and returning search results; and a client station for entering the partially specified URL address, a related keyword, and for providing information on a recently accessed website URL list.
- a maintenance routine for building a URL index and updating the user profile database is included in the search site server logic.
- a method for storing URL addresses of different sites in a website URL database, building an index having related keywords in database, providing a partially specified URL address and a keyword, searching the URL database for the sites containing the partially specified URL address, filtering out sites which do not contain the keyword specified, and using profile information, specified keywords and a list of recently accessed URL addresses to rank the remaining sites that partially match the incomplete/incorrect URL address.

- system modules and method steps described herein are preferably implemented in software as an application comprising program instructions that are tangibly embodied on one or more program storage devices (e.g., RAM, ROM, etc.) and executable by any platform comprising suitable architecture. It is to be further understood that, because the system modules and process steps depicted in the accompanying Figures are preferably implemented in software, the actual connections between such steps may differ depending upon the manner in which the present invention is programmed. Given the teachings herein, one of ordinary skill in the related art will be able to contemplate these and similar implementations or configurations of the present invention.
- FIG. 1 depicts an environment having features of the present invention.
- a Web site ( 105 ) providing search service based on a partially specified Web site URL address can be implemented on a computing server.
- the server and the website can be accessed through the communication network ( 110 ), which preferably is a global electronic network such as the Internet.
- Web sites ( 130 , 140 , and 150 ) are content providers, advertisers, or other sponsors connected to the network.
- Client stations ( 115 , 125 , and 135 ) access via network ( 110 ) all connected websites including the search site 105 via browsers (e.g., Explorer, Navigator) running on client PCs, hand-held, or wireless devices. Some of the client stations may configure their browsers to go through one of proxy servers ( 160 , 170 , and 180 ) to access the various Web sites ( 130 , 140 and 150 ).
- proxy servers 160 , 170 , and 180
- FIG. 2 depicts a more detailed example of a network ( 201 ) and system having features of the present invention.
- a search site server node ( 203 ) is used to represent a computing node that can serve search requests through the network ( 201 ).
- the search site server node preferably includes a CPU ( 260 ), memory ( 263 ) such as RAM, and storage devices ( 265 ) such as DASD.
- the memory ( 263 ) stores the search site server logic ( 268 ) which provides the search request handler ( 264 ) and maintenance routine ( 266 ), preferably embodied as a computer executable code which is loaded from DASD ( 265 ) into memory ( 263 ) for execution by the CPU ( 260 ).
- the URL search request handler ( 264 ) includes code executable by CPU ( 260 ) to cause server node ( 203 ) to receive users' requests and conduct URL searches based on the users' entries.
- the maintenance routine ( 266 ) includes code executable by CPU ( 260 ) for causing server node 203 to build the URL index and update the user profile. These steps will be described in further detail below and in FIG. 6 .
- Search site server logic ( 268 ) maintains a Web site URL database ( 270 ), which stores the URL addresses of most websites accessible through the Internet, and user profile database ( 275 ) which stores information on users.
- a representative client station ( 209 ) is preferably a networked or stand-alone station.
- the client station includes a CPU ( 240 ), memory ( 245 ) such as RAM, and storage devices ( 242 ) such as DASD.
- the memory ( 245 ) stores the client logic 244 for processing and sending the user request to the server.
- the client logic 244 is preferably embodied as computer executable codes which are loaded from DASD ( 242 ) into memory ( 245 ) for execution by the CPU ( 240 ).
- the client station is preferably a PC, but can be a handheld device such as a Palm Pilot, or a cellular telephone having capability for accessing the Internet, such as by operation of wireless application protocol (WAP).
- WAP wireless application protocol
- FIG. 3A depicts an example of a client routine having features of the present invention.
- the client enters a partially specified Web-site URL address, which can contain wild card characters such as “*” and “?”, where “*” represents a string of any length of any character and “?” represents any single character.
- “*price*.com” ( 350 ) can represent any URL including the five characters “price” and ending with “.com”.
- the URL, www.priceline.com will be one of them, whereas the URL www.printerhouse.com will not, since the word “price” does not appear anywhere in the URL.
- a second example can be “www.my*pc.com” ( 355 ), which can include the URL www.myfavoritepc.com, but not www.inmyoldpc.com, because the latter URL contains characters before the letters “my” in the URL.
- www.b*n*.com 360
- search requests can return with numerous matches. Therefore, the user can narrow down the search results by specifying keywords related to the content of the partially specified address.
- FIG. 3A it's next ascertained whether the user wants to provide additional information in the form of keywords related to the Web site ( 310 ). If not, the request and entry is forwarded to the server. If so, in step 315 , the user inputs the keywords relating to the site of interest.
- the search vehicle has additional information on the searcher, such as types of websites visited, types of goods purchased, or the age and sex of the searcher, such information can be used to predict or rank websites returned to the searcher. For example, if a user enters www.buy*.com, the search results may yield www.buypc.com or www.buycar.com. If it is known that the user is computer enthusiast, the www.buypc.com site should be returned with a higher rank than the www.buycar.com site. To illustrate, in step 320 , it's ascertained whether the browser can provide information on a history of recently accessed Web site URL lists, for example, the last 50 sites the user has visited. If so, in step 330 , the recently accessed URL list is added. In step 340 , the request is sent to the server of the search site. An alternative implementation is to let the proxy server provide the recently accessed URL list of a user.
- FIG. 4 depicts an example of a server routine which causes server node ( 203 ) to process user requests.
- the server node ( 203 ) checks for input from the network. If the input request is for searching based on a partially specified Web site address, the URL search request handler is invoked in step 415 to receive the search requests and return appropriate results. If the input request is for searching based on keywords or other type of searches, in step 420 the other search request handler is invoked. This can be a conventional search engine known to one ordinarily skilled in the art. If the input is for periodic maintenance of the Web site URL address database and user profile database, in step 410 the maintenance routine is invoked.
- FIG. 5A depicts a Web site URL database ( 505 ) and FIG. 5B depicts a user profile database ( 510 ) useable in the present invention.
- user ID user ID
- cookie information 518
- last n search results selected 520
- the search results may be ibm.com or dell.com
- the recently accessed URL list 525
- keywords e.g., CD drive, monitors, DVD
- search site can get a user to register with it, then additional demographic user information ( 540 ) such as age, sex, household income, etc., and subjects of interest ( 550 ) (e.g., computers, books) to the user can also be collected and stored in the user profile.
- additional demographic user information such as age, sex, household income, etc.
- subjects of interest e.g., computers, books
- the additional user information can be treated similar to the top m keywords ( 530 ) when applied to help rank the search results.
- the user information is used to rank results in the order that they are most relevant to the user.
- the search site can also partition or cluster users into peer groups and then derive useful information from the peer group to help rank the search results.
- the useful information derived from the peer group can also be added to the user profile database. This is referred to in FIG. 5 as peer group information ( 560 ).
- the top m keywords of interest to the peer group but not included in the top m keyword field ( 530 ) of a user, can be included in the peer group information field ( 560 ). Therefore, the top keywords of interest to a peer group as a whole are also taken into account through each individual profile. In this way, peer group information ( 560 ) is used to narrow down the results of a search to the sites likely to be of interest to the user.
- FIGS. 6 and 7 show an example of a maintenance routine which incorporates a URL index builder routine.
- the URL index builder is invoked which gathers and stores information on URL's and related keywords of websites.
- the profile updater is invoked, which updates the user profile based on information from a server log. The profile updater will be further described below with reference to FIG. 9 .
- a conventional search engine can be used to crawl the Web to get all Web pages, read the information on the URLs of all Web sites, and select keywords which appear in the Web pages of each site.
- the keywords selected preferably are based on meta information, such as the “meta” HTML tag in the header of a document, or XML-based semantic information, or PICS-based annotations (on the page or from a remote reputation server).
- the keywords selected could also be based on the frequency of occurrences, i.e. the most frequently occurring words at a site.
- the URL index builder stores the URLs of all Web sites with related keywords in a database.
- a Web site URL index is built for fast retrieval based on a partially specified URL address.
- an inverted index is built based on each character and character string up to a pre-specified length.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an example of an inverted index built from the Web site URL database according to the present invention.
- the inverted index is shown based on the exemplary Web site database shown in FIG. 5 , where the database contains 3 Web site URL entries.
- the list of Web site URLs that contain the character or string of characters is listed. For example if the requester input “*a*” as the partially specified URL, the server will follow the links pointed to by “a” ( 805 ), which include amazon.com ( 807 ) and ebay.com ( 808 ). If the requester specify “*am*”, the server will follow the links pointed to by “am” ( 810 ) which include amazon.com ( 817 ), but not ebay.com.
- FIG. 9 depicts an example of a profile updater for updating the user profile with new information.
- the server updates the user profile based on information from the server log. Specifically, in step 905 , the server uses the search result selected and the recently accessed URL list to update the last n search results selected field ( 520 ), the recently accessed URL list ( 525 ) and the top m keyword field ( 530 ) in the user profile.
- the users in the user profile database are clustered or partitioned into peer groups.
- the clustering can be based on demographic information and/or the recently accessed URL list.
- the information learned from the peer group of each user is also added to the user profile database in the peer group information field ( 560 ). For example, the top m keywords of interest to the peer group, but not included in the top m keyword field of a user, are added to his peer group information field ( 560 ).
- FIG. 10 depicts an example operation of the URL search request handler.
- the search site server receives the user request containing the partially specified Web site URL address and related information, such as keywords or the recently accessed URL list.
- the server uses the URL index to find all Web site URLs matching the partially specified URL address.
- the server filters out the irrelevant URLs from the matching list based on any keywords specified in the search request. That is to say for any Web site on the matching list, if the Web site content does not contain the keywords, it will be removed from the list.
- the URLs on the matching list are ranked by taking into account any keywords specified in the search request, the recently accessed URL list, and user profile.
- the URLs on the matching list is first ranked based on the number of keywords matched. For the URLs with the same number of matching keywords, those appearing in the recently accessed URL list will be ranked higher. Finally, for the URLs with the same number of matching keywords and status on the recently accessed list, user profile information can be used as a tie breaker. Those sites which contain keywords with a close match to the user profile will rank higher.
- the ranked Web site URL list is returned to the requesting user.
- the server logs the user request and its response to the search request, i.e. which Web site gets selected from the search result.
- a fuzzy search incorporating the use of fuzzy logic can be used to conduct searches based on incorrectly spelled URL addresses.
- Fuzzy logic is a computing technique that is a superset of conventional Boolean logic for handling the concept of partial truth (truth values between “completely true” and “completely false”) and as a means to model the uncertainty of natural language. While in Boolean logic the numbers 0 and 1 are used to represent extreme cases of truth (for example, “wide” or “narrow”), fuzzy logic also includes the various states of truth between a comparison of the two cases (0.45 of wideness). Applying this example to the present invention, looking at FIG.
- the URL search request handler will still return a list of search results based on partial matches to the web-site URL index, taking to account any keywords specified by the user, the user's recently accessed URL list, and user profile for ranking of the results.
- the search results based on the inverted index FIG. 8 would return www.amazon.com, even with the misspelled entry.
- a composite function taking into account the keywords specified in the search request, the recently accessed URL list, the subject of interests, etc., to rank the search result. Different weights can be assigned to each factor.
- a composite function can be of the form w 1 *(number of matching keywords)+w 2 * (number of matching subject interests)+w 3 (if the Web site appears in the recently accessed URL list), where w 1 , w 2 and w 3 are different weights.
- a browser is not used to provide the recently accessed URL list of a user.
- a proxy server will track the access pattern of each user and maintain the recently accessed URL list of each user.
- the proxy server uses the recently accessed URL list to rerank the search results provided by the search site. This can be done in a similar way to step 1020 of FIG. 10 .
- the server node operating the search site determines the peer group and derives useful information from the peer group of each user to further refine the ranking of the search results.
- the user group can be defined based on similar subject of interests and/or interests on content keywords of Web sites. It can also be based on the user's Web address, e.g. all users from ibm.com can be treated as one peer group.
- Other user groups can be based on criteria such as all the employees of a company, residents of a municipality, members of a household, or subscribers to the same Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- ISP Internet Service Provider
- an alternative approach to derive information from the peer group is to derive the additional URLs accessed by the peer group and add them to the corresponding recently accessed URL list ( 525 ) of the user or to derive the additional subjects of interests from the peer group and add them to the corresponding subject of interests ( 550 ) of the user.
- proxy server can participate in ranking the search results.
- the proxy server uses Web sites accessed by all users (not the requester) as an input for ranking search results.
- the access frequency can also be useful information. Web sites that never get accessed by any users are less likely to be a search target, while popular Web sites are more likely to be a URL search target.
