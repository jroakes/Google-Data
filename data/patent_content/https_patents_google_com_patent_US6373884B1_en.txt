Definitions
- the present invention is related to the transmission data, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for transmitting data between communication devices.
- Data communication schemes have been developed and used to transmit data between devices, such as electronic devices, according to the type of data being transmitted.
- transmission is accomplished by sending bit streams and character streams which are slaved to accurately synchronized clocks at the transmitting and receiving stations. Because a constant time interval is established between successive bits, characters, or events, beginning and end pulses are not required with each character. That is, synchronous transmission associated with a clock signal keeps the transmitter and receiver in phase.
- the transmission of data is independently controlled by beginning and end pulses in each frame of data. Although the data may be partitioned into frames of a predetermined number of bits and control bytes must be transmitted, the transmission of the bits or frames are not dependent upon a clock signal.
- control signals or bytes are transmitted to provide the receiver with information to help decode the data.
- control bytes representing the beginning of a frame (BOF) of data and an end of frame (EOF) of data are transmitted to provide an indication to the receiver that the data frame has been sent when sending asynchronous data.
- the control bytes are particular bit arrangements which would be recognized by the receiver as having a particular meaning, such as that the data is being started or ended.
- a problem occurs when the control signals are present in the data to be transmitted. That is, a receiver may decode the bits of data as being a control signal, and incorrectly receive the remaining data of the frame.
- the data could be assigned bit patterns such that the data could not include the bit patterns of the control signals. For example, when transmitting ASCII bit patterns representing alphanumeric characters, the ASCII bit patterns could be chosen to insure that they do not correspond to control signal bit patterns.
- such systems for transmitting asynchronous data are limited to the transmission of predefined bit patterns representing certain characters, such as letters.
- the data is modified prior to transmitting to insure that the data does not include a control signal. For example, if the control signal represents six “one” bits in row, the transmitter will insert a “zero” bit whenever a five “one” bits are detected in the data. Accordingly, when the receiver detects five data bits, the receiver will remove the following “zero” and decode the next bit as either a “one” or “zero”. If the following bit is a “one” bit, representing six “one” bits of data, the receiver will not detect the six “one” bits as a control byte, but as data.
- the control signal represents six “one” bits in row
- the transmitter will insert a “zero” bit whenever a five “one” bits are detected in the data. Accordingly, when the receiver detects five data bits, the receiver will remove the following “zero” and decode the next bit as either a “one” or “zero”. If the following bit is a “one” bit, representing six “one” bits of data, the receiver will not detect the
- a control byte called an escape (“ESC”) byte is transmitted prior to sending a byte of data which corresponds to a control byte.
- the data byte itself could be altered, such by an “exclusive or” Boolean operation.
- the receiver Upon receiving an escape byte, the receiver would know that the following byte is not a control signal and should be decoded.
- such methods require the transmission of an escape byte for each byte which corresponds to a control byte, and also lowers the speed and efficiency of the data transmission system.
- Such a system also creates inconsistency in data efficiency. For example, if one frame coincidentially had a number of data bytes which coincided with control bits, the system would be particularly inefficient for that frame because it would have to send an escape byte for each such data byte

- a method and apparatus for transmitting data both improves efficiency and guarantees consistency in the data transmission rate.
- a data offset value is determined for each frame of data.
- the data offset value is used to modify the data to insure that the data does not include control bytes which are sent with the data.
- the offset value is calculated such that when the offset value is subtracted, such as by modulo 265 subtraction, from each byte of data in the frame, the bytes of data do not correspond to any control bytes which are sent.
- the offset value is then sent with the modified bytes of data to a receiver which decodes the data bytes by adding the offset value to each data byte and processes the data. Accordingly, only a single offset value must be transmitted with each frame of data to prevent each byte of data from being misinterpreted as a control byte.

- FIG. 2 a block diagram of a communication device, such as a cellular radiotelephone, incorporating the present invention is shown.
- a microprocessor 201 such as a 68HC11 microprocessor available from Motorola, Inc.
- a speech coder 203 combine to generate the necessary communication protocol for operating in a cellular system.
- Microprocessor 201 uses RAM 205 , EEPROM 207 , and ROM 209 , preferably consolidated in one package 211 , to execute the steps necessary to generate the protocol and to perform other functions for the communication unit, such as writing to a display 213 , accepting information from a keypad 215 , and controlling a frequency synthesizer 225 .
- Speech coder 203 processes audio transformed by audio circuitry 219 from a microphone 217 and to a speaker 221 .
- a transceiver processes the radio frequency signals.
- a transmitter 223 receives modulated data from data modulator 224 and transmits the data through an antenna 229 using carrier frequencies produced by a frequency synthesizer 225 .
- Information received by the communication device's antenna 229 enters receiver 227 which provides demodulated signals to the processing circuit by way of data demodulator 228 .
- the communication device may optionally include a message receiver and storage device 230 including digital signal processing means.
- the message receiver and storage device could be, for example, a digital answering machine or a paging receiver.
- the communication device may include a circuit switch modem 232 . Circuit switch modems are well known to those skilled in the art of telecommunications, and could be used to transmit data according to the present invention.
- the communication device includes a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) 231 .
- UARTs which are well known in the art, are used interface a controller to a bit serial communication network.
- UART 231 is coupled to a EIA-232 interface 233 for transmitting serial data.
- the communication device also includes a data formatter 234 for providing serial communication signals to an IR transceiver 236 .
- Formatter 234 insures that IR transmitter 236 is properly signalled to transmit the data provided by UART 231 according to IR data protocols.
- the transmitter portion of infrared (IR) transceiver 236 comprises a transmitter diode 238 , while the receiver portion comprises a detector diode 240 . While specific data transmission devices are shown, other data transmission devices could be used according to the present invention. Also, other arrangements for transmitting IR signals according to the method of the present invention could be employed.
- FIG. 3 a conventional frame for transmitting data is shown.
- the frame includes a BOF byte 302 , followed by an address/control byte 304 .
- Data bytes 306 , 310 , and 312 follow.
- a cyclical redundancy check (CRC) byte 314 as is well known in the art, is then transmitted.
- an EOF byte 316 is transmitted.
- an offset byte 402 is added to the frame. As will be described in more detail in reference to FIG.
- the offset byte is calculated to insure that the modified data bytes 404 , 406 , and 408 will not be identical to BOF byte 302 , EOF byte 316 , or other byte which may be transmitted, such as an ESC byte previously described.
- Modified data bytes 404 - 408 which are original bytes 306 , 310 - 312 modified by the offset, and CRC 410 , based upon the address/control byte, the offset byte and the modified data bytes, are also sent in the frame.
- Communication device 101 analyzes the data to be transmitted at a step 502 . For example, when transmitting a frame having data partitioned into bytes, the bytes are compared to control bytes to determine whether any of the data bytes corresponds to control bytes. The communication device will then calculate an offset value based upon the data at a step 504 The offset value will be calculated such that when the data is modified by the offset value at a step 506 , the modified data bytes will not correspond to any control bytes which are sent. For example, the offset could be subtracted from the data byte by modulo 256 subtraction to generate a modified data byte.
- the resulting modified data byte would then no longer correspond to the control signals.
- the data bytes could be modified by modulo 2 addition (i.e. providing the product of an “exclusive or” with a predetermined value, or some other function.
- the offset value and modified data is then sent to a receiver at a step 508 .
- the receiver can use the offset value to reconstruct the original data bytes.
- the communication device preferably in microprocessor 201 , creates a 256 bit flag array at a step 602 .
- Each bit in the flag array corresponds to a possible offset value.
- the communication device sets all bits in the flag array to a predetermined setting (e.g. “1”) at a step 604 .
- the communication device then clears the bits in the array associated with control bits. That is, the offset value should not be the same as a control byte.
- the communication device sets a pointer to the beginning of a data buffer, for example a voice data buffer, at a step 606 .
- the device sets the data value (DVAL) equal to next byte in the data buffer at a step 608 .
- DVAL data value
- the device then clears the bits in the data field array corresponding to control bytes at a step 610 . As has been described,
- the device determines whether the end of data buffer is reached at a step 612 . If the end of data buffer is not reached, the device will clear the appropriate bits in the data field array at step 610 for each DVAL. However, if the end of data buffer is reached at step 612 , the device will point to the beginning of the flag array at step 616 . The microprocessor will then scan the array for the next “1” at step 618 . The microprocessor will set the data offset to the current flag index at a step 622 . The microprocessor will then subtract the offset value from all data bytes in the buffer at a step 624 .
- the transmitter calculates an offset value based upon the data according to the steps of FIG. 6 at a step 702 .
- the transmitter modifies the data bytes, for example by subtracting the offset value from each byte, at a step 704 , and transmits the offset value and the modified data at a step 706 .
- the receiver receives the offset value and modified data bytes at a step 708 , and converts each modified data byte back to its original value (for example, by adding the offset value to the data bytes) at a step 710 .
- the receiver then decodes the data at a step 712 .
- the transmitter and receiver could be communication devices as shown in FIG. 2 .
- the present invention finds particular application in transmitting voice over and infrared link, such as between a radiotelephone and some accessory.
- the method and apparatus provides transparency to coded voice data transmitted over an infrared data link, so that bytes reserved for protocol purposes by the infrared data standard are not present in the voice data.
- the method and apparatus finds particular application in reducing the number of overhead bytes required to transmit full duplex 32 kbps ADPCM coded voice over a 115,200 bps infrared data link.
- the relaxed timing constraints, resulting from the reduction in added transparency data will facilitate software based implementations of the Infrared Data Association Telecom Voice Specification, and will improve the operation of the infrared data voice link under marginal conditions.
- This invention transmits an extra byte of transparency data with each 85 bytes of voice data to insure transparency.
- This byte is chosen so that when it is subtracted from the 84 voice samples to be transmitted, no reserved bytes for control information will be present in the resulting data.
- Adding the transparency byte back into all the data bytes in the receiver restores the original data. For example in a protocol having three bytes, such as hex bytes 7D, C0 and C1, it can be shown that there is a unique value which when subtracted from each byte in a packet of up to 84 random bytes, will guarantee that it may be restored in the receiver.
- This method and apparatus can save as much as 0.851 ms per packet when sending 20 ms packets of speech, and 0.608 ms with the 13.5 msec speech packets.
