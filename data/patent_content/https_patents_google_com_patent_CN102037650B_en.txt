Abstract
Method and structure for encoding and decoding of pulse position and/or pulse magnitudes which adaptively switch between coding the position of pulses having a non zero value and coding the position of pulses having zero value.
Description
Background technology
For method that the vector about voice, audio frequency, image, video and other signals or matrix amount are encoded, be known.A kind of the method for describing in the people's such as Peng United States Patent (USP) 6,236,960 (being incorporated to herein by reference) is called as factorial pulse code (or FPC).FPC can be used altogether M position to vector x
iencode, provided
And vector x
iall values round numerical value, make-m≤x
i≤ m, wherein m is the sum of unit amplitude pulse, and n is vector length.M position is for encoding to N combination by the most efficient mode altogether, and it is true making the following expression of the theoretical minimal amount of description combination:
For this formula, F (n, d) is the combined number of the n that provided by following formula locational d non-vanishing vector element:
D (m, d) is the combined number of d non-vanishing vector element of the given unit pulse of m altogether that provided by following formula:
D(m，d)＝F(m-1，d-1)， (4)
And 2
drepresent required for describing the combination of the polarity (symbol) of d non-vanishing vector element.Item min (m, n) allows following situation, and wherein the number m of unit amplitude pulse surpasses vector length n.In the prior art, described all sidedly for carry out the method and apparatus of Code And Decode to thering is the vector of this form.In addition, described the practical implementation of this coding method in 3GPP2 standard C .S0014-B, wherein, the number of the unit amplitude pulse of vector length n=54 and m=7 has produced the code word of M=35 position.
Although these n and m value do not cause any irrational complexity burden, larger value may cause problem rapidly, particularly at needs, makes in memory and the alap mobile hand-held device of computation complexity.The use of for example, applying this coding method of (such as audio coding) for some may need n=144 and m=28 or higher.Under these environment, it may be too high producing the associated cost of combined expression F (n, d) with the method for using prior art for practical implementation.
When considering in more detail this cost, we can be rewritten as formula 3:
Because F (144,28) will need 197 precision in molecule and 98 precision in denominator, to produce the business of 99, therefore directly implementation is debatable.Because the most of digital signal processor (DSP) using in handheld device now is typically only supported the multiplying of 16 * 16, therefore need to use special many precision multiplication/division routine.These routines need a series of nested multiplication/accumulating operations, and it typically needs the computing of k multiplication/cumulative (MAC) magnitude, and wherein k is the number of 16 bit slice sections in operand.For the operand of 197,
In order to reduce complexity, formula 5 can be rewritten to disperse division arithmetic, thereby produces following formula:
In this expression formula, reduced the dynamic range of division arithmetic, but unfortunately, the resolution that need to increase business is to represent exactly the division divided by 3,7,9 etc.In order to adapt to this structure, also need rounding operation to guarantee whole-number result.Suppose a large amount of high accuracy division arithmetics, this implementation can not solve the complexity issue about large m and n fully, and has the possibility that produces incorrect result because of the trueness error of accumulation.
In another implementation, formula 5 can rearrange as follows:
If from left to right to this expression formula valuation, result will always produce integer value.Although the method has been controlled precision and dynamic range problem to a certain extent, large m and the value of n still need to use in a large number many precision multiplication and division arithmetic.
Finally, in order to make computation complexity minimum, can calculate in advance all factorial combinations and be stored in lookup table.Therefore, all values of F (n, m) can be stored in n * m matrix simply, and uses the considerably less processor cycle can suitably retrieve these values from memory.Yet the problem of the method is, along with n and m become large, associated storage requirement also becomes large.Quote previous example, F (144,28) need to
the storage of byte, this is irrational for most of mobile hand-held device.Therefore, need a kind of method and apparatus for vectorial low complex degree combination factorial pulse code.

The present invention relates generally to vector is encoded, and particularly, relate to vectorial combination factorial pulse code.
Forward now accompanying drawing to, wherein identical Reference numeral represents identical parts, and Fig. 1 is the block diagram of encoder 100.Encoder 100 comprises vector generator 102, assembly coding circuit (encoder) 106, composite function maker 108 and other coding circuits 104.During operation, by vector generator 102, receive input signal to be encoded.As known in the art, input signal can comprise signal and other signals such as voice, audio frequency, image, video.
Vector generator 102 receives input signal and creates vector x
i.Vector generator 102 can comprise many coding examples, it includes but not limited to, as Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) speech coding of people's descriptions such as Peng, the transform domain coding about audio frequency, image and video that comprises the method based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT) and improved discrete cosine transform (MDCT), transition coding based on small echo, direct time-domain pulse code modulated (PCM), differential PCM, adaptive differential PCM (ADPCM), or any one in sub-band coding technology series as known in the art.In fact, can advantageously process any signal vector with the above form providing by some embodiment according to the present invention.
In order to address this problem, the low complex techniques that composite function maker 108 utilizes for generation of F ' (n, d).Assembly coding circuit 106 utilizes F ' (n, d) to produce code word C subsequently.Circuit 108 utilizes the relatively low resolution of factorial combination F ' (n, d) approximate (position precision), and it only provides the precision that is enough to allow to generate effective code word.In other words,, as long as maintain some attribute, the suitably approximate of function F (n, d) can be decoded to produced code word uniquely with regard to sufficient to guarantee.
In order to describe the generation of F ' (n, d), first derive suitable approximate function F ' (n, the d) as F (n, d).First step is the logarithm that a is the end arbitrarily of take of acquisition formula 5, and obtains the antilogarithm that a is the end of take of the item rearrange:
Function exp wherein
a(k)=a
k.Then, defined function P (i), Q (d) and R (k), and substitution formula 8, make:
Wherein, P (i)=log
a(i),
and R (k)=exp
a(k)=a
k.
Yet, according to exemplary embodiment of the present invention, for the code word that makes to obtain, can decode uniquely, F (n, d) and F ' (n, d) there is no need to be equal to.Only exist and be enough to make it to remain genuine two conditions:
F′(n，d)≥F(n，d)， (10)
With
F′(n，d)≥F′(n-1，d)+F′(n-1，d-1)。(11)
For first condition, described constraint is described as simply, if F ' (n, d) < F (n, d) will exist overlapping code space, and subsequently, will have more than input that can generate certain code word; Therefore, code word can not decoded uniquely.Second conditional statement about given n, " error " of d should be more than or equal to the people such as Peng at United States Patent (USP) 6,236, in 960 the error term of that describe and last elements correlation recurrence relation and.May occur F (n, d)=F (n-1, d)+F (n-1, d-1), this only equals exactly at combined expression
In this case, for some (m, k), (m≤n), and (k≤d), formula 11 must meet strict inequality, in other words:
F(m，k)＞F(m-1，k)+F(m-1，k-1)，m≤n，k≤d。(13)
Referring again to formula 9, wish now by utilizing the approximate of antiderivative low complex degree, create function P ' (i), Q ' (d) and R ' (k), to generate F ' (n, d), make:
And wherein, meet the condition providing in formula 10 and 11.Consider P (i), may wish approximate this function, make P ' (i)>=log
a(i), i ∈ [1,2 ..., n].If select a=2 and subsequently P ' (i) be constrained to 32 precision, because most of DSP supports monocycle 32 additions, the computing therefore obtaining easily realizes on handheld mobile device.Therefore, we define:
Be wherein that l (i) is translocation factor, it can be used as the function of i and changes.In a preferred embodiment, l (i)=l=21, but many other set of value are possible.For this example, 2
lthe factor is equal to l position, the thus bracket function of shifting left
Wherein, owing to deducting this amount from total amount, therefore use bracket function
For P ' defined above (i) and Q ' (d), k is the number of 32 preferably, it has 8 signless integer part k
iwith 24 fractional part k
f.Use this setting, by making k=k
i+ k
fand take subsequently 2 as end negate logarithm, to produce
Wherein,
In above discussion, selected function P ' (i), Q ' (d) and R ' (k), make each independent function valuation guarantee to obtain F ' (n, d) >=F (n, d).Yet, only for cumulative impact, need to meet this condition.For example, P ' (i) and Q ' (d) can be as described above, but R ' can be (k) (k) ≈ 2 of more conventional R '
kfunction, it can clip or cast out least significant bit, makes for some k values, and R ' (k) can be less than 2
k.As long as this impact with respect to P ' (i) and Q ' impact (d) be little, it is acceptable that Here it is, so the attribute in formula 10 and 11 still remains very.
Moreover, as long as meet the attribute about formula 10 and 11, do not lose in general situation, can use any function P ' (i), Q ' (d) and R ' (k).Yet must be careful, if use too small precision, may there is the increase of bit rate.Shall also be noted that and between bit rate and complexity, have intrinsic trading off, and for large m, n value, the increase of 1 or 2 may be reasonably compromise, for the remarkable reduction of complexity.
Be described in now the formulism of the part code word C for position and amplitude in assembly coding circuit 106.Suppose π={ p
1, p
2...., p
vnon-zero pulses position (by increasing order) and μ={ m
1, m
2...., m
vit is the amplitude of each position in vector x.Code about pulse position is provided by following formula:
And the code about pulse amplitude is provided by following formula:
Therefore, the formulism of these code words represents to add v and v-1 multiple precision number.In decoder, need similar subtraction.When n and m are when large, these computings have also increased the complexity of FPC method.Consideration is about the coding/decoding of the audio signal of multilayer embedded coding system.This technology is for the conversion of the residual signals of three layers of the multilayer system of encoding.The size of supposing 20ms piece is n=280 and is identical for all layers.The bit rate that depends on each layer for the number of the pulse of encoding.If each layer is 8kbps, 16kbps or 32kbps, they need respectively 160,320 and 640 for 20ms piece is encoded.Use FPC technology, for 160,320 and 640 of every layer, can use respectively the piece that 28,74 and 230 pulses are 280 to length to encode.Multiprecision arithmetic in formula (19) and (20) is to carry out on the digital signal processor typically operating for 16 words.Therefore, in order to form 160 bit word, need to carry out add operation to 10 words, and in order to form 640 bit word, need to carry out add operation to 40 words.Each add operation takies 4 unit (generation of carry, moves to array, is added with carry).Therefore the coding/decoding of the k bit word in p of multilayer system layer needs
inferior computing/second.For the various values of n, m and p, the complexity of many precision addition/subtraction computing has been shown in table 1.In this table, WMOPS represents 1,000,000 computings of the execution per second of weighting.Table 1: the complexity of the addition/subtraction in the FPC coding/decoding of use art methods
From table 1, notice, when bit rate doubles, the complexity of many precision addition increases by six times.
As previously mentioned, composite function is replaced by the approximate function F ' (n, r) providing as follows:
Wherein
And R ' is (k) (k) ≈ 2 of function R '
kapproximate, be given:
Wherein, k=k
i+ k
fbe broken down into integer and the fractional part of k, and
it is the low resolution Taylor series expansion of the fractional part of k.Based on above predefined function Q ' (r) and R ' (k), first obtained P ' (i), thereby for all values of n and d, met unisolvent code inequality
F′(n，d)＞F′(n-1，d)+F′(n-1，d-1)。(24)
Recoverable (19) and (20), with approximate function F ', replace actual function F, thereby produced:
the coding of the number of non-zero position:
L
rposition mantissa and exponential representation form also have advantage when the number coding to non-zero position.The coding following formula of the number v of non-zero position provides
Can easily see, than adopting many precision format, it is easier adopting the multiplication of two approximate functions of mantissa and exponential scheme.Yet major advantage is, when hope reduces complexity, to use l
rposition mantissa and exponential representation, can only carry out each (their l in pre-stored F ' (n, k) and F ' (m-1, k-1) with two words
rposition mantissa long-pending and their index and also can be by pre-stored).This makes can to v, encode rapidly in the situation that not needing a considerable amount of ROM.
Fig. 2 is the block diagram of decoder 200.As shown, decoder 200 comprises combination decoding circuit 206, signal reconstruction circuit 210, other decoding circuits 204 and composite function maker 108.During operation, combined codeword receives by combining decoding circuit 206.Combination decoding circuit 206 provides n and d to composite function maker, and as response, receives F ' (n, d).Decoding circuit 302 creates vector x based on F ' (n, d) subsequently
i.Circuit 206 operates by the mode similar to circuit 106, and difference is to use subtraction to replace add operation.In other words, Ψ '
k=Ψ '
k+1-F ' (p
k, k).Vector x
ibe passed to signal reconstruction circuit 210, wherein, based on x
icreate output signal (for example, voice, audio frequency, image, video or other signals) with other parameters from other decoding circuits 204.More specifically, other parameters can comprise the associated signal reconstruction parameter of Signal coding example many and that using in specific embodiment.This can include but not limited to, signal convergent-divergent and energy parameter and frequency spectrum shaping and/or composite filter parameter.Conventionally these parameters are for the signal vector x to reconstruction according to the mode of reproduction final output signal
icarry out energy convergent-divergent and/or frequency spectrum shaping.
Fig. 3 is the flow chart of operation that the composite function maker of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is shown.More specifically, the logic flow 300 of Fig. 3 shows the step that produces F ' (n, d) for composite function maker 108.This logic flow starts from 301,302, wherein, receives input n and d.In 303, accumulator A is set to 0.At 304 Counter i, be set equal to n-d+1.In 306, (i) add logarithmic approximation P ' to accumulator A.In 310, make counter i increase progressively 1.In circulation, repeat 306 and 310, until counter i is greater than n.312 test i > n and stop circulating while being greater than n when i becomes.In this stage, the logarithmic approximation of the molecule that accumulator comprises composite function F (n, d).In 316, from accumulator, deduct composite function denominator logarithmic approximation Q ' (d), to obtain the logarithmic approximation of composite function.In 318, obtain the exponential approximation R ' of accumulator (A), to generate the approximate B of composite function.In 314, B is as F ' (n, d) in output.
Although the use that the combination of above-described reduced complexity is calculated is for significantly reducing complexity, the calculating of these functions still greatly causes the complexity of Code And Decode method.In order to address this problem, some embodiment of the present invention provides the self adaptation between the method for Code And Decode of pulse position and/or pulse amplitude to switch, so that reduce the calculation times of the composite function that must carry out.
Referring again to formula (19) and (20), and the formula of the implementation of their corresponding reduced complexities (25) and (26), it should be noted that the cataloged procedure in formula (19) and formula (25) needs respectively to calculate for v time of composite function F and F '.Similarly, formula (20) and (26) need to calculate for v-1 time of these functions.Therefore the decoding of pulse position and pulse amplitude is iteration, and it is very high typically to calculate the number of times of these functions.In decoder, the calculation times of these functions is linear increasing along with the number v of non-zero position or engaged position.In order to reduce the complexity of the coding/decoding of pulse position and/or pulse amplitude, of the present invention some can alternative embodiment a kind of method for paired pulses position and/or pulse amplitude Code And Decode is provided, it needs the less calculation times of these composite functions.In these can the embodiment of alternative, proposed the modification to formula (19) and (20), and by expansion, provided the modification to formula (25) and (26), encoded in vacant position selectively.
First with reference to the formula (26) of formula (20) and corresponding reduced complexity.If definition
Formula (20) can be rewritten as:
(20a)
And formula (26) can be rewritten as:
(26a)
It should be noted that formula (20a) is structurally similar with (25) to formula (19) respectively with (26a), p
kby p '
kreplace, n is replaced by m-1, and engaged position v replaced by v-1, and the coding of pulse amplitude can be regarded as being placed in v-1 pulse position encoded of m-1 position, and wherein engaged position is by p '
ksign.In fact, coded pulse amplitude can be regarded as the amplitude m of engaging pulse
jbe converted to generate by item p
jand u
jthe pseudo-position of definition.Therefore, any modification of the coding method of pulse position can easily expand to the coding of pulse amplitude, and vice versa.
Thereby embodiment that can alternative according to some, has proposed the optimization of the coding of pulse amplitude and/or pulse position, in order to reduce the required calculation times of composite function.Before the coding/decoding of pulse position, v be encoded/decode (formula 27).Therefore, if the twice of the number of non-zero position is greater than the number of position, i.e. 2v > n, vacant position u
1, u
2..., u
vnumber be less than the number v of engaged position.Therefore,, in these situations, use the situation of coding/decoding of the vacant position of the formula similar to formula (19) (or (25)) to cause the calculating of less composite function, and therefore will there is lower complexity.For this point is described on mathematics, first by u
kbe defined as vacant position, and U is the set of vacant position, that is,
U＝{0，1，...，n-1}-{p

The size that it should be noted that U is n-v.Now, when 2v > n, about position code be calculated as now

And p '

By the coding that proposed technology is applied to 27 pulses in 280 positions (that is, n=280 and m=27) are carried out, how the method for being encoded in vacant position selectively that assessment is proposed reduces complexity now.Due to 2m < n, therefore do not need proposed coding method to generate the code (C about pulse position
π).Yet, for the coding of pulse amplitude, will advantageously use the technology proposing.
Result is, in the situation that do not use proposed technology, the complexity of the worst condition of the coding/decoding algorithm in this specific example (when using low complex degree composite function) is that the number (v) when non-zero position is between 25 to 27, in the time of between m to m-2.Thereby when v=25, use formula (26) will need 24 composite functions to calculate for coding, and calculate for decoding more frequently.Use in this case the technology (formula (26z)) proposing only to need the calculating of the composite function of twice in encoder, and reduced significantly than the decoder of other decoding techniques the number of times calculating.
According to the technology for coding/decoding proposing of embodiment according to the invention, the worst condition complexity in this example is the situation when v approaches m/2.The Code And Decode of the number v of the non-zero position of use formula in this case, 27 has sizable contribution to complexity.As the storage of the parameter of describing in the part at " coding of the number of non-zero position " (needing in this example the storage of 54 words) has further reduced complexity.
Following table shows, and when using the method for the coding that vacant position is carried out proposing to encode to 27 pulses in 280 positions, and in 20ms frame, carries out while encoding for 2 times reduced complexity.This table also shows the advantage obtaining when calculating the parameter of the several object codes (formula 27) about non-zero position in storage.From this table, see, the selectable coding of vacant position has caused the complexity of 0.6WMOPs to improve (from 3.59 to 2.9), and if go back the parameter of using in memory-type (27), has saved 0.75WMOPs (from 3.59 to 2.75).
Decoding is the anti-process of cataloged procedure, and relates to the first code word C based on receiving the number of non-zero position (v) is decoded.For this purpose, can adopt people (United States Patent (USP) 6,662,154) such as the people such as Peng and Mittal for the whole bag of tricks to the number coding/decoding of non-zero position.Based on code word C and v, extract the code word C about position

By now, by the improved approximate composite function of describing, can further strengthen the technology that reduces the calculation times of composite function by the switching between engaged position and the coding of vacant position described herein.It is based on following understanding, that is, decoder has because of decoder need to repeatedly be found and make F ' (p
k, k) be less than multiple precision number C
kmaximum p
kand the sizable complexity causing.Decoder iteration ground obtains this p
kvalue.These iteration may need the several of composite function F ' to calculate, and this will add complexity to decode procedure.
In order further to reduce the complexity of the approximate composite function in (21), use P ' partial summation (i) to replace pre-stored P ' (i), such as:
And present (21) can be calculated as equally:
F′(n，d)＝R′(S′(n)-S′(n-d)-Q′(d)) (33)
Although use approximate composite function significantly to reduce complexity, the calculating of these functions still forms a major part of the complexity of coding.Recently in other open, disclose a kind of by switch to reduce the method for the calculation times of composite function between engaged position and the coding of vacant position.Even if utilize these to improve, decoder still has sizable complexity.This is because decoder need to repeatedly be found and make F ' (p
k, k) be less than multiple precision number value C
kmaximum p
k.Decoder iteration ground obtains this p
kvalue.These iteration may need the several of composite function to calculate, and this will add complexity to decode procedure.
Therefore, need a kind of wherein decoder not need iteration to obtain p
kcoding method, and a kind of improved composite function has been proposed, decoder does not need iteration to obtain p therein
k.If use formula (33) definition F ' is (p
k, k), it is infeasible in the situation that there is no iteration, obtaining this solution.
We will be similar to composite function redefine into:
Wherein
Be the logarithm of i, up to l (i)=16 decimal place, and calculate in advance and store Q " (d)=Q ' (d)+d, make F ' (n, d) of definition in (34) meet unisolvent code inequality (24).
By Q ' of definition in (16) (d) be used as d! Approximate logarithm (take 2 end of as) time, F ' (n, d) of definition is being similar to of practical combinations function of definition in formula (3) and formula (5) in (34).Recoverable (5), it is n that molecule can be assumed to be, n-1, n-2 ..., the d power of the geometrical mean of n-d+1.The arithmetic mean of these numbers is
if carry out approximate geometry mean value with arithmetic mean, the approximate of formula (5) can be written as:
If the logarithm of the formula of obtaining (34) (take 2 end of as), and the similar method used during to acquisition formula (21) of use, obtained
Therefore
F′(n，d)＝R′(d·P′(2·n-d+1)-d-Q′(d)) (37)
(n) ≈ log of P ' wherein
2(n),
As used here with in claims, can use the combination of multiple factorial in the situation that do not depart from the spirit and scope of proposed various embodiment, that is, and composite function F, or be commonly labeled as the approximate factorial combination F ' of F '.As described above, these composite functions can include but not limited to following formula:

According to various embodiments of the present invention, no matter be to engaged position coding or to vacant position encoded, all based on being defined as the averag density of engaged position with positional number object ratio.In part above, illustrate and wherein only make the once method of judgement, and adopt Same Way for all positions, that is, and to engaged position coding or to vacant position encoded.Because engaged position may be inhomogeneous in all locational distributions, so this density is also inhomogeneous.Therefore, be worth, the density based in various situations, keeps judgement to switch, with to engaged position coding or to vacant position encoded.By example, describe.In n=27 position, there is the situation of 16 engaged positions in consideration.Engaged position is 0,7,9,10,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,24 and 25.In art methods, use formula (26) is to these engaged position direct codings, and as described above, the number of engaged position is greater than n/2, use formula (26z) is encoded to vacant position 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,11,14,23 and 26.It should be noted that in this example, the encoder of prior art needs to calculate for 16 times of composite function, and encoder in the present invention needs to calculate for 11 times of composite function F or F '.Watch engaged position and vacant position, can see, in encoder, use the engaged position of initial 5 pulse positions, ascend the throne and set to 0,7,9,10 and 12 encode, and subsequently to vacant position, be to encode in position 14,23 and 26, calculating is reduced to calculating for 8 times of composite function.Yet which kind of method decoder need to understand for coding, and where switching in from a method to other method occurs.Because decoder starts decoding until therefore extreme lower position encodes to extreme higher position based on engaged position number from extreme higher position.Subsequently, estimate the density of engaged position, and if density is less than 0.5, to next engaged position coding, otherwise vacant position encoded to next.
For this point is described, again consider example above.Because initial engaged position density is greater than 0.5, therefore the highest vacant position 26 is encoded as F ' (26,11).The estimation density of engaged position is 16 positions in 26 positions now, and it is also greater than 0.5, and therefore next vacant position 23 is encoded as F ' (23,10).Can infer now that (even at decoder place) position 24 and 25 takies.Engaged position density becomes 14 engaged positions in 23 positions now, and it is still greater than 0.5, and therefore next vacant position is encoded as F ' (14,9).The density that can easily estimate to remain engaged position is 6 pulses in 14 positions, and it is less than 0.5.Now, next engaged position 13 is encoded as F ' (13,6).The density of engaged position is estimated as 5 pulses in 13 positions now, and it is less than 0.5, and therefore successively to engaged position coding, position 12 is encoded as F ' (12,5).There are now 4 engaged positions in 12 positions, and therefore again engaged position be encoded as F ' (10,4).Use identical argument, three engaged positions following are encoded as F ' (9,3), F ' (7,2) and F ' (0,1).Therefore code word in this example
C
