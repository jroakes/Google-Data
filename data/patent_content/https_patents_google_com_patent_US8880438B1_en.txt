- the computing device may include an electronic display, which may display a digital image captured by the computing device and/or a GUI.
- Parameters of a content item may include features that characterize the content item, and may be useful in the selection/ranking of the content items.
- the parameters may sometimes be referred to as “advertisement criteria.” Examples of the parameters may include keywords and semantic clusters extracted from the ad text, categories (some times referred to as “verticals”) of the advertisement, list of previous users interacting with the advertisement, etc.
- the content item (e.g., advertisement) to be delivered may be relevant to the main content (e.g., third-party webpages or the search results).
- Such relevance may affect an auction price in an advertisement system for advertisers to bid for a position for the advertisement.
- an advertisement highly relevant to a third-party webpage or a search query can win an auction with a lower price against a less-relevant advertisement with a higher price.
- the advertisement can be characterized by a plurality parameters
- the relevance of the advertisement to the main content or search queries can be obtained by comparing the parameters with corresponding parameters extracted from the main content.
- the parameter ranking may be employed to assign rankings/ratings to related parameters based on how relevant they are to the specific advertisement. Such ranking may help quantify the relevance between the advertisement and the main content.
- Parameter relevance can be measured by a performance metric, e.g., CTR, or CVR on the specific advertisement.
- CTR performance metric
- these parameters can be used to predict the ranking of the specific advertisement in an auction.
- advertisement ranking can be predicted with some relevance variables, e.g., eCPM, pCVR, because the estimation of the advertisement's relevance to the main content (and consequently the ranking of the advertisement) may depend on the parameters' relevance rankings or ratings.
- the raw ranking may not properly model the parameter relevance for the specific advertisement.
- the described implementations allow proper ranking of the parameters based on the advertisement's properties, for example by matching the advertisement with performance of historical advertisements.
- the estimated relevance of a parameter may be computed as a function of the raw rankings of all related parameters.
- the information throughout the full context of the advertisement may be preserved by constructing a vector of all raw parameter rankings in a ranking space.
- Such a ranking space may be a hyper-dimensional space, i.e., with the number of dimensions larger than 3.
- the function f can be further simplified and the dimensions of the space reduced, for example by considering co-occurrence of the different raw parameters.
- c1 and c1 co-occur 100% of the time (e.g., the phrase “spacecraft” always appears with itself)
- c1 and c2 may co-occur 50% of the time (e.g., the phrases “spacecraft” and “space shuttle” often appear together)
- c1 and c3 may co-occur less than 10% o the time.
- c1′ is a function of c1, and may also be a function of c2.
- a threshold may be selected (e.g., 10%) such that the co-occurrence below this threshold may indicate that c1 and c3 are not related or that their relationship is not significant for the ranking purpose.
- the statistical models can numerically cluster all advertisements based on their historical performance in the raw parameter ranking space, with the dimensions of the space being the raw rankings of all related parameters.
- every parameter's estimated (e.g., revised from the raw ranking) relevance score may be modeled by a function of all related parameters' raw rankings.
- the function e.g., model
- the function may be configured by a statistical learning/training engine based on historical data.
- an advertisement with a raw parameter ranking [c1, c2, c3] may actually have c3 as the most relevant parameter (e.g., an advertisement for a sandwich shop may have gotten the most clicks historically), contrary to the result of using raw rankings without the learning/training process from the historical data.
- historical data may be used to train a statistical model to achieve a best fit of historical data from raw relevance rankings.
- Model parameters can be tuned and optimized during the learning/training process, and mathematical methods such as maximum likelihood optimization may be employed.
- a new advertisement When a new advertisement registers into the system, it may be projected to a most-likely advertisement cluster in the raw ranking space according to the raw rankings of all related parameters for the new advertisement. Based on the most-likely advertisement cluster, each related parameter for the new advertisement can be estimated for parameter relevance.
- a model between raw parameter rankings and estimated (revised) criterion relevance may be statistically established, and the statistical model of each parameter may be based on the full-context of an advertisement, i.e., all related parameters' raw rankings, thus preserving the valuable information in the characterization of the advertisement.
- This can lead to more accurate positioning of an advertisement in the raw ranking space, and provide a better estimation of parameter relevance through a more proper statistical model in the full-context domain. As a result, more relevant advertisements may be delivered to users.
- an example advertisement parameter ranking system 200 is illustrated.
- the system may include a plurality of parameter sources 202 , 204 , etc.
- Parameters can be extracted respectively from the different sources, such as parameter set ⁇ c1, c2, c5 ⁇ and parameter set ⁇ c1, c5, c9 ⁇ .
- These parameter sets may be extracted by analyzing landing pages of the advertisement and determining parameters related to the advertisement.
- Other sources for parameters may include, for example, metadata of content, texts of webpages and/or content items, images (through various recognition technologies), and those provided by advertisers, etc.
- Parameter merger 206 may merge the different parameter sets, and provide a raw parameter ranking such as ⁇ c1, c5, c2, c9, . . . ⁇ .
- the raw ranking may be associated with an initial set of relevance scores, such as from high to low of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.13, . . . , respectively, for parameters c1, c5, c2, c9.
- the combined raw rankings can be obtained by rating the parameters based on combined voting from all of the parameter sources.
- Revised relevance scores of the parameters can be provided by a parameter relevance estimation engine 208 according to some described implementations.
- the parameter relevance estimation engine 208 can be used to select the top ranked parameter as the most relevant parameter for the advertisement to participate in the competition in an auction. In the example illustrated in FIG.
- c2 would be considered as the most relevant parameter.
- multiple parameters can be used, with different weights derived from the relevance scores, in the auction.
- raw parameter rankings may lead to unsatisfactory advertisement ranking, which in turn may result in less-relevant advertisements being delivered to users, and thus low CTR and CVR and slow convergence to good advertisement quality.
- estimation of individual advertisement's relevance is improved.
- the best (e.g., most relevant and cost efficient) advertisements will more likely win the auction, leading to improved cost efficiency, faster turnaround for advertisement selection, and improved user experience, benefiting the users, advertisers, and publishers.
- x i be the raw ranking (a scalar variable) of the parameter for an advertisement.
- x i can be a categorical variable or a numerical variable.
- y i be the indicator variable that suggests whether the i th parameter is relevant to an advertisement.
- the predictor variable used to estimate the relevance of the i th parameter can be a vector [x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ], where n is the total number of raw parameter rankings.
- the values of x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n for a specific advertisement may be obtained, for example, by combining the parameter sources' voting.
- the i th response variable would be f i , i.e., the estimated relevance of the i th parameter.
- the statistical model of f i can be trained by any of a number of statistical learning methods, e.g., logistic regression, linear regression, Naive Bayes, etc.
- the estimated probability f i for the i th parameter may take the form of:
- ⁇ i,j are parameters for the statistical model and can be derived from the fitting or training process.
- the observed value of the parameter relevance f i may be considered as an efficiency measurement of an advertisement, e.g., a function of CTR or CVR.
- logistic regression procedures may allow the training of the model parameters ⁇ i,j in various approaches, e.g., maximum likelihood optimization by a Newton-Raphson method.
- a model training flow 301 and a parameter relevance estimation flow 303 are shown in the block diagram of FIG. 3 .
- ⁇ x i ⁇ may be used as a training set in a model training process 302 .
- the trained model 304 can provide an estimated relevance score of the i th parameter as
- the raw parameter vector [x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ] can be different from advertisement to advertisement, and the model parameters ⁇ i,0 , ⁇ i,1 , ⁇ i,2 , . . . , ⁇ i,n can be different from model (for parameter i) to model (for parameter i′).
- every individual advertisement can be characterized in its full context, in terms of all relevant parameters.
- the statistical model according to the described implementations effectively clusters all advertisements numerically in the space of raw parameter rankings.
- Such a clustering can be reflected in the above equations, without an express operation of clustering.
- the estimated relevance of an individual parameter of a numerical advertisement cluster can thus be modeled much more accurately, with numerically differentiated advertisement clusters.
- a parameter's relevance for a new advertisement can thus be effectively predicted by establishing the statistical relationship between the estimated parameter relevance, and the full context of the advertisement through the raw rankings of all related parameters.
- Logistic regression may be prone to overfit in high dimensions.
- the training procedure may become unnecessarily lengthy if the model has a high dimensionality. Therefore, it may be helpful to eliminate unnecessary dimensions for the statistical model of each parameter. In some implementations, this may be achieved by feature selection.
- feature selection For each parameter, there may be a small group of parameters that co-occur with the parameter frequently in all advertisements. This small number of parameters may be the ones closely related to the parameter of interest and thus may have relatively high impact on the parameter's relevance estimation. As such, this small set of parameters can be the selected features for the parameter in interest. For example, they can be used as the predictor variables in the dimensionality-reduced statistical model for the parameter of interest.
- parameter c 1 its selected features may be x 1 , x 2 , x 5 , x 10 ; while for criterion c 2 , its selected features may be x 2 , x 3 , x 10 , x 15 .
- z 1 and z 2 may be functions of different numbers of features.
- the statistical model 304 may be trained with historical advertisement performance data and their observed values of parameter relevance.
- a new advertisement registers into the advertising system server 108 , all of its parameters' relevance can be estimated based on the trained statistical model.
- the new advertisement may be viewed as being numerically classified with some similar historical advertisements, because similar advertisements tend to have a similar raw parameter ranking vector. As such, a parameter may tend to have similar real relevance values for similar advertisements.
- the statistical model 304 can be dynamically updated by incremental logistic regression with the new training data.

- the statistical model may be trained with the historical data.
- one or more processing circuits may receive a plurality of parameters of a new content item and a plurality of corresponding initial relevance scores of the parameters indicating relevance of the parameters to the new content item.
- the corresponding initial relevance scores may be predetermined raw rankings of the parameters, e.g., all with values of “1.”
- co-occurrences may be determined among the plurality of parameters, and the plurality of initial relevance scores may be pruned for those parameters lacking co-occurrences.
- the trained statistical model may be employed to estimate a plurality of revised relevance scores form the initial relevance scores.
- Each of the revised relevance scores may be a function of at least some of the plurality of initial relevance scores (some of which may have been pruned at the block 408 ).
- the plurality of parameters may be ranked based on the revised relevance scores. Such a ranking can subsequently be used for estimating a relevance of the content item (e.g., advertisement) to a main content item (e.g., webpage content), and used in an auction for an advertising slot for the advertisement.
