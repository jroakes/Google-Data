STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT
Not applicable.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to an image processing method and apparatus and, in particular, discloses a brush stroke palette feedback method.
The present invention further relates to the field of digital image processing and the production of visual artistic effects in computer images.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Recently, it has become quite popular with computer images to process the images to produce special effects. These effects often attempt to approximate artistic styles such as impressionist's styles etc. and to produce interesting artistic effects on standard images.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved form of processing an image to produce artistic effects such as those that would be produced by an artist utilising a paint brush.
In accordance with a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of creating an output image rendering of an arbitrary input color image on a computer system, said output image being made up of output brush strokes, said method comprising the steps of:
defining an initial restricted palette of paint colors;
defining a constrained set of brush strokes;
defining a canvas onto which to render the output image; and
creating said output brush strokes of said output image on said canvas utilizing said constrained set of brush strokes colored from said palette.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
Notwithstanding any other forms which may fall within the scope of the present invention, preferred forms of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings which:
FIG. 1 illustrates an initial process of tiling an image;
FIG. 2 illustrates an alternative tile pattern for tiling an image;
FIGS. 3-6 illustrates various tile pattern units and resulting image combinations;
FIG. 7 illustrates a tile opacity mask;
FIG. 8 illustrates the process of brush stroke table creation;
FIG. 9 illustrates a corresponding surface texture height field for the tile of FIG. 7;
FIG. 10 illustrates the process of creating stroke color palettes;
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS
The preferred embodiment is preferably implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in Australian Provisional Patent Application entitled “Image Processing Method and Apparatus (ART01)” filed concurrently herewith by the present applicant the content of which is hereby specifically incorporated by cross reference.
The aforementioned patent specification discloses a camera system, hereinafter known as an “Artcam” type camera, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an Artcam portable camera unit. Further, the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device leading to the production of various effects in any output image. The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images, the cards hereinafter being known as Artcards. The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power by an Artcam Central Processor unit (ACP) which is interconnected to a memory device for the storage of important data and images.
The preferred embodiment has been constructed by noting that a human painter when “rendering” an image on canvas normally works with a limited palette of paint colors, with a constrained set of brushes which produce characteristic strokes, and paints on a canvas of a particular color and texture. The painter paints strokes of different color on the canvas so that the painting is more or less true to the scene being painted, or the painter's vision of the scene. Some painting styles try to reproduce the features and colors of the scene in as much detail as possible, and are characterised by detailed brushwork, extensive paint mixing and layering. Other styles try to capture more of an impression of the feature and colors of the scene, and are characterised by simpler and more uniform brush strokes, and little paint mixing or layering. These impressionistic styles achieve brighter and more vivid color than the realistic styles, but at the expense of detail.
Computer systems which automatically converts a photographic image into a “painted” rendition of that image typically place brush strokes in the output image. The color of the brush strokes is derived in some manner from corresponding groups of pixels in the input image. The challenge in such a system lies in capturing aspects of the human painting process described above. A partial solution to producing an impressionistic rendition lies in constructing a color palette based on the colors of real artists' paints, selecting each brush stroke color from the palette to match the input image as well as possible, and error diffusing the color to maintain overall color consistency with the input image.
In the preferred embodiment, there is constructed an algorithm which error diffuses an image on the basis of the final color of the brush stroke, rather than on the basis of the raw color alone. This final color is determined by the paint color, the brush texture, and the canvas color and texture.
The input to the algorithm is the following:
A restricted palette of paint colors.
A set of brush strokes, each defined by an opacity map and a bump map. The use of bump maps is well known to those skilled in the art of 3 dimensional graphics rendering and is described, for instance, in graphic gems, Volume 4 at pages 433-437.
A canvas, defined by a color image and a bump map.
A color image to be reproduced as a painting.
The output from the algorithm is a rendition of the input image, “painted” onto the canvas with brush strokes colored from the paint palette. Because the canvas and brush strokes are textured, and these textures are combined during the painting process, the final painting may be directionally lit.
Turning to FIG. 1, there is illustrated an example of an example opacity map 1 for a particular brush stroke. An opacity map consists of a bit map array having values of 0 or 1 defining whether the bit map is clear or transparent, thereby defining the area of the brush stroke. A bump map is of a similar nature however, a bump map defines a height field which can be utilised to produce 3 dimensional effects by means of perturbation of the normal to a degree measured by the height field.
In order to achieve the painted effect, various modifications are carried out on the basic tiling algorithm to achieve greater color consistency between the output image and the input image. Turning now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated 10 the initial process in the brush stroke palette feedback algorithm. This process proceeds by the creation of a table of a stroke color palettes. The table is indexed by brush stroke B1, B2, B3 etc. For each brush stroke Bn in the brush stroke set and for each paint color C1-CN in the paint palette set a stroke color S1-S4 is determined as follows as described with reference to the flow chart of FIG. 2:
1. The paint color C1 is utilised to color the corresponding brush stroke B1 at step 21.
2. The colored brush stroke is then composited with an empty canvas utilising the opacity map and bump map.
3. The average color across the painted stroke is then calculated at step 23. This average color then becomes the stroke color S1 of FIG. 1. A pointer (not shown) is then set to point from the stroke color palette entry S1 to the corresponding paint color palette entry C1.
4. The stroke color table is then sorted by color.
When painting an image, each brush stroke is selected in the usual way. The desired color of each brush stroke is then determined from the input image in the usual way. However, the nearest paint color Cn in the paint color palette is not used. Instead, the nearest stroke color Sn in the stroke color palette for that brush stroke is used. Next, the corresponding paint color Cn is used as the paint color for the brush stroke.
Since the range of colors available in the paint palette is limited, there is usually some difference between the desired paint color and the selected paint color Cn. This difference, or error can be error diffused into adjacent unvisited parts of the input image in the usual way when doing error diffusion. The error is the difference between the desired color and the paint color Cn is not used. Instead, the error being the difference between the desired color and the stroke color Sn is used which is the average color across the painted stroke for this purpose. Note that this average color Sn may differ from the average color in the stroke palette, since the real brush stroke may overlap other strokes, whereas the stroke in the stroke palette is painted on an empty canvas.
This method can be extended such that the effect of any number of painting parameters can be taken into account in the same way. This includes variations in the painting medium (oil paint, chalk, charcoal, etc.), variations in the canvas (textured paper, glass, etc.), etc. Each parameter will add a dimension to the multi-dimensional table of stroke color palettes, but the essential algorithm is unchanged.
Artists sometimes apply a mixture of two or more paints in a single brush stroke. In the impressionistic style these paints are often not well mixed, and the unmixed colors are visible as separate components of the stroke.
In the context of the aforementioned algorithm, a multi-colored brush stroke can be a generalisation of a single-colored brush stroke. It can be defined by multiple opacity maps, one for each color. These opacity maps define non-zero opacities for mutually exclusive regions of the brush stroke. Taken together they define the shape of the overall bush stroke. By introducing the following modifications to the algorithm, support multi-colored brush strokes can be provided.
When building the stroke color palette for each brush stroke, color the brush stroke with each possible combination of paint colors from the paint color palette. This is clearly only practical for small paint color palettes. Construct each stroke color palette entry in the usual way, but point each stroke color palette entry to the corresponding multiple paint color palette entries used to construct it. When painting the image, find the nearest stroke color in the stroke color palette in the usual way, but color the stroke with the corresponding multiple paint colors.
It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.
The present provisional is one of a series of Australian Provisional Patent Applications which relate to a new form of technology for the production of images. These Australian Provisional Patent Applications encompass a broad range of fields and as such, the present provisional is best viewed in the overall context of the development of this new form of technology. Appendix A attached hereto sets out the details of each of the series of Australian Provisional Patent Applications and, to the extent necessary, the associated Australian Provisional Patent Applications are hereby incorporated by cross-reference.
Ink Jet Technologies
The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.
The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.
The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth printheads with 19,200 nozzles.
Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include:
low power (less than 10 Watts)
high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)
photographic quality output
low manufacturing cost
small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)
high speed (<2 seconds per page).
All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty-five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Application.
The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems.
For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the printhead is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the printhead is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest printhead designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The printheads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.
Ink is supplied to the back of the printhead by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.
Tables of Drop-on-Demand Ink Jets
Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.
The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.
Actuator mechanism (18 types)
Basic operation mode (7 types)
Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)
Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)
Actuator motion (19 types)
Nozzle refill method (4 types)
Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)
Nozzle clearing method (9 types)
Nozzle plate construction (9 types)
Drop ejection direction (5 types)
Ink type (7 types)
The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 which matches the docket numbers in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.
Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty-five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet printheads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.
Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases, print technology may be listed more than once in a table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.
Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include: Home printers, Office network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers, Pocket printers, Internet WWW printers, Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers, Photographic minilabs etc.
The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.
