- the first wearable electronic device transmits a first identity signal based at least in part on at least a portion of the first sensor signal.
- Transmission of the first identity signal can be a broadcast of the first identity signal. That is, transmission of the first identity signal may not be directed specifically at or address a particular receiver such as the head mounted electronic display unit 110 .
- the processor of the electronic ring 120 can monitor an output of the first impact sensor and upon identifying that impact has occurred (based on, for example, a spike in the output of the first impact sensor), initiate the transmission of the first identity signal.
- the processor of the electronic ring 120 can be manually set to a broadcast mode prior to the physical contact taking place. Manually setting the electronic ring 120 to a broadcast mode can relate to manipulating a manual button or other input mechanism of the electronic ring 120 . Once bumped, the broadcast mode may result in the transmission of the first identity signal.
- the first identity signal can be stored in the storage medium 12 of the electronic ring 120 before the physical contact occurs between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. Storage of the first identity signal can be a factory default. Alternatively, the first identity signal can be transferred to the first wearable electronic device via a secure communication channel provided by the connecting case 130 , and optionally from the second wearable electronic device. In some implementations, the first identity signal can relate to or include an identifier for the electronic ring 120 .

- the second wearable electronic device receives the first identity signal. Reception of the first identity signal by the second wearable electronic device can be achieved, for example, when the second wearable electronic device is operating in a search or a listening mode for any signals. That is, reception of the first identity signal may not be directed at signals from a particular transmitter such as the electronic ring 120 .
- the processor of the head mounted electronic display unit 110 can be manually set to a listening mode prior to the physical contact taking place. Manually setting the head mounted electronic display unit 110 to a listening mode can relate to manipulating a manual button or other input mechanism of the head mounted electronic display unit 110 .
- the first wearable electronic device transmits the first identity signal and the listening mode of the second wearable electronic device can receive the first identity signal.
- the processor of the head mounted electronic display unit 110 can monitor the second sensor signal and upon identifying that impact has occurred, initiate the listening mode in order to receive the first identity signal.
- the second wearable electronic device determines that at least a portion of the first identity signal corresponds to at least a portion of an expected identity signal.
- the second wearable electronic device may determine whether or not at least a portion of the first identity signal corresponds to at least a portion of an expected identity signal, but method 200 only progresses from act 208 to act 210 when at least a portion of the first identity signal does correspond to at least a portion of the expected identity signal.
- the determination of whether respective portions of the first identity signal and the expected identity signal correspond to one another can involve any appropriate comparison algorithm. For instance, the determination can involve a direct comparison of the two signals. In some implementations, the determination can involve a comparison of a transformation of one or both of the signals.
- the term “correspond” in the context of at least a portion of a first identity signal and at least a portion of an expected identity signal means the two (portions of) signal match, align, or otherwise compare in a way that is indicative of a sufficient similarity between the two (portions) of signals. “Sufficient,” in this context, depends on the nature of the particular comparison algorithm being employed and generally invokes a minimum “similarity” threshold for whatever parameter is being compared (e.g., the same within 80%).
- the nature of the expected identity signal may generally be analogous to the first identity signal and may optionally be identical to the first identity signal.
- the expected identity signal may also be stored (i.e., in the storage medium 12 of the head mounted electronic display unit 110 ). Storage of the expected identity signal can also be a factory default.
- the expected identity signal can be transferred to the second wearable electronic device via a secure communication channel provided by the connecting case 130 , and optionally from the first wearable electronic device.
- the expected identity signal can also be an encryption key that corresponds to the encryption key of the first identity signal. That is, the encryption key of the first identity signal and the encryption key of the expected identity signal can form a pair of encryption keys.
- the expected identity signal can be based on (e.g., include or be derived, at least in part, from) the second sensor signal.
- the expected identity signal can be a signature of the second sensor signal.

- the expected identity signal can indicate the start time and the end time of the sequence of tapping.
- the expected identity signal can relate to a pattern of the sequence of tapping.
- the time of the physical contact can be used to generate an encryption key. Again, the encryption key of the first identity signal and the encryption key of the expected identity signal can form a pair of encryption keys.
- the at least a portion of the first identity signal and the at least a portion of the expected identity signal are used by the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device as encryption keys to provide encrypted communications between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. That is, the first wearable electronic device can encrypt data using at least a portion of the first identity signal prior to transmitting, or broadcasting the data. While any electronic device can receive the encrypted data that is broadcasted by the first wearable electronic device, only devices having the expected identity signal can decrypt the encrypted data. Likewise, the second wearable electronic device can encrypt data using at least a portion of the expected identity signal and the first wearable electronic device can decrypt data using at least a portion of the first identity signal.
- the encrypted communications can be refreshed by bumping the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device together again to generate another set of encryption keys.
- two wearable electronic devices can initially use stored identity signals, such as generic encryption keys, to establish encrypted communications from a first physical contact (i.e., a first bump).
- the encrypted communications can then be used to time-synchronize internal clocks of the two wearable electronic devices.
- the two wearable devices can be bumped together again (i.e., a second bump) to generate more secure encryption keys, that is, a first identity signal and an expected identity signal that are derived from the second bump, or a signature of the second bump.
- the second set of encryption keys may be more secure than the first set of encryption keys because the second set of encryption keys relate to the bump itself as opposed to being stored, generic keys.
- a second wearable electronic device can connect to a plurality of first wearable electronic devices. That is, prior to a bump, the second wearable electronic device can receive signals from a plurality of electronic devices in listening mode. The first wearable electronic device may transmit a generic signal in broadcast mode. Once the bump occurs, the first wearable electronic device transmits the first identity signal containing an impulse indicative of the bump. The second wearable electronic device can identify the impulse and based on the identification, validate or confirm the connection between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device.
- subsequent bumps can command different actions.
- the wearable electronic devices can be configured to discard the encryption keys upon a second bump, thus discontinuing the encrypted communication.
- the direction and the location of impact can command different actions.
- physical contact between an end face of the electronic ring 120 and the head mounted electronic display unit 110 can be indicative of a first bump and the wearable electronic devices can use generic encryption keys.
- Subsequent bumps may require a side surface of the electronic ring 120 in physical contact with the head mounted electronic display unit 110 and can trigger different responses, actions, effects, or the employment of different encryption keys, depending on the specific application.
- communicative as in “communicative pathway,” “communicative coupling,” and in variants such as “communicatively coupled,” is generally used to refer to any engineered arrangement for transferring and/or exchanging information.
- exemplary communicative pathways include, but are not limited to, electrically conductive pathways (e.g., electrically conductive wires, electrically conductive traces), magnetic pathways (e.g., magnetic media), and/or optical pathways (e.g., optical fiber), and exemplary communicative couplings include, but are not limited to, electrical couplings, magnetic couplings, and/or optical couplings.

Abstract
Description
- The present systems, devices, and methods generally relate to wearable electronic devices and particularly relate to encrypted communications between wearable electronic devices.
- Electronic devices are commonplace throughout most of the world today. Advancements in integrated circuit technology have enabled the development of electronic devices that are sufficiently small and lightweight to be carried by the user. Such “portable” electronic devices may include on-board power supplies (such as batteries or other power storage systems) and may be “wireless” (i.e., designed to operate without any wire-connections to other, non-portable electronic systems); however, a small and lightweight electronic device may still be considered portable even if it includes a wire-connection to a non-portable electronic system. For example, a microphone may be considered a portable electronic device whether it is operated wirelessly or through a wire-connection.
- The convenience afforded by the portability of electronic devices has fostered a huge industry. Smartphones, audio players, laptop computers, tablet computers, and ebook readers are all examples of portable electronic devices. However, the convenience of being able to carry a portable electronic device has also introduced the inconvenience of having one's hand(s) encumbered by the device itself. This problem is addressed by making an electronic device not only portable, but wearable.
- A wearable electronic device is any portable electronic device that a user can carry without physically grasping, clutching, or otherwise holding onto the device with their hands. For example, a wearable electronic device may be attached or coupled to the user by a strap or straps, a band or bands, a clip or clips, an adhesive, a pin and clasp, an article of clothing, tension or elastic support, an interference fit, an ergonomic form, etc. Examples of wearable electronic devices include digital wristwatches, electronic armbands, electronic rings, electronic ankle-bracelets or “anklets,” head-mounted electronic display units, hearing aids, and so on.
- Because wearable electronic devices are worn on the body of the user, visible to others, and generally present for long periods of time, form factor (i.e., size, geometry, and appearance) is a major design consideration in wearable electronic devices.
- A method for establishing encrypted communications between wearable electronic devices may be summarized as including: in response to a physical contact between a first wearable electronic device and a second wearable electronic device, generating a first sensor signal by a first impact sensor of the first wearable electronic device; transmitting, by the first wearable electronic device, a first identity signal based at least in part on at least a portion of the first sensor signal; receiving, by the second wearable electronic device, the first identity signal; determining, by the second wearable electronic device, that at least a portion of the first identity signal corresponds to at least a portion of an expected identity signal; and using the at least a portion of the first identity signal and the at least a portion of the expected identity signal as encryption keys to provide encrypted communications between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device.
- Prior to the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device, the method may include storing the first identity signal by the first wearable electronic device and storing the expected identity signal by the second wearable electronic device. The method may further include: providing a secure communication channel between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device; and transmitting the expected identity signal from the first wearable electronic device to the second wearable electronic device via the secure communication channel. Providing a secure communication channel between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device may include providing a secure wired communication channel between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device within a connecting case.

Generating a first sensor signal by a first impact sensor of the first wearable electronic device may include generating, by the first impact sensor of the first wearable electronic device a first impact signal indicative of at least one attribute of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device selected from a group consisting of: a direction of impact, a magnitude of impact, a speed of impact, and a duration of impact of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device.
- The method may further include: in response to the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device, generating a second sensor signal by a second impact sensor of the second wearable electronic device. In this case, the expected identity signal may include at least a portion of the second sensor signal and determining, by the second wearable electronic device, that at least a portion of the first identity signal corresponds to at least a portion of an expected identity signal may include determining, by the second wearable electronic device, that at least a portion of the first identity signal corresponds to at least a portion of the second sensor signal. The method may further include time-synchronizing the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device are time-synchronized, wherein the at least a portion of the first sensor signal and the at least a portion of the second sensor signal are both indicative of a time of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. The method may further include: generating, by the first wearable electronic device, a first encryption key based on a time of the first sensor signal, the first identity signal comprising the first encryption key; and generating, by the second wearable electronic device, a second encryption key based on a time of the second sensor signal, the expected identity signal comprising the second encryption key, wherein the first encryption key and the second encryption key together form a pair of encryption keys.
- The physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device may include a plurality of discrete contact events including a first contact event and at least a second contact event. Generating a first sensor signal by a first impact sensor of the first wearable electronic device in response to a physical contact between a first wearable electronic device and a second wearable electronic device may include generating the first sensor signal by the first impact sensor of the first wearable electronic device in response to the first contact event, and generating a second sensor signal by a second impact sensor of the second wearable electronic device in response to the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device may include generating the second sensor signal by the second impact sensor of the second wearable electronic device in response to the second contact event.

- The system may further include a connecting case, wherein the connecting case includes a secure wired communication channel between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. The first sensor signal may include an impulse signal representative of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device.
- The second wearable electronic device may further include a second impact sensor communicatively coupled to the second processor, the second impact sensor responsive to generate a second sensor signal in response to the physical contact between the second wearable electronic device and the first wearable electronic device.

The at least a portion of the first sensor signal and the at least a portion of the second sensor signal may be indicative of at least one attribute of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device selected from a group consisting of: a direction of impact, a magnitude of impact, a speed of impact, and a duration of impact of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. The first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device may be time-synchronized. The at least a portion of the first sensor signal and the at least a portion of the second sensor signal may be indicative of a time of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device.
- The processor-executable instructions stored in the first non-transitory processor-readable storage medium, when executed by the first processor, may cause the first processor to generate a first encryption key based on the time of the first sensor signal, the first identity signal comprising the first encryption key. The processor-executable instructions stored in the second non-transitory processor-readable storage medium, when executed by the second processor, may cause the second processor to generate a second encryption key based on the time of the second sensor signal, the expected identity signal comprising the second encryption key. The first encryption key and the second encryption key may form a pair of encryption keys. The physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device may include a plurality of discrete contact events including at least a first contact event and a second contact event. Each of the first encryption key and the second encryption key may be generated based on a time of the first contact event and a time of the second contact event, respectively.

O subsystem 18 couples input/output peripherals of wearableelectronic device 10, such input or control devices, with a peripherals interface (not shown). I/O subsystem 18 can include a controller for each of the input or devices. -
Power system 20 generally provides electrical power to the various components of the wearable electronic device 10 (not all connections shown).Power system 20 optionally includes a power management system, one or more power sources (e.g., primary battery cells, secondary power cells, fuel cells, super- or ultra-capacitors), a recharging system, a power failure detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation, management and distribution of power in portable devices. The recharging system may receive wired power (from e.g. a micro-USB charger) or wireless power via receipt of electromagnetic waves by one or more inductors or inductive interfaces, and provide the electrical power to the one or more power sources via one or more wired or electrically conductive paths. - Wearable
electronic device 10 also includes one ormore sensors 22. Sensors can include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers (e.g., as part of an inertial measurement unit (IMU)), vibration, shock, impact, and any other appropriate inertial sensors (herein referred to as impact sensors) to obtain information representative of a position, orientation, change in position and, or change in orientation (e.g., attitude), acceleration, angular velocity, and/or vibration of the wearableelectronic device 10. In some implementations, these sensors can be coupled with a peripherals interface (not shown). - It should be appreciated that wearable
electronic device 10 is only one example of a wearable electronic device, and that wearableelectronic device 10 optionally has more or fewer components than shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components shown inFIG. 1 are implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof, including one or more signal processing and/or application specific integrated circuits. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a first wearableelectronic device 30 communicating with a second wearableelectronic device 34, in accordance with one or more implementations described herein. Second wearableelectronic device 34 may include a display screen displaying a user interface for viewing by the user of the first wearableelectronic device 30. - First wearable
electronic device 30 communicates with second wearableelectronic device 34 via a communications channel, for instance acommunication network 32, which may be a wired connection, a Wi-Fi network, WiMAX, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth™, Bluetooth™ Low Energy, near-field communication, or any other type of connection capable of providing uni-directional or bi-directional communication between the second wearableelectronic device 34 and the first wearableelectronic device 30. - Referring now to
FIGS. 3A to 3F (collectively referred to asFIG. 3 herein), shown therein are right side, front, left side, right perspective, top, and left perspective views, respectively, of asystem 100 for establishing encrypted communications between wearable electronic devices. Thesystem 100 includes a first and second wearable electronic devices. According to at least one implementation, the first wearable electronic device can be a head mountedelectronic display unit 110 and the second wearable electronic device can be anelectronic ring 120, as shown inFIG. 3 . Optionally, thesystem 100 can also include a connectingcase 130 for the wearable electronic devices. An example of a similar system is described in US Patent Application Publication 2017-0097753. As illustrated inFIGS. 3A to 3F , the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 and theelectronic ring 120 are each shown positioned outside of an interior of the connectingcase 130. - The head mounted
electronic display unit 110 can be glasses, as shown inFIG. 3D . The glasses include a frame holding a pair oflenses bridge 114 between the lenses, as well as aright arm 116 a and aleft arm 116 b (collectively referred to as 116 herein). The shape of the glasses is shown for illustrative purposes and is not limited to the illustrated shape. Other shapes can be used. Furthermore, other head mountedelectronic display units 110 can be used. For example, a head mountedelectronic display unit 110 may cover a portion of the user's head, such as a helmet, may rest on top of a user's head, and/or wrap around a user's head, such as a headband. A head mountedelectronic display unit 110 may further include fastening or elastic members to secure to the user's head. - The
electronic ring 120 can be worn around a finger of a user, for example a ring finger or an index finger on a hand of the user. The shape of theelectronic ring 120 is shown for illustrative purposes and is not limited to the illustrated shape. Other shapes can be used. Theelectronic ring 120 can have any appropriate shape that allows the ring body to remain positioned around the finger of the user. For example, theelectronic ring 120 can have a general shape of a circular band (open or closed), a helix, or a spiral. With a helix or spiral shape, theelectronic ring 120 can have one or more turns. Theelectronic ring 120 can also have a break. With a break in theelectronic ring 120, the electronic ring may expand to accommodate or tolerate fingers having different ring sizes. Some example systems and devices that may be included in theelectronic ring 120 are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/607,819 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/608,463. - As shown in
FIG. 3E , the connectingcase 130 can have an interior or recesses and be shaped to receive the first wearableelectronic device 110 and/or the second wearableelectronic device 120. The shape of the connectingcase 130 is shown for illustrative purposes and is not limited to the illustrated shape. As shown inFIG. 3 , the connectingcase 130 can receive both the first wearableelectronic device 110 and the second wearableelectronic device 120. That is, the connectingcase 130 can receive the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 and theelectronic ring 120. In some implementations, the connectingcase 130 can receive only one wearable electronic device. When the connectingcase 130 receives only one wearable electronic device, the connectingcase 130 can include a connection port to communicatively couple to a second wearable electronic device or a second connecting case that holds the second wearable electronic device. - Referring now to
FIGS. 4A to 4F (collectively referred to asFIG. 4 herein), shown therein are right side, front, left side, right perspective, top, and left perspective views of the head mountedelectronic display 110 unit and theelectronic ring 120 illustrated as stored at least partially within an interior of the connectingcase 130 ofFIG. 3 . The connectingcase 130 can also include a lid (not shown) and/or fastening means (not shown) for retaining the wearableelectronic devices case 130. The connectingcase 130 can have a rigid outer shell to protect the wearableelectronic devices case 130 can include one or more chargers to charge either or both of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 and/or theelectronic ring 120. A charger may employ, for example, a magnetic connector such as that described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/608,385. - The connecting
case 130 can couple the wearable electronic devices, thereby providing a secure communication channel between the wearable electronic devices. The secure communication channel can be a wired or a wireless connection. Furthermore, in some implementations, the secure communication channel can be a wired connection to a first wearable electronic device and a wireless connection to a second wearable electronic device. - The secure communication channel can be used to transfer data between the wearable
electronic devices electronic display unit 110 and theelectronic ring 120 can include an internal clock, which can be time-synchronized together. In some implementations, the internal clocks of the wearable electronic devices can be time-synchronized via an unsecure communication channel. In some implementations, the internal clocks can be time-synchronized via the secure communication channel. In some embodiments, the internal clocks can be time-synchronized via encrypted communications. Throughout this specification and the appended claims, the term “time-synchronized” is used to refer to at least two separate devices that have separate means (i.e., clocks) to keep track of the passage of time, and whose respective separate means (i.e., clocks) to keep track of the passage of time are sufficiently temporally aligned so that, at any given time, each device could identify the time that the other device would measure/report within less than 0.1 s. - Referring now to
FIGS. 5A to 5F (collectively referred to asFIG. 5 herein), shown therein are right side, front, left side, right perspective, top, and left perspective views of theelectronic ring 120 in physical contact with the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 ofFIG. 3 . Physical contact between theelectronic ring 120 and the head mountedelectronic display 110 may occur at thebridge 114 of the head mountedelectronic display 110. For example, theelectronic ring 120 can be brought into physical contact with thebridge 114 of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 as shown inFIG. 5 while a user is wearing one, both, or neither of theelectronic ring 120 and the head mountedelectronic display unit 110. Physical contact at/withbridge 114 of head mountedelectronic display unit 110 is used here for illustrative purposes only. In alternative implementations, such physical contact may occur at another position on head mountedelectronic display unit 100, such as at either arm 116 of head mountedelectronic display unit 110. - The head mounted
electronic display unit 110 and theelectronic ring 120 each include an impact sensor (not shown inFIG. 5 ). The impact sensors each generate a sensor signal with information about the respective wearable electronic device. For example, in response to a physical contact between the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 and the electronic ring 120 (e.g., if and when the head mountedelectronic display 110 and theelectronic ring 120 are brought into physical contact with one another, such as shown inFIG. 5 ), the impact sensors of each wearable electronic device can generate a sensor signal indicative of the wearable electronic device being in physical contact with, or impacting, another object. - In some implementations, received signal strength may be used as an indicator (“RSSI”) of close proximity between the head mounted
electronic display unit 110 and theelectronic ring 120 instead of signals from impact sensors resulting from physical contact. For example, in lieu of physical contact, the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 and theelectronic ring 120 may implement the systems and methods for establishing proximity-based wireless connections described in US Patent Application Publication No. 2015-0296553. - In some implementations, the impact sensor can output an impulse signal when impact of the physical contact between the two wearable electronic devices is detected. That is, the sensor signal can represent an impulse when impact occurs. In some implementations, the sensor signal can be indicative of a direction of impact, a magnitude of impact, a speed of impact, and a duration of impact of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. The processor of a wearable electronic device can monitor the sensor signal to determine if the sensor signal satisfies a threshold magnitude and/or duration indicative of physical contact with another wearable electronic device. The threshold magnitude and/or duration can be minimum and/or maximum thresholds.
- The sensor signal of the head mounted
electronic display unit 110 can be analyzed to determine a location at which the physical contact takes place. In particular, the magnitude of impact can be different depending on the location at which the physical contact takes place relative to the location of the sensor within the head mountedelectronic display unit 110. In some instances, the threshold magnitude may be more readily exceeded when the physical contact takes place at a location that is in close proximity to the impact sensor compared to at a location that is more distant from the impact sensor. - For example,
FIG. 5 shows theelectronic ring 120 in physical contact with thebridge 114 of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110. Such may be particularly advantageous, for example, when the impact sensor of head mountedelectronic display unit 110 is physically located at, within, or in close proximity to (i.e., within two centimeters of)bridge 114. In contrast, theelectronic ring 120 can be in physical contact with an arm 116 of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110. Referring now toFIGS. 6A to 6F (collectively referred to asFIG. 6 herein), shown therein are right side, front, left side, right perspective, top, and left perspective views of theelectronic ring 120 in physical contact with aright arm 116 a of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 ofFIG. 3 . In particular, a side surface of theelectronic ring 120 is in physical contact with the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 as shown inFIG. 6 . The side surface of theelectronic ring 120 can be in (e.g., can be brought into) physical contact with the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 while a user is wearing one, both, or neither of theelectronic ring 120 and the head mountedelectronic display unit 110. The physical contact withright arm 116 a depicted inFIG. 6 may be particularly advantageous when the impact sensor of head mountedelectronic display unit 110 is physically located at, within, or in close proximity to (i.e., within two centimeters of)right arm 116 a. - Referring now to
FIGS. 7A to 7F (collectively referred to asFIG. 7 herein), shown therein are right side, front, left side, right perspective, top, and left perspective views of theelectronic ring 120 in physical contact with aleft arm 116 b of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 ofFIG. 3 . In contrast toFIG. 6 , inFIG. 7 , an end face of theelectronic ring 120 is in physical contact with the head mountedelectronic display unit 110. When the end face of theelectronic ring 120 is in (e.g., is brought into) physical contact with the head mountedelectronic display unit 110, the user may be wearing or not wearing the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 however, the user is not wearing theelectronic ring 120. The physical contact withleft arm 116 b depicted inFIG. 7 may be particularly advantageous when the impact sensor of head mountedelectronic display unit 110 is physically located at, within, or in close proximity to (i.e., within two centimeters of)left arm 116 b. - The sensor signal of the
electronic ring 120 can be analyzed to determine a direction of impact of the electronic ring 120 (e.g., based on data from one or more accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, or inertial sensors in general), which can for example, indicate the orientation of theelectronic ring 120 during physical contact with the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 as shown inFIG. 6 or 7 . - Physical contact between wearable electronic devices may refer to bumping or tapping the wearable electronic devices together. Bumping or tapping can be a quick and easy act to perform. In some implementations, physical contact can be a single tap or bump. In some implementations, physical contact can include a sequence of taps. That is, physical contact can be a plurality of discrete contact events with a first contact event and at least a second contact event.
- Referring now to
FIG. 8 , shown therein is a flow-diagram ofmethod 200 for establishing encrypted communication between wearable electronic devices in accordance with the present systems, devices, and methods. The wearable electronic devices may be substantially similar to the wearableelectronic devices FIGS. 1 and 2 , and the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 and theelectronic ring 120 ofFIGS. 3 to 7 . Furthermore, whilemethod 200 is described with theelectronic ring 120 as a first wearable electronic device and the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 as a second wearable electronic device, those of skill in the art will understand that the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 can act as the first wearable electronic device and theelectronic ring 120 can act as the second wearable electronic device. Furthermore, the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device can be any wearable electronic devices. -
Method 200 includes fiveacts -
Act 202 is triggered or effected in response to a physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. For example, act 202 may be triggered in response to the user bringing the first wearable electronic device and the second wearableelectronic device 120 into physical contact with one another as illustrated in, for example,FIGS. 5, 6, and 7 . The physical contact can include a single bump or a plurality of bumps. A first impact sensor within theelectronic ring 120, for example, generates a first sensor signal upon detection of the physical contact. The first sensor signal generated by the first impact sensor of the first wearable electronic device may be indicative of at least one attribute of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device, such as: a direction of impact, a magnitude of impact, a speed of impact, and/or a duration of impact of the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. -
Method 200 optionally includesact 212. Act 212 may be triggered/effected in tandem withact 202 in response to the physical contact between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. At 212, a second impact sensor within the head mountedelectronic display unit 110, for example, generates a second sensor signal upon detection of the physical contact. Whether or not act 212 is performed depends on whether or not the particular implementation ofmethod 200 has a need of or use for a second sensor signal. - At 204, the first wearable electronic device transmits a first identity signal based at least in part on at least a portion of the first sensor signal. Transmission of the first identity signal can be a broadcast of the first identity signal. That is, transmission of the first identity signal may not be directed specifically at or address a particular receiver such as the head mounted
electronic display unit 110. In some implementations, the processor of theelectronic ring 120 can monitor an output of the first impact sensor and upon identifying that impact has occurred (based on, for example, a spike in the output of the first impact sensor), initiate the transmission of the first identity signal. In some implementations, the processor of theelectronic ring 120 can be manually set to a broadcast mode prior to the physical contact taking place. Manually setting theelectronic ring 120 to a broadcast mode can relate to manipulating a manual button or other input mechanism of theelectronic ring 120. Once bumped, the broadcast mode may result in the transmission of the first identity signal. - In some implementations, the first identity signal can be stored in the
storage medium 12 of theelectronic ring 120 before the physical contact occurs between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. Storage of the first identity signal can be a factory default. Alternatively, the first identity signal can be transferred to the first wearable electronic device via a secure communication channel provided by the connectingcase 130, and optionally from the second wearable electronic device. In some implementations, the first identity signal can relate to or include an identifier for theelectronic ring 120. In some implementations, the first identity signal can be, encode, or carry an encryption key, and more specifically a generic encryption key. - In some implementations, the first identity signal can be based on (e.g., include or be derived from), at least in part, the first sensor signal. In this sense, the first identity signal can be a signature of the first sensor signal. For example, the first identity signal can include a portion of the first sensor signal, and in particular, the impulse signal generated by the physical contact. In some implementations when internal clocks of the wearable electronic devices are time-synchronized, the first identity signal can indicate the time of the physical contact. When the physical contact includes a sequence of tapping, the first identity signal can indicate the start time and the end time of the sequence of tapping. Alternatively, the first identity signal can relate to a pattern of the sequence of tapping. Furthermore, in some implementations, the time of the physical contact, as reported or indicated by the internal clock, can be used to generate an encryption key. Any suitable algorithm can be used to generate an encryption key from the time reported by the internal clock or the pattern of the sequence of tapping.
- At 206, the second wearable electronic device receives the first identity signal. Reception of the first identity signal by the second wearable electronic device can be achieved, for example, when the second wearable electronic device is operating in a search or a listening mode for any signals. That is, reception of the first identity signal may not be directed at signals from a particular transmitter such as the
electronic ring 120. In some implementations, the processor of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 can be manually set to a listening mode prior to the physical contact taking place. Manually setting the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 to a listening mode can relate to manipulating a manual button or other input mechanism of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110. Once bumped, the first wearable electronic device transmits the first identity signal and the listening mode of the second wearable electronic device can receive the first identity signal. In implementations ofmethod 200 that includeoptional act 212, the processor of the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 can monitor the second sensor signal and upon identifying that impact has occurred, initiate the listening mode in order to receive the first identity signal. - At 208, the second wearable electronic device determines that at least a portion of the first identity signal corresponds to at least a portion of an expected identity signal. In general, at 208 the second wearable electronic device may determine whether or not at least a portion of the first identity signal corresponds to at least a portion of an expected identity signal, but
method 200 only progresses fromact 208 to act 210 when at least a portion of the first identity signal does correspond to at least a portion of the expected identity signal. The determination of whether respective portions of the first identity signal and the expected identity signal correspond to one another can involve any appropriate comparison algorithm. For instance, the determination can involve a direct comparison of the two signals. In some implementations, the determination can involve a comparison of a transformation of one or both of the signals. For the purposes of this specification and the appended claims, the term “correspond” in the context of at least a portion of a first identity signal and at least a portion of an expected identity signal means the two (portions of) signal match, align, or otherwise compare in a way that is indicative of a sufficient similarity between the two (portions) of signals. “Sufficient,” in this context, depends on the nature of the particular comparison algorithm being employed and generally invokes a minimum “similarity” threshold for whatever parameter is being compared (e.g., the same within 80%). - The nature of the expected identity signal may generally be analogous to the first identity signal and may optionally be identical to the first identity signal. When the first identity signal is stored in the
storage medium 12 of theelectronic ring 120, the expected identity signal may also be stored (i.e., in thestorage medium 12 of the head mounted electronic display unit 110). Storage of the expected identity signal can also be a factory default. Alternatively, the expected identity signal can be transferred to the second wearable electronic device via a secure communication channel provided by the connectingcase 130, and optionally from the first wearable electronic device. The expected identity signal can also be an encryption key that corresponds to the encryption key of the first identity signal. That is, the encryption key of the first identity signal and the encryption key of the expected identity signal can form a pair of encryption keys. - In implementations of
method 200 that includeoptional act 212, the expected identity signal can be based on (e.g., include or be derived, at least in part, from) the second sensor signal. In this sense, the expected identity signal can be a signature of the second sensor signal. For example, the expected identity signal can include a portion of the second sensor signal, and in particular, the impulse signal generated by the physical contact. In some implementations when internal clocks of the wearable electronic devices are time-synchronized, the expected identity signal can indicate the time of the physical contact. When the physical contact includes a sequence of tapping, the expected identity signal can indicate the start time and the end time of the sequence of tapping. Alternatively, the expected identity signal can relate to a pattern of the sequence of tapping. Furthermore, in some implementations, the time of the physical contact can be used to generate an encryption key. Again, the encryption key of the first identity signal and the encryption key of the expected identity signal can form a pair of encryption keys. - At 210, the at least a portion of the first identity signal and the at least a portion of the expected identity signal are used by the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device as encryption keys to provide encrypted communications between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device. That is, the first wearable electronic device can encrypt data using at least a portion of the first identity signal prior to transmitting, or broadcasting the data. While any electronic device can receive the encrypted data that is broadcasted by the first wearable electronic device, only devices having the expected identity signal can decrypt the encrypted data. Likewise, the second wearable electronic device can encrypt data using at least a portion of the expected identity signal and the first wearable electronic device can decrypt data using at least a portion of the first identity signal.
- Furthermore, the encrypted communications can be refreshed by bumping the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device together again to generate another set of encryption keys. In some implementations, two wearable electronic devices can initially use stored identity signals, such as generic encryption keys, to establish encrypted communications from a first physical contact (i.e., a first bump). The encrypted communications can then be used to time-synchronize internal clocks of the two wearable electronic devices. Subsequently, the two wearable devices can be bumped together again (i.e., a second bump) to generate more secure encryption keys, that is, a first identity signal and an expected identity signal that are derived from the second bump, or a signature of the second bump. In this scenario, the second set of encryption keys may be more secure than the first set of encryption keys because the second set of encryption keys relate to the bump itself as opposed to being stored, generic keys.
- In some embodiments, a second wearable electronic device can connect to a plurality of first wearable electronic devices. That is, prior to a bump, the second wearable electronic device can receive signals from a plurality of electronic devices in listening mode. The first wearable electronic device may transmit a generic signal in broadcast mode. Once the bump occurs, the first wearable electronic device transmits the first identity signal containing an impulse indicative of the bump. The second wearable electronic device can identify the impulse and based on the identification, validate or confirm the connection between the first wearable electronic device and the second wearable electronic device.
- In some embodiments, subsequent bumps can command different actions. For example, the wearable electronic devices can be configured to discard the encryption keys upon a second bump, thus discontinuing the encrypted communication.
- Furthermore, in some embodiments, the direction and the location of impact can command different actions. For example, physical contact between an end face of the
electronic ring 120 and the head mountedelectronic display unit 110, as shown inFIG. 7 , can be indicative of a first bump and the wearable electronic devices can use generic encryption keys. Subsequent bumps may require a side surface of theelectronic ring 120 in physical contact with the head mountedelectronic display unit 110 and can trigger different responses, actions, effects, or the employment of different encryption keys, depending on the specific application. - Throughout this specification and the appended claims the term “communicative” as in “communicative pathway,” “communicative coupling,” and in variants such as “communicatively coupled,” is generally used to refer to any engineered arrangement for transferring and/or exchanging information. Exemplary communicative pathways include, but are not limited to, electrically conductive pathways (e.g., electrically conductive wires, electrically conductive traces), magnetic pathways (e.g., magnetic media), and/or optical pathways (e.g., optical fiber), and exemplary communicative couplings include, but are not limited to, electrical couplings, magnetic couplings, and/or optical couplings.
- Throughout this specification and the appended claims, infinitive verb forms are often used. Examples include, without limitation: “to detect,” “to provide,” “to transmit,” “to communicate,” “to process,” “to route,” and the like. Unless the specific context requires otherwise, such infinitive verb forms are used in an open, inclusive sense, that is as “to, at least, detect,” to, at least, provide,” “to, at least, transmit,” and so on.
