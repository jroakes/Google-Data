Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to communication systems and networks and more particularly to multiple access networks.
- QoS Quality of Service
- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technologies have seen an enormous growth in popularity and are currently being deployed in home, office and public access spaces, particularly as the last hop network.
- VoIP Voice over Internet Protocol
- QoS support is currently being standardized in the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless networks.
- Two mechanisms will be supported, namely a simple, priority-based approach and a more complex, centralized scheduler based approach to be used where tight jitter control is required.
- Prioritized access to the network is implemented by using differentiated media access (MAC) protocol variables for the different priority flows, such that high priority flows gain access to the network in preference to low priority flows. Wide deployment of this simple mechanism is anticipated.
- MAC differentiated media access
- Admission control has been widely studied in the context of wide area networks such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and internet Protocol (IP) networks.
- ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode
- IP internet Protocol
- Admission control can be non-optimally performed by conservatively allocating resources and reserving more bandwidth than is actually necessary to achieve satisfactory levels of QoS.
- Wireless networks have low transmission speeds and dynamic channel characteristics. Data reliability is usually of greater importance than delay and robust transmission link methods, such as forward error correction and automatic repeat request, are necessary. Consequently, results from studies relating to high-speed data networks cannot readily be applied to WLAN's or other networks exhibiting similar characteristics to WLAN's.
- admission control It is known in the art to employ an admission control function that uses a measurement-based approach for calculating the load on the network.
- the function makes admission control decisions on the basis of the calculated load.
- Admission control is dependent on the presence of a time stamp in each data packet for estimating delays.
- a timestamp is not available in a WLAN unless inserted by an application.
- aspects of the present invention provide a method, a network access point and a communication system for admitting data flows corresponding to new service requests to a multiple access network.
- the method includes the steps of receiving a service request having Quality of Service (QoS) requirements from a network node, calculating the effective bandwidth required by a data flow corresponding to the service request based on an average packet size of the data flow, determining the maximum capacity of the network, and admitting the data flow corresponding to the service request if the network has sufficient capacity to accommodate the effective bandwidth required by the data flow.
- QoS Quality of Service
- the average packet size of the data flow is preferably determined from the service request and the effective bandwidth required by the data flow corresponding to the service request can optionally be adjusted if the transmission rate of the service request is less than the maximum transmission rate of the network.
- the maximum capacity of the network is determined based on the number of transmitting nodes in the network.
- the data flow corresponding to the service request is admitted to the network if the sum of the occupied bandwidth on the network and the effective bandwidth required by the data flow is less than or equal to the maximum capacity of the network.
- the number of transmitting nodes and the occupied bandwidth of the network can be stored and/or updated when a data flow terminates.
- the apparatus includes a receiver for receiving a service request having Quality of Service (QoS) requirements from a network node, at least one processor for calculating an effective bandwidth required by the data flow corresponding to the service request based on an average packet size of the data flow and for determining a capacity of the network based on a number of transmitting nodes in the network, an admission controller for admitting the data flow relating to the service request to the network provided that the network has sufficient capacity to accommodate the effective bandwidth required by the data flow and a transmitter to transmit grant of admission to the network node.
- QoS Quality of Service
- Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a communication system, including a multiple access data network, a plurality of network nodes capable of communicating via the network and at least one access point coupled to the multiple access data network.
- An access point includes a receiver for receiving a service request having Quality of Service (QoS) requirements from a network node, at least one processor for calculating an effective bandwidth required by a dataflow corresponding to the service request based on an average packet size of the data flow and for determining a capacity of the network based on a number of transmitting nodes in the network, an admission controller for admitting to the network, the data flow relating to the service request provided that the network has sufficient capacity to accommodate the effective bandwidth required by the data flow and a transmitter to transmit grant of admission to the network node.

- embodiments of the present invention are so limited since the principles of the method and apparatus described hereinafter have general applicability to other kinds of networks that exhibit similar characteristics to WLAN's.

- the method, apparatus and system described hereinafter have application to multi-class multiple-access LAN's incorporating QoS support.
- FIG. 1 is a graph of mean delay as a function of offered load.
- the threshold 110 is referred to as the capacity of the network.
- the QoS characteristics of the network are satisfactory or good, and the network is considered to be offering a controlled load service.
- a prioritized WLAN can thus prevent the best effort traffic from affecting high priority flows.
- Other QoS characteristics such as jitter are affected in a similar manner as mean delay.
- the purpose of admission control is to guarantee QoS by ensuring that the offered load remains below the capacity of the network.
- the network capacity is not constant, and the admission control algorithm and apparatus thus need to take variations in capacity into account. Network capacity is affected by the following factors:
- FIG. 4 shows a flow diagram of a method for admission control of new traffic on a WLAN.
- a service request for a new data flow is received from a WLAN node.
- the effective bandwidth for the new data flow is calculated at step 420 .
- the capacity of the network is determined at step 430 .
- FIG. 5 shows a more detailed flow diagram of a method for admission control of new traffic on a WLAN.
- a service request for a new data flow is received from a WLAN node.
- the bandwidth requested in respect of the new data flow is determined from the QoS signaling between the requesting station and the WLAN admission controller, at step 520 .
- the effective bandwidth of the new data flow is calculated using the average packet size of the new data flow. The average packet size is obtained directly from the QoS signaling.
- BW eff (Size packet+ Size header )/Size packet ⁇ BW actual
- the number of transmitting nodess can be determined using the QoS signaling, which indicates the address of a transmitting node. If the number of transmitting nodes increases when the new data flow is added (Y), the new maximum capacity of the network is determined at step 545 , before processing continues at step 550 .
- Maximum network capacity as a function of the number of transmitting nodes is determined in advance by measurement or simulation. The relevant value for maximum capacity is typically obtained from a lookup table, based or indexed on the number of transmitting nodes. In the absence of an exact match in the lookup table, the next highest value in the table is selected. Table 1 provides an example of a lookup table for determining the maximum network capacity as a function of the number of transmitting nodes:
- step 540 If the number of transmitting nodes did not increase (N), processing continues from step 540 to step 550 .
- the physical transmission rate of a data flow relating to the new service request is determined by means of a link monitor at the access point to the WLAN.
- Nodes can vary their transmitting rate periodically to deal with link conditions and station mobility.
- a link monitor continually sample packets from each node, variations in network capacity can be dynamically tracked by taking changes in physical rate into account.
- the link monitor obtains the physical rate from the WLAN headers.
- step 565 processing continues at step 570 . If the physical rate is not less than the maximum rate (N), processing continues from step 560 to step 570 .
- the admission controller updates its state in a similar fashion when data flows terminate, as to when new data flows are admitted to the network.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an architecture with which the methods of FIGS. 4 and 5 may be practiced.

- the actual applications using the WLAN or similar wired network are assumed to provide sufficient buffering to deal with minor variations in QoS.
Abstract
Description
-
- The packet mix in the network. WLAN packets typically have long preambles due to the need to interoperate with nodes at different data rates. For small packets, the size of the preamble is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the actual data packets. Voice traffic has small packet sizes and consequently reduces the capacity of the network. Video traffic, on the other hand, has large packet sizes and thus increases the capacity of the network. The capacity of the network is therefore dependent on the average packet size or the packet mix in a WLAN.
FIG. 2 is a graph showing WLAN capacity as a function of packet size. The capacity of the network increases non-linearly as the packet size increases, in a largely half-parabolic manner, until amaximum packet size 210 is reached. As can be seen, network capacity increases rapidly as a function of packet size for smaller packet sizes, but increases less rapidly as the average packet size increases and approaches the Maximum Transmitting Unit (MTU). - The number of transmitting nodes in the network. The capacity of a WLAN is also affected by the number of transmitting nodes, due to an increase in the number of collisions as the number of transmitting nodes increases.
FIG. 3 is a graph of network capacity as a function of the number of transmitting nodes. As can be seen from the graph, network capacity reduces when a constant load is offered by an increasing number of nodes. However, the graph is substantially more flat thanFIG. 2 , indicating that the number of transmitting nodes does not have as great an effect on network capacity as the effect of average packet size. - The physical transmission rate in a multi-rate WLAN. WLAN's support transmissions at various physical rates. Nodes transmit at different rates depending on factors such as link quality and the distance from the Access Point (AP). Transmitting at a lower rate than the maximum rate reduces the overall capacity of the network, as this results in the channel being occupied for a longer period of time. Thus, when a new data flow is requested, current values of factors affecting network capacity are obtained and compensated for. The compensation can be performed by reducing the network capacity, calculating an effective bandwidth for the new flow, or a combination thereof. A new data flow is only admitted if the network has sufficient capacity to accommodate the effective bandwidth required by the data flow.
- The packet mix in the network. WLAN packets typically have long preambles due to the need to interoperate with nodes at different data rates. For small packets, the size of the preamble is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the actual data packets. Voice traffic has small packet sizes and consequently reduces the capacity of the network. Video traffic, on the other hand, has large packet sizes and thus increases the capacity of the network. The capacity of the network is therefore dependent on the average packet size or the packet mix in a WLAN.
BWeff=(Sizepacket+Sizeheader)/Sizepacket·BWactual

-
- BWactual is the requested bandwidth,
- Sizepacket is the average packet size, and
