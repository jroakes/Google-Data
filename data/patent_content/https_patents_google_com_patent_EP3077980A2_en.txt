Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.
- the content that is provided may be any suitable components of an interactive user interface in which a user is able to select interactive components of the user interface.
- the modeling described below is therefore able to analyse user interactions with a user interface and to provide content, for example in the form of interactive components or information, in such a way that the user interface is improved based upon the techniques described below.
- an online user today is exposed to a plethora of media exposures or marketing touchpoints, such as banner ads, email ads, display ads, organic and paid search results, social media posts or notifications, amongst others.
- a user exposed to such media exposures may likely take an action related to the media exposure, for example, click on the media exposure.
- the user upon taking an action on the media exposure to which the user is exposed, the user can be directed to the website linked to the media exposure, resulting in a user visit.
- the modeling techniques described below allow improved provision of data to a user such that data may be displayed to a user based upon the modeling techniques to provide an improved user interface and interactive user experience.
- the website can monitor visits to the website and maintain a log of such visits.
- a data processing system can maintain such a log for the website.
- a record of the visit is created.
- the record can include a visitor identifier unique to the device, browser, account or other identifiable component through which the visitor is visiting the website; a timestamp of the visit; a source from where the visitor arrived at the website, for example, a name of another website; a media exposure type indicating a type of media exposure through which the visitor arrived at the website, for example, a paid advertisement, amongst others; and an indication indicating whether or not the visit resulted in the user performing a conversion act.

- the visitors may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters).
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by a content server.
- the record can also include a path of the visitor.
- the path of the visitor includes a sequence of events, in which each event corresponds to a particular previous visit to the website.
- the path can also include an indication indicating whether or not the user performed a converting act. In some such implementations, the indication can also identify when the converting act occurred relative to other events included in the path.
- the path of the visitor corresponds to 'Paid Search 1 ' - 'Email' - 'Paid Search 2'.
- Each of the visits and the media exposure type through which the visitor visited the website corresponds to an event and each of the events is associated with an index position indicating an event's position relative to other events of the path.

- the event 'email' has an index position 2
- the event 'paid search 2' has the index position 3.

- the data processing system can identify, for each visitor from the plurality of visits, one or more paths taken by the visitor to visit the website. Each of the paths may correspond to a sequence of events through which the visitor visits the website.
- the data processing system can determine, for each path type, a conversion probability based on a number of visits corresponding to the path type that resulted in a conversion.
- the data processing system can then calculate, for a given path type having a plurality of events, a counterfactual gain for each event based on a conversion probability of the given path type and a conversion probability of a path type that does not include the event for which the counterfactual gain is calculated.
- the data processing system can then assign attribution credits to the events of the given path type for which counterfactual gains are calculated.
- the attribution model is created once each event in each path type can be assigned an attribution credit determined according to the system just described. As this attribution model relies on historical data corresponding to visits to a website, this attribution model is a data-driven attribution model.
- the data-driven attribution model created by the system described above can be utilized to assign attribution credit to various events of a path associated with a user that performs a converting act.
- the data processing system can first identify the path taken by the user to perform the converting act. The data processing system can then determine that the identified path matches a path included in the attribution model, and responsive to determining that the path matches a path of the attribution model, provide an attribution credit to each of the events included in the path taken by the user based on the assigned attribution credits assigned to each of the events of the path included in the attribution model. Additional details of the methods and systems for creating the data-driven attribution model are provided below in Section A.
- the new attribution model relies on determining conversion probabilities of path types based on paths taken by visitors of a particular website.

For a given path type having more than one event, an attribution credit for each of the events can be determined by calculating counterfactual gains for each event. The counterfactual gains are calculated based on a conversion probability of the given path type and a conversion probability of a path type that does not include the event for which the counterfactual gain is calculated. Accurately calculating the conversion probability of various path types can be quite challenging.

- the data processing system can identify one or more subpaths corresponding to each visit to the website as paths. The data processing system can determine, for each of the identified paths, that the path is one of converting or non-converting. The data processing system can then compute a total path count for each path type.
- Each path type identifies one or more events having an associated indexed position indicating a position of the event relative to other events in the path.
- the data processing system can then determine, for each path type, a conversion path count indicating a number of paths taken by visitors that resulted in a conversion at the website.

In this way, the path associated with the given identifier includes the entries arranged in ascending order.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can be configured to determine if the amount of time between two successive events is greater than a threshold time period. In some such implementations, if the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 determines that the amount of time between two successive events is greater than a threshold time period, the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can be configured to disregard the earlier occurring event of the two successive events and all other events preceding the earlier occurring event when identifying a path associated with the given visitor identifier.

- the second path type 222 includes a first event 'Organic Search' followed by a second event 'Referral' and the conversion probability is 0.33.
- the difference between the first path type 212 and the second path type 222 is that the second path type 222 does not include the event 'Paid Search' in between the 'Organic Search' event and the 'Referral' event.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can be configured to calculate the counterfactual gain of the 'Paid Search' event of the first path type by determining the difference in the conversion probabilities of the first path type 212 and the second path type 222 that is identical to the first path type except that the second path type 222 does not include the 'Paid Search' event for which the counterfactual gain is to be calculated.

- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can be configured to calculate the counterfactual gain of an event of a given path type by first identifying, for the given path type, a first ordered sequence of events preceding the given event and a second ordered sequence of events subsequent to the given event.
- the event if the event is the first event of the given path type, there data-driven attribution model creation module 120 does not identify a first ordered sequence of events. In some implementations, if the event is the last event of the given path type, the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 does not identify the second ordered sequence of events. In some implementations, the sequence of events can include one or more events.
- the data- driven attribution model creation module 120 can then identify, from the identified path types, a comparison path type that includes the first ordered sequence of events immediately followed by the second ordered sequence of events. Stated in another way, the comparison path type is identical to the given path type except that the comparison path type does not include the event for which the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 is calculating the counterfactual gain. The data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can then calculate the difference between a conversion probability of the given path type and a conversion probability of the comparison path type. The calculated difference is the counterfactual gain of the event.
- the counterfactual gain of a particular event in a given path type can be a negative number.
- this can adversely affect how to assign attribution credit to one or more events.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can calculate a counterfactual gain for the last event of a particular path type to be a negative number even though the last event can result in a conversion.
- assigning a negative attribution credit to a particular event is counterintuitive.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can be configured to determine that a calculated counterfactual gain for a given event is less than zero. The data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can modify the counterfactual gain for such an event to zero in response to determining that the calculated counterfactual gain for the given event is less than zero.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can then determine the attribution credit to assign to each of the events of a given path type.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can first determine a total gain value corresponding to the sum of the counterfactual gains corresponding to each of the events of the given path type.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can then determine the attribution credit for each of the events by determining the ratio of the counterfactual gain of a given event to the total gain value. As shown in FIG. 2D, the total gain value is the sum of the counterfactual gains of each of the Organic Search' event, the 'Paid Search' event and the 'Referral' event.
- the attribution credit is the ratio of 0.1/0.32, which is about 31%.
- the attribution credit is the ratio of 0.07/0.32, which is about 22%.
- the attribution credit is the ratio of 0.15/0.32, which is about 47%.
- the data- driven attribution model creation module 120 can then assign the determined attribution credit to each event in the given path type for which counterfactual gains are calculated.
- the data-driven attribution creation module 120 in the event that the total gain value is zero, can be configured to assign each event in the path an attribution credit according to a fallback attribution model.
- the fallback attribution model can be a last-click attribution model.
- the fallback attribution model can be one that assigns each event an equal amount of attribution credit.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can be configured to determine the amount of attribution credit to apply to each event type for the identified paths that resulted in conversions.
- FIG. 2E shows a conceptual illustration of two paths of the same path type. As shown in FIG. 2E, the two converting paths of the first path type 212 are shown.
- the data- driven attribution model creation module 120 can compute the amount of attribution credit each of the events of the first path type deserve by multiplying the attribution credit to the total number of conversions for the first path type. Accordingly, the attribution credit assigned to the 'Organic Search' event is 0.63, the 'Paid Search' event is 0.44 and the 'Referral' event is 0.94, respectively. In contrast, if the last click attribution model was applied, the attribution credit assigned to Organic Search' event and the 'Paid Search' event would be zero, while the attribution credit assigned to the 'Referral' event would be 2.

In this way, the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can store a plurality of the attribution rules to create an attribution model based on the conversion probabilities of various path types.
- the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can store the attribution rules created from the determined attribution credits in such a way that the data-driven attribution model creation module 120 can access the attribution rules at a later time to assign attribution credits to events of a path type that resulted in a conversion.
- the data processing system can be configured to assign attribution credits to various events of a given path that resulted in a conversion. To do so, the data processing system can first identify a path type of the path that converted. The data processing system can then use the attribution rule corresponding to the identified path type to assign attribution credits to each of the events of the identified path.
- the data processing system can be configured to maintain statistics for one or more content publishers.

In some implementations, if the event is the last event of the given path type, the data processing system does not identify the second ordered sequence of events. In some implementations, the sequence of events can include one or more events.
- the data processing system can then identify, from the identified path types, a comparison path type that includes the first ordered sequence of events immediately followed by the second ordered sequence of events. Stated in another way, the comparison path type is identical to the given path type except that the comparison path type does not include the event for which the data processing system is calculating the counterfactual gain. The data processing system can then calculate the difference between a conversion probability of the given path type and a conversion probability of the comparison path type. The calculated difference is the counterfactual gain of the event.
- the counterfactual gain of a particular event in a given path type can be a negative number.
- this can adversely affect how to assign attribution credit to one or more events.
- the data processing system can calculate a counterfactual gain for the last event of a particular path type to be a negative number even though the last event can result in a conversion.
- assigning a negative attribution credit to a particular event is counterintuitive.
- the data processing system can be configured to determine that a calculated counterfactual gain for a given event is less than zero. The data processing system can modify the counterfactual gain for such an event to zero in response to determining that the calculated counterfactual gain for the given event is less than zero.
- the data processing system can then determine an attribution credit for each event of each of the plurality of path types (BLOCK 425).
- the data processing system can first determine a total gain value corresponding to the sum of the counterfactual gains corresponding to each of the events of the given path type.
- the data processing system can then determine the attribution credit for each of the events by determining the ratio of the counterfactual gain of a given event to the total gain value.
- the data processing system can then assign the determined attribution credit to each event in the given path type for which counterfactual gains are calculated.
- the data processing system in the event that the total gain value is zero, the data processing system can assign each event in the path an attribution credit according to a fallback attribution model.
- the fallback attribution model can be a last-click attribution model. In some implementations, the fallback attribution model can be one that assigns each event an equal amount of attribution credit.
- the data processing system can store, for each of a plurality of the path types associated with the identified paths, the determined attribution credit for each event included in the path type (BLOCK 430). In some implementations, the data processing system can store the determined attribution credits of each event of a given path type as a single attribution rule. In this way, the data processing system can store a plurality of the attribution rules to create an attribution model based on the conversion probabilities of various path types.
- the data processing system can store the attribution rules created from the determined attribution credits in such a way that the data processing system can access the attribution rules at a later time to assign attribution credits to events of a path type that resulted in a conversion.
- the data processing system can be configured to assign attribution credits to various events of a given path that resulted in a conversion. To do so, the data processing system can first identify a path type of the path that converted. The data processing system can then use the attribution rule corresponding to the identified path type to assign attribution credits to each of the events of the identified path.
- the data processing system can be configured to maintain statistics for one or more content publishers.
- the data processing system can update a conversion table of the website that maintains a tally of the attribution credits associated with various events by adding the attribution credits associated with each of the events to the existing totals of the corresponding events.
- the data-driven attribution model briefly described above relies on the use of prior conversion paths of visitors to assign attribution credits to deserving media exposures.
- the attribution model includes a plurality of rules for assigning attribution credit to events of a given path type. Each of the rules can be unique to a given path type. For a given path type having more than one event, an attribution credit for each of the events included in the given path type can be determined by calculating counterfactual gains for each event as described in Section A. The counterfactual gains are calculated based on a conversion probability of the given path type and a conversion probability of a path type that does not include the event for which the counterfactual gain is calculated.
- the attribution model's reliance on calculating a counterfactual gain for each event of a given path type raises challenges not previously acknowledged.
- One of the challenges in creating such an attribution model is allocating or managing resources for computing the counterfactual gains for each event included in each path type that a visitor may take.
- the data processing system can determine the conversion probability of the path type that has 5 events as well as the conversion probability of at least 4 different path types that have 4 events that include the same events in order of the 5 path type except for the event for which the counterfactual gain is to be calculated.
- the computation can be quite resource intensive. As such, it may be desirable to create a data-driven attribution model relying on calculating a counterfactual gain for each event of a given path type that balances accuracy with resource utilization.
- the new attribution model relies on determining conversion probabilities of path types based on paths taken by visitors of a particular website.
- One challenge in creating an attribution model that relies on determining conversion probabilities of path types is the amount of data that would need to be processed to be able to reliably determine conversion probabilities as well as counterfactual gains for each event included in the plurality of path types for which attribution credit is to be assigned.
- the amount of data that may need to be processed can be based on the total number of paths to the website, the number of events in each of the paths and the number of different types of paths, amongst others. Although having more data be processed may help achieve greater accuracy in calculating conversion probabilities for each of the path types, it can be desirable to balance the need for greater accuracy with the amount of computational resources utilized.
- aspects of the present disclosure also relate to methods and systems for processing data to accurately determine conversion probabilities of path types while efficiently utilizing computational resources.
- the present disclosure provides methods and systems for creating rules for the attribution model that balances accuracy with computational resource requirements.
- the rule creation module 125 of the data processing system 1 10 can be configured to perform aspects of the data-driven attribution model creation module 120.

- the rule creation module 125 can be configured to identify a plurality of conversions made by visitors at a particular website.
- the rule creation module 125 can be configured to identify a plurality of conversions that occurred within a given time period.
- the given time period can be based on a request from an advertiser.
- the time period can be based on the amount of traffic the website receives over the given time period.
- the time period can be based on the number of visits to be analyzed.
- the rule creation module 125 can be configured to identify a plurality of conversions by retrieving visit related entries from a database in which visit related information of the website is stored, such as the database 140.

- the rule creation module 125 can identify, for each identified conversion of the plurality of conversions, a path associated with the conversion.
- the path can identify one or more events and a corresponding index position indicating an event's position relative to other events of the path.
- the path is specific to a particular visitor identifier identifying a visitor device.
- the path represents a sequence of events that resulted in visits to the website by the visitor device.
- the events can correspond to interactions by the visitor device and media exposures corresponding to the website.
- the rule creation module 125 can identify a path associated with the conversion by requesting information from a database that stores visit related information relating to visits to the website.
- the rule creation module 125 can determine the path associated with a conversion by identifying, for the visitor identifier associated with the conversion, one or more previous visits to the website. Upon identifying previous visits to the website, the rule creation module 125 can then arrange the previous visits in chronological order according to their timestamps indicating a time at which the visitor visited the website. In some implementations, the rule creation module 125 can determine if a time period between two successive visits to the website exceeds a threshold time period. If the time period between the two successive visits exceeds the threshold time period, the rule creation module 125 can disregard all visits preceding the later of the two successive visits. The threshold time period can be predetermined.
- the threshold time period can range from a few hours to a few months.
- the rule creation module 125 can determine if the amount of time between one particular type of event and an immediate prior event (of any type) is less than a threshold time period. In some such implementations, if the data- rule creation module 125 determines that the amount of time between an occurrence of that particular event type and it's immediate predecessor event is less than threshold time period, rule creation module 125 can disregard that occurrence of the particular event type when identifying a path associated with the given visitor path.
- the rule creation module 125 can be configured to identify, from the identified paths or corresponding conversions, a plurality of path types associated with each of the identified conversions. Each path type is characterized by a particular sequence of events. In some implementations, the rule creation module 125 can identify a conversion count associated with each path type. The conversion count of a given path type is a number of conversions from the identified conversions that correspond to the given path type.
- the rule creation module 125 can further be configured to identify a subset of path types that are to be rewritten.
- the rule creation module 125 can identify the subset of path types to be rewritten according to a path rewriting policy.
- the path rewriting policy can include one or more rules for identifying path types to be rewritten as well as the manner in which the identified path types are to be rewritten.
- the path rewriting policy can include one or more rules for rewriting paths such that one or more different paths can be treated the same when determining attribution credits for the events included in the paths.

- the path rewriting policy can be configured to rewrite path types having a path length greater than a threshold number of events.
- a path length of one or more of the paths can exceed a threshold number of events.
- the path length of a path is the number of events included in the path before the path resulted in a conversion. For such paths that have a path length that exceeds a threshold number of events, it may be desirable to assign attribution credits to only a subset of the events included in the paths.
- the rule creation module 125 can rewrite paths to include events to assign attribution credit, while disregarding events for which to not assign attribution credit.
- the threshold number of events can range from 3-10. In some implementations, the threshold number of events can be based on the total number of conversions per path type.
- the path rewriting policy can include two parameters, a first subset length and a second subset length. For every path where the path length is greater than the sum of the first subset length and a second subset length, the path is rewritten by introducing a dummy variable in between the events corresponding to the first subset length and the events corresponding to the second subset length.
- the first subset length can be one and the second subset length can be two.
- the dummy variable, represented herein as 'ANY' can be a token that represents one or more events of any type and is assigned an attribution credit of zero.
- a first path may correspond to paid search - email - paid search - social network - referral - email.
- the first path may be rewritten as paid search - ANY - referral - email.
- a second path may correspond to paid search - email— social network - paid search - email - paid search - referral - email.
- the second path similar to the first path, may be rewritten as paid search - ANY - referral - email.
- the rule creation module 125 can be configured to determine that one or more path types corresponding to the identified conversions are not statistically significant. In some implementations, the rule creation module 125 can arrange the path types in order of decreasing frequency. Upon arranging the path types in order of decreasing frequency, the rule creation module can remove all path types whose cumulative frequency is less than a threshold frequency. In some implementations, the threshold frequency can be determined to be a percentage of the overall number of conversions identified. As such, if the overall number of conversions is 10 million, the threshold frequency can range from 100,000 for a 99% inclusion rate to 1 million for a 90% inclusion rate. In some implementations, the threshold frequency can bet set to any predetermined inclusion rate.
- the rule creation module 125 can also remove any path type that has a frequency that is less than a threshold frequency amount.
- the threshold frequency amount can be based on the overall number of conversions identified. For example, the threshold frequency amount can be 1000 conversions.
- the rule creation module 125 can further be configured to determine the attribution credit for each of the events of the path.
- the rule creation module 125 can utilize the process for determining attribution credits for events of a path described with respect to Section A.
- the rule creation module can be configured to determine the attribution credit for each of the events of the path by determining the conversion probabilities of each path type and then determining the attribution credit for each event by calculating the counterfactual gain of the event for which the attribution credit is being determined.
- the rule creation module 125 can create a plurality of rules corresponding to the path types for which attribution credits are determined.
- the rule creation module 125 can create an associative array that includes one or more of the created rules.
- the associative array can include a key that corresponds to a path type associated with the conversions. As such, each entry in the array can correspond to a unique path type and can be considered a single attribution rule.
- the rule creation module 125 can include an attribution rule for the path 'paid search' - 'email' - 'paid search' that has a frequency of 34,222. That is, of the 10 million conversions identified by the rule creation module, the attribution rule corresponding to the path 'paid search' - 'email' - 'paid search' led to 34,222 conversions.
- the rule creation module 125 can include rules corresponding to the rewritten paths. In this way, the associative array does not include rules corresponding to paths that have path lengths that exceed the threshold number of events.
- the associative array can also keep track of the number of conversions that correspond to each of the rules.
- the rule creation module can associate conversions belonging to multiple paths that correspond to a single rewritten path as conversions of the single rewritten path. In this way, multiple paths that do not have a high number of conversions but can be treated similarly can be rewritten in such a way so as to be associated with a single rewritten path.
- each of the rules created by the rule creation module 125 includes the attribution credits determined according to the process described in Section A. These attribution credits correspond to each of the events of the given path type with which the rule is associated. For those path types for which a rule has not been created or for which attribution credits to the constituent events cannot be assigned, attribution credits can be assigned according a fallback attribution model, such as last click attribution. In some implementations, the attribution credits can be assigned according to a configurable attribution model selected by an advertiser or other entity, for example, an attribution model in which the first event and the last event each get 25% of the attribution credit while the remaining 50% is shared amongst the other events of the path type.

- Each path type includes a sequence of events.
- Each event in the path type is assigned an attribution credit value.
- the sum of the attribution credit values of each of the events of a particular path type is equal to 100%.
- the associative array 500 can be stored in a database, such as the database 140.
- the data processing system 110 can access the associative array 500 to determine how to assign attribution credit for a given path type.
- the data processing system 110 can be configured to identify a path type associated with the conversion.
- the data processing system 110 can then match the identified path type with a rule included in the associative array 500. If the data processing system 1 10 determines that the path type matches a rule of the associative array, the data processing system assigns attribution credit to the events of the path corresponding to the conversion in accordance with the assigned attribution credit associated with the rule of the associative array.
- the data processing system 110 determines that the path type does not match a rule of the associative array, the data processing system 1 10 assigns attribution credit to the events of the path corresponding to the conversion in accordance with a fallback attribution model, such as last click attribution.
- the rule creation module 125 has to employ greater computational resources to process the identified plurality of conversions and determine the attribution credits for each event of each rule.
- the data-driven attribution model is more accurate than any fallback attribution model employed by the data processing system 110, there is a loss of accuracy in assigning attribution credits according to a fallback attribution model in the event of a conversion.
- the data processing system is also reducing the accuracy in which attribution credits are assigned to events of the conversion path.

- the data processing system can identify a plurality of conversions at a particular website by retrieving, from a website log, visit related data associated with conversions at the website.
- the data processing system can identify path types associated with the identified conversions (BLOCK 610). Each path type is characterized by a particular sequence of events. In some implementations, the data processing system can identify a conversion count associated with each path type. The conversion count of a given path type is a number of conversions from the identified conversions that correspond to the given path type. The data processing system can identify path types by identifying, for each conversion, a visitor identifier associated with the conversion. The data processing system can then identify qualifying visits to the website prior to the conversion. A qualifying visit can include any previous visit that occurs within a threshold amount of time before a given visit. In this way, if the threshold amount of time is 1 day, any visit that occurs less than 1 day before a given visit is a qualifying visit. In some
- the data processing system can then identify, for each qualifying visit, an event through which the visitor visited the website.
- events include a user's interaction with any of a plurality of media exposures, such as a paid search ad, a display ad, a social network post, an email ad, a direct visit, amongst others.

- the path rewriting policy can include one or more rules to simplify one or more path types.
- the path rewriting policy can be configured to rewrite path types having a path length greater than a threshold number of events.
- a path length of one or more of the paths can exceed a threshold number of events. The path length of a path is the number of events included in the path before the path resulted in a conversion.
- the data processing system can then identify a subset of the identified path types to be rewritten by identifying path types that have a path length that exceeds a threshold number of events.

- the data processing system can then identify, for the given path, a first number of events of the given path corresponding to a first set of events that resulted in a visit to the website and a second number of events corresponding to a second set of events of the given path immediately preceding the conversion.
- the data processing system can then identify one or more events of the given path that are not identified as the first number of events and not identified as the second number of events, as remaining events.
- the data processing system can then replace the remaining events of the given path with a dummy variable that is not assigned any attribution credit.
- the data processing system can rewrite path types that have a path length that exceeds a threshold number of events by keeping a portion of the events while removing the other events included in the path type.
- the events to keep and remove may be selected based on conversion path trends.
- the data processing system can arrange all path types according to the last event preceding the conversion event. The data processing system can then further arrange the path types according to the last two events preceding the conversion event, and so forth. The data processing system can then determine whether to merge one or more path types that have a portion of events just preceding the conversion sequence of events by rewriting the path types to disregard events that are not common to the one or more merging path types.
- the data processing system can determine that a path type is not sufficiently significant. The data processing system can then remove the path type from the identified path types for which a rule for assigning attribution credit is created in response to determining that the path type is not sufficiently significant. In some implementations, the data processing system can determine that a path type is not sufficiently significant by first identifying a number of conversions associated with the path type. The data processing system can then identify path types having a number of conversions less than a threshold. The data processing system can remove the identified path types that have a number of conversions that are less than the threshold.
- the data processing system can determine that a path type is not sufficiently significant by identifying, for each path type, a number of conversions associated with the path type.
- the data processing system can then identify a threshold frequency based on a number of conversions identified.
- the threshold frequency can be 1% of the number of conversions identified (see BLOCK 605).
- the data processing system can then remove path types in ascending order of the identified number of conversions associated with the path type until the number of conversions removed exceeds the threshold frequency.
- the data processing system can remove path types starting with the path type having the lowest frequency.
- the data processing system can determine, for each of the rewritten path types and remaining identified path types associated with the identified conversions, attribution credits for each event included in the path type (BLOCK 625).
- the data processing system can utilize the process for determining attribution credits for events of a path described with respect to Section A.

- the data processing system can include rules corresponding to the rewritten paths. In this way, the associative array does not include rules corresponding to paths that have path lengths that exceed the threshold number of events.
- the associative array can also keep track of the number of conversions that correspond to each of the rules.
- the data processing system can associate conversions belonging to multiple paths that correspond to a single rewritten path as conversions of the single rewritten path. In this way, multiple paths that do not have a high number of conversions but can be treated similarly can be rewritten in such a way so as to be associated with a single rewritten path.
- the rules created by the data processing system include the determined attribution credits. These attribution credits correspond to each of the events of the given path type with which the rule is associated. For those path types for which a rule has not been created or for which attribution credits to the constituent events cannot be assigned, attribution credits can be assigned according a fallback attribution model, such as last click attribution. In some implementations, the attribution credits can be assigned arbitrarily such that the first event and the last event each get 25% of the attribution credit while the remaining 50% is shared amongst the other events of the path type. [0190] In some implementations, the data processing system can receive a request to assign attribution credit to a plurality of events of a given path type.
- the data processing system can determine that the given path type does not match any of the created rules. The data processing system can then assign an attribution credit to each of the plurality of events included in the identified path according to a fallback attribution model that is different from an attribution model used to assign attribution credits for events of path types for which a rule is created.
- the fallback attribution model is a last click attribution model. In some implementations, the fallback attribution model can be any other attribution model.
- the data-driven attribution model described herein relies on the use of prior conversion paths of visitors to determine conversion probabilities of various path types. Based on the conversion probabilities of the various path types, counterfactual gains can be calculated for each event of a given path type, which can be used to determine and assign attribution credits to events of the given path type. For a given path type having more than one event, an attribution credit for each of the events can be determined by calculating counterfactual gains for each event. The counterfactual gains are calculated based on a conversion probability of the given path type and a conversion probability of a path type that does not include the event for which the counterfactual gain are calculated. Accurately calculating the conversion probability of various path types can be quite challenging.
- a methodology that can measure a website visitor's propensity to convert as a function of multiple events as well as the order of those events is needed.
- the methodology should be able to discern a website visitor's propensity to convert as a function of number of events, types of events, and the relative order in which the events occur is needed.
- aspects of the present disclosure relate to methods and systems for measuring conversion probabilities of a plurality of path types to create the data-driven attribution model.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 of the data processing system can be configured to determine conversion probabilities of a plurality of path types.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can be configured to identify a plurality of paths taken by visitors to visit a particular website. As described above, a path corresponds to a sequence of events. Each event can correspond to a media exposure or marketing touchpoint through which the visitor exposed to the media exposure visits the website. In some implementations, the event corresponds to an interaction between the visitor and the media exposure, for example, a click on a paid search ad, an email ad, a social networking post, or entering a web address of the website in a web browser.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can be configured to identify one or more subpaths associated with each of the identified plurality of paths.
- a subpath is a path corresponding to a previous visit of the visitor to the website.
- a path 'Paid Search' - 'Email' - 'Referral' that results in a conversion can be associated with two subpaths 'Paid Search' and 'Paid Search - 'Email'.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can treat the identified subpaths as paths for the purposes of counting a number of converting paths and a number of non-converting paths.
- One of the challenges in identifying subpaths associated with each of the identified plurality of paths is the resource consumption needed to perform such a function. Imagine if the number of identified paths is 10 million and 2 million of them have ten or more events prior to a conversion. The number of subpaths that can be derived from the 10 million paths can be significantly larger than the 10 million initially identified paths. As such, in some
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can apply a path rewriting policy to rewrite one or more of the identified paths. In some implementations, the conversion probability determination module 130 can rewrite paths that have a path length greater than a threshold number of events. Details of rewriting the paths are provided above with respect to the rule creation module described above in Section B.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can be configured to determine if a given path or subpath is a converting path or a non-converting path.
- a converting path is a path in which the visitor performs a converting act during the visit that resulted from the last event of the particular path.
- a non-converting path is a path in which the visitor does not perform a converting act during the visit that resulted from the last event of the particular path.
- the path 'Paid Search' - 'Email' - 'Referral' is a converting path, while the subpaths 'Paid Search' and 'Paid Search - 'Email' are non-converting paths.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can be configured to determine whether each of the identified paths is a converting path or a non- converting path.
- the paths include both the paths initially identified by the conversion probability determination module 130 as well as subpaths derived from the initially identified paths.
- a path can include multiple interactions that result in multiple conversions.
- a path Organic Search' - 'Paid Search' - 'Conversion - 'Social' - 'Email' - 'Conversion 2' - 'Conversion 3 ' corresponds to three conversions.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can derive the following paths from this example path.
- Subpath 1 'Organic Search' - Not Converting.
- Subpath 2 'Organic Search' - 'Paid Search' - Converting.
- Subpath 3 'Organic Search' - 'Paid Search' - 'Social' - Not Converting.
- Subpath 4 'Organic Search' - 'Paid Search' - 'Social' - 'Email' - Converting.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can be configured to derive a single path into a four separate subpaths of which two of them are converting paths and the other two are non-converting paths.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can also be configured to determine a conversion path count for a given path type.
- the conversion path count indicates a number of times a given path has resulted in a conversion at the website.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can determine a separate conversion path count for each path type. Moreover, the conversion probability determination module 130 can also be configured to determine a total path count for a given path type. The total path count indicates a number of times a given path has resulted in a conversion or failed to result in a conversion. The conversion probability determination module 130 can determine a separate total path count for each given path type.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can be configured to calculate, for each of the path types, a conversion probability indicating a likelihood of conversion of a particular path type.
- the conversion probability can be based on the ratio of the conversion path count of the given path type to the total path count of the same path type.
- the conversion probability determination module 130 can be configured to use or share the conversion probability of one or more path types to calculate counterfactual gains for events included in the path type and to determine attribution credits for each of the events included in the path type.

- the data processing system can identify one or more subpaths associated with each of the identified plurality of paths (BLOCK 710).
- a subpath is a path corresponding to a previous visit of the visitor to the website.
- a path 'Paid Search' - 'Email' - 'Referral' that results in a conversion can be associated with two subpaths 'Paid Search' and 'Paid Search - 'Email'.
- the data processing system can treat the identified subpaths as paths for the purposes of counting a number of converting paths and a number of non-converting paths.
- the data processing system can determine if a given path or subpath is a converting path or a non-converting path.
- a converting path is a path in which the visitor performs a converting act during the visit that resulted from the last event of the particular path.
- a non-converting path is a path in which the visitor does not perform a converting act during the visit that resulted from the last event of the particular path.

- the conversion probabilities of the path types can help determine attribution credits for various events of a given path type.
- the conversion probabilities of the various path types can be enormous valuable for content selection. For instance, marketers and advertisers can use the conversion probability of a path associated with a visitor identifier to determine a likelihood that the visitor identifier will convert in response to being exposed to a particular type of media exposure. For example, a visitor has previously visited a website twice. The visitor's first visit was through a paid search event and the second visit was through an email event.
- the advertiser can make decisions on whether to serve the visitor a paid search ad based on the visitor's likelihood of conversion for the path "paid search - email - paid search.” In this way, advertisers and marketers can take advantage of the knowledge of conversion probabilities to determine whether to bid on a paid search ad and in some implementations, determine an amount to bid for the paid search ad when participating in an ad placement auction. In another example, if the website publisher knows a visitor's conversion probability, the website publisher can select content to display based on the conversion probability.
- the website publisher can display content relating to products that the visitor may be interested in purchasing. Conversely, if the visitor has a low conversion probability, the website publisher can select content that may convince the visitor to convert, for example, show content that provides an additional discount in an effort to get the visitor to convert.

- the data processing system can be configured to assign attribution credits according to the data-driven attribution model described herein. To do so, the data processing system can receive an indication of a conversion at the website. The data processing system can receive the indication via a script embedded at the website that allows the data processing system 1 10 to identify when a conversion occurs at the website. The data processing system can identify a path associated with the conversion based on the visitor identifier associated with the conversion.

The record can include a position of each event in the path and an amount of attribution credit assigned to each of the events in the path.
- the data processing system 1 10 can then, over a period of time, tally up the recorded information. For instance, the data processing system 1 10 can determine, for a given time period, such as a month, a number of conversions that took place during the given time period and identify records associated with each of those conversions. To calculate the number of conversions assigned to a particular event, such as Paid Search, the data processing system 1 10 can then identify, for each of the conversions that took place in the given time period, the attribution credit assigned to the particular event (Paid Search).

- the data processing system 1 10 can be configured to determine a percentage of weights across various positions of the paths.
- the last event which is the event before the conversion is assigned an index position of 1
- the second last event is assigned an index position of 2, and so forth. As shown in FIG. 9, only the last four events of paths are shown.
- the data processing system 1 10 can determine a position specific aggregate number of conversions. The position specific aggregate number of conversions can be determined by identifying, from the conversions that took place during the given time period, conversions in which the event associated with the particular index position received attribution credit.
- the data processing system 1 10 can then compute the position specific aggregate number of conversions by adding the attribution credits received by the events associated with the particular index position. The data processing system 1 10 can then determine a ratio of the position specific aggregate number of conversions to the total number of conversions assigned to the particular event. [0236] For example, to determine the weighting of conversions for the 'Paid Search' event having an index position of 3, the data processing system 1 10 identifies all conversions that correspond to paths in which the event having an index position of 3 is the 'Paid Search' event. The data processing system 1 10 can then determine, for each of these conversions, the attribution credit assigned to the 'Paid Search' event having the index position of 3.
- the data processing system 1 10 can then determine the position specific aggregate number of conversions for the 'Paid Search' event having the index position of 3 by adding the determined attribution credit assigned to the 'Paid Search' event having the index position of 3 of each of the conversions that correspond to paths in which the event having an index position of 3 is the 'Paid Search' event.
- the data processing system 110 can then determine the ratio of the position specific aggregate number of conversions for the 'Paid Search' event having the index position of 3 to the total number of conversions (shown as 171650 in FIG. 10). The determined ratio is the weighting (12%) of the index position of 3 for the event 'Paid Search'.

- the attribution data display module 138 can be configured to identify a plurality of paths taken by visitors to perform a converting act, such as visiting a webpage, making a purchase at a particular website, subscribing to a service, providing an email address, or any other action that is identified as a converting act.
- a path corresponds to a sequence of events.
- the event corresponds to an interaction between the visitor and a media exposure, for example, a click on a paid search ad, an email ad, a social networking post, or entering a web address of the website in a web browser.
- the attribution data display module 138 or some other module of the data processing system 110 can be configured to identify the plurality of paths. In some implementation

- the advertiser can submit the request for attribution data via a user interface.
- Each event can correspond to one or more channels. Each event can be classified under a particular channel based on the type of event. In one example, events can result in a visitor visiting a particular webpage. Examples of channels can include paid search, display, referral, organic search, direct, social network, amongst others. Events corresponding to the paid search channel can include any event in which a visitor visits the webpage in response to taking an action on a paid search result. Events corresponding to the display channel can include any event in which a visitor visits the webpage in response to taking an action on a display ad. Events corresponding to the referral channel can include any event in which a visitor visits the webpage in response to taking an action on a referral link.
- Events corresponding to the organic search channel can include any event in which a visitor visits the webpage in response to performing a search and taking an action on a search result.
- Events corresponding to the direct channel can include any event in which a visitor visits the webpage in response to directly visiting the webpage, for example, by entering the URL of the webpage in the address bar of a browser.
- Events corresponding to the social network channel can include any event in which a visitor visits the webpage in response to taking an action on a social network. It should be appreciated that the granularity of these channels can be increased or decreased.
- the social network channel can be defined more granularly by having separate channels for different social networks, for example, Facebook, Twitter, Google +, and Linkedin, among others.
- the request can identify one or more parameters for which the attribution data is to be shown. In some implementations, the request can identify one or more parameter values. Each event can also correspond to parameter data corresponding to one or more parameters associated with the event. In some implementations, each event can be associated with one or more parameters. Parameters can be based on the occurrence of the event. For example, an event can have a position-based parameter that indicates a position along the path at which the event was performed. For instance, for a converting path, the converting event can be the last event. In some implementations, an event that does not result in a conversion can have a position relative to the converting event.
- a data driven attribution model may assign a majority of the attribution credit across the last four events of a converting path. Another parameter can be based on the time of the occurrence of the event relative to the converting event. In some implementations, events happening within 24 hours of the converting event are likely to be assigned a majority of the attribution credit, while events occurring more than 24 hours prior to the converting act are likely to be assigned a minority, if any, of the attribution credit. Details of how the attribution credit is assigned for each event in a sequence have been described above.
- the request can be a request to view attribution data corresponding to a weighting of attribution credit across a plurality of positions for each channel that received attribution credit. In some implementations, the request can be a request to view attribution data corresponding to a weighting of attribution credit across a plurality of positions for channels specified in the request. In some implementations, the request can be a request to view attribution data corresponding to a weighting of attribution credit across a plurality of positions for channels that receive an attribution credit that is greater than a predetermined threshold. In some implementations, the request can be a request to view attribution data corresponding to a weighting of attribution credit across a plurality of positions for channels that are assigned attribution credits that exceed a predetermined threshold.

- the attribution data display module 138 can identify, for each path of the plurality of paths, each of the events and one or more parameter values associated with parameters of the event.
- the attribution data display module 138 can identify parameter values associated with a particular parameter based on the request to display attribution data corresponding to a particular parameter. For instance, if the request corresponds to attribution data based on positions of the events, the attribution data display module 138 can identify, for each event of each path, position data associated with the event.
- the attribution data display module 138 can identify the following event-parameter pairs: i) Organic Search - Position 2; ii) Referral - Position 1 ; and iii) Display - Position 0, where the Position 2 corresponds to 2 events prior to the converting event and Position 1 corresponds to 1 event prior to the converting event.
- the attribution data display module 138 can identify the following event-parameter pairs: i) Organic Search - Time 22; ii) Referral - Time 5; and iii) Display - Time 0, where the Time 22 corresponds to the Organic Search event occurring 22 hours prior to the converting event and Time 5 corresponds to the Referral event occurring 5 hours prior to the converting event.

In particular, in some implementations, the total number of conversions for the channel can be determined by aggregating the attribution credits assigned to events included in the candidate paths that can be classified under the channel.
- the attribution data display module 138 can then identify those events in the candidate paths that have a parameter value that matches the parameter value of the event-parameter pair. The attribution data display module 138 then determines the weighting for the identified event- parameter pair based on a ratio of the sum of the attribution credits assigned to events included in the candidate paths that have the parameter value that matches the parameter value of the event- parameter pair to the total number of conversions of the channel under which the event can be classified.

- the attribution data display module 138 can aggregate the attribution credits for each of those Organic Search events that were performed two events prior to the converting event.
- the aggregate attribution credit corresponds to the event-parameter pair Organic Search - Position 2.
- the weighting of each of the event-parameter pairs is based on the aggregate of the attribution credits assigned to the events regardless of their parameter values. Stated in another way, the aggregate of the attribution credits assigned to the events regardless of their parameter values is the total attribution credits assigned to events of a particular channel. In some implementations, the attribution data display module 138 determines the weighting of an event-parameter pair by determining the ratio of the aggregate attribution credit of the event- parameter pair to the total attribution credits assigned to events of a particular channel. [0253] The attribution data display module 138 can provide, for display, a visual object including an indicator corresponding to the determined weighting for at least one of the event- parameter pairs.

- events that took place three events prior to the converting event were, on average, attributed 12% of the attribution credit, while the remaining 82% was attributed across other events at other positions along the path.

- a visual color scale 940 can indicate a weighting level based on the intensity of the color of the visual objects or items. In some implementations, a darker color indicates a greater weighting than a less dark color.
- the user interface 900 is based on all paths as shown in the selectable input field 950.
- the paths across which to determine the attribution data can be modified by selecting a different option using the input field 950. For instance, if an option to only view paths from the last week is selected, the attribution data will be displayed based on paths that include a converting event within the last week.
- the visual object 902 displays attribution data across various positions in the path, the visual object 902 can display attribution data based on when events were performed relative to the converting event.
