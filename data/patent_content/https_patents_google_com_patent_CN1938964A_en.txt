Embodiment
In general, according to these different embodiment, talker arbitration is functional dynamically to be moved between each network element, postpones so that may reduce PTT.According to this embodiment, so functional can between each dispatch service device, moving.In a preferred embodiment, talker arbitration is functional can move to a wireless mobile of given phone group and influenced by it.
According to an embodiment, and after the PTT radio communication that is used for phone group was initiated, preferable methods was considered at least one possible follow-up PTT communication requirement of this phone group automatically, and the corresponding judgement of at least one this respect is provided thus.This judgement is provided for the basis of automatic recognition network position, to support the talker arbitration that is used for the PTT communication requirement of this phone group.
Assessment to the possible follow-up PTT communication requirement of phone group can be based on various criterions, these criterions include but not limited to: the sign of the current mobile radio station that transmits, the sign of the current mobile radio station that receives, and the item of all kinds of environmental informations of relevant this phone group.Can including but not limited to of such environmental information: corresponding to the voice identification result of at least one side's of PTT radio communication analysis, which mobile radio station of judging this phone group may comprise the presider of discussion, user's operation of mobile radio station, the historical information of PTT radio communication, the most frequent promoter's of PTT communication sign, at least one member's of this phone group geographical position, and the existence of other services of using simultaneously or do not exist, or the like, do not enumerate one by one.
Functional by setting in advance talker arbitration, such preparation may be avoided very big delay.In many cases, can in than possible usually now time less time, permit being notified to the user to conversation.For example, in multi-server system, may select in the functional server that is arranged on the more approaching most possible mobile radio station of next time confirming to start PTT or a plurality of mobile radio stations of talker arbitration (with regard to " delay " with regard to, apart from or other propagation problem and phenomenon may be influential factor).
For example, at group call or in calling out one to one, one side is in San Francisco, and the opposing party is in the Washington DC, and wherein the dispatch service device is all arranged in two cities, can determine the talker arbitration ability is placed on the server in the city of the mobile radio station that has just received last audio section, perhaps can determine the talker arbitration ability is placed in the city at the current place of most of sides in this phone group.
Referring now to accompanying drawing,, particularly Fig. 1 supports the suitable platform 10 of this flexible way to generally include processing platform 11 and corresponding memory 12.In a preferred embodiment, store PTT talker arbitration instruction (as doing programming) in the memory 12 at least so that processing platform 11 can influence the talker arbitration task.Processing platform 11 itself comprises that mechanism is used for activating and use PTT arbitration instruction, for example, the detection of response predetermined condition, predetermined condition for example can be trigger event or condition.By such preparation, processing platform 11 can be selected to be used to use this PTT arbitration instruction to come the arbitration PTT communication for one or more phone groups.
Can such processing platform 11 be set according to the mode that is fit to given demands of applications.For example, according to an embodiment, processing platform 11 can constitute the part of dispatch service device.According to additional embodiments, this device 10 can constitute the Push to talk over Cellular mobile radio station.When being fit to this embodiment, certainly comprise other key element, assembly and functional by suitable manner or additive method well known in the art.As an explanation of this point, when these device 10 formation Push to talk over Cellular mobile radio stations, but processing platform 11 operational coupled are to radio receiving-transmitting unit 13 (this also is that those skilled in the art are intelligible).
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that processing platform 11 can comprise programmable platform complete or part, perhaps can comprise how hardwired special fixing device, can satisfy given demands of applications and designing requirement best like this.Should also be appreciated that, functional realization of processing platform 11 can be by the platform that uses integrated special purpose, the integrated versatile platform of supporting other functions, perhaps distributed multi-platform enforcement is wherein carried out the functional part of talker arbitration by each corresponding actual discrete entity.Should be appreciated that by similar mode, memory 12 can be formed in the entity (as suggestion in this diagram) that physically separates with processing platform, perhaps can constitute its whole part.Be also to be understood that memory 12 can constitute single key element or formation comprises a plurality of distributed entities of discrete key element physically.And,, be also to be understood that memory 12 can or can be positioned at long-range by corresponding this processing platform physically near processing platform 11 by similar mode.It all is well known in the art that these and other structure and preparation are selected, and does not need to be described in further detail.
When such preparation, one or more network elements in given communication system (comprising a plurality of dispatch service devices and mobile radio station itself) optionally provide the service of PTT talker arbitration, are used for for example being supported in the PTT communication of being carried out between the member of given phone group.
Referring to Fig. 2, the method 20 of effectively using this device 10 (or any other can carry out the platform or the preparation of compatible operation) will be discussed.After initiating PTT phone group radio communication, preferably carry out this method 20 in major part at least.For example, current member's allocation activities wireless channel to PTT phone group is to support that (for example, those skilled in the art understand to its each member of phone group, phone group can comprise two or more mobile radio stations) the PTT radio communication, can carry out method 20 during this period.
Method 20 can automatically be considered at least one possible follow-up PTT communication requirement of this phone group, allows to provide at least one corresponding judgement thus.This consideration can comprise various factors and/or criterion.For example, this consideration can comprise the current PTT of automatic identification signal post towards at least one mobile radio station.This can comprise the consideration that comes in handy, because of current signal post towards one can be to be considered to can be willing to next respond this current communication.This causes corresponding judgement conversely again, and this recipient's this may the action represented follow-up PTT communication requirement, and this recipient can be next side who seeks distributing radio resource like this.
Other consideration can also be arranged certainly.For example, one or more of the environmental information of relevant this phone group can be considered.The environmental information that comes in handy includes but not limited to:
● corresponding to the voice identification result of at least one side's of PTT radio communication analysis (for example, the individual's that the identification active user talks just with it name, this detected name can be associated with user name and moving station mark symbol like this, helps the next possible talker of identification thus);
● which mobile radio station of determining this phone group may comprise discussion presider's (because of the presider that may expect to discuss at least in some cases talks more continually than other participants);
● which mobile radio station of determining this phone group comprises the originating mobile station (originating mobile) of this PTT radio communication;
● user's operation (for example, the grasping of the mobile phone of ad hoc fashion or remote microphone (available various mechanism well known in the art detect) may be the early stage indication that is intended to confirm to start ptt button) of mobile radio station;
● PTT radio communication historical information (for example, discern specific mobile radio station and/or user, in given in the past phone group than other mobile radio stations and/or the often more frequent communication of user);
● discern promoter's (for example, by corresponding statistics) of the most frequent PTT communication with reference to historical and/or current accumulation;
● at least one member's of this phone group geographical position (can utilize global positioning system or other location technologies to determine); And/or
● the existence of other current uses services or do not exist, for example.
● the type of previous PTT communication and length (for example, if previous PTT communication does not comprise any audio content or so-called call alerts, can be thought then that next PTT incident is unlikely to be sent by this recipient.
● the current state of this target (target), that in talk, exist or non-existent by inferring, for example, from the schedule programof meeting of this target;
● member's quantity in this PTT phone group (for example, when a bigger group being provided service, because relevant probabilistic increase of accurately discerning possible next talker, assigns talk person's arbitration function may be of no use).
● RF is congested, frame erasure rate or resulting link speed (for example, in grouping busy, next mobile radio station A and B might confirm to start PTT equally, can be by the functional mobile radio station with High Data Rate and better RF condition that is placed in of talker arbitration is broken this relation; Except other benefit, this can reduce the system delay amount, when not being that A or B but third party this delay can take place when next confirming to start PTT.Because therefore such strategy can respond other mobile radio station to the functional mobile radio station with more superior communication condition that is placed in of talker arbitration than the mobile radio station with the link of higher frame erasure rate experience low bit rate quickly).
Usually, the one or more members that can be used for assessing phone group may can constitute the suitable basis of this consideration at least a portion at the available information of the request PTT communication resource in the recent period.Can also select or select in advance the use of specific consideration criterion according to static or dynamic trigger, as according to the life period of the time in every day, phone group's sign, available information etc.And, can also whether available with reflection information about responsive relatively importance, confidence level or accuracy etc. to available information weighting (particularly when considering a plurality of information types or information source).
The criterion of same these classes can be used for influencing or controlling other sequence problem.For example, to next confirm to start PTT when thinking that owing to any this class reason this target is unlikely, then after the time interval shorter than the time interval that may distribute by other means, this talker arbitration is functional can to return back to the dispatch service device from this target mobile radio station.
As other example, such criterion can also be used to influence the functional distribution of talker arbitration and be delayed timing how long; Usually, if know this user can make a speech (thefloor is open) before this target have short delay or can ask to make a speech and all have short delay up to this user, this delay is preferably shorter.For example, long broadcast buffer memory (this can by the radio frequency conditions that comprises decay etc. various situations cause) before can causing this target to be known can making a speech than long delay.
Method 20 is discerned (step 22) network site automatically with according to (at least in part) this corresponding talker arbitration of judging the PTT communication requirement of supporting to be used for this phone group then.As already explained, according to this embodiment, this network site can constitute one or more infrastructure elements, as dispatch service device and/or mobile radio station (preferably including the one or more mobile radio stations that constitute current a support phone group part).For example, discerned the current communication target that is used for current PTT communication when the front, this method 20 can help to discern this communication target, supports talker arbitration (the special benefit of this decision-making describes in detail below) subsequently.
According to this embodiment, method 20 can be provided with the delay of wanting (step 23) then alternatively.That is, method 20 can postpone the follow-up automatic distribution to the talker arbitration function of institute recognition network position intentionally.For example, this delay can be the time quantum of determining, perhaps can be (according to the ability and the demand of given enforcement) dynamically determined.At this timing period intentionally, if wish that method 20 can be carried out other processing.For example, method 20 can detect at this timing period whether one or more specified conditions of being paid close attention to take place, and when this class of generation is paid close attention to condition really, discern (may be new) network site automatically again, to support the talker arbitration demand of this phone group.For example, a kind of possible concern condition is whether the mobile radio station that the front has just sent seeks to initiate follow-up PTT radio communication again at once.In this environment, allow the functional current location of staying of talker arbitration may be better in some cases.
According to this embodiment, the network site that this method 20 distributes (step 24) to discern then automatically is used for the talker arbitration of this phone group with support.Such distribution can take place by variety of way.As an example, can indicate at least one the explicit message of this distribution to send the network site of being discerned to.As another example, can come the signal of this distribution of indication is sent to the position of being discerned by more implicit mode.For example, this signal can comprise the transmission end signal, as usually finishing by what finish its PTT transmission that mobile radio station sends.It is functional to activate talker arbitration that this end of transmission signal is also pass on triggering message to the mobile radio station of suitable preparation in addition.Under the situation about being fit to during, also can use other control strategies and transmission equipment and/or signal maybe when needs.
Referring to Fig. 3, given mobile radio station method 30 will respond and for example receive at least one and judge that as the first above-mentioned prearranged signals (step 31) activates this talker arbitration functional (signal can comprise that to activate talker arbitration such as end of transmission signal or more explicit instruction functional).Do not having under the situation of this instruction, typically, at this moment mobile radio station is waited and is finished this consideration (step 32) and continue its common processing.As long as useful and relevant with given mobile radio station, can repeat this judgement, as understood by the skilled person to the operating environment of giving fixed system.
When this mobile radio station decision activation talker arbitration ability, this mobile radio station is that its phone group activates talker arbitration ability (step 33).This means that this mobile radio station is this specific phone group execution talker arbitration function.By coming suitably dynamically to be provided with this function in such a way, and as following illustrated, can reduce greatly usually in this system and initiate the time of delay that the PTT radio communication is associated.
In a preferred embodiment, this method 30 also can adapt to the deactivation (step 34) of talker arbitration ability.Make the talker arbitration function transfer to other network site according to above-mentioned instruction again like this.Can respond various operating conditions and carry out this deactivation (deactivation).For example, this deactivation of can programming takes place when receiving next end of transmission signal automatically.As another example, this deactivation can when receiving the deactivation signal, mobile radio station take place.
Referring to Fig. 4, will the illustrative example of the part of compatible PTT communication session be described.This simple example begins to utilize first mobile radio station to receive PTT communication from second mobile radio station.During second mobile radio station rises period 41 of this transmission, support this little phone group communication requirement dispatch service device identification as this transmission recipient's first mobile radio station and and then identification as first mobile radio station of next network element, be used for the talker arbitration function of this phone group with support.Finish its transmission when second mobile radio station, second mobile radio station rises by the transmission end signal 42 of this dispatch service device reception, as understood by the skilled person.Then (perhaps after the aforesaid optional delay period 43, so that the easier and effective for example recent new PTT transmission demand of second mobile radio station that adapts to), this dispatch service device transmits talker arbitration transfer signal 44 to first mobile radio station, for example is recited above.
When receiving this talker arbitration transfer signal 44, as mentioned above, first mobile radio station activates its talker arbitration ability.First mobile radio station also provides transmission end indicator 45 (for example, many this mobile radio stations provide unique audio sound to indicate a transmission side to finish its transmission) to the user of first mobile radio station.Confirmed to start ptt button 46, the first mobile radio stations and begun its channel acquisition/conversation admission process when detecting this user.This comprises to talker arbitration person provides corresponding call request, as the common way in this area.But in this example, the talker arbitration function is current to be supported by first mobile radio station.Like this, talker arbitration person can receive and respond the call request of first mobile radio station, and this lacks a lot than the employed time in the common way.For example, carrying out this processing need be up to 700 milliseconds time, for example, as whole arbitrated procedure, provides to the user that " conversation " designator 47 is actual to be finished at once, in this example, and only need be less than 100 milliseconds.
Then, the user of first mobile radio station can use the communication resource/permission that is distributed to support desirable audio transmission 48 by usual method.
When coming assigns talk person's arbitration function according to above-mentioned, can not know for sure usually next user's the sign of this PTT communication resource of this system.For example, in the illustrative example that has just illustrated, second mobile radio station (or be different from this phone group other mobile radio stations of first mobile radio station) may be a next mobile radio station of seeking transfer resource.When such situation takes place, continue with reference to the example that has just illustrated, first mobile radio station will directly be carried out the talker arbitration function for this mobile radio station of making request.
In order to illustrate, and referring to Fig. 5, second mobile radio station may be to experience ptt button by its each user to confirm to start first mobile radio station of 51.Second mobile radio station will send call request 51A to the dispatch service device then.The latter can carry out in suitable memory resource and search (52), with identification talker arbitration person's current location (as the replacement of suboptimum, each mobile radio station that the dispatch service device can be generally investigated in this phone group is discerned current talking person arbitrator).In this example, therefore the dispatch service device can discern first mobile radio station as current talking person arbitrator.Like this, the dispatch service device is forwarded to first mobile radio station to call request 51B.
First mobile radio station is handled (53) this call request according to its talker arbitration programming and ability then.In this example, competitive call request more early or other modes, so this talker arbitration platform (i.e. first mobile radio station) will send and permit 54A, transmit this permission 54B to the second mobile radio station by the dispatch service device.The latter transmits its audio-frequency information 55 to first mobile radio stations then, and when finishing this transmission, sends end of transmission signal 56A, by the dispatch service device this signal 56B is forwarded to first mobile radio station.
When such preparation, can see that the talker arbitration person who is used for phone group of this flexible positioning even Kinematic Positioning is functional needn't excessively damage unexpected communication requirement.Especially, under the prerequisite of the functional flexible setting of talker arbitration, actual conflict communication requirement still can the processed and support by effective and efficient manner.
In some cases, it is functional to wish or be more suitable for to reorientate talker arbitration from the mobile radio station of such distribution.Referring to Fig. 6, as mentioned above, the deactivation signal 61 of appropriate characteristics and/or predetermined activity (or non-activity) window 62 can be used for carrying out the transfer 63 of this talker arbitration function from this mobile radio station.For example, this mobile radio station can send message and notifies the deactivation of this talker arbitration function and/or for example send spendable programming itself to the dispatch service device.As other example (not shown), first mobile radio station can send message and notify the transfer of this talker arbitration function to other position such as other mobile radio station.
These examples and situation are illustrative, be not the exhaustive of various different modes, in these different modes, according to the instruction here, can realize talker arbitration functional about given phone group each member and/or support or help the flexible positioning of key element of the infrastructure of such phone group's communication.
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, under the premise without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, can carry out various modifications, replacement and combination to described embodiment, and this modification, replacement and combination should be considered to be within the scope of the principle of the invention.For example, when the different referee methods of a plurality of dispatch service device seating surfaces to its mobile radio station of serving, like this when making a speech by the mobile radio station of given server service, it will use the speech control method of this this locality, and this may cause the problem of the speech control method that outskirt mobile radio station expectation use is different.In this case, when at present having control and this identical mobile radio station is made the speech control request by the mobile radio station of outskirt server service, can prepare and arrange its server that this speech control method is converted to suitable speech control method, and the request through conversion is forwarded to this outskirt server, is used for as above-mentioned arbitration.
Those skilled in the art be also to be understood that the instruction here also generally is applicable to other forms of communication, wherein uses the mechanism of class speech control, for example:
Push away and broadcast video call (push to video call) (wherein video content replaces above-mentioned audio content);
Push away to broadcast and watch or image is called out (push-to-see or photo call) (wherein transmitted image or other data files but not sound);
Interconnect call full duplex audio call (wherein provides method to set up full duplex audio call between the user more quickly; In such example, when setting up full-duplex link, the flexible positioning of the controlled function that can not need to make a speech);
Text message and text chat, the controlling mechanism of wherein making a speech usually are very important.
