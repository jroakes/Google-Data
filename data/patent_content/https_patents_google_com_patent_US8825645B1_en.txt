Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to information retrieval and, more particularly, to automated techniques for judging the quality of a document.
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Search engines assist users in locating desired portions of this information by cataloging web pages. Typically, in response to a user's request, the search engine returns references to documents relevant to the request.
- Search engines may base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to identify links to high quality relevant results based on the search query.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web documents. Web documents that contain the user's search terms are considered “hits” and are returned to the user.
- One technique for determining the quality of a web page is based on more than the content of the web page. This technique assigns a degree of quality to a web page based on the link structure of the web.
- One aspect consistent with the principles of the invention is directed to a method that includes identifying a plurality of linked documents and assigning ranking scores to the linked documents.
- the ranking scores are based on the links between the documents and based on affiliation among the documents.
- Another aspect includes a device for assigning ranking scores to documents that quantify a quality of the documents.
- the device includes a collection of linked documents and a set location component to identify affiliations among documents in the collection of linked documents.
- the device further includes a ranking component that assigns the ranking scores to the documents in the collection based on the links between the documents and based on the identified affiliations among the documents.
- Yet another aspect is directed to a search system that includes a search engine to locate a set of documents from a corpus of documents that are relevant to a user search query.
- the search engine returns the set of documents to the user in an order based on ranking scores associated with the documents in the set of documents.
- a ranking component computes the ranking scores based on the links between documents in the corpus of documents and based on affiliation among the documents.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary overview of assigning ranking scores consistent with aspects of the invention
- FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a network in which systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may be implemented;
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of a client or server, shown in FIG. 2 , according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an implementation of a ranking component, shown in FIG. 2 , in additional detail;
- FIG. 5 is diagram illustrating an exemplary corpus of documents classified into affiliated sets
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating operation of the ranking component consistent with aspects of the invention.
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating operations for calculating ranking scores consistent with an aspect of the invention.
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating operations for calculating ranking scores consistent with an alternate aspect of the invention.
- FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary implementation of the ranking component in the context of an Internet search engine.
- a ranking component ranks documents, such as web pages or web sites, to obtain a ranking score that defines a quality judgment of the document.
- the ranking score of a particular document is based on the ranking score of the documents which link to it and takes into account affiliation between documents.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary overview of assigning ranking scores consistent with aspects of the inventions.
- FIG. 1 in which three documents 101 - 103 link to another document 110 (links between the documents are shown as lines).
- Each of documents 101 - 103 and 110 is authored by the same entity (author “A”).
- document 104 authored by entity “B,” and document 105 , authored by entity “C”, also link to document 110 .
- the quality ranking score assigned to document 110 should probably be at least the same as or similar to the ranking score of document 101 .
- knowing the ranking score of document 101 can be useful in setting a lower bound on the quality of other pages (e.g., document 110 ) that are pointed to by document 101 .
- additional links by the same author such as the links from documents 102 and 103 , should not excessively raise the ranking score of document 110 .
- document 110 is linked to by the three documents 101 - 103 , does not necessarily mean that document 110 is three times the quality of documents 101 - 103 .
- Documents 104 and 105 may be independently authored and unaffiliated with documents 101 - 103 .
- the individual endorsements (i.e., links) to document 110 , from documents 104 and 105 may be viewed as complimenting each other.
- the ranking score contributed by documents 104 and 105 to document 110 may deserve to be handled differently than the ranking scores contributed by documents 101 - 103 .
- the portion of the final ranking score for document 110 may be based on a function that produces a value proportional to a Maximum operator applied to the ranking scores of affiliated sets of documents and a Sum operator applied to non-affiliated documents.
- FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a network 200 in which systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention may be implemented.
- Network 200 may include multiple clients 210 connected to one or more servers 220 via a network 240 .

- Clients 210 and server 220 may connect to network 240 via wired, wireless, or optical connections.
- server 220 may implement a search engine usable by clients 210 .
- the search engine in response to a client request, the search engine returns resources, such as web pages, to the client. These resources may be scored and displayed in an order influenced by ranking scores calculated consistent with aspects of the invention.
- the ranking scores may be pre-calculated via a ranking component 225 .
- ranking component 225 generates ranking scores that relate to an objective measure of document quality. The operation of ranking component 225 will be described in more detail below.
- a document is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may be an e-mail, a blog, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, etc.
- a common document is a web page. Web pages often include content and may include embedded information (such as meta information, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as Javascript, etc.).
- FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of a client 210 or server 220 according to an implementation consistent with the principles of the invention.
- Client/server 210 / 220 may include a bus 310 , a processor 320 , a main memory 330 , a read only memory (ROM) 340 , a storage device 350 , one or more input devices 360 , one or more output devices 370 , and a communication interface 380 .

- hardwired circuitry or other logic may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the present invention.
- implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an implementation of ranking component 225 in additional detail.
- Ranking component 225 may include a set location component 405 and a rank computation component 410 .
- the documents on which ranking component 225 operates may be stored in a database 415 .
- Database 415 may be implemented in many different forms, such as a distributed database, a relational database, and so on. In one implementation, database 415 is generated from web documents downloaded from the world wide web.
- Set location component 405 may analyze the documents in database 415 and group the documents into sets of related documents. In one implementation, set location component 405 groups documents based on the affiliation of documents with one another. Set location component 405 may automatically arrange documents in sets based on one or more of a number of possible factors. For example, the determination of affiliation can be based on the link graph structure of the documents, traffic patterns to the documents, or similarity of features such as the hostname or the IP address of the documents. As another example, in the context of the web, the link graph structure of the documents can be used to measure affiliation between web documents based on the strength of the linkage between web sites hosting the documents. Additionally, traffic patterns on the web can be used to detect affiliation between web documents that are visited by many users in the same session. Still further, the IP addresses of two web servers can be compared and if the leading two or three components (octets) of the ID address are identical, affiliation can be inferred.
- the determination of affiliation can be based on the link graph structure of the documents, traffic patterns to the documents,
- FIG. 5 is diagram illustrating an exemplary corpus of documents classified into affiliated sets.
- Documents 501 - 509 (shown as circles) can be thought of as forming a network graph in which the documents are connected by their links. When the documents are web pages, the links may be in the form of hyperlinks.
- lines with arrows are used to indicate links.
- a line originating from a first document and leading to a second document may be called a forward or outbound link relative to the first document and indicate that the first document is a linking document.
- a line originating from the second document and leading to the first document may be called a backward or inbound link relative to the first document and indicate that the first document is a linked document.
- Document 501 for example, has a single outbound link leading to document 502 and three inbound links originating from documents 502 , 503 , and 506 .
- set location component 405 may determine that certain documents are affiliated with one another.
- Sets of affiliated documents are shown as enclosed in dashed circles 510 and 515 .
- documents 501 , 502 , and 503 are illustrated as being affiliated with one another.
- documents 504 , 505 , 506 , and 507 are illustrated as being affiliated with one another.
- Affiliation is illustrated in FIG. 5 as a binary concept in which a document is either in an affiliated set or not in an affiliated set. More generally, however, in some implementations, affiliation may be considered to be a continuous state. In these implementations, affiliated sets, such as sets 510 and 515 , may be associated with a measure of affiliation. For example, the documents in set 510 may be strongly affiliated (e.g., if they are all on the same host) while the documents in set 515 , although still affiliated, may be considered to be more weakly affiliated (e.g., if the affiliation evidence is weak).
- rank computation component 410 may generate ranking scores based on both link information (i.e., illustrated by lines in FIG. 4 ) and affiliation between documents. The operation of rank component 410 will now be described in more detail.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating operation of ranking component 410 consistent with aspects of the invention.
- set location component 405 may define sets of affiliated documents (act 601 ). The sets may be automatically defined, as discussed above.
- Ranking component 410 may then calculate ranking scores for the documents (act 602 ).
- the calculation of the ranking scores is an iterative process, and ranking component 410 may re-calculate the ranking scores for the documents based on the previously calculated ranking scores (acts 602 and 603 ). That is, each pass in calculating the ranks may change the ranking score from the previous pass.
- a seed ranking score may be defined for some or all of the documents in order to implement the iterative technique.
- Ranking component 410 may continue to repeat the calculation of the ranking scores in act 602 until the ranks have sufficiently converged (act 603 ). “Sufficiently converged” can be determined when the ranks generally stop changing, within a certain error tolerance, from one pass to the next. Typically, sets of documents may converge within about 50 iterations.
- the ranking scores may then be normalized to obtain a final ranking score for each document (act 604 ).
- FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating operations for calculating ranking scores, as performed in act 602 , consistent with an aspect of the invention.
- the affiliated sets are defined using the binary model. That is, documents are classified as either being in an affiliated set or the document is not affiliated. All affiliated sets are considered to have an equal measure of affiliation.
- Ranking component 410 may begin by calculating a contribution value, CONTRIB(D), for each document D as: RankingScore( D )/Out D ( D ), (Eq. 1)
- RankingScore(D) is the ranking score of the document computed in the previous iteration (or the assigned seed value) and OutD(D) (outdegree) is the number of outbound links from the document (act 701 ).
- Ranking component 410 may next calculate a second value, SETCONTRIB(S), for each set S of documents as: MAX[CONTRIB( D 1 ),CONTRIB( D 2 ), . . . ,CONTRIB( D N )], (Eq. 2) where MAX defines the Maximum operator (i.e., the maximum value of the listed values) and D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D N represents each document 1 through Nin set S (act 702 ).
- a set may contain one or more documents. Referring to FIG. 5 , for example, four sets are illustrated—set 510 and 515 , as well as the “sets” defined by documents 508 and 509 .
- CONTRIB for this document may be calculated as the ranking score for this document from the previous iteration divided by the three outbound links (to documents 505 , 506 , and 508 ) from this document.
- the value of SETCONTRIB associated with this document would be the calculated value of CONTRIB if CONTRIB is greater than the value of CONTRIB or documents 504 - 506 ; otherwise it would be the largest CONTRIB value for documents 504 - 506 .
- the ranking scores for the documents may be computed from the SETCONTRIB values as
- RankingScore(X) is the ranking score of document X, ⁇ and ⁇ are constants, and the sum is taken over the m sets that contain documents that link to document X.
- m would be two (set 515 and the set defined by document 508 ).
- a may be set to 0.1 and ⁇ may be set to 0.9.
- the ranking scores calculated by ranking component 410 using equations (1)-(3) are based on the link structure of the documents and on a binary measure of affiliation between the documents. Although the operations of rank component 410 were described in a particular order, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the operations could be performed in a different order or simultaneously.
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating operations for calculating ranking scores, as performed in act 602 , consistent with an alternate aspect of the invention.
- the affiliated sets are defined using a continuous model.
- a degree of affiliation parameter, ⁇ may be used to measure affiliation, where ⁇ is in the range [0 . . . 1].
- a ⁇ value of zero signifies complete affiliation and ⁇ of 1 signifies complete independence.
- Ranking component 410 may begin by calculating the contribution value, CONTRIB(D), for each document D as calculated in equation (1) (act 801 ). Ranking component 410 may next calculate SETCONTRIB(S), for each set S of documents, using a modified version of SETCONTRIB that takes ⁇ into account. More particularly, ranking component 410 may calculate, for each set S, that has a corresponding value of ⁇ i , SETCONTRIB(S i , ⁇ i ) as: (CONTRIB( D 1 ) a i +CONTRIB( D 2 ) a i + . . . +CONTRIB( D k ) a i ) 1/a i , (Eq. 4) where
- e is assigned the value 0.05.
- the ranking scores for the documents may be computed from the SETCONTRIB values as
- RankingScore(X) is the ranking score of document X, ⁇ and ⁇ are constants, and the sum is taken over the m sets that contain documents that link to document X.
- the ranking scores calculated by rank computation component 410 using equations (4)-(6) are based on the link structure of the documents and on a continuous measure of affiliation between the documents.
- equation (4) tends towards the Maximum function.
- CONTRIB(D) for a document D may be defined as
- RankingScore ( D ) MAX ⁇ ( 1 , Out ⁇ D ⁇ ( D ) - THRESHOLD ) , ( Eq . ⁇ 7 ) where THRESHOLD is set to a predetermined value, such as 10. This implementation tends to move the calculation of the ranking scores from a stochastic model to a voting model, where for pages with medium to low links, every endorsement link carries the full weight of the source page.
- nodes may operate on groups of one or more documents (“nodes”).
- a node may refer to a web site, each of which may contain one or more web pages.
- An affiliated set of nodes may be, for example, nodes that are under control of a common entity.
- FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary implementation of ranking component 225 with an Internet search engine.
- a number of users 905 may connect to a search engine 910 over a network 915 , such as the Internet.
- Search engine 910 may be a traditional search engine that returns a ranked set of documents related to a user query.
- Search engine 910 may be a general search engine, such as one based on all documents from a large collection, such as documents on the web, or a more specialized search engine, such as a news search engine.
- search engine 910 may be implemented over a specialized corpus of documents, such as a corporate document database made available over a corporate network 915 .
- search engine 910 may receive a user query and generate a list of documents that contain the terms of the user query. Search engine 910 may sort the documents in the list based on a number of factors, including the ranking scores computed for each of the documents in the list. The ranking scores may be generated by ranking component 225 using the above described techniques. In one implementation, the ranking scores may be generated ahead of time and stored in database 920 . Search engine 910 may then simply look-up the ranking score of any particular document in database 920 .
