User's set 106 is electronic installations of being controlled by user, and can ask and receive resource 105 by network 102.The example of user's set 106 comprises personal computer, mobile communications device and other devices that can transmit and receive data by network 102.User's set 106 generally includes the user of being convenient to transmit and receive data by network 102 and applies, for example web browser.
User's set 106 can be asked the resource 105 from website 104.Conversely, the data that represent resource 105 can be offered to user's set 106, for being presented by user's set 106.The data that represent resource 105 can comprise the data that are used to specify the part of the resource that wherein can present advertisement or the part (for example, the position of appearing of pop-up window or the position of appearing in the position of webpage) of user's demonstration.These specified portions that resource 105 or user show are called location advertising.
For ease of search, by the addressable ample resources 105 of network 102, environment 100 can comprise search system 112, and it carrys out recognition resource 105 by the resource 105 capturing and index provides on website 104.Can the resource 105 based on data correlation come index about the data of resource 105.Alternatively, the index copy of resource 105 and (optionally) cached copy are stored in search index (not shown).
User's set 106 can be submitted search inquiry to search system 112 by network 102.As response, search system 112 access search index, to identify the resource relevant to search inquiry 105.In an illustrative embodiment, search inquiry comprises one or more keywords.Search system 112 identification is in response to the resource 105 of inquiry, provide the information about this resource 105 with the form of Search Results, and towards user's set 106, returns to this Search Results with search results pages.Search Results can comprise the data that generated by search system 112, and its identification response is in the resource 105 of particular search query, and Search Results can be included in the link of resource 105.The example of Search Results can comprise the presenting of part, resource 105 of web page title, the text fragments that extract from webpage 104 or image, and the URL of webpage 104.Result of page searching can also be included in one or more location advertisings that wherein can present advertisement.
Result of page searching can be arranged to HTTP(HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) with the web browser for user's set 106 from search system 112) send together with the request of cookie.For example, cookie can represent particular user device 106 and particular webpage browser.For example, search system 112 comprises server, and this server is inquired about by send result of page searching answer in http response.This http response comprises that making browser is that server is posted the website that carries or is the instruction (for example, cookie instruction being set) of the territory storage cookie of server.If browser supports cookie and enabled cookie, to each page request subsequently of the server in the territory of this same server or this server, will comprise this cookie.Cookie can store various kinds of data, comprises unique or part unique identifier.It doesn't matter can to conceal this unique or part unique identifier and this unique or part unique identifier and user's name.Because HTTP is stateless protocol, for example, so use cookie to allow external service (search system 112 or other system) to follow the tracks of user's specific action and state in a plurality of sessions.For example, user can, by the middle forbidding of arranging of browser cookie, select to exit tracking user action.
When user's set 106 request resource 105 or Search Results, or when resource 105 or Search Results are offered to user's set 106, the requests that Advertising Management System 110 receives advertisement, wherein this advertisement will be provided together with resource 105 or Search Results.To the request of advertisement, can be included as the feature of the resource 105 of request or the location advertising of result of page searching definition, and can be provided for Advertising Management System 110.For example, can provide to Advertising Management System 110: quote (for example URL) to resource 105, has wherein defined location advertising for this resource 105; The size of location advertising; And/or be used in the medium type presenting in this location advertising.Similarly, the search inquiry of the keyword associated with the resource 105 of asking one or more words of relevance (with) (" resource keyword ") or request Search Results can also be provided to Advertising Management System 110, to help the advertisement that identification is relevant to resource 105 or search inquiry.
Data based on the request of advertisement is comprised, Advertising Management System 110 can be selected to provide in response to this request, qualified advertisement (" qualified advertisement ").For example, qualified advertisement can comprise having the advertisement of the feature matching to the feature of location advertising and be identified as and the resource keyword of appointment or the relevant advertisement of search inquiry.Eligible advertisement is elected in the advertisement of the target keyword by Advertising Management System 110, the part having with resource keyword, search inquiry or search inquiry being matched in certain embodiments, as.
Similarly, when user selects advertisement that (clicking) present, can to the data of the selection of advertisement, store in journal file 116, cookie or history data repository 119 representing.In certain embodiments, in response to by advertisement link to the request of webpage store data.For example, user can initiate to present the request of the webpage being provided by (or being) advertiser to the selection of advertisement.This request can comprise that sign is about the data of the specific cookie of user's set, and these data can be stored in advertisement data store.
User interactive data can be associated with unique identifier, and this unique identifier represents to carry out the corresponding user's set of user interactions.For example, in certain embodiments, user interactive data can be associated with one or more cookie.Each cookie can comprise the content of specifying initialization time, and this initialization time indication arranges at first the time of this cookie in particular user device 106.
As described above, the report that offers certain content supplier can be described for weigh performance measurement that occurred, user and content exchange before transforming.When user carries out required movement, transform, and conversion pathway comprises the one group of user interactions that transforms and occurred before carrying out conversion by user.Can regard any one or more user interactions as conversion.Forming the factor transforming may be different because of thing, and can in all sorts of ways to determine to be that what formation transforms.For example, when user clicks advertisement, forwards webpage or website to, then complete while buying leaving before this webpage or website at that, can transform.Again for example, when user is when specific website spends the time of measuring more than preset time, can transform.Data from a plurality of user interactions can be used for determining the time quantum at specific website.
Can specify the action that forms conversion by each advertiser.For example, each advertiser can select one or more measurement/observable user action as conversion, for example download white paper, at least navigate to the given depth of website, at least check the webpage of some, at least on website or webpage, spend predetermined time amount, or register on website.Also can use and form other actions that transform.
Follow the tracks of conversion (and mutual with other of advertiser's website), advertiser can comprise embedding instruction in this advertiser's webpage, wherein this embeds the user interactions (for example the page is selected, content item is selected and other mutual) of instruction monitoring and advertiser's website, and can detect the user interactions (or a series of user interactions) that forms conversion.In certain embodiments, when user is from webpage referenced (or other resources) accessed web page, or during another resource, can identify about this mutual webpage referenced (or other resources), for example, can be by carrying out the code snippet be quoted by just accessed webpage and/or based on identifying for accessing the URL of this webpage.
For example, user can visit advertiser's website by being chosen in the link presenting on webpage, and for example, selection is as the link of the part of the popularization activity of advertiser's affiliate (affiliate).This link can be associated with the URL that comprises the data (being text) of unique identification resource, and wherein user navigates from this resource.For example, link http://www.example.com/homepage/%aff iliate_identifier%promotion_1 shows user to navigate to example.com webpage from the webpage of the associated affiliate of the affiliate identifier with appointment this URL, and based on being chosen in linking of comprising in the popularization activity associated with promotion_1, user is directed to example.com webpage.Can deposit the user interactive data about this mutual (selecting link) in database, and as mentioned below, with this user interactive data, facilitate performance report.
When detecting conversion for advertiser, can represent that the conversion data transforming is transferred to the data processing equipment (" analytical equipment ") that receives this conversion data, and then this conversion data is stored in data-carrier store.Can with for carrying out one or more cookie of the user's set of user interactions, store explicitly this conversion data, make the user interactive data associated with cookie can with transform associatedly, and the performance that can be used for generating about this conversion is reported.
Conventionally, when the advertisement of using target keyword to be decided to be target is, while transforming the front last advertisement of clicking, to think that this conversion is owing to this target keyword.For example, advertiser X can be associated keyword " tennis ", " footwear " and " brand X " with advertisement.In this example, suppose that user submits the first search inquiry to " tennis " to, to this user, present the result of page searching of the advertisement that comprises advertiser X, and this user selects this advertisement, but this user does not take to form the action transforming.Further this user of hypothesis submits the second search inquiry to " brand X " subsequently to, presents the advertisement of advertiser X to this user, and user selects the advertisement of advertiser X, and user takes to form the action (for example, user buys brand X tennis shoes) transforming.In this example, this is transformed owing to keyword " brand X ", this is the advertisement presenting because last advertisement of selecting before transforming (" advertisement of finally selecting ") is in response to coupling " brand X ".
To causing being presented on before conversion the keyword of the last advertisement of selecting, provide that to transform score (" finally selecting score (credit) ") be a kind of effective measurement to advertisement performance, yet be only that this measurement can not be offered help and analyze the data of transformation period to advertiser, this transformation period be included in the advertisement of last selection before user to the contact of advertisement and/or selection.For example, independent last selection score weighs that do not describe may be by having increased the keyword of brand or product popularity before selecting this last advertisement of selecting to presenting of the advertisement of presenting to user and/or being selected by user.Yet these advertisements may be to taking the user who forms the action transforming to have major contribution subsequently.
In the above example, even if the advertisement presenting in response to the search inquiry of matching keywords " tennis " may for example, have contribution to the user of the action (buying brand X tennis shoes) of taking form to transform, but does not provide any score about transforming to keyword " tennis ".For example, when advertisement that user selects to present in response to matching keywords " tennis ", user may check the brand X tennis shoes that can obtain from advertiser X.Contact based on user to brand X tennis shoes, user may submit search inquiry " brand X " subsequently to, to find the tennis shoes from brand X.Similarly, the selection regardless of user to advertisement, user to the contact of advertisement of using keyword " tennis " and being decided to be target also for example, to taking subsequently the user who forms the action (buying the product from advertiser X) transforming to contribute to some extent.Analysis the user who selects to occur before the last advertisement of selecting and advertiser's advertisement (or other guide) alternately, can improve the ability that advertiser understands this advertiser's transformation period.
Transformation period is when presenting advertisement to user, and when user takes to form the action transforming, finish during.Can weigh and/or retrain the transformation period by time or action, and this transformation period can cross over a plurality of user conversations.User conversation is the set condensing together for the user interactions analyzed.Each user conversation comprises data that expression is carried out by specific user and the user interactions of (being designated duration) in session window.For example, session window can be the time period (for example 1 hour, 1 day or 1 month) of appointment, or can delimit this session window with required movement.For example, user search session user search queries that occur in can being included in during 1 hour and/or that for example, occur before in conversation end event (, closing search browser) and action subsequently.
Analyze the transformation period can improve advertiser understand within the transformation period its client how with the mutual ability of advertisement.For example, if advertiser determines that contacting for the first time advertisement from user is 20 days to the mean time area of a room transforming, advertiser can infer that user is transforming (taking to form the action transforming) front time quantum spending for studying alternate source by these data.Similarly, if advertiser determines the user much transform and does like this after using particular keywords to be decided to be the presenting of advertisement of target, advertiser may wish to increase the amount of funds that it spends in the advertisement of using this keyword to distribute, and/or improves the quality of using this particular keywords to be decided to be the advertisement of target.
Help the user interactions measurement of analyzing the transformation period can be called conversion pathway performance measurement.Conversion pathway is by specific user, transformed front and comprising one group of user interactions of this specific user of this conversion.As be described in more detail below, the mutual quantity of specific user occurring before user interactions path before conversion pathway performance is weighed and describe the duration of transformation period, the amount of user interaction occurring within the duration of transformation period, transforms, conversion, and other measurements to the user interactions occurring within the duration of transformation period.
Can provide config option to reduce the deviation in performance report.There is no config option, some performance report may have deviation, for example, be partial to short conversion pathway.For example, if comprise the number percent in the Partial Conversion path higher than threshold percentage by the basic data of giving a report, performance report may be partial to short conversion pathway.Partial Conversion path be wherein about some user interactive datas of user but not all user interactive data all with transform associated conversion pathway.For example, if generate report with the report period of typical transformation period length that is less than the advertiser of request report, can in this report, add Partial Conversion path.
Report period is determined the maximum length (to represent over sky) of the transformation period report, and this is to generate this report due to the excessive data of operation report outside the phase not.Performance report can, based on report period (looking back window), make the user interactions before the report period not to be regarded as the part of transformation period when generating report.Such report period is called " review window ".For example, when generating report according to the review window of 30 days, be illustrated in the available subscribers interaction data of the user action occurring between July 1 in given time and July 31, will be available to the conversion occurring this year July 31.
For example, when using acquiescence to look back window (30 days), if being greater than this acquiescence, the typical transformation period length of the product associated with report looks back window, show public lecture and be partial to short conversion pathway.For example, in example above, the typical transformation period of " brand X " tennis shoes (for example 30 days) is with for example, compare compared with the transformation period of your make (, new car) may be relatively short.New car can have the longer transformation period (for example, 90 days).
Different advertisers or advertiser's different product can have different associated transformation period length.For example, sell (being for example less than 100 dollars) advertiser of product at a low price and can specify the review window of 30 days, and the advertiser who sells more expensive product (for example at least 1000 dollars) can specify the review window of 90 days.
In certain embodiments, advertiser 108 can when request performance report, for example, specify the review window that will use by input number of days or for example, by select to look back window from specific review window list (30 days, 60 days, 90 days).Allow advertiser to configure the review window of their performance report, make advertiser can select the review window corresponding with their transformation period of product.Allow to look back window configuration and also make advertiser to test by enough different review windows, its possibility of result causes finding to improve the method for conversion rate.
Other factors can work to report section conversion pathway.For example, as described above, with the basic user interactive data of giving a report, can be associated with the unique identifier that represents user's set, wherein with this user's set, carry out user interactions.As described above, unique identifier can be stored as to cookie.Can delete cookie from user's set, for example, can by delete cookie user, the browser of deleting cookie (for example,, when exiting browser, based on browser parameters, set), or some other softwares (for example Rogue Anti-Spyware) of deletion co okie are deleted cookie.
If deleted cookie from user's set, for example, when user's accessed web page (search system 112), new cookie can be set on user's set.This new cookie can be used for storing new part unique identifier, and the user interactive data subsequently therefore occurring on this user's set can be associated from different identifiers.Therefore,, owing to thinking that each user identifier represents different users, so compare with the user interactive data of associated new cookie, the user interactive data associated from deleted cookie is identified as with different users and is associated.
For example, in example above, suppose that user deletes cookie after carrying out first search inquiry of " tennis ", and in the deleted rear generation of cookie the second search inquiry to " brand X ".In this example, the performance that the user interactive data based on about user calculates is weighed may there is deviation.For example, because the advertisement selection the first search inquiry not being caused is regarded the part of the transformation period that the advertisement selection that causes with the second search inquiry is identical as, so weighing, path may be calculated as one, rather than two, this is because these two user interactions seem not to be to be carried out by identical user.
Check the report that reduces the deviation being caused by Partial Conversion path, advertiser can be this report and specifies review window.As described above, looking back window appointment is the user interactive data associated with unique identifier for generating the user interactive data of report, wherein, this unique identifier has designated duration (for example 30 days, 60 days, 90 days) before conversion initialization time before.Therefore, for the conversion that wherein user interactive data is associated with the unique identifier with the initialization time after this designated duration, be not included the basis that is used as this report.Have on the user's set that the unique identifier indication of nearest initialization time may represent at this unique identifier recently and reinitialized this unique identifier.Therefore, the user interactive data associated with relatively new unique identifier can only represent part conversion pathway.Or, for user interactive data wherein, be comprised in this report with the conversion that the unique identifier with the initialization time after this designated duration is associated.For reducing deviation, before adding report, from conversion pathway, remove any user interactions comprising in conversion pathway, occur after designated duration.
Fig. 2 is the process flow diagram for the method for integrated user interactions daily record data according to an illustrative embodiment.Method 200 is to upgrade conversion pathway and the definite method transforming of the user's conversion pathway based on upgrading.
Can be on Advertising Management System 110, performance point desorption device 120 or another calculation element implementation method 200.In one embodiment, on computer-readable medium, coding method 200, and this computer-readable medium comprises the instruction that makes the operation of this calculation element manner of execution 200 when being carried out by calculation element.
As described above, journal file 116 can comprise user interactive data.Journal file 116 can be before processing combines with the user interactive data of other daily records from other servers, comprises those servers of realizing search system 112.Processing from the calculation element of implementation method 200 determine new daily record can be used for processing (210).For example, can send the notice that the new daily record of indication has been ready for processing to calculation element, or the existence of new daily record can indicate this new daily record to be ready for processing.
Next, retrieve new daily record (220).Can retrieving novel daily record on network 102.User action based on being indicated by new daily record upgrades each user's state history.New daily record can comprise the information relevant to a plurality of users' user interactions.History data repository 119 comprises the user interactive data from previously processed journal file.Owing to can according to user identifier, user interactive data being divided into groups and by the time, it be sorted, so the user interactive data comprising in history data repository 119 can have state.Fig. 3 is described in the block diagram of the user interactive data upgrading in the duration of user interactions daily record data integrated approach 200 according to an illustrative embodiment.Fig. 3 shows four user identifier examples, yet history data repository 119 can comprise the data associated with thousands of or millions of different user identifiers with journal file 116.In one embodiment, previously stored user interactive data 310 is stored in history data repository 119.As shown in the figure, previously also in history data repository 119, do not stored the user interactive data associated with user identifier 3.
New daily record can comprise the user interactive data about one or more user identifiers.Can to user interactive data, divide into groups according to user identifier and then by time sort (230).Row 320 illustrate the user interactive data that divides into groups and sort.As shown in the figure, user identifier 2 does not comprise any new user interactive data, and user identifier 1,3 and 4 has upgraded user interactive data.For example, new journal file comprises and the user interactions a that is associated with user identifier 1
13and a
14associated user interactive data.Then, divided into groups can merge mutually (240) with the user interactive data of storage in history data repository 119 with the user interactive data of sequence.If preexist user identifier in history data repository 119, adds new user interactive data to previous user interactive data.Otherwise, add new user interactive data and new user identifier.
Row 330 illustrate the user interactive data about the renewal of each user identifier.User interactive data based on upgrading, can determine any conversion (250) occurring in each of the more new route of user interactions.User interactions path is restricted to those user interactions relevant to particular advertisers 108.The conversion of particular advertisers 108 transforms for determining whether alternately.For example, suppose user interactions a
13and a
32represent to transform mutual.Correspondingly, find conversion pathway 340 and 350.Once find, conversion pathway can be write to another part or another data-carrier store of history data repository 119, for further analysis.
Each user interactions comprises associated with this user interactions one group of data or dimension.Can sparsely fill this dimension, make any user interactions can there are the data that subset is relevant to dimension.Can generate a large amount of conversion pathway by the user interactive data based on receiving.Various report about the implementation status of activity or advertiser's arrangement can comprise the various information about conversion pathway.Consider a large amount of potential conversion pathway, each conversion pathway can be aggregated to together to reduce the quantity of the different conversion pathway of report.In an illustrative embodiment, the conversion pathway that polymerizable has the user interactions of equal number and has corresponding data.
The dimension data of user interactions can be sparse filling.By single dimension, come polymerization conversion pathway can cause not having a large amount of polymerization conversion pathway of the data associated with the dimension of institute polymerization.In an illustrative embodiment, can carry out the various conversion pathway of polymerization by a plurality of dimensions.The sorted lists that can use dimension is definite the first matching dimensionality that comprises data of each user interactions.If there is not alternately the dimension of coupling, specify default dimension or data value for any specific user.For example, the default dimensions that is not sparse filling can be used as to default dimensions or text-string, for example can be by " unavailable ", " (nothing) " or " " as default value.
The sorted lists that uses dimension, can be converted to each conversion pathway dimension path.Dimension path comprises the dimension element corresponding with the user interactions of conversion pathway.Dimension element can comprise or quote the data from the first dimension, and wherein this first dimension comprises to come the data of self-corresponding user interactions.For example, the sorted lists of supposing dimension comprises dimension
1, dimension
2and dimension
3, and user interactions comprises dimension
2and dimension
3in data, but there is no dimension
1in data.Due to dimension
2be the first dimension of the user interactions that comprises data, the dimension element corresponding with this user interactions will comprise or quote the dimension from this user interactions
