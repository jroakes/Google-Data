- the access network is generally communicably coupled to one or more core networks, which may be coupled to other networks like the Internet and public switched telephone networks among others. These and other elements of access and core networks are not illustrated but are known generally by those having ordinary skill in the art.
- the one or more base units serve a number of remote units 103 , 104 within a corresponding serving area, for example, a cell or a cell sector, via a wireless communication link.
- the remote units may be fixed or mobile.
- the remote units may also be referred to as subscriber units, mobiles, mobile stations, mobile units, users, terminals, subscriber stations, user equipment (UE), user terminals, wireless communication devices, relay node, or by other terminology used in the art.

- the remote units may also communicate with the base unit via a relay node.
- the wireless communication system is compliant with the 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) LTE protocol, also referred to as EUTRA or 3GPP LTE or some later generation thereof, wherein the base unit transmits using an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme on the downlink and the user terminals transmit on the uplink using a single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) scheme.
- UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
- SC-FDMA single carrier frequency division multiple access
- the wireless communication system may implement some other open or proprietary communication protocol, for example, IEEE 802.16(d) (WiMAX), IEEE 802.16(e) (mobile WiMAX), among other existing and future protocols.
- the disclosure is not intended to be implemented in any particular wireless communication system architecture or protocol.

- the wireless communication system may utilize other communication system protocols including, but not limited to, TDMA or direct sequence CD
- a LTE-A User Equipment can receive and transmit control and data signaling on multiple component carriers (CCs).
- CCs component carriers
- the UE is expected to communicate with the network by receiving only a single CC (Primary or Anchor CC).
- the network sends a configuration message (SI configuration message) to the UE on the primary CC with system information (SI) corresponding to other CCs on which the network may schedule the UE.
- SI configuration message typically consists of CC specific information that the UE is required to store in order to communicate with the network on other CCs.
- the SI can include CC specific information such as CC carrier frequency, downlink (DL) bandwidth, number of antennas, downlink reference signal power, uplink (UL) power control parameters and other information that does not change frequently.
- the SI configuration message is sent to the UE using Radio Resource Configuration (RRC) signaling from an eNodeB in the network.
- RRC signaling between the UE and eNodeB is typically associated with large latency, e.g., 10-15 ms.
- the UE Upon receipt of the SI configuration RRC message, the UE stores the SI for other CCs but continues to communicate with the network by only receiving the primary CC.
- the other CCs for which the UE has received SI and the primary CC constitute the UE's “configured CC set”.
- the eNodeB sends an activation message to the UE instructing the UE to communicate (receive and/or transmit) on other CCs in addition to the primary CC.
- the UE activates the other CCs and can receive control and data signaling on the activated CCs (including the primary CC).
- the UE In order to receive multiple CCs, the UE must reconfigure its hardware to receive a larger bandwidth. However, receiving more bandwidth increases UE power consumption.
- the eNodeB sends the activation message only when the bandwidth of the primary CC is not sufficient to schedule a large data burst to the UE.
- the eNodeB may send the activation message to enable load balancing in the network and not necessarily schedule a large data burst to the UE.
- the eNodeB may send a de-activation message to the UE instructing the UE to reconfigure its receiver for a smaller bandwidth to receive only the primary CC.
- the activation/deactivation messages are sent from the network or eNodeB using Layer 1 (L1) or Medium Access Control (MAC) signaling.
- L1 or MAC signaling between the UE and eNodeB is typically associated with low latency, e.g., 1-4 ms.
- the deactivation message can be implicit or explicit.
- the UE Since the UE has already stored the SI corresponding to the configured CCs in the first step, the UE can quickly communicate with the network on multiple activated CCs when they are activated by the eNodeB. This reduces latency. As multiple CCs are activated only during occasional reception of large data bursts, the UE is required to receive large bandwidths only occasionally. This reduces UE power consumption.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example of the process of configuration, activation and deactivation of CCs.
- the UE first communicates with the network only using a single CC (CC 1 ).
- the UE Upon reception of the SI configuration message on CC 1 , the UE stores information about CC 2 and CC 3 but continues to communicate with the network using CC 1 .
- CC 1 , CC 2 and CC 3 constitute the UE's “configured CC set”.
- the UE receives an activation message from the eNodeB indicating that CC 2 and CC 3 are activated.
- the eNodeB might have activated these CCs to quickly schedule a large data burst to the UE.
- CC 2 and CC 3 are deactivated using an explicit deactivation message as illustrated in this example.
- the deactivation may be implicit or using some other mechanism.
- the UE continues to communicate with the eNodeB using only CC 1 thereafter until the UE receives a new activation message.
- the deactivation message may deactivate CC 1 and CC 3 and thus the UE continues to communicate with the eNodeB using CC 2 thereafter until the UE receives a new activation message.
- the CC 2 may then take the role of the primary or anchor carrier.
- CC 1 , CC 2 and CC 3 can have same or different carrier bandwidths.
- CC 1 can have a bandwidth 10 MHz
- CC 2 and CC 3 can have a bandwidth of 5 MHz.
- UE capable of communicating with the eNodeB over multiple CCs are typically advanced UE associated with LTE Rel-10 or a future release. In most cases the eNodeB can communicate with both LTE Rel-10 UE and LTE Rel-8 UE (legacy UE) on the same CC. In such cases the CC should support all the necessary backwards compatible signaling required for LTE Rel-8 such as transmission of synchronization channels, system information broadcast, pilot transmissions for serving legacy UEs.
- the UE is expected to receive all the CCs (i.e., CC 1 , CC 2 and CC 3 in FIG. 2 ) from the same eNodeB. In some specific implementations it may be possible for the UE to receive some CCs from one eNodeB and some other CCs from another eNodeB.
- the eNodeB can send data and control signaling to the UE on each activated CC.
- Control signaling is preferably sent to the UE in a control region in the first few symbols of each subframe in each activated CC.
- Data is sent in a data region in the remaining symbols of each subframe in each activated CC.
- Scheduling messages in the control region of each activated CC are sent on a Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH).
- Data is received by the UE in the data region of each activated CC on a Physical Downlink Shared CHannel (PDSCH) corresponding to that CC.
- PDSCH Physical Downlink Shared CHannel
- On the uplink data is transmitted by the UE on a Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH) on one or more of the multiple activated CCs or the CCs in the UE configured set.
- PUSCH Physical Uplink Shared CHannel
- interference from other eNodeB transmissions is not uniform across all CCs. This results in significantly different signal reception quality at the UE on each activated CC. Since control signaling is considered more critical than data signaling, the eNodeB can use PDDCH messages in the control region of one CC, typically the CC with better signal quality (e.g., the Primary CC) to schedule PDSCH data for multiple activated CCs. This procedure is called cross-carrier scheduling. Cross-carrier scheduling may also be used for other purposes such as network load balancing.
- DCI Downlink Control Information
- DCI includes scheduling information.
- Scheduling information includes signaling such as a set of PDSCH/PUSCH Resource blocks (RBs) on which the UE is scheduled data, Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) of scheduled data, Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) process number and Redundancy Version (RV) of scheduled data etc.
- MCS Modulation and Coding Scheme
- HARQ Hybrid ARQ
- RV Redundancy Version
- various DCI format types such as DCI format 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2, 2A, 3, 3A are used.
- PDCCH messages with different DCI format types can have same or different size.
- PDCCH messages are also used for scheduling uplink transmissions from the UE on Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH) resources of different activated CCs.
- DCI format 0 is used for scheduling PUSCH.
- the control region in a given subframe comprises time-frequency resources called Control Channel Elements (CCEs).
- CCE comprises several smaller time frequency resources called Resource Element Groups (REGs).
- REG Resource Element Groups
- each CCE comprises 9 REGs.
- a REG consists several even smaller time-frequency resources called Resource Elements (REs).
- each REG can have 4 or 6 REs.
- a REG may have REs that are mapped to only control channels or REs that are mapped to both control channels and reference signals.
- a UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates for control information in the control region of every non-DRX subframe, where monitoring implies attempting to decode each of the PDCCHs in the set according to several DCI format types and DCI format sizes.
- the set of PDCCH candidates to monitor are defined in terms of search spaces.
- a search space corresponds to a set of PDCCH candidates monitored by the UE for PDCCH messages.
- the CCEs corresponding to a particular PDCCH candidate of a search space are determined at the UE by using a predefined formula.
- a UE can monitor multiple search spaces.
- the search spaces may overlap.
- a search space is further defined by various aggregation levels.
- An aggregation level corresponds to an aggregation of one or several consecutive logically indexed CCEs. CCEs available in the control region of a subframe are logically indexed from 0 to a maximum value.
- the aggregation levels defining each of the search spaces and number of PDCCH candidates associated with each aggregation level in a search space are determined by the UE using predefined rules or tables.
- the DCI format types and DCI format sizes that the UE monitors on each search space can depend on UE configuration.
- the concept of monitoring a set of PDCCH candidates in terms of search spaces allows the UE receive PDCCH messages of various DCI format types and sizes with a reasonable amount of decoding complexity.
- a typical control region of a particular subframe of a particular CC can contain up to approximately 80 CCEs.
- a PDDCH message of a given DCI format can be signaled by the eNodeB using an aggregation of 1, 2, 4 or 8 logically consecutive CCEs.
- the UE must blindly decode all possible CCEs combinations within the control region at various aggregation levels to receive the PDCCH message which results in extremely high decoding complexity.
- the concept of search spaces allows the UE to decode a relatively small subset of CCE combinations within the control region to receive PDCCH messages.
- a UE monitors the control region of every non Discontinous Reception (DRX) subframe for PDCCH messages in common search spaces and UE specific search spaces at different aggregation levels.
- the UE monitors the PDCCH candidates of each search space for PDCCH messages of different DCI format types and DCI format sizes depending on UE configuration.
- Table 2 gives an example listing of some DCI format types and sizes allowed for LTE Rel-8 for a 20 MHz system bandwidth and FDD operation.
- the UE performs a separate decode operation for each distinct DCI format size for all PDCCH candidates that correspond to the search space where a particular DCI format type is expected.
- the common search spaces are associated with a Y k value of zero.
- the UE In the UE specific search spaces (UESS), of aggregation levels 1, 2, 4 and 8 the UE looks for DCI format type 0, 1A and one additional DCI format type (i.e., one chosen from types 1, 2, 1B, 2A, 2B) depending on UE configuration.
- the one additional DCI format type has a size larger than 44 bits.
- the UE specific search spaces are associated with a UE specific Y k value.
- the eNodeB when a UE is configured for cross-carrier scheduling, the eNodeB sends a cross scheduling configuration (CSC) message to the UE indicating that the UE should receive, or is expected to receive, PDCCH messages including a Carrier Indication Field (CIF) in the DCI of the PDCCH messages.
- CSC cross scheduling configuration
- the CIF signals whether each received PDCCH message corresponds to a first CC or at least one additional CC.
- the CIF field signals a preconfigured index of the CC on which PDSCH/PUSCH data resources are scheduled.
- the index values corresponding to different CCs can be configured by the eNodeB using either the SI configuration message or the CSC message described earlier. Alternatively, a separate configuration message or the activation message can be used.
- a LTE Rel-10 UE is expected to receive several separate PDDCH messages in the control region of a subframe in a CC for which CIF is configured.
- Each PDCCH message corresponds to a PDSCH resource assignment for a particular CC.
- a UE is not expected to receive more than one PDSCH resource assignment per CC.
- the eNodeB can configure the UE to include CIF on a subset of CCs.
- the subset of CCs that contain CIF can be signaled to the UE in the SI configuration RRC message, cross scheduling configuration (CSC) message or some other message.
- CSC cross scheduling configuration
- the UE is expected to receive some PDCCH messages whose DCI does not include CIF (e.g., messages signaling broadcast information) and some PDCCHs whose DCI includes CIF.
- PDCCH messages received in CSS do not contain a CIF.
- PDCCH messages received in the UESS contain CIF.
- the search spaces for receiving PDCCH messages with CIF have to be expanded beyond the Rel-8 search spaces.
- a UE using a Rel-8 UESS design would monitor only two PDCCH candidates of a UESS at aggregation level 8. This may be sufficient for the case of non cross-carrier scheduling where the UE is expected to receive a maximum 1UL grant and 1DL assignment in its UESS.
- the UE can be scheduled n UL grants and n DL assignments in the control region of a single CC that cross schedules n ⁇ 1 other CCs.
- the eNodeB will be forced to use a smaller aggregation level to cross schedule other CCs. Signaling at smaller aggregation levels is less reliable than aggregation level 8. Such restrictions on an eNodeB scheduler are not desirable as they may degrade overall system performance.
- the control region of a CC that cross schedules n ⁇ 1 other CCs should have search spaces whose size is larger than the size of LTE Rel-8 UESS.
- One implementation can increase the search space size (by increasing the number of PDCCH candidates) for all the allowed aggregation levels 1, 2, 4 and 8.
- Another implementation can only increase the search space size for some aggregation levels (e.g., levels 4 and 8) and leave the search space size same as that of LTE Rel-8 UESS for some other aggregation levels.
- Such an implementation allows slightly reduced complexity UE implementation compared to previous implementation (number of decodes performed at the UE is proportional to search space size) while providing some level of flexibility at the eNodeB.
- U.S. Publication No. 2010/0279628 corresponding to U.S. application Ser. No. 12/435,145 entitled “Control Channel Provisioning and Signaling” describes increasing the search space size for some aggregation levels.
- Yet another implementation can increase the search space size beyond LTE Rel-8 by adding new aggregation levels (e.g., 16 CCE aggregation) not supported in LTE Rel-8.
- a UE is expected to receive cross-carrier PDCCH messages in a particular CC when the following conditions are satisfied:
- the UE is configured by the eNodeB to monitor the control region of that particular CC for PDCCH messages whose DCI information includes a CIF field (i.e., the UE is configured for cross-carrier scheduling on that particular CC); and the UE is informed by the eNodeB that one or more of the other CCs for which cross-carrier PDSCH/PUSCH data can be scheduled are activated.
- the UE monitors a larger search space in the control region of that particular CC when both the above conditions are satisfied.
- UE monitors only a smaller search space in the control region of that particular CC resulting in reduced UE decoding overhead. Further, since the UE attempts fewer decode operations while monitoring the smaller search space, the probability that the UE will falsely detect a PDCCH message not signaled to it is reduced.
- a mobile unit or UE monitors a search space of a first Component Carrier (CC) from a base unit.
- the search space is specific to the UE and it corresponds to a set of Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH) candidates monitored by the UE for PDCCH messages.
- the mobile unit receives an activation message on the first CC, wherein the activation message activates at least one additional CC.
- the mobile unit monitors a search space having a larger size than the size of the search space monitored by the mobile unit before the mobile unit receives the activation message.
- RRC Radio Resource control
- CSC cross scheduling configuration
- the mobile unit receives the SI for the at least one additional CC in the radio resource control (RRC) configuration message before receiving the activation message.
- RRC radio resource control
- the first CC and the additional CC constitute a configured CC set of the UE.
- the UE still looks for PDCCH messages corresponding to only CC 1 . Since the PDCCH messages are still expected for only a single CC (CC 1 ), the UE still monitors the smaller UE specific search space at each aggregation level.
- the CSC message indicates that the UE is expected to receive the PDCCH messages including a carrier indicator field (CIF), the CIF signals whether each received PDCCH message corresponds to the first CC or the at least one additional CC.
- CIF carrier indicator field
- the UE monitors the control region of CC 1 for PDCCHs corresponding to CC 1 and CC 2 with CIF.
- the activation message may be received by the mobile unit in a control region of a subframe of the first CC on a PDCCH.
- the activation message may be received by the mobile unit in a higher layer message from the eNodeB such as Medium Access Control (MAC) layer message.
- the activation message may be part of a PDCCH scheduling message, such as a PDSCH assignment or a PUSCH grant PDCCH message on the first CC or CC 1 .
- a one bit activation field can be included in the PDCCH message indicating one of activation (e.g., an activation field bit value of 1) and de-activation (e.g., an activation field bit value of 0).
- the activation message may be indicated by a particular bit combination of one or more bits in the PDCCH message. Since CC 2 is activated, UE looks for PDCCH messages corresponding to both CC 1 and CC 2 . The UE may start looking for the PDCCH message corresponding to both CC 1 and CC 2 “x” time units after reception of the activation message. In one embodiment, “x” corresponds to an integer number of subframes after the subframe on which the activation message is received.
- “x” may correspond to a predetermined timer value.
- the value of “x” may be fixed, signaled in the SI configuration message, RRC-configuration message, CSC message, activation message or a high-layer configuration message, or may be a function of the UE capability. Since the PDCCH messages are now expected for multiple CCs (CC 1 and CC 2 ), the UE monitors a larger UE specific search space at each aggregation level to provide more scheduling flexibility for the eNodeB. Alternatively, the UE can monitor a larger UE specific search space at some aggregation levels and continue monitoring a smaller UE specific search space at some other aggregation levels. Thus the size of the search space monitored by the UE after receiving the activation message and the CSC message is greater than the size of the search space monitored by the UE before receiving the activation message.
- the UE When CC 2 is later deactivated, the UE reverts back to receiving PDCCHs in the smaller search space at some or all the aggregation levels.
- the size of the search space monitored by the UE on a first CC after de-activating the at least one additional CC is smaller than the size of the search space monitored by the UE before de-activating the at least one additional CC.
- the UE can de-activate CC 2 after receiving a de-activation message from the eNodeB. As described above, the deactivation message can be implicit or explicit.
- the de-activation message may be received by the UE in a control region of a subframe of the first CC on a PDCCH.
- the de-activation message may be received by the UE in a higher layer message from the eNodeB such as Medium Access Control (MAC) layer message.
- the de-activation message may be part of a PDCCH scheduling message, such as a PDSCH assignment or a PUSCH grant PDCCH message preferably on the first CC.
- a PDCCH scheduling message such as a PDSCH assignment or a PUSCH grant PDCCH message preferably on the first CC.
- a one bit activation field e.g., an activation field bit value of 0
- UE can de-activate CC 2 after a predetermined timer reaches a predetermined value (e.g., TIMEOUT).
- the predetermined timer can count the time elapsed (e.g., number of sub frames elapsed) since the reception of a subframe where a PDCCH message scheduling a resource assignment corresponding to CC 2 or the at least one additional CC was received.
- the predetermined value or TIMEOUT parameter value may be fixed, signaled in the SI configuration message, RRC-configuration message, CSC message, activation message or a high-layer configuration message.
- the UE can thus de-activate the at least one additional CC or CC 2 without a subsequent reception of a de-activation message from the base unit.
- the persistence of activation of CC 2 or the at least one additional CC may be indicated by indicating a period of time or TIMEOUT measured from the last successfully decoded PDCCH indicating resources scheduled on CC 2 (at least one additional CC).
- a mobile unit receives an activation message on a first CC activating a particular set of additional CCs. After receiving the activation message, the mobile unit monitors a search space having a larger size than the size of the search space monitored by the mobile unit before the mobile unit receives the activation message. Later, the mobile unit de-activates the particular set of CCs that were activated by the activation message. The size of the search space monitored by the mobile unit after de-activating the particular set of CCs is same as the size of the search space monitored by the mobile unit before activating the particular set of CCs.
- the CSC message and the configuration message providing the UE with SI for the at least one additional CC can be combined into a single RRC configuration message.
- the combined RRC configuration message indicates that the mobile unit is expected to receive the PDCCH messages including a carrier indicator field (CIF), the CIF signals whether each received PDCCH message corresponds to the first CC or the at least one additional CC.
- CIF carrier indicator field
- the mobile unit receives a particular PDCCH message in a monitored search space on a first CC, wherein the CIF in the particular PDCCH message indicates that a Physical Downlink Shared CHannel (PDSCH) data assignment in the particular PDCCH message corresponds to at least one additional CC.
- the UE then receives PDSCH data assignment on the at least one additional CC.
- the mobile unit receives a PDCCH message in a monitored search space on a first CC, wherein the received PDCCH message schedules a Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH) data assignment for the at least one additional CC.
- the UE transmits the PUSCH data assignment on the at least one additional CC.
- PUSCH Physical Uplink Shared CHannel
- the UE monitors a search space of a first Component Carrier (CC).
- CC Component Carrier
- the UE Upon receiving an activation message activating a second CC, the UE also monitors a second search space on the second CC.
- the first and second search spaces are specific to the UE and each search space corresponds to a set of Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH) candidates monitored by the UE for PDCCH messages.
- the UE receives a cross scheduling configuration (CSC) message on the first (CC) wherein the size of the first search space monitored by the UE after receiving the CSC message is different than the size of the search space monitored by the UE before receiving the activation message and the CSC message and the second search space is no longer monitored by the UE.
- CSC cross scheduling configuration
