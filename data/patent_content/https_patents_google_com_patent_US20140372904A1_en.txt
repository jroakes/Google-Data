- the event engine 318 may provide the aggregated event information in the form of a summary to the routing engine to provide routing information based on the aggregated events.
- the event engine 318 may rank user provided public transit event information according to logic rules or logic tables.
- the event engine 318 may assign a value to each event received based on a determined measure of reliability.
- another value may be may be assigned according to subsequently received events, the subsequent value may be higher or lower based on reliability.
- the event engine may assign a first value based on receiving of a delay event received at a particular bus stop from a first user, and subsequently assign a second value based on receiving another delay event at the same location by another user, where the second value may be higher than the first value.
- the event information may not be provided to the routing engine until a threshold number of events is received (e.g. two or more). In one example, the events may need to be closely related received near similar locations.
- events confirmed by another source may have a higher value assigned to them.
- a station shut down event may be confirmed by information received from a transit authority or verified using transit tracking information.
- different users may have different values of reliability assigned to them.
- directly connected members of the user's social network members “following” the user, or are “friends” of the user, or those within the user's “circle”
- members of the user's extended social network e.g. members “not following” the user, members in various degrees of separation, “friends of friends” or those outside of the user's circle.
- users may have a value assigned to them based on previous accurate reporting of transit event information independently or subsequently confirmed.
- Ranking information may be provided to the geographical navigation interface and displayed to the user in association with events displayed.
- the routing engine 320 may adjust travel information relating to the public transportation system and provide alternative directions based on the user-submitted transit event information.
- the routing engine 320 may include a navigation tree that includes aspects of the transit system, infrastructure, vehicles, nodes, hubs, and equipment, and the interconnections between the aspects.
- the navigation tree may also include a hierarchy and logic rules for optimized travel along the aspects of the transit system. For example, train travel may be higher on the hierarchy than bus travel, which may be higher on the hierarchy than walking.
- the logic rules may determine how a traveler reaches from point A to point B.
- the navigational tree may further include details of how each aspect of the tree effects over aspects. For example, if one node of the train system is disabled (e.g. a train broken down in a station) how are the rest of the nodes affected (e.g. can the remaining train station be operational).
- the routing engine 320 may adjust the navigational tree or the hierarchy of travel based on the public transit event information received and the ranking assigned to the public transit event. For example, if one or more users indicated that a particular train line is not in service, the routing engine 320 may temporarily remove the transit line on the navigational tree. Other examples of adjusting the navigational tree may include removing a station or a stop, such as a train or a bus stop if the station or stop are shut-down, removing a public transit route if the route is shut down, changing travel times for services that are delayed, rerouted or changed to express or local status as well as other changes to the travel information. Based on the adjusted navigation tree, the routing engine 320 may determine alternative travel directions for a requesting user.
- a service train e.g. “Blue line”
- the geographical navigation interface 106 shows the service line as shut down (indicated with “X” marks in FIG. 4 ).
- the user is requesting public transportation directions from Bowdin Station to Back Bay Station.
- the routing engine 320 provides alternative directions shown in 404 .
- the user is directed to walk to the next closest train line (e.g. Orange or Green line).
- the routing engine 320 may include a set of logic rules for adjusting navigational tree.
- the logic rules may be based on the type of event received, the aspect of the transit system affected, the related aspects of the transit systems, and the ranking information associated with the event or the submitting user. For example, if the routing engine 320 receives a train delay event for a train route, the routing engine 320 may continue to provide the train route as one of the travel options, but may adjust travel times and arrival times associated with the train service.
- the routing engine 320 may include another set of logic rules for restoring the navigation tree to original form as the public transit event concludes. For example, if the routing engine 320 receives a train shut down event due to a power shut down in the train station, the routing engine 320 may temporarily remove the train route from the travel options for a specific period of time (e.g. 20, 30, or 60 minutes). At the end of the period the train route may return to original status and the navigational tree may be returned to its original form. In this example, if the routing engine 320 receives another event relating to the same train shut down event during the period of time, the routing engine 320 may continue to suspend the train route in the navigational tree.
- a specific period of time e.g. 20, 30, or 60 minutes
- routine engine 320 may calculate alternative transportation directions and provide those alternative directions to the user. For example, if a train station is shut down, the routing engine 320 may direct the user to walk to the next train station, take a shuttle, or a bus.

In one example, the method comprises presenting, to the user in the display of the computer system, a geographical navigation interface including a visual indicator of a transit element, receiving, in the display, at least one long-press input provided by the user and directed to the visual indicator of the transit element, presenting at least one selection option for identifying a transit event pertaining to the transit element and at least one broadcast option for the user's social network, accepting, at least one selection option input corresponding to the transit event and at least one broadcast option input provided by the user, and causing the identified transit event to be broadcast to one or more members of the user's social network, based on the at least one broadcast option input.
Description
- Public transportation or public transit is a shared passenger transportation service which is typically provided to the general public within populated areas. Public transit may include buses, trolleys, trams and trains, shuttles, the bike share programs, ferries, and water taxis. Public transit typically operates according to planned routes and predetermined timetables that are provided by the transport operator to allow travelers to plan their trip. Mobile computing devices can be used to obtain public transit information, including planned routes and predetermined timetables.
- Such mobile computing devices can also be used for communicating with friends and acquaintances through social networks. Members of such social networks may be interested in sharing information with other members of the network. Users of these social networks can share with their friends and acquaintances information regarding real-time experiences as those experiences are happening. Typically, these real-time experiences are associated with a particular location, a particular service, or a particular event. Friends and acquaintances of the user who are located in nearby areas may be interested in receiving information relating to those locations, events and services.
- Some mobile applications provide public transit travel directions to a user desiring to go from point A to point B, but do not provide traveling times based on real-time traveling conditions. Other mobile applications may use vehicle tracking systems to predict the arrival of the next public transit vehicle at any given node, such as a bus stop or a train stop. Using this mobile application user may infer a delay or a shut down from the delayed next arrival time. Additionally, public transit authorities may provide may provide alerts via various communication mediums notifying travelers of potential travel issues such as emergencies, approximate travel delays, transit advisories, and transit shut downs. Typically, because these alerts are provided by transit authorities, the dissemination of these alerts is delayed, commonly reaching the user after a point where the user can take an alternative route. Additionally, if a public transit service is shut down or delayed, the user receiving the alert would need to figure out alternative travel options and which of the options is optimal for travel. A user unfamiliar with the public transit system or the geographical area may have a hard time planning an alternative route.
- Therefore, aspects and embodiments are directed to a system and method that provides real-time public transit information from members of the user's social network and determines the best alternative travel options for the user. According to one embodiment, the system includes a geographical navigation interface. The geographical navigation interface provides a selection option that allows the user to quickly input public transit event information pertaining to a location where public transit is affected. The system further includes a service that receives user inputted public transit event information and processes the event information to determine alternative routes for traveling directions. The selection option system eases the burden on the user to type in the information and provides normalized event data to the service for processing.
- For users searching for directions, the service may provide a way to avoid public transit problem areas without inferring or accessing multiple applications. A user unfamiliar with the transit system may not be able to determine the optimal alternative travel route. Further, the service processes received events to determine whether the received public transit events are relevant and reliable and whether the public transit events should be used to determine an alternative route.
- According to one embodiment, a method for notifying members of a social network of a transit event using a computer system, the computer system having a display, is disclosed. The method comprises presenting, to the user in the display of the computer system, a geographical navigation interface including a visual indicator of a transit element, receiving, in the display, at least one long-press input provided by the user and directed to the visual indicator of the transit element, and presenting to the user in the display, in response to accepting the at least one long-press input, at least one selection option for identifying a transit event pertaining to the transit element and at least one broadcast option for the user's social network. The method further comprises accepting, in the display, at least one selection option input corresponding to the transit event and at least one broadcast option input provided by the user, and causing the identified transit event to be broadcast to one or more members of the user's social network, based on the at least one broadcast option input.
- In one example, the method may further comprise receiving, by a communication service, a plurality of transit events pertaining to at least one of a plurality transit elements associated with the at least one selection option input and the at least one broadcast option input. In this example, the method may further comprise determining a value of reliability associated with each of the plurality of public transit events. In addition, the method may further comprise adjusting the value of reliability associated with at least one of the plurality of transit events based on a subsequently received transit event.
- In another example, the method may further comprise ranking the plurality of transit events based on the value of reliability for each of the plurality of transit events. In addition, the method may further comprise comprising adjusting a navigational tree based on at least one transit event of the plurality of transit events and the respective value of reliability. In this example, adjusting the navigational tree further includes adjusting at least one aspect of the plurality of transit elements. In addition, adjusting the navigational tree further includes adjusting at least one aspect of the plurality of transit elements for a predetermined period of time, and returning the navigational tree to a previous state after passage of the predetermined period of time.
- In another example, the method may further comprise determining alternative navigation directions based on the at least one transit event of the plurality of transit events and the respective value of reliability. In this example, the method may further comprise presenting the alternative navigation directions to the user in the display of the computer system. In another example, presenting at least one selection option for the transit event may include presenting at least one standardized input option.
- According to another embodiment, a system for notifying members of a user's social network of a transit event is disclosed. The system comprises a display, and a geographical navigation interface provided on the display, the geographical navigation interface including a visual indicator of a transit element.

Accordingly, there is a need for an integrated mobile device application and service that provides real-time public transit information and determines the best alternative travel options for the user.
- According to one embodiment, a distributed communication system includes a geographical navigation interface provided on a mobile device that presents a selection option to a user of the mobile device. The selection option allows the user to quickly input public transit event information pertaining to a location where public transit is affected.

In addition, the service may process and use the public transit event information to determine potential alternative routes. In one example, the service includes a routing engine that determines and provides directions for a potential alternative route for the user requesting directions that impact a problem area of the transit system. The routing engine allows the user to avoid the problem area without having to determine an alternative route themselves. Further, the system may include an event engine that processes received events according to various ranking methods. The event engine may be configured to determine whether the public transit events are relevant and reliable and whether the public transit events should be used to determine an alternative route.
- Social networks may include any subscription-based or micro-blogging messaging services such as Twitter, provided by Twitter, Inc. of San Francisco, Calif. or Google+ provided by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. In one example of the use of a micro-blogging site, a user of a micro-blogging application on a mobile device may submit short textual posts to a micro-blogging service. The posts may be transmitted from the mobile computing device to a central server where the posts are disseminated to computing devices of other users, including other users who have previously indicated an interest in “following” the posting user. Those “following” the posting user receive notices of new posts, such as in a stream presented to them on their computing devices. Users may view the posts by using the same micro-blogging application or logging into a website that displays a stream of posts by other people that use the micro-blogging service. Also, posts by other users can be presented to the viewing user according to automated algorithms (e.g., based on views, connections or ratings) and can further be provided to other people that do not “follow” the user. These other people may be in the user's extended network of friends (or “friends of friends”).
- A transportation system may include various transit elements. Examples include infrastructure, such as highways, roads, rails, or seaways and vehicles traveling on the infrastructure, such as buses, trolleys, trams and trains, such as high speed trains or rapid transit (metro/subways/underground/“T”), cable cars, shuttles, bikes, pedicabs, road taxis, ride-share cars, ferries, and water taxis. The public transit system may further include transit elements that are nodes, such as train stations or bus stops, bike centers, ferry terminals as well as other nodes. In addition, the public transit system may include transit elements that are interchanges or hubs, where passengers can change travel modes, from passenger to vehicle, or from one vehicle to another (e.g. from train to bus). Further, the public transit system may include transit elements corresponding to other equipment that relates to public transportation, such as elevators, escalators, on-ramps, wheelchair accessible seats and entrances, stairs, HVAC units, lighting units, as well as other related equipment.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , there is illustrated one example of asystem 100 for inputting public transit event information and providing this information to members of a social network.FIG. 1 shows one example of adisplay 102 of amobile computing device 104 that presents ageographical navigation interface 106. Thegeographical navigation interface 106 may provide a map of an area around a user of thedevice 104, or an area to which the user intends to travel, layered with transit information and user-provided information. Thegeographical navigation interface 106 may provide for the user to input a search for a particular location of the map or alternatively, present on the map the user's current location. Thegeographical navigation interface 106 may be provided by a service over a distributedcommunication system 300, as further described below. - In one example, the map may be overlaid with information which may be provided on the geographical navigation interface in discrete layers. The layers may include public transit elements, such as public transit routes, public transit stops, and public transit equipment such as trains, buses, shuttles, as well as other transit related information. The layers may further include icons or other graphical element types indicating elements of the transit system, such as public transit stops and equipment. The elements may be presented as part of a map of the transit system or may be presented to indicate one or more routes utilizing elements of the transit system.
- The layers and the icons may include geo-coded information representing the geographical location of the corresponding transit elements in the physical environment. For example, the geo-coded information may be in the form of latitude and longitude, or in the form of Global Positioning System (GPS) location information. The user of the device can select certain icons on one or more of these layers to see information about the icons. For example, the display shows an icon of a public transit stop on the map, shown as a circle with a letter “T.”
- The geographical navigation interface may provide for the user an input component that allows the user to enter public transit event information. In one example, public transit event information may include security, maintenance, malfunction, weather and emergency related closures or delays, road hazards, alternative routes, change in service (e.g. change from local to express), information provided by public transit authorities, alerts, service advisories or service updates, as well as other public transit related information.
- A user experiencing a public transit event or having knowledge of such an event may enter related information into the geographical navigation interface. In one example, the user may provide a one long-press input to the geographical navigation interface over the location on the map correlating to the existence of the event. The long-press input may be accomplished by pressing down and holding, using a fingertip or a stylus, on an area of a touch screen display. In one example, the user may hold the area for longer than a typical selection used for other features of the touch screen to distinguish the input.
- As a result of the long-press an
input screen 108 may be displayed. In one example of the long-press input, a user waiting for a train at a station may experience a delay in service of the train due to a malfunctioning train. The user may access the geographical navigation interface showing a map of the location near the user including an icon of the train station. The user may long-press (e.g. press and hold) the icon of the train station until the input screen is displayed. The input screen can allow the user to enter delay information associated with the train station. -
FIG. 1 shows aninput window 108 presented to the user as the result of the long-press on the geographical navigation interface of the mobile device. Theinput window 108 may be a single screen or a series of screens displayed for the user on the mobile device. Theinput window 108 may includevarious selection options 110 for the user to select in order to enter public transit event information.FIG. 1 shows the selection options as buttons; however any method of standardized input can be used including check boxes, radio buttons, as well as other methods. In one example, these various selection options may allow the user to quickly provide standardized event information without additional input. For example, the user may enter that a train is delayed by selecting the “delay” button, that a station is closed by selection “station closed” button or that the entire train line is shut down by selecting “line shut down” button. Alternatively, the user may customize the input of event information, by selecting “other” and manually entering the information. The user may also add anote 112 to either the standard input or the custom input to provide additional information regarding the event. - The input screen may allow the user to input any type of public transit event relating to any element of the public transit system, for example any event relating to infrastructure, nodes, hubs, vehicles or equipment or other event types. According to some embodiments, the geographic navigation interface may determine the location of the long-press on the map and whether there is a component of the public transit system situated in that location. In some embodiments, the input screen may be tailored to the type of component of public transit system present in the location of the long-press. For example, if the user long-presses on an icon of a node (e.g. a bus stop), the selection options presented on the public transit event information screen may be related to event information associated with that type of node.
- In another example, the user may select any location on a map, the selection options may first prompt the user to select a type of component of the public transit system, for example infrastructure, vehicles, nodes, hubs, or equipment, then may present another set of selection options to enter the event related to the component. For example, the user may long-press a point along a road to indicate that a parade is occurring along the street and that buses traveling along that road are being rerouted to another road. In this example, the input screen may first present a series of selection options to determine that the user wishes to enter an event relating to a bus, then present another set of options allowing the user to enter road closure information.
- According to at least one example, most commonly used selection options may be presented to the user. For example, commonly used selection options can be determined based on the number of inputs of a particular type from multiple users or from repeat use by the same user. Common selection options may be also determined by location and presented to the user when an area around the location is selected on the display.
- After the information is entered by the user, the user may select a
broadcast option 114. In one embodiment, the event information may then be broadcast to the user's social network according to settings selected by the user. In one example, the geographical navigation interface may automatically broadcast public transit event information to members of the user's social network. As shown inFIG. 1 , the user may change automatic broadcast setting by toggling a switch from “on” into “off” position. In another example, the user may select which one(s) of the user's social networks to broadcast the public transit event information. For example, the social networks can be selected by highlighting or un-highlighting the icon associated with the particular social network. - The user can then cause the public transit event information to be broadcasted to one or more members of the user's social network. The public transit event information may then be received by the service as part of the distributed communication network and then transmitted to each of the respective social network servers selected by the user. The public event information received by the service may be processed by the service according to methods described below. The information may be streamed to each respective user according to methods used by each of the social network platforms. In at least one example, the user may have to authorize the service to have access to the user's social network information prior to broadcasting to the social network servers. The user may authorize access by providing the social network login and password information.
- Referring to
FIG. 2 , there is illustrated one example of asystem 200 for displaying public transit event information to members of a social network.FIG. 2 shows another example of thedisplay 102 of themobile computing device 104 that includes thegeographical navigation interface 106. Thegeographical navigation interface 106 shows a map of an area around a user of thedevice 104, or an area to which the user intends to travel layered with public transit as well as user provided information. The map, the transit information, and the user provided information may be provided by a service over a distributed communication system, as further described below. - In one example, the map may be overlaid with information which may be provided on the
display 102 in discrete layers. The layers may include public transit information and may further include icons indicating elements of the transit system, such as nodes, hubs, vehicles or equipment. The layers and the icons may include geo-coded information representing the geographical location of those layers and icons in the physical environment. - In addition, the layers may include transit directions provided to the user. For example, the user may desire to go from a point of origin (e.g. point A) to a destination point (e.g. point B). User enters locations of both points A and B and visual representation of transit directions are included as a layer over the map. The visual representation may include one or more suggested routes, including on or more alternative routes (e.g. bus versus train versus walking directions).
- The user of the device can select certain icons on one or more of these layers to see information about the icons that other users have made to the system. For example, the
geographic navigation interface 106 shows an icon of apublic transit node 202 on the map, such as a train stop. The node is represented inFIG. 2 as a circle with a letter “T.” The user may select this icon of the node to obtain more information about the public transit station. For example, the train station may have aprofile page 204 associated with the station. The information in the station'sprofile page 204 may have been initially provided or obtained directly from the transit authority by the mobile device using geo-coded location information. In one example, the information in theprofile page 204 may be updated by asking the users of mobile devices to confirm the information as the users provide information associated with the station. - In one example, a user may click on the transit station to raise
indicator 206 showing general information about the transit station, such as its name. The user may then tap the indicator to be presented with the profile page for the transit stop. Theprofile page 104 may include general information about the transit stop, such as photos of the exterior of the station, the status of the station, schedule of the associated transit line, information about the next train, or parking at the train station, as well as any other profile information. Also, theprofile page 204 may presentlinks 208 to various posts and related streams that have been associated with the station, as shown with icons on the bottom of the station profile page. The user can select the icons related to posts to display the posts in apost screen 210. - The posts and streams may also be presented to the user as one of the layers or icons in
navigation interface 106. As shown inFIG. 2 , thepost icon 212 may be illustrated as a bubble proximate to the train station icon; however any visual indication can be used to indicate posts. The user may select thepost icon 212 to access the posts screen 210 directly from the map. The location of thepost icon 212 may be displayed in the map based on the location information received from user'smobile device 104 as the user posted the comments. - The posts screen 210 may display event information from users regarding the
node 202 at the time of their location near the node, such as that the train is delayed, or that the train station is shut down. For each user, thepost screen 210 may display theselection option 214, followed by the user'snote 216. In one example, the selection option may be color coded based on severity. Thepost screen 210 can also displaytime information 218 associated with the posts, as well as information about the users creating the posts. The posts by users may be provided in response to other user's posts or they may be independent posts. The user's posting regarding the train station may be members of the user's social network. In particular, as shownFIG. 2 , three members of the user's social network have commented on the train station. - According to some examples, the event information provided by the user's social network may be different than the transit information provided by the transit authorities. For example, as shown in
FIG. 2 , three members of the user's social network indicated that there is an issue with the train station, however, the transit authorities are reporting the station as open. In this example, the transit authority information is delayed making event information provided by the social network more reliable. Based on the information received from thepost screen 210, the user may decide to find alternative travel options or routes. Thepost screen 210 may provided a reroute option for the user to find an alternative route. - The information that is presented on the map may be controlled by user and/or by the social network service. In one example, the posts that are displayed may be filtered by a user in various ways. For example, a viewing user may desire to see only posts from other users that the viewing user has affirmatively elected to “follow.” The viewing user may also see time-filtered posts, for example by selecting a graphical slider that can be displayed on the geographical navigation interface, so that posts in the last x hours or y days are displayed. In one example, the viewing user can also select to filter by post or user ranking level (e.g., three or above on a scale of five), as further described below. The geographical navigation interface can filter posts that have been ranked lower than a desired level and omit those posts from display to the user.

FIG. 3 shows a distributedsystem 300 including aservice 302 for managing and enabling communication of information between users and various social networks. The distributed system can include theservice 302,devices 304, users 306, ageographical navigation interface 308,social networks 310, and asocial network interface 312. In one example,service 302 allows the users 306 to quickly post public transit event information to social networks and to quickly obtain public transit event information from social networks. - According to various examples, one or more components of the distributed
system 300 can be implemented using one or more computer systems, such as the distributedcomputer system 600 discussed below with regard toFIG. 6 . Thus, examples of the distributedcommunication system 300 include a variety of hardware and software components configured to perform the functions described herein and examples are not limited to a particular hardware component, software component or a particular combination thereof. - For instance, the user may provide one or more inputs to one of the
devices 304, such as a cell phone, a smart phone, a PDA, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer or another system. Thedevices 304 may include a component, such as circuits, to determine the geographic location of the device. For example,mobile device 304 may include a GPS receiver. The component may include software for determining the position of the device based on signals received at a cell phone's antenna from one or more cell phone towers. In accordance with one aspect of the system and method,mobile device 304 includes a routine for periodically uploading its geographic location to theservice 302. The routine may also include instructions for requesting and downloading maps and directions. Both the routine and the instructions may be presented in a single application, such as a mobile map or geographical navigation application. - The
service 302 may include adatabase 314, an Application Programming Interface (API) 316, aranking engine 318, arouting engine 320 and asearch engine 322. These elements ofservice 302 can be provided using a computing system such ascomputer system 600 ofFIG. 6 . Users may interact with thedevices 304 using thegeographical navigation interface 308, which may be provided on thedevices 304. Thegeographical navigation interface 308 may allow for inputs using keyword searches, geographical map searches and inputs, location based searching (e.g. within 2 mile radius of the present location), category selections (such as “train station”), and other methods of inputting search parameters. The search queries are transmitted to thesearch engine 322 of theservice 302, which may return search results comprising of one or more hits meeting the search criteria. - The
API 316 can serve as an interface between theservice 302 and various software programs and interfaces and further facilitate their interaction. In one example, theAPI 316 can interface components of theservice 302 and the applications and software programs used by thedevices 304, and/or thesocial networks 310. TheAPI 316 can include one or more discrete interfaces, for example, a user interface for interacting with the geographical navigation interface, a social network interface for interacting with one or more social network services. The service can further provide one or more related services through the API. In one example, the service can include a service for providing geographical navigation or directions to users via the mobile devices. - The API may further retrieve transit information from various
external services 324. For example, transit information from various transit authorities, such as station information, route information, schedules, station shut-downs or re-routing information, as well as real-time travel or arrival times. Transit information may also be obtained from other services such as public transit tracking services. This information may be processed by theservice 302 and used by theranking engine 318 and/or therouting engine 320, as further described below. The transit information may also be displayed to the user via thegraphical navigation interface 308. -
External services 324 may further include various location-based services that may be integrated with posts or comments, such as by identifying the locations (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) from which posts or comments are made. Theservice 302 may receive location information about a user of thegeographical navigation interface 308. For example, when a user submits public transit event information, geo-coordinates for the user may be provided with the post (e.g., via the GPS receiver on the user's device 304) or may be determined for the user by the service 302 (e.g., via cell tower or access point identification or triangulation). For example, the geo-location information may be an estimated latitude and longitude of thedevice 304 and information identifying an accuracy of the estimation. Because privacy is a concern, users may choose to opt out of sharing the geo-coordinates of their location; alternatively, a user's location may not be shared unless the user expressly opts in after being provided notice of how his or her location will be used. - The
service 302 can be capable of storing information in thedatabase 314, for instance, relating to users, social networks, transit event information, transition authorities, navigation information including the navigational tree, and transit profile information. The user information, for example, may include user identification information, previous event information submitted by the user, user's authentication information to various social networks, user preferences and settings, including previously selected broadcasting options, previously obtained directions and routing options, as well as current and past location information of the user's device. As mentioned above, users may also choose to opt out of having their user information stored in thedatabase 314. - Referring again to
FIG. 3 , according to various embodiments, therouting engine 320 may use the transit event information to provide directions to a user of thegeographical navigation interface 106. As described above, the user may request traveling directions from a point of origin to a destination in thegeographical navigation interface 106, via public transportation services. Thegeographical navigation interface 106 may provide the directions to the user graphically as a layer on the map.FIG. 4 shows one example of thegeographical navigation interface 106 displaying directions for the user. Thegeographical navigation interface 106 may provide a suggestedroute screen 402, which may include different suggested routes, including different public transportation services (e.g. travel by orange line or green line). Travel times, including approximate arrival time, may be displayed along with different traveling options may be displayed on the suggestedroute screen 402. The user may select one of the suggested routes and thegeographical navigation interface 106 may provide directions for the suggested route. The directions may be in the form oftext 404 describing every step of the transit path (e.g. “turn-by-turn” direction). The directions may also be visual 406, provided on the map as lines indicating the path of travel. - Turning back to
FIG. 3 , theevent engine 318 may process public transit event information received from users according to sets of logic rules. In one example, theevent engine 318 may aggregate and normalize one or more of the same public transit events received from different users, such as multiple users reporting a station shut down. In another example, theevent engine 318 may also aggregate and normalize different public transit events received from different users, such as one user reporting a train delay and another user reporting a train shut down. Theevent engine 318 may provide the aggregated event information in the form of a summary to the routing engine to provide routing information based on the aggregated events. - According to various examples, the
event engine 318 may rank user provided public transit event information according to logic rules or logic tables. Theevent engine 318 may assign a value to each event received based on a determined measure of reliability. In one example, another value may be may be assigned according to subsequently received events, the subsequent value may be higher or lower based on reliability. For example, the event engine may assign a first value based on receiving of a delay event received at a particular bus stop from a first user, and subsequently assign a second value based on receiving another delay event at the same location by another user, where the second value may be higher than the first value. According to at least one example, the event information may not be provided to the routing engine until a threshold number of events is received (e.g. two or more). In one example, the events may need to be closely related received near similar locations. - In yet another example, events confirmed by another source may have a higher value assigned to them. For example, a station shut down event may be confirmed by information received from a transit authority or verified using transit tracking information. In another example, different users may have different values of reliability assigned to them. For example, directly connected members of the user's social network (members “following” the user, or are “friends” of the user, or those within the user's “circle”) may have a higher value assigned than members of the user's extended social network (e.g. members “not following” the user, members in various degrees of separation, “friends of friends” or those outside of the user's circle). In addition, users may have a value assigned to them based on previous accurate reporting of transit event information independently or subsequently confirmed. Ranking information may be provided to the geographical navigation interface and displayed to the user in association with events displayed.
- In one example, the
routing engine 320 may adjust travel information relating to the public transportation system and provide alternative directions based on the user-submitted transit event information. Therouting engine 320 may include a navigation tree that includes aspects of the transit system, infrastructure, vehicles, nodes, hubs, and equipment, and the interconnections between the aspects. The navigation tree may also include a hierarchy and logic rules for optimized travel along the aspects of the transit system. For example, train travel may be higher on the hierarchy than bus travel, which may be higher on the hierarchy than walking. The logic rules may determine how a traveler reaches from point A to point B. The navigational tree may further include details of how each aspect of the tree effects over aspects. For example, if one node of the train system is disabled (e.g. a train broken down in a station) how are the rest of the nodes affected (e.g. can the remaining train station be operational). - The
routing engine 320 may adjust the navigational tree or the hierarchy of travel based on the public transit event information received and the ranking assigned to the public transit event. For example, if one or more users indicated that a particular train line is not in service, therouting engine 320 may temporarily remove the transit line on the navigational tree. Other examples of adjusting the navigational tree may include removing a station or a stop, such as a train or a bus stop if the station or stop are shut-down, removing a public transit route if the route is shut down, changing travel times for services that are delayed, rerouted or changed to express or local status as well as other changes to the travel information. Based on the adjusted navigation tree, therouting engine 320 may determine alternative travel directions for a requesting user. - Referring again to
FIG. 4 , one example of adjusting travel information and displaying the adjusted travel information in thegeographical navigation interface 106 is illustrated. In the example shown, a service train (e.g. “Blue line”) is determined to be shut down based on event information received from various users. Thegeographical navigation interface 106 shows the service line as shut down (indicated with “X” marks inFIG. 4 ). In this example, the user is requesting public transportation directions from Bowdin Station to Back Bay Station. Therouting engine 320 provides alternative directions shown in 404. In this example, the user is directed to walk to the next closest train line (e.g. Orange or Green line). - The
routing engine 320 may include a set of logic rules for adjusting navigational tree. In one example, the logic rules may be based on the type of event received, the aspect of the transit system affected, the related aspects of the transit systems, and the ranking information associated with the event or the submitting user. For example, if therouting engine 320 receives a train delay event for a train route, therouting engine 320 may continue to provide the train route as one of the travel options, but may adjust travel times and arrival times associated with the train service. - In another example, the
routing engine 320 may include another set of logic rules for restoring the navigation tree to original form as the public transit event concludes. For example, if therouting engine 320 receives a train shut down event due to a power shut down in the train station, therouting engine 320 may temporarily remove the train route from the travel options for a specific period of time (e.g. 20, 30, or 60 minutes). At the end of the period the train route may return to original status and the navigational tree may be returned to its original form. In this example, if therouting engine 320 receives another event relating to the same train shut down event during the period of time, therouting engine 320 may continue to suspend the train route in the navigational tree. - If a user's request for directions overlaps one or more of the adjusted transportation services, the
routine engine 320 may calculate alternative transportation directions and provide those alternative directions to the user. For example, if a train station is shut down, therouting engine 320 may direct the user to walk to the next train station, take a shuttle, or a bus. -
FIG. 5 shows one example of amethod 500 of notifying members of a social network of a public transit event for example by using the mobile devices and distributed communication systems described above with reference toFIGS. 1-4 and the computer systems described below with reference toFIG. 6 . - In
step 502, the mobile device presents, to a user in the display of the mobile device, a geographical navigational interface. The geographical navigation interface includes a navigational option and an input component. The input component allows the user to provide a one long-press input to the navigation option. Instep 504, the mobile device accepts, in the display of the mobile device the long-press input provided by the user. As described above, the long-press may be accomplished by pressing down and holding, using a fingertip or a stylus, on an area of a touch-sensitive display or on a touch-sensitive input device mapped to a display. - In
step 506, in response to accepting the long-press input, the mobile device presents to presenting to the user in the display one or more selection options for the public transit event and a broadcast option for the user's social media network. The selection options may include ways of selecting different types of public transit events. The different types of public transit events may be specific to locations of the navigation option. In one example, the public transit events may be specific to nodes, infrastructure, vehicles, or equipment associated with the public transit event. For instance, the events may be specific to the transit element represented at a location on the display for which the long-press touch was directed. The selection options may include one or a series of screens that “walk” the user through selecting the corresponding public transit event. - In
step 508, the mobile device accepts the selection option and the broadcast option provided by the user in the display. The selection option accepted by the mobile device corresponds to the public transit event experienced by the user. As described above, the selection option may also be standardized by presenting one of the standard selection options to the user. The selection option may also be customizable by the user by providing for the user to enter “other” and input a custom description of the public transit event. The selection option and the broadcast option may be provided to theservice 302 and can be stored on the database of theservice 302. - In
step 510, the public transit event associated with the selection option may be broadcast to members of the of the user's social network based on the broadcast option. As described above, the broadcast option may include a selection by the user of the social networks the user desires to broadcast the public transit information. The broadcast option may further allow the user to filter the types of social networks and the members of those networks who are to receive the broadcast. For instance, the public transit event may be provided to one or moresocial networks 310 via theservice 302. As another example, the public transit event may be provided directly to social network(s) 310 from the user's device, for example by invoking functions of an API made available bysocial network 310. - In some implementations,
method 500 ends atstep 510 when information about the public transit event is provided for broadcast to one or more social networks. However, in some implementations the method continues to steps 510-516 so that information is used byservice 302. Instep 512, the selection option associated with the public transit event is processed by theservice 302. As described above, the public transit events received may be ranked based on a measure of reliability. Based on the ranking, theservice 302 may determine whether route or travel options need to be adjusted and determine alternative travel options (step 514). Instep 516, a user requesting directions impacting adjusted travel options can receive alternative travel options, which are provided by theservice 302. - Various aspects and functions described herein in accord with the present invention may be implemented as hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software on one or more computer systems. There are many examples of computer systems currently in use. Some examples include, among others, network appliances, personal computers, workstations, mainframes, networked clients, servers, media servers, application servers, database servers, web servers, and virtual servers. Other examples of computer systems may include mobile computing devices, such as cellular phones and personal digital assistants, and network equipment, such as load balancers, routers and switches. Additionally, aspects in accord with the present invention may be located on a single computer system or may be distributed among a plurality of computer systems connected to one or more communication networks.
- For example, various aspects and functions may be distributed among one or more computer systems configured to provide a service to one or more client computers, or to perform an overall task as part of a distributed system. Additionally, aspects may be performed on a client-server or multi-tier system that includes components distributed among one or more server systems that perform various functions. Thus, the invention is not limited to executing on any particular system or group of systems. Further, aspects may be implemented in software, hardware or firmware, or any combination thereof. Thus, aspects in accord with the present invention may be implemented within methods, acts, systems, system placements and components using a variety of hardware and software configurations, and the implementation is not limited to any particular distributed architecture, network, or communication protocol.
