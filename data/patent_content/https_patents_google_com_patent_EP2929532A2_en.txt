- An existing audio codec may be applied to compress a sub-signal at a certain bit rate, yielding a bit stream that can be used to reconstruct the sub-signal.
- g k q k ⁇ g k , r k ) denote the reconstruction of g3 ⁇ 4 by applying codec at bit rate r3 ⁇ 4.
- Compression of audio signals is generally lossy, meaning that g k does not equal g 3 ⁇ 4 .
- the difference is usually quantified by a distortion measure. The following considers a global distortion measure that takes all involved codecs into account:
- the problem may be expressed as min V" r s.t. d ⁇ ⁇ q k (g k , r k ); s ⁇ D (2) r k ⁇ 0 -
- equation set (2) conjugates to the expression in equation set (1), and may be solved using similar techniques.
- present disclosure focuses on the problem as expressed in equation set (1).
- a first assumption is that the global distortion is additive.
- the assumption presented in equation (3) is reasonable since often-used distortion measures for audio compression (e.g., weighted mean squared errors (MSE)) are additive.
- MSE weighted mean squared errors
- the original problem presented in equation (1) may be divided into smaller problems, each of which optimizes for a sub-signal.
- Such a codec may be applied to a sub-signal from the previous context described above.
- the following description reduces the notion of a sub-signal and considers the optimal compression of a c channel signal (where "c" is an arbitrary number).
- the minimum distortion of compressing a multichannel audio signal at an arbitrary bit rate may be derived from the information theoretical viewpoint.
- a multidimensional Gaussian process may be used to model a multichannel audio signal, which can represent any sub-signal in the earlier context. Such an assumption may be valid for audio segments of, for example, some tens of milliseconds. Accordingly, the methods and systems described herein may be applied to real audio signals frame -by-frame.
- a multidimensional Gaussian process can be characterized by its spectral matrix
- the diagonal elements are the self power-spectral-densities (PSDs) of the individual channels in the multidimensional Gaussian process
- a k (S(a>)) represents the k-th eigenvalue (actually a function of ⁇ ) of the spectral matrix.
- Equation (6) may be further simplified by assuming that A k (S(o))) ⁇ ⁇ , ⁇ /o), k .
- This assumption is valid, for example, when the overall distortion level is sufficiently low, which will depend on the dynamic range of the power spectrum and, importantly, on the perceptual weighting. In other words, the above assumption works well because of proper perceptual weighting, which reduces the dynamic range of the power spectrum. With this assumption, it becomes clear that
- det(S(o)))do) is related to the entropy rate of the
- the distortion may be assumed to follow a generalized form:
- the method addresses the following: (1) given a signal rearrangement, determine the optimal rate allocation, and (2) determine the optimal signal rearrangement.
- S k (o) Given a rearrangement of the original multichannel audio signal, allow S k (o)) to denote the spectral matrix of the k-th sub-signal and f t (r) to denote the rate function associated with the k-th audio codec. The first part of the problem then becomes
- the optimal bit allocation then satisfies M ⁇ - ⁇ ⁇ ( 12) dr
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example process for determining optimal signal rearrangement and rate allocation, with consideration given to a perceptually-weighted distortion measure, according to at least one embodiment of the disclosure.
- the original multichannel audio signal (e.g., multichannel audio signal 105 as shown in FIG. 1) may be modified according to one or more perceptual criterion.
- the process may estimate, for a segment of the signal, self-PSDs and cross-PSDs of the modified signal from block 300.
- entropy rates may be calculated for candidate sub-signals.
- a bit rates may be allocated to each of the candidate signal rearrangements, where the allocation of the bit rates is optimized according to a criterion.
- a corresponding distortion may be obtained in block 320.
- a determination may be made as to whether there is a next segment still to be considered in the multi-segment signal.
- the process may move from block 325 to block 305 where, for the next segment of the signal, estimates may be obtained for self-PSDs and cross-PSDs of the modified signal, as described above. If it is determined at block 325 that the signal does not include any more segments to be considered, the process may move to block 330 where a selection may be made of the candidate signal rearrangement that leads to the minimum average distortion. [0067] At block 335, the original audio signal may be output according to the signal rearrangement selected at block 330 (e.g., the signal rearrangement that leads to the minimum average distortion), and at block 340 the average -rate allocation on the selected rearrangement may be output.
- the signal rearrangement selected at block 330 e.g., the signal rearrangement that leads to the minimum average distortion
- a special case is when the rate function is optimal for MSE. For example, where
- FIG. 4 illustrates another example process for determining optimal signal rearrangement and rate allocation according to one or more embodiments described herein. While certain blocks comprising the process illustrated in FIG. 4 may be similar to one or more blocks comprising the process illustrated in FIG. 3 (described above), other blocks may include different features between the two example processes illustrated, as described in further detail below.
- the original multichannel audio signal (e.g., multichannel audio signal 105 as shown in FIG. 1) may be modified according to one or more perceptual criterion.
- the process may estimate, for a segment of the signal, self-PSDs and cross-PSDs of the modified signal from block 400.
- entropy rates may be calculated for the candidate sub-signals using, for example, equation (8) presented above.
- a determination may be made as to whether multiple segments of the signal are present. For example, where the signal does include multiple segments, the process may move from block 415 to block 405 where, for another segment of the signal, estimates may be obtained for self-PSDs and cross-PSDs of the modified signal from block 400, as described above.
- the process may move to block 420 where the signal rearrangement that yields the minimum sum of entropy rates for the candidate sub-signals may be selected as the optimal signal rearrangement.
- the optimal rate allocation may be calculated on the optimal signal rearrangement selected in block 420.
- a stereo audio codec may be used to compress an L- channel multichannel audio signal (where "L" is an arbitrary number).
- L is an even number
- the source channels may be rearranged into LI2 pairs of channels.
- L(L - l)/2 candidate pairs of channels there will be L(L - l)/2 candidate pairs of channels.
- L is an odd number
- the candidate sub-signals may include all pairs and all original channels. Since the number of sub-signals and the sizes of sub-signals are fixed in any given rearrangement, the algorithm illustrated in FIG. 4 and described above may be used to determine the optimal signal rearrangement and bit allocation. Additional implementation details for such a scenario are provided below.
- the entropy rate may be calculated as
- equations (16) and (17) are each only an example of one way to calculate the entropy rate for a mono and stereo candidate sub-signal, respectively, by making a Gaussian assumption.
- the optimal rearrangement may be determined by the perfect matching of channels that yields the minimum sum of entropy rates.
- the optimal rearrangement may be determined using a matching algorithm (e.g., the blossom algorithm).
- a matching algorithm e.g., the blossom algorithm.
- less computationally complex methods may be utilized in block 420 (e.g., greedy search).
- the following example further illustrates the method for determining optimal signal rearrangement and rate allocation of a multichannel audio signal according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.
- the scenario presented below is entirely illustrative in nature, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any manner.
- the aim is to compress a 5-channel 48 kHz sampled audio signal at 130 kbps, using a codec that only handles stereo and mono signals.
- the original signal may be rearranged into three sub-signals, two of which are stereo and the third of which is mono (e.g., two pairs of channels plus one individual channel). Rates may be allocated to the three sub-signals using a process similar to that described above and illustrated in FIG. 4.
- the original signal may be divided into segments of 40 milliseconds, where segments are overlapped by 20 milliseconds.
- a simple perceptual criterion e.g., overall rate-distortion performance
- the criterion is based on an auto-regressive model for each channel in each segment.
- a standard method such as the Levinson-Durbin recursion can be used to obtain such a model.
- Every channel may then undergo a filtering with a filter with transfer function A(z / y ⁇ / A(z / y 2 ) , where A(z) represents the auto-regressive model of the particular channel, and the two parameters, y l and ⁇ 2 , can take, for example, the values 0.9 and 0.6, respectively.
- This perceptual criterion is known as the ⁇ 1 - y 2 model.
- all of the channels in each segment may be normalized against the total power of that segment, after the filtering. This operation takes the changes of signal power over time into the distortion measure.
- the power weighting and the perceptual weighting may be undone by renormalization and by filtering with the corresponding inverse filter.
- perceptual criterion described above ( y 1 - y 2 model) is only one example of a perceptual criterion that may be utilized in accordance with the methods and systems of the present disclosure. Depending on the particular implementation, one or more other perceptual criteria may also be utilized in addition to or instead of the example criterion described above.
- self-PSDs and cross-PSDs may be extracted from the channels using any of a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art.
- the periodogram method may be used to extract the self-PSDs and cross-PSDs.
- the entropy rates of candidate sub- signals may then be calculated.
- the entropy rate for a given candidate sub-signal may be calculated using equation (16) or (17), depending on whether the sub-signal is a mono or stereo sub-signal.
- the entropy rates for ten seconds of audio may be collected and averaged. Then the optimal rearrangement and rate allocation may be obtained for the audio in the time span, as further described below.
- the blossom algorithm may be used to determine the optimal signal rearrangement.
- a graph is constructed with six nodes, five of which correspond to a channel of the audio signal.
- the sixth node is designated as a dummy node.
- the averaged entropy rate may be assigned to the edge connecting the corresponding nodes.
- the averaged entropy rate for the channel may be assigned to the edge between the dummy node and the node of the channel.
- the blossom algorithm may then yield the optimal signal rearrangement.
- the blossom algorithm selects non-intersecting edges with the minimum sum of entropy rates.
- the two nodes on each chosen edge form a sub-signal.
- coding gain in which the rate is reduced by optimal coding of all channels together as opposed to coding the channels independently.
- perceptual effects can be captured by means other than modifying the audio signal upfront.
- perceptual effects may be captured using "perceptual entropy” and “perceptual distortion” instead of "entropy rate” and “distortion.”
