Definitions
- This invention relates to a data extraction tool and, more particularly, to novel systems and methods for organizing information from a database for ready access by a user.
- datastores are substantially unorganized collections of data, while databases are indexed in some fashion.
- the Internet the world's largest database, has made available enormous quantities of information to anyone with a personal computer and Internet access. This can be very helpful for people who wish to learn about something or conduct business in the convenience of their own homes. However, it can also be tremendously time-consuming to locate a desired bundle of information among the millions available.
- the Internet is organized only by the name of each web site. Each individual or group maintaining a web site decides how that web site will be organized. Thus, there is no official catalog of information available on the Internet. Perhaps desiring information must hypothesize which web sites would be likely to have the desired data and navigate through those web sites according to the organization set up by the web site's operator. Although other databases and datastores are small, many exhibit the same organizational difficulties.
- portals to automate a portion of the search for information. Most of these portals are text-based. Currently available portals include search engines, and directories.
- search engines are advantageous in that they require little user input or understanding of the operation of the search engine. However, they can be difficult to work with for a number of reasons.
- the list may contain a vast number of hits, few of which actually relate to the desired piece of data.
- Conventional keyword searching returns any instance of the word being sought, regardless of the way the word is used in the web site.
- a user may add additional keywords to narrow the search, there often is no combination of words that must be found together to exclude all irrelevant pages while keeping all relevant ones.
- the output from most search engines is simply a page of links to possibly relevant sites.
- a user may wish to supplement or rearrange the search results, but the way the results of a search are formatted typically makes addition or modification of criteria difficult or impossible.
- Directories function differently than search engines. Rather than search based on keywords provided by a user, most directories provide a user with an information scheme, often hierarchically organized. The user then chooses what type of information to search for, designating narrower groups of information with each choice. Ultimately, the user reaches the bottom level of the hierarchy and receives a list of links to information within that level.
- Directories are advantageous in that information concerning a certain topic is typically grouped together. A directory probably will not inundate a user with information, but rather provide a few links believed to be important by the creators of the directory. Nevertheless, directories have drawbacks of their own.
- directories contain information deemed of value by those who compile them.
- a user may have an entirely different view of what is important and what is irrelevant. A user may thus find that information he or she needs simply is not available on the directory.
- directories take time to navigate. A user must make a series of decisions to reach any useful information at all. Even then, a user may find it necessary to backtrack and choose a different route through the hierarchy. Since a user cannot fashion groupings of information, he or she may be required to view several branches of the hierarchy to obtain the full range of information he or she desires.
- a user may not even be able to find it in the directory. For example, a user desiring to find the meaning of “salmonella” in a biological directory may spend great amounts of time looking through the “aquatic life” branch of the directory, without ever realizing that “salmonella” is more properly classified as “microscopic life.” The more a user's view of how information should be organized differs form that of the directory's creators, the more difficult it will be for the user to find information in the directory.
- a data extraction tool capable of providing many of the benefits of both search engines and directories, without drawbacks listed above.
- a tool that could reliably provide a list of highly relevant information locations based on a simple text query.
- the tool should provide ready access to the exact location of the information.
- the tool would supply the 8 user with a list of locations or links that can be easily sorted and updated for the convenience of the user.
- the tool should not require that the user understand the configuration of the tool's internal databases.
- an apparatus and method are disclosed, in suitable detail to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention.
- an apparatus and method in accordance with the present invention may be directed to locating prices for products that can be purchased over the Internet.
- Selected embodiments of the invention have modules for mining, databasing, searching, filtering, pinpointing, presenting, indexing, or updating information for a user, or some combination thereof.
- the data extraction tool mines information from the information source and organizes the locations of that information within a local database. Then, a user may query the tool for a desired type of information. The tool filters the local database to provide a set of pinpoint site locations with information of the type requested in the query. These pinpoint site locations are presented to a user and indexed for future reference. The index of site locations may be updated automatically by the tool.
- a context system is provided for manually or automatically determining the proper context for a user's query.
- the data extraction tool provides information with a high probability of relevance to the user. The user obtains the information without expending much effort to refine the search.

- the system 10 may be a database contained on a single computer.
- many of the subsequent descriptions will refer to the system 10 as a distributed network 10 of computers, such as the Internet.
- FIG. 2 shows one embodiment of a data extraction tool 110 , or tool 110 , with its associated modules.
- a mining module 112 gathers information from a data source, preferably the Internet.
- a databasing module 114 categorizes and sorts information within a local database. This information can be actual data directly from the data source, or it can be simply pointers to locations of data within the data source.
- An input module 116 interfaces with a user to receive a request for information.
- a filtering module 118 filters information to isolate the data most relevant to a user's request.
- a pinpointing module 120 locates and returns identification of the exact location of information.
- a presentation module 122 presents information summaries and locations to a user.
- An indexing module 124 organizes information for use and access by a user.
- An updating module 126 automatically updates information in a local database.
- the arrows in FIG. 2 show a general chronological flow. However, the modules shown do not have to be accessed in the order shown. In addition, modules can operate multiple times. For example, the updating module 126 may utilize the mining module 112 to obtain more information, which may then be shown to a user by the presentation module 122 and stored by the indexing module 124 .
- a node 11 may have a hard disk 128 or HD 128 , an input/output port 130 or I/O 130 , a central processing unit 132 or CPU 132 , and a memory 133 .
- the modules 112 , 114 , 116 , 118 , 120 , 122 , 124 , and 126 may be temporarily stored for use in the memory 133 , permanently stored in the hard disk 128 , and processed through the central processing unit 132 .
- a user interface 134 and a server link 136 provide for communication with a user and with the network 10 via the I/O 130 .
- a transaction interface 138 may also be included to permit purchasing and selling over the network 10 .
- FIG. 4 shows some data structures that may be included in the user interface 134 .
- a home page 140 provides a user with access to the node 11 with the data extraction tool 110 .
- a web server 142 stores data that makes up the home page 140 .
- CGI scripts 144 may display data from the web server 142 for a user in the form of text 146 and graphics 148 .
- a free form input module 150 receives searching parameters, in the form of a query, from a user.
- a semantic analysis module 152 parses the query and uses context templates 154 to develop a list of contexts that may correlate to information desired by a user.
- An inquiry module 156 prompts a user for further guidance concerning which of the available contexts are truly relevant.
- a query modification module 158 modifies the query to suit a user's response to prompting from the inquiry module 156 .
- a presentation module 160 displays search results in a clear fashion for a user, and can also permit a user to interact with other nodes (e.g. nodes 50 , 52 , 54 ) where further information may be stored.
- a site interaction module 162 can permit partial processing of information by the data extraction tool 110 before presentation to a user.
- a pinpoint selection module 164 chooses relevant sites for further processing.
- a login module 166 if needed, may permit the site interaction module 162 to automatically log onto a site where relevant information is stored.
- a link selection module 168 chooses the most relevant path within the site for retrieval of the desired information.
- a page parsing module 170 determines whether text from the site is relevant to a user's query.
- the semantic net 174 is a resource for matching query text from a user to text from a web site.
- Context clues 176 provide information for contextual comparisons based on classifications 178 of contexts in which a word may be found.
- a context selector 180 selects those contexts that correlate to the proper context for the query and isolates them via filters 182 .
- the filters 182 may reference the context system 184 , which simply provides a list of actions corresponding to each instance of a word. For example, the context system may specify that a site should be retained if a keyword is found in a certain context within the site, but that the site should be filtered out if the keyword is used in a different context.
- the context clues 176 and the context selector 180 may reference an attributes index 185 .
- the attributes index 185 contains a list of words 186 .
- Each word has at least one meaning 187 indexed to that word, and each meaning 187 has a list of relations 188 , such as synonyms, antonyms, subsets, supersets, usage correlation, and usage association.
- a second meaning 189 and however many meanings exist for the word 186 , may also be included with an associated list of relations.
- the relations 188 provide context clues 176 so that a given web site can be classified by context.
- the context may be determined, for example, by the frequency and combination of relations 188 that appear within the web site.
- the filters 182 can filter out those web sites in which the proper keyword is used in an irrelevant context.
- FIG. 7 shows one method for implementation of the data structures of FIG. 2 .
- a data extraction tool 110 mines information from the network 10 .
- the locations of the information, and possibly some of the information itself, may be compiled and formatted in a database construction step 191 .
- a searching step 192 permits a user to query for information stored by the database construction step 191 .
- a filtering step 193 selects the information most relevant to a user's query.
- a pinpointing step 194 determines the exact location of the relevant information on the network 10 .
- a presenting step 196 organizes relevant information and provides it to a user.
- An indexing step 198 links relevant information to the location of that information on the network 10 .
- An updating step 200 subsequently performs an automatic search of the network 10 for new information relevant to the user's query.
- FIG. 8 shows possible steps that might be included within the mining step 190 .
- the tool 110 chooses an orderly method for processing information from the network 10 .
- the route selection step 202 involves an orderly progression to ensure that each potentially relevant parcel of data is processed once and only once.
- the tool 110 receives information from the network 10 for processing in a content reading step 206 .
- the tool 110 evaluates the potential relevance of the text 146 of a site to future queries of a user.
- the tool 110 may be directed towards acquiring a certain type of information, or broadly used to obtain and categorize a wide variety of data.
- the scope of data to be mined determines how selective the evaluation step 110 will be.
- a content extraction step 210 potentially relevant content is compared against a listing of needed information to further filter it in a database filtration step 212 .
- the data are indexed for ready access by an addition to a master index step 214 .
- FIG. 9 shows possible steps that might be included within the database construction step 191 .
- a database structuring step 216 provides the structure and organization for the information.
- a relations recording step 220 and an indices recording step 222 organize data into fields that are appropriately linked together and indexed for rapid reference.
- the tool 10 receives information gathered during the mining step 186 .
- a data classification step 226 uses discrimination functions 228 to categorize information within the schema developed by the schema provision step 218 .
- a schema refining step 230 permits revision of the schema as needed to accommodate information that otherwise cannot be appropriately categorized within the schema.
- the tool 110 adds data to form records.
- the tool 110 adds data retrieved by the mining step 186 to the local database. This involves a number of steps.
- a site identification step 236 the tool 10 identifies sites of relevant information.
- a site isolation step 238 the tool 110 further filters sites based on criteria provided by a user or by the programming of the tool 110 . For example, the tool 110 can be programmed to isolate sites capable of conducting commerce over the Internet. In that case, the site isolation step 238 would filter out all sites without a method for conducting commerce through the site.
- the site contents classification step 240 the tool 110 classifies data into appropriate categories, as laid out in the schema.
- a data selection step 242 chooses classifiable data for transmission to a record preparation step 244 , where data is added to records in the local database.
- a number of steps may be included within the searching step 192 .
- a user may request information by entering free form text or other query inputs in a query receiving step 246 .
- a query parsing step 248 the query is compared against a list of possible contexts by a semantic net reference step 250 .
- the tool 110 forms a question for a user, in a question selection step 254 , to ask for clarification concerning which of the potential contexts that may match the query is the most relevant.
- the inquiry computation step 256 may provide an estimate of the time required to perform a search for each potential context, so that a user will know how long the tool 110 will take to process a search for a given context. This is especially helpful when a user has provided a very broad query. In such a case, the computation time will be high, so a user will know that the search will take a comparatively long time and provide a comparatively large amount of information, perhaps more than desired.
- the tool 10 receives more text or menu selections from a user to identify which of the context or contexts are desired for searching.
- the tool 110 reads an index of information contexts created in conjunction with the database construction step 191 .
- the relevant context or contexts in the index are linked to site locations for information.
- the tool 10 returns these site locations to a user in a pinpointed sites returning step 262 .
- the searching and filtering modules may alternatively be embodied as shown in FIGS. 11 through 14 , in contrast to the configurations shown in FIGS. 5 , 6 , and 10 .
- the input module 116 may transmit text 117 reflecting a search query to the filtering module 118 , which may then filter information to isolate what a user is seeking.
- the filtering module 118 includes a context construction module 300 for assembling micro-contexts 301 based on the text 117 , a context comparison module 302 for converting the micro-contexts 301 to macro-contexts 303 , and an information matching modules 304 for matching the macro-contexts 303 to specific information 306 responsive to the user's query.
- the presentation module 122 again provides the information to a user.
- the input module 116 may acquire text to describe information sought by a user in a variety of different ways. For example, a simple free form text search may be used, wherein the user types a query in plain language. Alternatively, a user may provide key words separated by operators such as and, or, not, and others known in the art. The input module 116 may be configured to refine the text through questions to be answered by a user. The filtering module 118 then receives the text from the input module 116 . Until processed, the text is only a series of words with no inherent meaning to a computer. The filtering module 118 , in this embodiment, will convert the text into searchable portions to find matching information of the type desired by a user.
- a simple free form text search may be used, wherein the user types a query in plain language.
- a user may provide key words separated by operators such as and, or, not, and others known in the art.
- the input module 116 may be configured to refine the text through questions to be answered by a user.
- the context construction module 300 assembles the words to form small, coherent groups, or micro-contexts 301 , for examples, they may contain about 1 to 5 words. This is accomplished in part by using a block parser 316 , which breaks down and interprets the text.
- the text can be broken up by the block parser 300 in a number of different ways. Key words 312 and their modifiers, if designated by a user, can form or define natural contexts for searching. Similarly, relative values 314 or priorities assigned to words in the text may be used by the block parser 310 to create micro-contexts 301 . Occurrence patterns 316 may be used to form natural separations between groups of words.
- These occurrence patterns 316 may be obtained from a user's history 318 corresponding to a given user's activities with the tool, including prior searches and results, or from a general language database such as the attributes index 185 .
- the user history 316 in any case may provide the tool 110 with information concerning what information a user has requested in the past, and therefore what information the user is most likely looking for with a new inquiry.
- the context comparison module 302 receives the micro-contexts 301 from the context construction module 300 and compares them to a corpus 330 of information.
- the corpus 330 may simply be a database with samples of information 332 in natural language format, indexed according to macro-contexts 303 . These macro-contexts 303 may be more specific than the micro-contexts 301 .
- the corpus 330 is sized to suit the amount and type of information on the network 10 .
- the corpus 330 may be composed of portions of text from 100,000 to 200,000 web sites, or more, with each portion matched to a macro-context 303 .
- the entire corpus 330 may be between 10 Megabytes and 10 Gigabytes in size, or larger.
- a text comparison algorithm 336 may be provided to match text from the corpus 330 to the micro-contexts 301 , and then return the corresponding macro-context 303 .
- the text comparison algorithm 336 may combine several micro-contexts 301 to permit a more specific search, thereby narrowing the number of matching macro-contexts 303 .
- the context comparison module 302 will return a small number of macro-contexts 303 . However, this may not be possible for two reasons. First, if multiple, important, micro-contexts 301 are identified by the context construction module 300 , they might not appear together within any portion of the corpus 330 . In such a case, the context comparison module 302 may return a series of macro-contexts 303 that match some fraction of the important micro-contexts 301 . Although these macro-contexts may not precisely match a user's query, they may be ranked in order of likelihood that they will be relevant to the user. The ranking may be obtained by using the user history 318 and other factors, such as the number, probability, or nature of prior requests of the macro-context 303 by other users, to determine the probability that a given macro-context 303 is relevant to the user.
- the micro-contexts 301 may not even be found in the corpus 330 .
- a user may be referred to a user tracking module 338 , which provides a user with portals to access and search the network 10 directly.
- the user tracking module 338 permits the tool 110 to track a user's progress through the network 10 to obtain further context information for the current search, acquire more general information regarding contexts important to the user, or find important information not currently present within the corpus 330 .
- a rapid mining module 339 may also be accessed while the user tracking module 338 is operating, to add nodes 52 , or sites 52 , to the corpus 330 and to process them through the databasing module 114 “on the fly,” or while the user is accessing the tool 110 . These may be sites 52 visited by the user or suggested by the user's query.
- a user may once again be referred to the input module 116 , in order to provide additional text inputs, or the context comparison module 302 may resume operation to process the micro-contexts 301 through new additions to the corpus 330 .
- the information matching module 304 receives macro-contexts 303 from the context comparison module 302 and compares them to an indexed database 350 .
- the indexed database 350 contains specific information 306 of the type desired by the user, indexed by macro-contexts 354 identical or similar to those provided by the context comparison module 302 .
- the information matching module 304 can find the portion of specific information 306 that correlates to the macro-contexts 303 provided by the context comparison module 302 .
- the specific information 306 located by the information matching module 304 may then be returned to the presentation module 122 to be presented to a user.
- the presentation module 122 is preferably flexible in its operation. For example, the depth and breadth of specific information 306 returned may be varied according to a user's preferences. Once the specific information 306 is located within the indexed database 350 , proximate information is easily gathered and returned. The order and arrangement of specific information 306 displayed may also be determined manually by a user or automatically by reference to the user history 318 .
- the indexed database 350 may be structured as a hierarchical database 400 .
- the hierarchical database 400 is configured like a tree, with general information at the top and more specific information below.
- a parcel of information 402 desired by a user is a specific portion, and is therefore near the bottom of the hierarchical database 400 .
- a user would locate the parcel of information 402 by navigating through the broadest classification 404 and through the branches 406 , 408 , and 410 .
- a user might find this path difficult or even impossible to find, particularly if the user knows little about the parcel of information 402 , the organizational scheme in which it resides, or the related elements in the hierarchy, and therefore little about where it should be classified.
- the current invention permits a user to navigate across hierarchies straight to the parcel of information 402 .
- the hierarchical database 400 remains transparent to the user, who need not familiarize himself or herself with the structure of the hierarchical database 400 .
- the method disclosed herein provides horizontal navigation across a hierarchical database, in which the tool 110 intelligently determines exactly what the user is looking for and searches among the more specific, lower branches of the hierarchical database 400 to find it.
- One application of such a hierarchical, searchable database is to provide information about products for sale over the Internet.
- the presentation module 122 ultimately returns words to the user to denote the various products in the hierarchical database 400 that match the user's request.
- the presentation module 122 may, for example, be configured to sort products matching the user's request by brand, model, specifications, price, vendor, availability, distance to the vendor from the user, shipping cost, or any number of other relevant parameters.
- the login module 166 may operate to navigate a site 52 for a user, including forms presented by the site 52 to collect information from the user.
- the user may also be permitted to access the site 52 and conduct business on it without having to navigate the structure of the site 52 .
- the tool 110 as configured above is also well adapted for use without such a hierarchical structure.
- the context matching capabilities of the tool 110 make the tool 110 effective for improving the relevance and completeness of results to a query, regardless of what formats are used by the tool 110 to maintain and organize a local database. This is a vast improvement over current search engines, which typically search only for the exact text provided by the user, and thus deliver results that include irrelevant items and fail to include important information.
- the present invention provides a data extraction tool for extracting information from an information source. Extracted information is cataloged and indexed for future searching by a user. Although not limited to commerce, the method disclosed herein may be adapted to search for commerce-ready web sites on the Internet.
