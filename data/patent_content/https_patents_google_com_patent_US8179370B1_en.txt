Definitions
- This document relates to resolving keystrokes input into a keyboard.
- keyboards More and more people type information into electronic devices using keyboards for various work-related and personal reasons throughout their day, whether using a personal computer, laptop, or mobile communication device, to name a few examples. People have begun to expect a certain level of auto-correction of typographical errors when they are typing. The challenges of typing without error are further compounded when using a small-sized keyboard, for example, as found on a mobile communication device, such as a smartphone, or app phone. Since keys on such keyboards are typically much smaller than the average fingertip, two or more keys can accidentally be pressed when by a user intending to input a single character.
- This specification describes technologies relating to resolving keystrokes.
- the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods for resolving keystrokes which include receiving a first keystroke and a second keystroke input by a user on a keyboard.
- the first keystroke corresponds to a first key on the keyboard and the second keystroke corresponds to a second key on the keyboard that is different from the first key.
- the first keystroke and the second keystroke are determined to have been input at substantially the same time and the first key is determined to be adjacent the second key on the keyboard.
- a suggestion is generated that only one of the two keystrokes was intended to be input.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- the suggestion can be communicated to the user.
- Communicating the suggestion to the user that only one of the two keystrokes was intended to be input can include determining one or more permutations of character strings that include either a first character corresponding to the first key or a second character corresponding to the second key and one or more characters input by the user immediately preceding the two keystrokes.
- a probability for each of the one or more permutations that the permutation was the character string intended to be input by the user can be determined.
- One or more suggested character strings based on the determined probabilities can be displayed to the user on a display device.
- the first character and the second character preceded by the one or more characters input previously by the user can be displayed on the display device.
- An input can be received from the user selecting one of the suggested character strings.
- the characters input by the user can be replaced with the selected suggested character string.
- the one or more suggested character strings can include a permutation having at least some of the characters reordered from the order in which they were input by the user.
- Determining one or more permutations of character strings that include either the first character or the second character and one or more characters input by the user immediately preceding the two keystrokes can include determining permutations having at least one of the characters in the string replaced by a proximal character.
- a proximal character is a character that corresponds to a key on the keyboard adjacent a key that corresponds to the character input by the user.
- An input can be received from the user indicating a termination of a character string.
- Permutations of character strings that include either a first character corresponding to the first key or a second character corresponding to the second key and one or more other characters input by the user in the same character string can be determined. For each permutation, a probability can be determined that the permutation is the character string intended to be input by the user. If the permutation with the highest probability has a probability exceeding a predetermined threshold confidence, then the permutation with the highest probability can be selected and automatically replace the characters input by the user. Otherwise, one or more suggested character strings based on the probabilities can be displayed to the user.
- a second set of permutations of character strings that include both the first character and the second character and one or more other characters input by the user in the same character string can be determined.
- a probability that the permutation is the character string intended to be input by the user can be determined.
- One or more of the most probable of the second set of permutations of character strings can be suggested to the user in addition to the one or more most probable permutations that include only the first character or the second character.
- a third keystroke corresponding to a third key input by the user on the keyboard can be received.
- a determination that the third keystroke was input at substantially the same time as the first and second keystrokes and that the third key is adjacent at least one of either the first key or the second key can be made.
- a suggestion can be generated that only one of the three keystrokes was intended to be input.
- a typing mistake incurred by a user inadvertently pressing two or more keys on a keyboard which can be a frequent error if using a small-sized keyboard (e.g., a real or virtual keyboard on a mobile electronic device), can be quickly identified and corrected.
- a user can be presented with one or more suggested options to replace what he has typed, and can easily select an option with minimal effort. For example, if using a device that has a touch screen, a user can touch the screen to select a character string to replace what he typed in error. Alternatively, the character string as typed can be automatically corrected with no further input from the user.

- FIG. 6 shows examples of generic computer devices that may be used to execute the actions discussed in this document.
- FIG. 1A is a conceptual diagram of an example electronic device that can be used to implement a keystroke resolution system.
- the electronic device 100 is a mobile communication device (e.g., a mobile telephone) that includes a keyboard 102 .
- the keyboard 102 is relatively small as compared to the user's hand.
- each key is smaller than the pad of a typical adult user's finger.
- errors due to a finger accidentally pressing two or more keys at the same time (or substantially the same time) can occur frequently.
- Systems and techniques are described here to identify and resolve these types of typographical errors.
- a hard keyboard is a keyboard with keys that must be pressed by a user to select a key and input a keystroke.
- a soft, or virtual, keyboard is a keyboard image shown on a touchable display screen (touch screen). Images of keys are depicted, which the user can touch (via a touch sensitive overlay, such as a capacitive screen) to select a key and input a keystroke.
- a user typically does not select two keys at once when using a soft keyboard. If the user touches a spot on the keyboard image that is between two keys, usually the closest key to the touch is assumed to be the intended keystroke, and two keystrokes are not received as input for a single touch.
- a soft keyboard may interpret a touch between two keys as inputting two keystrokes corresponding to the two keys. Additionally, in some instances, the user may actually press the keyboard twice, thereby inadvertently inputting two keystrokes corresponding to two adjacent keys nearly simultaneously. In such instances, the systems and techniques described can be use to resolve the keystrokes.
- the user is using an e-mail application executing on the mobile electronic device 100 to input text into an e-mail message using a keyboard 102 .
- the user is attempting to type the word “meet” and has accidentally pressed both the “r” and “t” keys with his finger 104 , which are adjacent each other on the keyboard, instead of just the “t” key.
- the keys were pressed simultaneously or nearly simultaneously, and as shown on the display screen 106 , the input reads “meert” rather than “meet”.
- the timing of the two keystrokes and the location of the two corresponding keys on the keyboard 102 can be used to identify that the user pressed two adjacent keys at nearly the same time.
- This information can be used to generate suggested replacement character strings if a spelling error is detected, or to perform an auto-correct of the typed characters, where the two keystrokes are treated as a single keystroke. That is, the two characters that were input as a result of the two keystrokes, the “r” and the “t”, can be coalesced into a single entity containing both the characters.
- a character string correction algorithm can treat them as a single character that could be either “r” or “t”, or in some implementations a different character that corresponds to a different proximate key, when attempting to resolve a detected spelling error.
- the system shown includes a computer system 202 that is operatively connected to a display device 204 and a keyboard 206 .
- the example computer system 202 shown includes a RAM (random access memory) 208 , user interface 210 and CPU (central processing unit) 212 and a disc 214 .
- the disc 214 stores code for an operating system 216 and applications 218 .
- the applications 218 can include various applications that receive user input by a keyboard, for example, a word processing application, an e-mail application, a web browser application, or a calendar application. With reference to the example shown in FIG. 1A , the particular application implementing the keystroke resolution process is an e-mail application.
- the computer system 202 further includes a keystroke resolution system 220 .
- the keystroke resolution system 220 includes a potential error detector 225 , permutations module 226 , a probabilities module 228 , a selection module 230 and a dictionary 228 .
- the potential error detector 225 is configured to detect that two keystrokes were input within a predetermined time interval that suggests that the corresponding keys were pressed simultaneously or near simultaneously, and that the two keys are within a predetermined proximity to each other on the keyboard 206 .
- the predetermined proximity can require the two keys be adjacent each other.
- the predetermined time interval can be selected to be sufficiently short, so as to detect instances of a finger pressing two keys together accidentally, as compared to the finger deliberately pressing two adjacent keys one after the other.
- wpm words per minute
- each word has an average of five characters, and therefore a total of 6 downward keystrokes
- 60 wpm translates to approximately 360 keystrokes/minute or one keystroke every 167 milliseconds (ms). Therefore, if a user is typing in a consistent, deliberate manner, he or she will type one keystroke approximately every 167 ms.
- Typing on a small-sized keyboard is typically slower than on a full-sized keyboard.
- the two (or more) corresponding keystrokes will be input near simultaneously, i.e., within a much smaller interval than 167 ms.
- the predetermined time interval is set to 50 ms. That is, if two keystrokes are input at approximately the same time, they will be input less than 50 ms apart from one another.
- the permutations module 222 can determine permutations of the characters received forming a character string, with the characters input by the two simultaneous keystrokes treated as a single character.
- the user has input the character string MEERT.
- a character string is a set of one or more characters that follow a word separator, e.g., a space or punctuation mark, or are otherwise identifiable as forming a word or portion of a word.
- the first character in the string M immediately precedes a space after the word “Let's”, indicating the beginning of a new word or character string.
- the permutations module 222 is configured to treat the two simultaneously-input characters as a single character and determines at least the following two character string permutations: MEET and MEER.
- the permutations can be checked against entries in one or more dictionaries, represented in the system as dictionary 228 , for a match. More than one match can be found.
- the probabilities module 224 can determine a probability that each match is the correct character string. For example, immediately after inputting the R and T, but before inputting a space, or other indicator of a word termination, it is not known if the characters in the string represent the beginning of a word or an entire word.
- the dictionary 228 can include the entry MEET for the 4-letter word “meet”, but can also include the entry MEERKAT, i.e., the small mammal belonging to the mongoose family. It is possible the user was beginning to type the word MEERKAT.
- the probabilities module 224 can determine probabilities that the user was intending to input MEET and MEERKAT. In this example, since “meet” is a word occurring much more frequently in the English language than “meerkat”, the character string “meet” is given a higher probability than the character string “meer”.
- the permutations module 222 determines permutations that include replacing one or more of the other characters in the string with a character corresponding to a key that is proximate on the keyboard 206 to the key corresponding to the character that was actually input. For example, referring to the keyboard 102 in FIG. 1A , the key 108 corresponding to the character W is adjacent the key 110 corresponding to the character E. The permutations module can substitute the character W for instances of the character E when determining the various possible permutations of the character string. An example of some of the permutations that can be determined by the permutations module 222 is shown in Table 1 below.
- the permutations in Table 1 above do not show an exhaustive list, but are representative of some of the permutations that can be determined by replacing various of the characters with characters corresponding to adjacent keys on the keyboard.
- the 4 th character in the string is either an R or a T but not both, or is a character corresponding to a key adjacent to either the R or the T on the keyboard, e.g., an E, F, G or Y.
- the character string with the highest probability of being the correct string is the second row in Table 1, that is, the word “meet”. The probability can be higher if less of the originally input characters are replaced (i.e., the “delta” is lower).
- the string MEET has only the 4-th character corrected by selecting between either R or T.
- the string MEWT in row 8 has the 3 rd character, which was input as an E replaced with a W and the 4 th character, which was input was R/T replaced with T—therefore 2 deltas.
- the word correction algorithm can generate permutations based on assuming that one or more characters have been transposed, e.g., that the user input the 1 st character and the 2 nd character out of order, and generate permutations to account for both possibilities.
- the selection module 226 can be configured to select one or more of the permutations based on their corresponding probabilities. If a word terminator has been received, for example after the user inputs a space following the character T, then the selection module 226 can determine whether one of the permutations has a probability meeting a threshold confidence level, and if so, automatically correct the character string. That is, the character string MEERT can be replaced with the character string MEET automatically after receiving the spacebar keystroke input by the user. If the probability that MEET was the correct character string was not high enough, then the selection module 226 can select to display the permutation as a suggested character string on the display screen 204 , perhaps along with one or more other suggested character strings having relatively high probabilities.
- the dictionary 228 can be a dynamically updated dictionary, stored either on the device itself or a remote system.
- the terms in the dictionary and the probabilities of the occurrences of those terms may be updated periodically, for example, using search query submission information for a public search engine, by using new story information, or by other mechanisms. For example, when a natural disaster or similar event occurs, many users of a search engine begin to submit queries regarding the location of the disaster and other related topics so that they can learn more about the situation. In a like manner, the user of a particular device may be assumed to be more likely to enter such terms based on a general public level of interest in such events.
- the new terms may be added to the user's dictionary 228 , at least temporarily, and/or their probabilities may be increased.
- Various mechanisms may be used so as to properly blend the probabilities of “background” terms in the dictionary that are normal parts of the language whose popularity does not change much over time, with “transient” terms whose probabilities should be raised for a time period but then trend back to their regular levels.
- FIG. 1B A second illustrative example is shown in FIG. 1B .
- the user has input additional keystrokes, the most recent corresponding to the characters W and E.
- the W and E characters correspond to adjacent keys on the keyboard, and in this example were input within 50 ms of each other.
- the potential error detector 225 has therefore detected that the W and E potentially have erroneously been input as two characters when only one character was intended.
- the permutations module 222 can determine permutations of 5-character strings, where the 5th character is either a W or an E but not both, or can be another character that corresponds to a key adjacent to either the W or E keys on the keyboard.
- the system can also be configured to determine word completion permutations.
- the permutation module determines as one permutation the character string BURGE.
- the dictionary does not include an entry for BURGE but does include an entry for BURGER. Since a word terminator has not been received as input, i.e., the user has not pressed a space bar or input a punctuation mark following the E input, the string BURGER is a probable word completion for the characters already received as input.
- word completions can be suggested to the user in addition to one or more suggested permutations of the characters input by the user, e.g., by displaying them on the display screen.
- the text “Did you mean?” 120 is displayed to the user beneath the field where he is typing, and two suggested character strings are shown, BURGE 122 and BURGER 124 . If the display screen 106 is a touch screen, the user can touch one of the suggested strings to select the string to replace what was typed, otherwise, the user can use a different type of input mechanism to make the selection (e.g., a roller ball).
- the system can determine that the probability the 5 th character was supposed to be the character E is high enough that the string BURGWER is automatically corrected and changed to BURGER. That is, inputting the word terminator (pressing the spacebar) can trigger the selection module 226 to enter an auto-correct mode, if a suggested permutation has a probability exceeding a predetermined threshold confidence. In this example, the selection module finds BURGER to have a high enough probability to automatically correct the character string without requiring additional input from the user.
- a word terminator e.g., a space
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example process 300 for resolving keystrokes.
- the process 300 can be described in reference to the example system 200 shown in FIG. 2 and the example mobile electronic device 100 shown in FIG. 1 . However, it should be understood the process 300 can be implemented using a differently configured system or device.
- a first keystroke and a second keystroke are received (box 302 ), such as on a physical or virtual keyboard.
- the first keystroke can correspond to the character W and the second keystroke can correspond to the character E.
- a determination is then made whether the first and second keystrokes were received substantially simultaneously (box 304 ). For example, if the second keystroke was input within a predetermined time interval of the first keystroke, e.g., within 50 ms, then the second keystroke can be determined to have been input substantially simultaneously with the first keystroke (“Yes” branch of box 304 ). If the first and second keystrokes were not input substantially simultaneously (“No” branch of box 304 ), then the process can terminate with respect to these two keystrokes.
- a proximate key refers to an adjacent key on the keyboard.
- the determination can be made by the potential error detector 225 .
- keyboard information is stored and can be checked to determine the relative location of keys to one another, since not all keyboards have the same arrangement.
- Information about the keyboard 206 for the particular system 200 can be accessed to determine whether the E key is adjacent the R key, if the E keystroke was received within the predetermined time interval with the R keystroke.
- an electronic file e.g., an XML file, can be used that specifies the positions and sizes of keys included in the keyboard, from which a determination can be made whether two keys are adjacent each other.
- the process can terminate with respect to these two keystrokes. If the process 300 terminates with respect to these two keystrokes, and a new keystroke is received, the process can begin again for a second iteration. In the second iteration, the new keystroke is the “second keystroke” and the second keystroke from the previous iteration is now the “first keystroke”.
- the permutations of character strings made up of the characters input by the user can be determined (box 308 ).
- the permutations module 222 can determine strings having 5 characters based on the received input of BURG and W/E, where the W/E inputs are treated as a single character.
- different characters can be substituted for one or more of the other characters as well, based on key proximity, e.g., the B can be replaced with a V, G or N—which correspond to keys adjacent the B-key on the keyboard.
- permutations can also be determined that take into account the possibility that the W and E inputs were intended as two separate inputs and that the character string is a 6-character string and not a 5-character string. For example, a first set of permutations can be determined for 5-character strings where the W/E inputs are treated as a single character. A second set of permutations can be determined for 6-character strings, e.g., the following:
- probabilities of the permutations are determined (box 310 ).
- the probabilities module 224 can compare the permutations to entries in the dictionary 228 and determine a probability that the permutation is the correct character string.
- a different weighting can be applied to the two sets of permutations. That is, a higher weighting can be applied to the probabilities of the character strings in the first set (i.e., the permutations with 5-characters) as compared to a weighting applied to the probabilities of the character strings in the second set (i.e., the permutations with 6-characters).
- the weighting which can be referred to as a confidence level, can therefore favor the first scenario, but still allow for a permutation from the second scenario being selected.
- an auto-correct mode can be triggered. That is, if the most probable permutation has a probability exceeding a predetermined threshold confidence (“Yes” branch of box 316 ), then the character string input by the user can be automatically corrected with the most probable permutation (box 320 ). Otherwise, if the probability is too low, even for the most probable permutation, then one or more suggested permutations can be displayed to the user, without making any automatic changes to his input (box 314 ). The user can then input a selection of one of the suggested permutations (“yes” branch of box 318 ), following which input the selected permutation can replace the character string that was input by the user (box 320 ). If the user does not input a selection (“no” branch of box 318 ), the process can end.
- one or more suggested permutations can be displayed on the display screen.
- the selections module 226 can select the top N permutations based on their determined probabilities to be displayed on the display 204 for presentation to the user.
- FIG. 1B an example screen shot is shown where two permutations are displayed to the user: BURGE and BURGER. This screen shot was discussed above in the context of suggesting a word completion, i.e., completing the string BURGE with an R to form the word BURGER. However, this screen shot can also be used to illustrate an example where both 5-character and 6-character strings are determined by the permutations module 222 .
- the 5-character string BURGE and the 6-character string BURGER are the two permutations with the highest probabilities, after applying a higher confidence level to the 5-character permutations.
- the user may select one of the suggested permutations (i.e., “yes” branch of box 318 ) and the character string is replaced (Box 320 ), or not (i.e., “no” branch of box 318 ) and the process with respect to these two keystrokes ends.
- a user may next input a new keystroke and the process can begin again for a next iteration, where the new keystroke is the “second keystroke” and the previously input keystroke (i.e., the second keystroke in the last iteration of the process) now becomes the first keystroke. That is, a character corresponding to the new keystroke can be used to determine permutations of the now-lengthened character string.
- the new keystroke is a word terminator, e.g., a space or punctuation mark
- an auto-correct mode can be triggered, and if the most probable permutation determined in the previous iteration exceeded a threshold confidence, the characters can automatically be corrected to correspond to the most probable permutation of the character string.
- the process 300 can be used to resolve more than one keystroke error in one word. That is, the process 300 can be used as described above to resolve the W/E input error in the character string BURGE. The user can then input a new keystroke, to complete the word, and instead of pressing R may press R/T, i.e., two adjacent keys, substantially simultaneously. In a subsequent iteration of the process, the R/T keystrokes can also be resolved.
- the process 300 was described in the context of receiving two keystrokes corresponding to adjacent keys on a keyboard substantially simultaneously. However, it should be understood the process 300 can be used in the context of receiving more than two keystrokes in this manner.
- a user inputting keystrokes into a small keyboard may press three (or even more) keystrokes substantially simultaneously. For example, when attempting to input the character D, the user may press D, S and E at substantially the same time.
- the process 300 can be used to resolve such an error.
- the first, second and third keystrokes can be determined to be received substantially simultaneously and in Box 306 the three keystrokes can be determined to correspond to proximate keys on the keyboard.
- the three characters D/S/E can be treated as a single character for the purpose of determine permutations of character strings that include either D, S or E but not all three, in a similar manner as described in the two character example.
- word completions can be determined. For example, as previously discussed in reference to FIG. 1B , since the character string BURGE is not a word in the dictionary 228 , a word that begins with that character string can be found in the dictionary 228 , i.e., the word BURGER. Permutations determined to complete words can form a third set of permutations. In the above example, the word was completed by adding a character to the end of the character string. In other examples, a word can be completed by adding a character to a different position in the word. For example, if a user inputs URGER, a comparison to entries in the dictionary 228 can determine, with a high probability, that the correct character string begins with the character B and complete the word by adding a B to the beginning of the string.
- a different level of confidence i.e., weighting
- the highest confidence is given to the first set of permutations (i.e., character strings formed from the characters input by the user together with the simultaneous keystrokes treated as a single input)
- the next highest confidence is given to the second set of permutations (i.e., character strings formed using the characters input by the user and treating the simultaneous keystrokes as two inputs) and the lowest confidence is given to the word-completion-permutations.
- the permutations determined in all three sets can be merged to generate a selection of permutations ranked with the most probable permutations at the top of the selection.
- the dictionary is structured as a prefix tree dictionary, which (optionally) can be read directly off flash memory included in an electronic device, e.g., in device 100 shown in FIG. 1A .
- FIG. 4 shows a portion of an example prefix tree dictionary 400 . The portion shown is simplified and was selected for illustrative purposes, to be discussed in reference to the following example.
- the user inputs three keystrokes corresponding to the characters A, S and D.
- the example is described in terms of searching the tree for a 3-character string.
- the tree can be searched for 2-character strings. That is, the S/D keystrokes can be treated as one input rather than two.
- the dictionary includes the words ASK, ASKS, ADD and ADVICE beginning with the character A 402 and includes the words SAD and SAT beginning with the character S 404 .
- Words beginning with the character A are searched in the prefix tree 400 because the user's first input corresponds to the character A. However, the key for A is adjacent to the key for S on the keyboard, so words beginning with the character S are also searched.
- the third character input by the user was a D.
- the D key is not proximate to (i.e., adjacent) either the K, V or T keys, so words having either of those characters in the third-letter-position (i.e., ASK*, ADV* and SAT) are eliminated.
- the word ADD is not eliminated because: the first character corresponds to the user input (A); the second character corresponds to the D key which is adjacent the S key on the keyboard, where S was the user input; and the third character also corresponds to the user input (D).
- the word SAD is not eliminated because: the first character corresponds to the S key which is adjacent the A key on the keyboard, where A was the user input; the second character corresponds to the A key which is adjacent the S key on the keyboard, where S was the user input; and the third character corresponds to the user input (D).
- Each word in the prefix tree 400 can include (or be associated with) a frequency of the word occurring (shown as f in FIG. 4 ).
- the frequency for ADD (f 3 ) is 200 and the frequency for SAD (f 6 ) is 200, that is, they have the same frequency.
- the frequency can be used as a basis for determining the probability that the word is the correct character string.
- other factors can be used to boost the probability.
- the number of “deltas” for each word can boost the word's probability.
- a delta refers to the number of characters in the word that are changed as compared to the user's input. In this example, the user input the characters ASD, and therefore the word ADD has 1 delta and the word SAD has 2 deltas.
- the dictionary may also be a dynamic dictionary, in that the terms in the dictionary and the probabilities or those terms may be updated in response to current events, such as the text in news stories or in user-submitted queries to a search engine.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of an example system 500 that provides user interaction in response to touch screen inputs.
- the system 500 may be implemented using a mobile electronic device such as device 502 .
- the device 502 includes various input and output mechanisms such as a touch screen display 505 and a roller ball 506 .
- a number of components within device 502 may be configured to provide various selection functionality on display 505 , such as keystroke resolution for simultaneously entered keystrokes, as discussed above.
- One such component is a display manager 512 , which can be responsible for rendering content for presentation on display 505 .
- the display manager 512 can receive graphic-related content from a number of sources and can determine how the content is to be provided to a user. For example, a number of different windows for various applications 510 on the device 505 may need to be displayed, and the display manager 512 may determine which to display, which to hide, and what to display or hide when there is overlap between various graphical objects.
- the display manager 512 can include various components to provide the device 502 with particular functionality for interacting with displayed components, which may be shared across multiple applications, and may be supplied, for example, by an operating system of device 502 .
- An input manager 514 may be responsible for translating commands provided by a user of device 502 .
- commands may come from a keyboard, from touch screen display 505 , from roller ball 506 , or from other such sources, including dedicated buttons or soft buttons (e.g., buttons whose functions may change over time, and whose functions may be displayed on areas of display 505 that are adjacent to the particular buttons).
- the input manager 514 may determine, for example, in what area of the display commands are being received, and thus in what application being shown on the display the commands are intended for.
- the input manager 514 may interpret input motions on the touch screen 505 into a common format and pass those interpreted motions (e.g., short press, long press, flicks, and straight-line drags) to the appropriate application.
- the input manager 514 may also report such inputs to an event manager (not shown) that in turn reports them to the appropriate modules or applications.
- a variety of applications 510 may operate, generally on a common microprocessor, on the device 502 .
- the applications 510 may take a variety of forms, such as mapping applications, e-mail and other messaging applications, web browser applications, music and video players, and various applications running within a web browser or running extensions of a web browser.
- applications 510 that receive input from a user typing on the keyboard 504 can resolve typographical errors using the keystroke resolution system 516 . That is, keystrokes input substantially simultaneously and corresponding to adjacent keys on the keyboard 504 can be treated as a single input. The character corresponding to the single input can be resolved using various techniques, e.g., the process 300 described above in reference to FIG. 3 .
- a wireless interface 508 manages communication with a wireless network, which may be a data network that also carries voice communications.
- the wireless interface may operate in a familiar manner, such as according to the examples discussed below, and may provide for communication by the device 502 with messaging services such as text messaging, e-mail, and telephone voice mail messaging.
- the wireless interface 508 may support downloads and uploads of content and computer code over a wireless network.
- maps/lists/etc storage 517 includes all sorts of data to be used by applications 510 , and can include lists of data elements, graphical components like map tiles, and a variety of other well known data structures so that a user can interact with applications on device 502 .
- Other storage includes user defaults 518 , which may be profile information for a user stored on the same media as maps/links/etc. storage 517 .
- the user defaults 518 include various parameters about a user of the device 502 .
- the user profile may include data defining the manner in which the user prefers to have panning controls presented on the display 505 (e.g., what the controls should look like, whether a list should scroll with the control or in the opposite direction of the control, the actions by the user that will bring up the control, etc.).
- the device 502 may provide particular actions in response to user inputs. Specifically, the device 502 may respond to zooming and panning inputs within a large-scale graphical space in particular ways, including by displaying a navigation control that permits zooming and panning in the space.
