Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to identifying one or more applications as being potentially of interest to a user in view of a selected application within an application marketplace.
- Mobile computing devices may run a variety of software applications that extend existing device capabilities and that add new capabilities. Many types of applications are generally available, such as applications for information retrieval, communications and entertainment. Applications may be created by mobile device manufacturers and/or third parties (e.g., application developers), and may be pre-installed by the manufacturer, or may be downloaded and installed by device users.
- third parties e.g., application developers
- Users may discover new applications through an interface associated with an on-line application marketplace by browsing a catalog of available applications. Additionally, information about new applications is generally available through advertising, industry reviews, "top 10" and “best” lists, and through word-of-mouth referrals.
- users may obtain, install, and use full versions of the applications, or users may access demonstration versions of the application that allow the users to try the application out with or without purchasing. Over time, users may keep applications, upgrade applications (e.g., from a

- the users may often find it cumbersome to search through the application marketplace to discover other applications that can be suggested in view of a selected application.
- a degree of correspondence between a selected application and a target application is based on query log data. If the degree of correspondence between the selected application and the target application is sufficient, the target application is suggested (e.g., potentially of interest to a user) in view of the selected application. For example, applications that can be used for the same or similar purpose can be suggested in view of the other even though there may be no other direct correlation (e.g., same developer) between the applications.
- a user can search for applications that are available through the application marketplace by entering search terms into a query field provided in a user interface of the application marketplace.
- a resultant query can be transmitted to the application marketplace, which searches available applications to identify one or more applications that correspond to the query.
- the application marketplace can return a listing of the one or more applications to the computing device.
- the user can then select an application from the listing displayed on the computing device.
- detailed information regarding the selected application can be presented to the user via the computing device.
- a list of one or more suggested applications in view of the selected application can also be displayed to the user in response to the user selection, as discussed in further detail below.
- the user can initiate installation of the selected application on the computing device.
- Information relating to the search queries, the selection of the applications for display of detailed information, application installations, application content, application ratings and the like can be stored in a database.
- the information can account for the search queries, requests for detailed information and installations of multiple users across multiple devices.
- application information can be processed to identify applications as suggested applications in view of a selected application. Suggested applications can be displayed in the application marketplace as being suggested applications in view of a selected application.

- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a system 300 that includes example components for identifying one or more applications as suggested applications in view of a selected application.
- the system 300 includes a query log database 302, a co-weight engine 304, an application database 306, a metadata engine 308, a suggested applications engine 310, and a suggested applications database 312.
- the query log database 302 provides information to the co-weight engine 304 in the form of a query log.
- the co-weight engine 304 processes the query log to generate an index of co-weights of applications (e.g., a degree of correspondence between applications).
- the index of co-weights of applications includes, for each application, a list of co-weights of applications that are suggested in view of the application. For example, a first application in the index of co-weights of applications includes a corresponding first list of co-weights of applications that are suggested in view of the first application, and a second application in the index of co-weights of applications includes a corresponding second list of applications that are suggested in view of the second application.
- the query log database 302 includes information relating to queries input to the application marketplace application.
- the information can include, for example, events.
- Example events can include clicks or installs, discussed in further detail herein.
- the query log can further include a note indicating that the event originated from a position within a list of search results for a particular query.
- the query log is processed to generate a first mapping 305 of queries to a set of applications with the number of clicks and installs.
- the application database 306 stores information corresponding to the applications available for download to and installation on computing devices (e.g., the mobile device 200 of FIG. 2).
- the application database 306 provides an initial listing of applications stored in the application database 306 and information relating to the applications to the metadata engine 308.
- the metadata engine 308 processes this information to provide relevant metadata corresponding to each application.
- the metadata can include, for example, application name, developer name, rating, the price, category, whether an application is of a particular content (e.g., adult content), and the like.
- the metadata engine 308 provides the metadata of the applications to the suggested applications engine 310.
- the suggested applications engine 310 receives the initial listing of applications stored in the application database 306 and associated metadata from the metadata engine 308 and the index of co-weights of applications from the co- weight engine 304.
- the application database 306 provides the initial listing of applications to the suggested applications engine 310.
- the suggested applications engine 310 removes application pairs from the initial listing of applications that are not identified as suggested based on the metadata to generate a filtered listing of application pairs.
- the suggested applications engine 310 processes the filtered listing of application pairs in view of the index of co-weights of applications to generate an index of suggested applications, as discussed in further detail below.
- the suggested applications engine 310 provides the index of suggested applications to the suggested applications database 312.
- the suggested applications database 312 stores the index of suggested applications.
- the suggested applications database 312 makes the index of suggested applications available to the application marketplace.
- the co-weight engine 304 determines the co-weights between application pairs based on information provided from the query log database 302. As discussed above, information (e.g., events) in the query log database 302 can be processed to provide the first mapping 305 relating each query (Q) to the applications (App) that were identified as being a search result of the query.
- the first mapping 305 further includes, for each application of each corresponding query, a number of clicks (C) and a number of installs (I) of the application.
- the query Q-i of the first mapping 305 generated search results that included App1 and App2 (i.e., when users entered the query Q-i, App1 and App2 were presented as search results corresponding to the query Q-i).
- App1 includes a corresponding number of clicks (Ci , i) and a
- App2 includes a corresponding number of clicks (C 2, i) and a corresponding number of installs (l 2 ,i) that resulted from App2 being a search result of the query Qi.
- a click indicates that a searching user at least clicked on the application from the search results to garner more information regarding the application.
- an install indicates that a searching user actually downloaded and installed the application.
- the co-weight engine 304 generates a hash for each of the queries (Q) of the first mapping 305 to generate a second mapping from the query hashes to the applications. For each application of each query, the co-weight engine 304 determines a weighting for each application based on the number of clicks and the number of installs to generate a third mapping from the query hashes to the applications. The co-weight engine 304 determines the total weight for each application across each of the query hashes, determines co-weights for each application pair, and normalizes the co-weights for each application pair.
- the co-weight engine 304 includes the normalized weight for the particular application pair in the index of co-weights of applications. If the normalized weight of the particular application pair is less than the threshold, the co-weight engine 304 does not include the normalized weight of the particular application pair in the index of co-weights of applications .
- the co-weight engine 304 generates the first mapping (e.g., the first mapping 305) from the queries (Q) to the applications (App) that are provided as search results in response to the respective query based on information provided from the query log database 302.
- the present example includes four queries (QrQ ); however, the example applies to any number of queries.
- a mapping is generated to applications (Appm) provided as search results of the corresponding query.
- the queries are mapped to the applications as follows:
- the first mapping provided above is merely an example for purposes of illustration and the number of applications that can be mapped to a particular query is not limited to the example number of applications provided therein.
- C m , n indicates the total of times the application m was clicked on and l m , n indicates the total number of times the application m was installed on devices (e.g., mobile computing devices).
- a click of an application, or otherwise selection of the application by the user includes displaying detailed information regarding the "clicked on" application to the user.
- the co-weight engine 304 cleans the queries and generates a hash for each of the queries of the first mapping to provide a second mapping from the query hashes to the applications.
- cleaning of the queries can include removing punctuation from queries, reordering search terms of the queries, removing duplicate terms in the search queries, and the like.
- the second mapping can be provided as follows:
- the co-weight engine 304 determines a weighting based on the number of clicks and the number of installs to provide a third mapping. Specifically, the co-weight engine 304 determines the weight (w m n ) for each application (Appm). In some implementations, the weight can be determined in accordance with the following relationship:
- variable a alters the weighting applied to the number of installs for the application.
- the value of a can be greater than 1 such that the number of installs of the application is weighted more heavily than the number of clicks for the application.
- the third mapping can be provided as follows:
- the co-weight engine 304 determines the total weight for each application across each of the query hashes.
- the co-weight engine 304 sums the squares of each weight for the applications across all of the query hashes. Specifically, the total weight for each application can be determined based on the following relationships:
- the co-weight engine 304 determines co-weights for each application pair.
- the weights w 2 ,3 and w 2,4 are zero (i.e., weights w 2 ,3 and w 2,4 are not present in the current non-limiting example).
- App1 App2(awi, 2 ), App3(awi, 3 )
- the co-weight engine 304 normalizes the co-weights for each application pair.
- the normalized co-weights are as follows:
- App1 ⁇ App2(nwi, 2 ), App3(nwi, 3 ) where nw x,y (aw x,y / (tw x + tw y ).
- the normalized weight is a factor identifying a degree to which applications in an application pair are related.
- the normalized weight for each application pair can be considered a score and can be compared to a threshold normalized weight. If the normalized weight for a particular application pair is above the threshold normalized weight, the co-weight engine 304 outputs the co-weight of the particular application pair in the index of co-weights of applications . If the normalized weight for the particular application pair is less than the threshold normalized weight, the co-weight engine 304 does not output the co-weight of the particular application pair in the index of co-weights of applications .
- the co-weight engine 304 includes the co- weight nw-1 ,2 in the index of co-weights of applications . If, however, nwi ,2 is less than the threshold nw T HR, the co-weight engine 304 does not include the co-weight nwi ,2 in the index of co-weights of applications .
- the co-weight engine 304 generates the index of co-weights of applications based on the normalized co-weights that have a normalized weight above the threshold normalized weight.
- the index of co- weights of applications includes, for each application, a list of co-weights of applications that are above the threshold normalized weight.
- App1 would include a corresponding list of co-weights of suggested applications, which list includes the normalized co-weights of App2 and App3.
- App2 would include a corresponding list of co-weights of suggested applications, which list includes the normalized co-weights of App1 ; and App3 would include a
- the suggested applications engine 310 receives the initial listing of applications stored in the application database 306 and associated metadata and the index of co-weights of applications.
- the metadata can include filter metadata and/or scoring metadata.
- the filter metadata includes metadata used to filter (e.g. remove) application pairs from the initial listing of applications , as described in detail below.
- the scoring metadata includes metadata used to determine, in conjunction with the normalized co-weight, an overall score of the application pair for identifying either application of the applications of an application pair as suggested in view of selection of the other application , as described in detail below. More specifically, the scoring metadata can be used to generate a metadata score, as discussed in further detail below. Certain metadata can be provided as both filter metadata and scoring metadata (i.e., can be used for both filtering and score calculation).
- the suggested applications engine 310 compares the filter metadata of applications in the initial listing of applications to generate a filtered listing of application pairs. If the filter metadata of the applications of a particular application pair correspond, the related applications engine 310 includes the particular application pair in the filtered listing of application pairs. If the filter metadata of the applications of the particular application pair do not correspond, the related applications engine 310 does not include the particular application pair in the filtered listing of application pairs. Further, in some implementations, if the filter metadata of any application of the particular application pair is not above a threshold, described in detail below, the application pair is removed from the filtered listing of application pairs.
- Filter metadata can include, for example, category metadata, content metadata, title metadata, description metadata, install metadata, rating metadata, locale metadata and developer score metadata.
- category metadata of applications of a particular application pair in the initial listing of applications can be compared. If it is determined that the applications correspond to the same category (e.g., games, entertainment, educational), the particular application pair is included in the filtered listing of application pairs. If, however, it is determined that the applications do not correspond to the same category, the particular application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs.
- the content metadata can indicate particular content of an application.
- the application content can include adult content, for example.
- the content metadata of applications of a particular application pair in the initial listing of applications stored in the application database 306 can be compared. If it is determined that the applications correspond to the same content (e.g., adult content), the particular application pair is included in the filtered listing of application pairs. If, however, it is determined that the applications do not correspond to the same content, the particular application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs.
- the content metadata of a first application in a particular application pair can indicate that the first application includes adult content
- the content metadata of a second application in the application pair can indicate that the related application does not include adult content.
- an application marketplace can exclude applications including pornographic content
- applications including content that may be deemed to be racy e.g., applications including content related to lingerie, and/or content related to erotic novels
- other adult themes can still be available from the application marketplace.
- a comparison of the content metadata of the applications reveals that the content of the applications is different (i.e., the first application includes adult content and the second application does not include adult content). Consequently, the application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs.
- the title metadata of applications can be processed.
- the title metadata includes the title of the application that can be displayed to the user, for example, as application name 218 or 238, both shown in FIG. 2. If it is determined that at least one of the applications of a particular application pair includes an empty title (e.g., the title is blank), the particular application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs .
- the description metadata of applications can be processed.
- the description metadata includes information relating to a description of the application that can be displayed to the user.
- the description metadata can be provided by the developer of the application. If it is determined that at least one of the applications of a particular application pair includes an empty description (e.g., the description is blank), the particular application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs.
- the install metadata of applications can be processed. In some embodiments,
- the install metadata includes the total number of installations of the application across multiple computing devices (e.g., computing devices 102). If it is determined that the number of installs of at least one of the applications of a particular application pair is below a minimum number of installs, the application is not included in the filtered listing of applications.
- the install metadata includes an uninstall ratio of the application. The uninstall ratio is the number of uninstalls of the application per the number of installs of the application (e.g., after install of the application, the user uninstalls the application). If it is determined that the uninstall ratio of at least one of the applications of a particular application pair is above a maximum uninstall ratio, the application pair is not included in the filtered listing of applications.
- the rating metadata of applications can be processed. In some embodiments,
- the rating metadata includes a number of ratings of the application.
- the number of ratings is the total number of individual ratings associated with the application provided by users (e.g. the users 108) of the application. If it is determined that the total number of ratings of at least one of the applications of a particular application pair is below a minimum number of ratings, the particular application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs.
- the rating metadata includes the average rating of the application. The average rating of the application can be across any subset (or all) of users of the application. If it is determined that the average rating of at least one of the applications in a particular application pair is below a minimum average rating, the application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs.
- the locale metadata of applications can be compared.
- the locale metadata indicates data relating to geographic regions where the application is supported.
- the locale can indicate a country where the application is supported, for example, China or the United States.

If the locale information of applications of a particular application pair indicates an overlap, the application pair is included in the filtered listing of application pairs.
- the applications include a language overlap (e.g., both applications are provided in English) and/or a country overlap (e.g., both applications are available in the United States), the applications are deemed to correspond to the same locale and the corresponding application pair is included in the filtered listing of application pairs. If, however, it is determined that the applications do not correspond to the same locale, the corresponding application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs .
- a language overlap e.g., both applications are provided in English
- a country overlap e.g., both applications are available in the United States
- the developer score metadata of applications can be compared.
- the developer score can relate to a rating associated with the developer of the application.
- the developer rating can be based on historical ratings of applications provided by the developer or an average rating of applications provided by the developer. If it is determined that the developer score of at least one of the applications of a particular application pair is below a minimum score, the application pair is not included in the filtered listing of application pairs.
- the suggested applications engine 310 processes the scoring metadata of application in applications pairs to generate a metadata score (ms). Specifically, the suggested applications engine 310 compares the scoring metadata of the applications in the application pairs to generate the metadata score. The suggested applications engine 310 combines the normalized weight and the metadata score of the applications in the application pairs to provide an overall score, as discussed in further detail below.
- the scoring metadata can include, for example, title metadata, description metadata and permission metadata.
- the title metadata of applications in a particular application pair can be processed and a corresponding similarity score can be generated. Specifically, a similarity of the text of the title metadata of the applications is compared to generate a title similarity score.
- the description metadata of applications in a particular application pair can be processed and a similarity score, discussed in further detail below, can be generated. Specifically, a similarity of the text of the description metadata of the applications is compared to generate a description similarity score.
- the title metadata and the description metadata of the applications in a particular applications pair can be processed and similarity scores can be generated. For example, title metadata of one application and description metadata of another application can be processed to generate a title-description similarity score.
- the permissions metadata of the applications in a particular application pair can be processed and a
- the permissions metadata can include data related to permissions by the applications to accesses APIs (Application Programming Interface) of computing devices (e.g., the mobile device 200), such as the global positioning system (GPS) API or the API of a camera flash.
- APIs Application Programming Interface
- computing devices e.g., the mobile device 200
- GPS global positioning system
- the ConceptSimilarity UiV is the concept similarity score based on text associated with each of the applications. For example, important words in a document (e.g., the description of an application) can be extracted and expanded to determine the most similar words based on search patterns. For small documents, the expansion can be done directly.
- the concept similarity score for the documents is defined as a weighted sum of these concepts, where each concept is represented by a list of words.
- the TitleSimilahty u v is the title similarity score based on the similarity of the text of the title metadata between the applications u and v.
- the Title u Description v Similarity is the title-description similarity score based on the similarity of the text of the title metadata of application u and the text of the description metadata of application v.
- the Title v Deschption u Similarity is the title-description similarity score based on the similarity of the text of the title metadata of application v and the text of the description metadata of application u.
- the DescriptionSimilahty UiV is the description similarity score based on the similarity of the text of the description metadata between the applications u and v.
- the PermissionSimilarity u v is the permission similarity sore based on the similarity of the permissions metadata between the applications u and v.
- the variables ki - k 7 alter the weighting applied to the respective metadata scores that the variable is associated with.
- the final related applications engine 310 multiplies the metadata score (ms)with the square of the normalized weight (nw) to generate an overall score (os) for a pair of applications.
- the metadata score (ms) can be a calculation of any combination of the metadata scores (e.g., title, description, permissions).
- the suggested applications engine 310 can then compare the overall score for each application pair of the filtered listing of application pairs to an overall score threshold. The suggested applications engine 310 can then determine whether the applications in the application pair are sufficiently similar based on the overall score such that an application of the application pair can be identified as suggested in view of selection of the other application of the application pair in the index of suggested applications. If the overall score is above the overall score threshold, the suggested applications engine 310 determines that an application of the application pair can be identified as suggested in view of selection of the other application of the application pair. If the overall score is less than the overall score threshold, the suggested applications engine 310 determines that an application of the application pair cannot be identified as suggested in view of selection of the other application of the application pair. In some implementations, the suggested applications engine 310 generates the index of suggested applications based on the applications pairs that have an overall score above the overall score threshold.
- the overall score can be used to rank suggested applications for display.
- the suggested applications engine 310 determines that App2 and App3 are identified as suggested application in view of App1 based on the osi ,2 and osi ,3 , respectively.
- App2 and App3 can be displayed in a ranked order based on the overall scores for each application pair. For example, if the overall score osi ,2 is greater than the overall score os-1 ,3, App2 will be displayed higher in the ranked order than App3.
- the suggested applications engine 310 provides the index of suggested applications to the suggested applications database 312.
- the suggested applications database 312 stores the index of suggested applications, shown as mapping 316.
- the suggested applications database 312 makes the index of suggested
