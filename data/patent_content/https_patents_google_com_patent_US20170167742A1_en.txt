- the maximum current I BP (max) is set to a relatively modest value, such as 20 mA, for the case of inactive power stealing. Assuming a voltage of about 4.4 volts at node 725 , this corresponds to a maximum output power from the buck regulator system 724 of about 88 mW.
- This power level of 88 mW has been found to not accidentally trip the HVAC system into an “on” state due to the current following through the call relay coil.
- the PAB regulator 728 operates to discharge the battery 730 during any periods of operation in which the instantaneous thermostat electrical power load rises above 88 mW, and to recharge the battery (if needed) when the instantaneous thermostat electrical power load drops below 88 mW.
- the thermostat 700 is configured such that the average power consumption is well below 88 mW, and indeed for some embodiments is even below 10 mW on a long-term time average.
- the secondary processor 708 is configured by virtue of circuitry denoted “PS MOD” to turn, for example, the Y-Rc FET switch OFF for small periods of time during the active cooling call, wherein the periods of time are small enough such that the cooling call relay does not “un-trip” into an OFF state, but wherein the periods of time are long enough to allow inrush of current into the bridge rectifier 720 to keep the bridge output capacitor 722 to a reasonably acceptable operating level.
- this is achieved in a closed-loop fashion in which the secondary processor 708 monitors the voltage V BR at node 723 and actuates the signal Y-CTL as necessary to keep the bridge output capacitor 722 charged.
- a delay period such as 60-90 seconds, following the instantiation of an active heating/cooling cycle before instantiating the active power stealing process. This delay period has been found useful in allowing many real-world HVAC systems to reach a kind of “quiescent” operating state in which they will be much less likely to accidentally un-trip away from the active cooling cycle due to active power stealing operation of the thermostat 102 .
- this delay period has likewise been found useful in allowing the various HVAC systems to reach a quiescent state in which accidental tripping back into an active cooling cycle is avoided.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an example of a smart home environment, such as the smart home environment of FIG. 1 , within which one or more of the devices, methods, systems, services, and/or computer program products described further herein can be applicable.
- the depicted smart home environment includes a structure 150 , which can include, e.g., a house, office building, garage, or mobile home.

- the entities in a system for managing demand-response programs and events typically include a utility provider that provides electrical or other forms of energy from a power source (e.g., an electrical generator) to individual's homes or businesses.
- the individuals typically pay for the amount of energy they consume on a periodic, e.g., monthly, basis.
- an energy management system is disposed between the utility provider and the individuals.
- the energy management system operates to intelligently and effectively shift energy consumption of the individuals from one particular time period to other time periods. Such energy shifting is usually performed so as to shift energy consumption from a high energy cost period to a low energy cost period. In the case of DR events, energy is shifted from the DR event period to time periods outside of the DR event period.
- the energy management system includes an intelligent, network-connected thermostat located at the individual's homes or businesses.
- a thermostat can acquire various information about the residence, such as a thermal retention characteristic of the residence, a capacity of an HVAC associated with the residence to cool or heat the residence, a likelihood of the residence being occupied (via occupancy sensors that, over time, can build an occupancy probability profile), a forecasted weather, a real-time weather, a real-time occupancy, etc.
- the thermostat can be programmed by its users or may learn, over time, the preferences and habits of its users to set scheduled setpoints.
- a population of such network-connected thermostats associated with a respective population of individual homes and businesses are configured to communicate with one or more central servers managed by one or more cloud service providers.
- Each network-connected thermostat is associated with one or more accounts managed by the cloud service provider(s), and data is sent back and forth as needed between each network-connected thermostat and the central server(s) for providing a variety of advantageous functionalities such as facilitating remote control, reporting weather data, reporting HVAC control data and status information, and providing the centralized and/or partially centralized controlling and data communications required to carry out the DR-related, time-of-use (TOU)-related, and/or real-time pricing functionalities described herein.
- TOU time-of-use
- the energy management system Prior to a DR event, based on a wealth of information the energy management system possesses regarding the residences it is managing, the energy management system can effectively predict how much energy a residence is likely to consume over an given period, such as over a DR event. Moreover, given the wealth of information regarding the residences, the energy management system may also generate variations to the residence's baseline thermostat setpoints that can be implemented during the DR event period. The variations can be made so that that the residence consumes less energy over the DR event period.
- the energy management system may also accurately predict the amount of energy likely to be reduced over the DR event period or, in other words, shifted from the DR event period to one or more time periods outside (e.g., shouldering) the DR event period.
- the described provisions for such energy consumption prediction and management brings about many advantages as described further hereinbelow. For example, not only does it allow the energy management system to effectively manage the energy consumption of a number of connected residences, but it also allows the energy management system to intelligently select a subset of residences from a large pool for participation in DR programs or events.
- the physical characteristics of residences and habitual tendencies of occupants of those residents vary widely across regions, and thus the potential energy savings/shifting also varies widely.
- the energy management system disclosed herein may intelligently choose the participants in an energy savings program to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.
- the energy management system may also provide portals so that other interested parties, such as utility companies, may similarly have access to such information.
- the utility company similarly has interests in accessing such energy-related characteristics of the various residences individually and in the aggregate so as to more efficiently and effectively generate and manage DR events.
- a utility portal is disclosed that enables the utility provider access to consumer-level energy-related information at a variety of levels of detail and complexity, for facilitating both economically smart and environmentally responsible decision making on resource planning and utilization.

- the depiction of system 800 in FIG. 8 should be taken as being illustrative in nature, and not as limiting the scope of the present teachings.
- the embodiments described herein may begin by scheduling electrical load usage across a variety of electrical devices (storage, electric vehicles, HVAC systems) or across a plurality of structures in a way that simultaneously minimizes overall energy costs, allows participation in load-shedding capacity markets, and maintains a comfortable environment for end-users.
- These embodiments may employ a centralized approach appropriate for control of a (i) large commercial or university campus, or (ii) a large collection of individual structures.
- These embodiments may operate on a time-scale of minutes, dispatching schedules to devices/structures under management that incorporate current information, as well as best available predictions.
- a general framework is developed to describe how device models for energy storage, electric vehicles, and/or HVAC systems fit into this approach and to describe cost functions corresponding to a typical commercial power bill and participation in DR programs.
- a feature of what is referred to herein as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheduler is the includes incorporation of predictions for various important quantities (e.g. uncontrolled device loads, EV driver availability, thermal response of buildings, etc.)
- MPC Model Predictive Control
- This approach can be applied to scheduling various electrical load combinations with the simultaneous goals of reducing electricity costs, supporting the grid through DR support, and keeping end-users happy.
- u 1 . . . , u n to be the power consumption of n devices with u i ⁇ T denoting the average power consumption of device i over a time horizon of length T.
- the convention can be adopted that (u i ) t ⁇ 0 signifies that a device (e.g., a battery) generates rather than consumes electricity during this time interval.
- (u i ) typically will have units in kW and define ⁇ to be the time constant corresponding to the length of the interval such that (u i ) corresponds to kWh's.
- time horizons over 12+ hours can typically be considered to cover an entire work day, and time intervals of 5 minutes to allow for sufficiently fine-grained control.
- each device also has internal state x i ⁇ T , which describes relevant device-specific quantities.
- this could include internal building temperatures.
- EV electric vehicle
- this might include a maximum charging rate and a required energy for the currently charging EV.
- a power schedule can be produced for all devices by solving an optimization problem over these x 1 . . . , x n and u 1 . . . , u n variables,
- the f objective can include both well-known energy costs (e.g., time-of-use charges, demand charges, demand-response penalties) as well as softer costs (e.g., user satisfaction).
- the g i terms may define hard constraints due to physical limitations (battery capacity) or due to hard user constraints (e.g., the EV must have 5 kWh by 5 pm). Note that while u 1 . . . u n denotes the scheduled power for each device over the entire time horizon, as is standard in model predictive control, only the first action in this schedule needs to be executed, then the optimization problem can be resolved again with updated information in the next interval.
- cost function f depend only on power consumption u 1 . . . u n , and thus make up the utility power bill as well as determine revenue from participating in DR programs.
- cost functions There are essentially two types of cost functions: those that depend on a pre-defined rate plan and that are applied at the meter level, and those based on capacity events that are declared days or hours in advance.
- demand charges and capacity events lead to nonlinear functions that apply to a group of devices or structures simultaneously (e.g. all devices behind a single meter) leading to an overall cost function that applies at different levels of granularity.
- cost functions are described for the most common rate plan charges (i.e., time-of-use energy charges, and demand charges) as well as for capacity events.
- c i TOU denotes the time of use charge for each individual device.
- the energy charge for the rate plan combined with the amount of energy used by the device at that time is given by,
- ⁇ represents the appropriate constant for converting average power in kW to energy in kWh.
- h 5/60 if the time interval for scheduling is 5 minutes.
- demand charges can also be codified in the rate schedule for a particular meter.
- These charges are a rough proxy for utility costs that are incurred due to higher peak power usage. Of course, they only roughly approximate the true utility cost because the peak for an individual meter may not correspond exactly to the peak for the overall grid. Nonetheless, these charges are a significant component of the monthly bill for many rate plans and thus an important term to minimize.
- demand charges groups of devices can be considered that are behind a particular meter. Additionally, for the same group of devices, there may be several demand charges that apply over different periods of the scheduling window. For example, scheduling beginning at 9 AM in a summer month, some embodiments may need to consider peak demand charges that are active during the middle of the day, as well as partial peak charges that are active in the morning hours. This can be written as a sum over the demand charges, where each demand charge is determined by the sum of individual devices within that group, such as all devices behind a single meter,
- f DC ⁇ ( u 1 ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ , u n ) ⁇ k ⁇ f DC ( ⁇ i ⁇ D k ⁇ u i + ⁇ k ; m k , c k ( DC ) ) ( 4 )
- l k denotes the predicted power consumption for uncontrolled devices behind the same meter
- m k represents maximum power consumption thus far in the billing period
- c k (DC) denotes the demand charge rate from the rate plan denominated in $/kW.
- the incremental cost incurred can be determined by the amount we increase the maximum power consumption, given by
- f DC ( x;m,c ) c max ⁇ u 1 ⁇ m 1 , . . . , u T ⁇ m T ⁇ . (5)
- capacity events are not fixed in the rate structure, and are instead declared by grid operators with some advanced notice.
- participants self-nominate or bid on a particular load capacity that can be shed on demand in order to support the grid.
- a baseline methodology may be used to define the power consumption under “normal” conditions. For example, a 10-day average, excluding weekends and holidays, may be considered and adjusted for day-of power consumption prior to the event.
- the goal of this term in the scheduler is to ensure that after events are declared, loads are scheduled in a way that minimizes energy cost due to penalties incurred from not supplying the pre-agreed capacity.
- These events are typically defined at a relatively coarse granularity that includes multiple meters, but as with demand charges, groups of loads can be enumerated that are relevant for a particular event and the sum of all devices in these groups can be considered together as
- f DC ⁇ ( u 1 ⁇ ⁇ ... ⁇ , u n ) ⁇ k ⁇ f DC ( ⁇ i ⁇ C k ⁇ u i + ⁇ k ; b k , p k ) ( 6 )
- b k denotes the baseline
- p k denotes the nominated capacity.
- the actual penalty function for an event depends on the program in question and can include quantities such as the price to purchase capacity in the real-time energy markets.
- One example is a non-symmetric cost function with significant penalties for under performance and limited/no upside for shedding more capacity than is required.
- a simple example places a linear penalty on under-delivering given by
- constraints are determined by known physical properties (e.g., a lithium-ion battery with a 50 MWh capacity and a 10 MW charge/discharge rate) as well as predictions of physical properties (e.g., weather forecasts, arrival and departure of electric vehicles). Constraints can also be used to incorporate user preferences (e.g. vehicle must have 5 kWh of charge by 5 p.m. or building temperature must between 70°-74° F.), ensuring that the optimal schedule respects the needs of electricity consumers. Alternatively, preferences may be incorporated through additional terms, but this introduces a tradeoff between energy costs and user happiness. By instead making these hard constraints, the assumption that maintaining user happiness is more important than reducing energy costs can be encoded.
- a dedicated energy storage device such as a lithium-ion battery
- the constraints for these devices may take into account the maximum charge/discharge rate and the physical constraints on battery capacity
- e 0 is the initial energy stored in the battery
- e max is the maximum capacity measured in kWh
- r min and r max are the maximum charge/discharge rates.
- the first constraint ensures that the total energy remains within the capacity of the battery, while the second constraint bounds the charge/discharge rate at each time interval. Recall that the convention that u t ⁇ 0 represents sourcing of power, such as discharging the battery.
- e 0 is the current state of the battery
- r max corresponds to the maximum EV charging rate (e.g., 6.6 kW for standard Level 2 charging).
- Controlling an HVAC load requires a slightly more complicated model able to specify the relationship between power consumption and internal building temperatures.
- a linear model may be adopted having the state variables x t representing the internal building temperature with
- a and b are physical constants representing the thermal properties of the building and cooling efficiency, respectively.
- User preferences can be incorporated as constraints in the model on internal building temperatures in the range of T min ⁇ x t ⁇ T max .
- T min ⁇ x t ⁇ T max For example, occupants of an office building may expect temperatures in the range 70°-74° F. under normal circumstances, but may be willing to tolerate slightly higher temperatures for short periods during capacity events.
- commercial building management systems may have their own sophisticated control systems that maintain desired set points in application-specific ways.
- the output of the scheduler can be mapped to these systems as a post-processing step and/or by incorporating more application-specific details and state in the constraints.
- a linear solver To schedule various loads from a plurality of electrical loads for use in energy reduction, the equations and constraints described above can be used as inputs to a linear solver.
- an algorithm referred to herein as a “Greedy Tetris” scheduler may be used to schedule different customers' load drop flexibility to achieve a desired aggregate load drop shape in magnitude and time.
- each customer or structure can be represented by a time-series of how much they can drop in a given time interval, and for how many time intervals such a drop may occur; and (2) once a customer is dispatched, the dispatch will not stop and restart at another time during the same event.
- Market rules vary by location and ISO/utility, but here it will be assumed that there is no incentive to over-perform, i.e. to drop more load than was committed up front. An extension for exception cases will be introduced below.
- FIG. 9 illustrates a flowchart of a method for scheduling individual loads for a load-drop event, according to some embodiments.
- the method may include, for a first time interval of a load-drop event, selecting available loads to dispatch ( 902 ). This initial selection of loads to dispatch may be selected such that there is just enough estimated load drop to meet required capacity that was committed by the energy management system.
- the first time interval may refer to a unit of performance evaluation, which could be a fixed time interval, such as an hour, or a duration of the entire load-drop event.
- the initial selection of loads may be calculated by aggregating individual load drops from each load until the required capacity is reached.
- the method may also include determining an actual load drop during the first time interval using the initial selection of loads, and determining whether the actual load drop meets the capacity requirement ( 904 ). If the actual load drop does not meet the capacity requirement, the scheduling system can dispatch additional electrical loads until the actual load drop meets the capacity requirement ( 906 ). These two steps of the process may be repeated during the current time interval as needed. It will be understood that the actual load drop can fluctuate during the current time interval due to customer interactions with their thermostat. When the current time interval is completed, the algorithm can move on to a subsequent time interval ( 908 ).
- some embodiments may determine whether an average load over the entire event is greater than the capacity requirement ( 912 ). If so, electrical loads during the subsequent time interval may be dropped until the actual load during the subsequent time interval is below the capacity requirement ( 914 ). It will be understood that steps 912 , 914 can also determine whether the average over the entire event is less than the capacity requirement, and then add additional loads in response.
- a rebalancing process as described above can be used to maintain an average load dispatch over the entire event that is approximately equal to the capacity requirement.
- the scheduling system can move to the next time interval ( 916 ), again determine which loads can remain dropped ( 910 ), and rebalance loads according to the average load drop over the entire event in relation to the capacity requirement ( 912 , 914 ).
- the event will end, and analysis can be performed regarding the efficiency of the scheduling algorithm described above.
- This general scheme works regardless of whether event performance is judged in discrete intervals, or averaged over the entire event. It is also not dependent on knowing the duration of the event ahead of time. This algorithm is simple and fast, and requires little in the way of computing resources. Although it uses rebalancing, and is not necessary optimal in all cases, this algorithm avoids extensive forward-looking planning. If load-shedding rules include some incentive for over performance (e.g., extra payments for shedding more electrical load than agreed to upfront) then the algorithm of FIG. 9 can be modified by identifying the optimal drop level to be reached, based on a trade-off of expected payout versus costs. “Cost” in this sense can be represented as the cost of dispatching more customers in terms of user satisfaction. Once the optimal drop level has been determined, the greedy algorithm of FIG. 9 can proceed as described above, using the optimal drop level instead of the agreed-to capacity requirement.
- the dispatch engine described above may be responsible for generating an optimal dispatch schedule given a DR event start time and the constraints that apply to each load (e.g., each home with a customer having a smart thermostat). This optimization performed by the dispatch engine they provide at least two benefits. First, the expected payout for the given event performance may be calculated by using the DR program rules in conjunction with the specific energy-saving characteristics of the grouping of loads provided by the dispatch engine. Second, a significant amount of flexibility may be realized during and after a given event. This flexibility can be potentially used to dispatch into energy markets, so it also carries some real-world monetary value.
- the bidding engine and the load models described above allow a thermostat management server to predict and simulate how different load combinations will perform during future DR events. Parameters can be changed during a simulation to find an optimized combination of loads for given DR program rules. This can be beneficial when energy companies require estimated energy savings prior to DR events.
- an energy company may place certain future DR events up for bid among various load-saving customers. For example, a utility company may ask for a 4 MW reduction during a certain date/time.
- the thermostat management server can calculate the likelihood that the thermostat network will be able to shed the required amount of energy based on simulating various load configurations returned by the dispatch engine described above.
- thermostat management server determines the optimal combination of loads using the dispatch engine to shed as closely as possible the required amount of energy by the utility provider.
- FIG. 10 illustrates a system diagram of a thermostat management server that includes the dispatch engine and bidding engine, according to some embodiments.
- the dispatch engine 1004 and the bidding engine 1002 represent the major functional blocks of the load-shedding system.
- the bidding engine 1002 may be responsible for determining how much capacity should be nominated for each of the demand response resources.
- the dispatch engine 1004 can schedule individual assets of a resource during demand response events.
- Information regarding each of the assets/resources e.g., thermal characteristics of homes, HVAC capacities, etc.
- An API 1008 can connect assistant to external computer systems, such as the utility provider computer system.
- the API 1008 can also source thermostat-level information, events, and dispatch the actual system instructions for individual thermostats.
- FIG. 11 illustrates a flowchart of a method for estimating an optimal amount of load capacity to agree to shed during future DR events, according to some embodiments.
- the method may include uploading information about assets and resources, such as their load flexibility, through the API into the database ( 1102 ). This information may be uploaded constantly and/or periodically from thermostats in operation in various homes.
- the method may also include receiving DR parameters for upcoming DR events ( 1104 ). This information may be provided by the utility provider computer system, and may generally describe DR events during an upcoming season. For example, this information may request an amount of energy to be shed, along with start times, end times, durations, locations, and so forth.
- the method may additionally include a simulation loop performed by the bidding engine, the details of which will be described further below.
- the dispatch engine can determine a load configuration to be simulated, such as a grouping of homes having smart thermostats installed therein ( 1106 ).
- the bidding engine can perform, for example, a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the amount of load to be shed using that configuration based on varying weather conditions, energy prices, and so forth ( 1108 ).
- This loop ( 1110 ) can be performed using many different configurations selected by the dispatch engine.
- the method may include generating a set of statistical data relating the load capacity shed to the risk of underperformance when agreeing to service the DR events ( 1112 ).
- the statistical information may include a set of curves showing an expected value, a 10 th percentile value, a 90 th percentile value, and so forth.
- the statistical information can be provided to the thermostat management system, which can then make a decision as to how much load can be reliably shed based on a desired level of risk.
- the method may include sending the estimate of the capacity to shed load during the future DR events to the utility provider computer system ( 1114 ).
- the bidding engine can generate a set of statistical data that can allow the thermostat management server to determine the optimal amount of load that can be shared during DR events.
- This approach incorporates (i) a statistical categorization of the drop in energy consumption with respect to a monetized baseline as reported to the utility providers that run the demand response programs, and (ii) a way to use these models with the inherent uncertainty in weather forecasts within a Monte Carlo simulation framework that provides capacity nomination versus payout curves.
- These embodiments use models of uncertainty to generate many instances, or sample paths, for future monthly demand response event realizations. These models then compute the actual payout outcomes of these different realizations.
- the result of this analysis is a set of distribution curves as a function of the upfront capacity nomination.
- Characterizing the drop in energy consumption with respect to the utility-reported baseline is one parameter in estimating the ability to respond when the demand response event is called.
- the key challenges in implementing this procedure were in the amount of uncertainty (noise) that was present in this process. Therefore these embodiments required an approach that placed special attention on how the estimation noise is reduced.
- the capacity drop analysis was broken down into two components: (i) the difference between the predicted baseline vs the utility-based (monetization) baseline, and (ii) the drop of the actual demand with respect to the predicted baseline (instead of the utility-based baseline). These embodiments have been shown to efficiently control the noise in the estimation procedure, which may be important given the typically very limited DR event history. All the applied methods were statistically rigorous. This is the only known approach that incorporates noise and provides the risk-averse strategy in coming up with the DR program nominations.
- the approach in estimating the drop includes estimating a difference between the actual load during the demand response event and the utility baseline based on which the resource is monetized. Predicting this quantity can be challenging due to the inherent uncertainty of the utility baseline and the fairly small number of available demand response events that can be used to build the capacity drop prediction model. The noise can be limited in the capacity drop estimation by exploiting the following equality.
- A(t) represents the actual power at time t
- B (t) represents the utility baseline at time t
- P(t) represents the baseline prediction at time t
- DR(t) represents the DR state at time t
- an indicator function e.g., the first term in (10) does not depend on the demand response event. Instead, it represents the difference between the utility baseline and the corresponding prediction, and the model can be built using all of the available historic data.
- the second term in (10) depends on actual DR events, and the estimation uncertainty stems from a commonly small number of events, as well as the uncertainty in demand and weather forecasts. Bid nominations are usually registered at least a month ahead. However, in general, month-ahead predictions are very noisy especially for loads that depend on the outside temperature, such as HVACs.
- Assigning loads to a DR program depends on the ability of the utility baseline to track actual load.
- the drop of the actual demand with respect to the utility provided baseline is noisy.
- the estimation noise can be controlled by considering the terms in (10) separately, while adding the correlation between the two terms.
- the drop with respect to the predicted power exhibits a more clear trend as a function of outside temperature and the power prediction. This is due to the fact that the trained power prediction algorithms take into account many more effects than the utility's baseline procedure.
- the estimation can be optimized by focusing on the DR-likely days, including the actual event days.
- PCA Principle Component Analysis
- a linear model can accept temperature and weather conditions, time of the week, day of week, and DR related states as inputs.
- One way to improve the drop prediction accuracy is by focusing only on the event days. Note that the drop is a function of the time of day, which can be excluded from the analysis below, since DR events are almost always triggered at the same time.
- the first is the payment ratio based on the delivery ratio. In other words, each month, a certain DR capacity can be nominated. The performance achieved during the DR event (i.e. actual drop from baseline) relative to the nominated capacity is the delivered capacity ratio. The payment or penalty based on this delivered capacity ratio is shown in FIG. 12 . Note that the Payment Ratio levels off as the Delivered Capacity Ratio increases, leveling off at a ratio of 1.0. This signifies that there is no benefit to over estimating the capacity reduction.
- This capacity payment determined by the Payment Ratio is a function of a random process of hourly event drops throughout a given month.
- a Monte-Carlo simulation can be used. N monthly samples can be generated (i.e., sequences of monthly event drops) using the previously discussed prediction models.
- the quantile values can be estimated which converge to the actual values as the number of samples N grows.
- the bidding engine derives the expected payoff for different capacity nominations for a given load combination.
- all the uncertainties e.g., load performance, weather, timing of events
- the bidding engine is implemented as a Monte Carlo outer loop around the dispatch engine, which tests dispatch behavior by running many iterations for each capacity point. For each iteration, the bidding engine chooses a given event time and duration from the event distribution, along with a load drop for each flexible load from its model, and then runs the dispatch engine to obtain a load schedule. The bidding engine then evaluates that schedule based on the DR program rules. After many iterations, the results are collected into a graph that shows the distribution of payouts (over a DR season) for different capacity nominations for a given set of load combinations.
- FIG. 13 illustrates an example set of curves, according to some embodiments.
- Line 1302 captures the expected value of payout for each given capacity nomination for a given resource. But given that the payout is based on a number of uncertainties that are modelled, there is a certain distribution to the payout amount for each capacity.
- Line 1304 and line 1306 capture the 90th and 10th percentile of the payout, respectively. This is the payout amount that will be achieved in at least 90 and only 10 percent of the cases.

FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a smart home environment within which one or more of the devices, methods, systems, services, and/or computer program products described further herein can be applicable. The depicted smart home environment includes astructure 150, which can include, e.g., a house, office building, garage, or mobile home. It will be appreciated that devices can also be integrated into a smart home environment that does not include anentire structure 150, such as an apartment, condominium, or office space. Further, the smart home environment can control and/or be coupled to devices outside of theactual structure 150. Indeed, several devices in the smart home environment need not physically be within thestructure 150 at all. For example, a device controlling a pool heater or irrigation system can be located outside of thestructure 150. - The depicted
structure 150 includes a plurality ofrooms 152, separated at least partly from each other viawalls 154. Thewalls 154 can include interior walls or exterior walls. Each room can further include afloor 156 and aceiling 158. Devices can be mounted on, integrated with and/or supported by awall 154, floor or ceiling. - The smart home depicted in
FIG. 1 includes a plurality of devices, including intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected devices that can integrate seamlessly with each other and/or with cloud-based server systems to provide any of a variety of useful smart home objectives. One, more or each of the devices illustrated in the smart home environment and/or in the figure can include one or more sensors, a user interface, a power supply, a communications component, a modularity unit and intelligent software as described herein. Examples of devices are shown inFIG. 1 . - An intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected
thermostat 102 can detect ambient climate characteristics (e.g., temperature and/or humidity) and control a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC)system 103. One or more intelligent, network-connected, multi-sensinghazard detection units 104 can detect the presence of a hazardous substance and/or a hazardous condition in the home environment (e.g., smoke, fire, or carbon monoxide). One or more intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connectedentryway interface devices 106, which can be termed a “smart doorbell”, can detect a person's approach to or departure from a location, control audible functionality, announce a person's approach or departure via audio or visual means, or control settings on a security system (e.g., to activate or deactivate the security system). - Each of a plurality of intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected
wall light switches 108 can detect ambient lighting conditions, detect room-occupancy states and control a power and/or dim state of one or more lights. In some instances,light switches 108 can further or alternatively control a power state or speed of a fan, such as a ceiling fan. Each of a plurality of intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected wall plug interfaces 110 can detect occupancy of a room or enclosure and control supply of power to one or more wall plugs (e.g., such that power is not supplied to the plug if nobody is at home). The smart home may further include a plurality of intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connectedappliances 112, such as refrigerators, stoves and/or ovens, televisions, washers, dryers, lights (inside and/or outside the structure 150), stereos, intercom systems, garage-door openers, floor fans, ceiling fans, whole-house fans, wall air conditioners,pool heaters 114,irrigation systems 116, security systems (including security system components such as cameras, motion detectors and window/door sensors), and so forth. While descriptions ofFIG. 1 can identify specific sensors and functionalities associated with specific devices, it will be appreciated that any of a variety of sensors and functionalities (such as those described throughout the specification) can be integrated into the device. - In addition to containing processing and sensing capabilities, each of the
devices devices - For example, a first device can communicate with a second device via a
wireless router 160. A device can further communicate with remote devices via a connection to a network, such as theInternet 162. Through theInternet 162, the device can communicate with a central server or a cloud-computing system 164. The central server or cloud-computing system 164 can be associated with a manufacturer, support entity or service provider associated with the device. For one embodiment, a user may be able to contact customer support using a device itself rather than needing to use other communication means such as a telephone or Internet-connected computer. Further, software updates can be automatically sent from the central server or cloud-computing system 164 to devices (e.g., when available, when purchased, or at routine intervals). - By virtue of network connectivity, one or more of the smart-home devices of
FIG. 1 can further allow a user to interact with the device even if the user is not proximate to the device. For example, a user can communicate with a device using a computer (e.g., a desktop computer, laptop computer, or tablet) or other portable electronic device (e.g., a smartphone). A webpage or app can be configured to receive communications from the user and control the device based on the communications and/or to present information about the device's operation to the user. For example, the user can view a current setpoint temperature for a device and adjust it using a computer. The user can be in the structure during this remote communication or outside the structure. - The smart home also can include a variety of
non-communicating legacy appliances 140, such as old conventional washer/dryers, refrigerators, and the like which can be controlled, albeit coarsely (ON/OFF), by virtue of the wall plug interfaces 110. The smart home can further include a variety of partially communicatinglegacy appliances 142, such as IR-controlled wall air conditioners or other IR-controlled devices, which can be controlled by IR signals provided by thehazard detection units 104 or thelight switches 108. -
FIG. 2 illustrates a network-level view of an extensible devices and services platform with which the smart home ofFIG. 1 can be integrated, according to some embodiments. Each of the intelligent, network-connected devices fromFIG. 1 can communicate with one or more remote central servers orcloud computing systems 164. The communication can be enabled by establishing connection to theInternet 162 either directly (for example, using 3G/4G connectivity to a wireless carrier), though a hubbed network (which can be scheme ranging from a simple wireless router, for example, up to and including an intelligent, dedicated whole-home control node), or through any combination thereof. - The central server or cloud-
computing system 164 can collectoperation data 202 from the smart home devices. For example, the devices can routinely transmit operation data or can transmit operation data in specific instances (e.g., when requesting customer support). The central server or cloud-computing architecture 164 can further provide one ormore services 204. Theservices 204 can include, e.g., software update, customer support, sensor data collection/logging, remote access, remote or distributed control, or use suggestions (e.g., based on collectedoperation data 204 to improve performance, reduce utility cost, etc.). Data associated with theservices 204 can be stored at the central server or cloud-computing system 164 and the central server or cloud-computing system 164 can retrieve and transmit the data at an appropriate time (e.g., at regular intervals, upon receiving request from a user, etc.). - One salient feature of the described extensible devices and services platform, as illustrated in
FIG. 2 , is aprocessing engines 206, which can be concentrated at a single server or distributed among several different computing entities without limitation. Processingengines 206 can include engines configured to receive data from a set of devices (e.g., via the Internet or a hubbed network), to index the data, to analyze the data and/or to generate statistics based on the analysis or as part of the analysis. The analyzed data can be stored as deriveddata 208. Results of the analysis or statistics can thereafter be transmitted back to a device providing ops data used to derive the results, to other devices, to a server providing a webpage to a user of the device, or to other non-device entities. For example, use statistics, use statistics relative to use of other devices, use patterns, and/or statistics summarizing sensor readings can be transmitted. The results or statistics can be provided via theInternet 162. In this manner, processingengines 206 can be configured and programmed to derive a variety of useful information from the operational data obtained from the smart home. A single server can include one or more engines. - The derived data can be highly beneficial at a variety of different granularities for a variety of useful purposes, ranging from explicit programmed control of the devices on a per-home, per-neighborhood, or per-region basis (for example, demand-response programs for electrical utilities), to the generation of inferential abstractions that can assist on a per-home basis (for example, an inference can be drawn that the homeowner has left for vacation and so security detection equipment can be put on heightened sensitivity), to the generation of statistics and associated inferential abstractions that can be used for government or charitable purposes. For example, processing
engines 206 can generate statistics about device usage across a population of devices and send the statistics to device users, service providers or other entities (e.g., that have requested or may have provided monetary compensation for the statistics). As specific illustrations, statistics can be transmitted tocharities 222, governmental entities 224 (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency), academic institutions 226 (e.g., university researchers), businesses 228 (e.g., providing device warranties or service to related equipment), orutility companies 230. These entities can use the data to form programs to reduce energy usage, to preemptively service faulty equipment, to prepare for high service demands, to track past service performance, etc., or to perform any of a variety of beneficial functions or tasks now known or hereinafter developed. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an abstracted functional view of the extensible devices and services platform ofFIG. 2 , with particular reference to theprocessing engine 206 as well as the devices of the smart home. Even though the devices situated in the smart home will have an endless variety of different individual capabilities and limitations, they can all be thought of as sharing common characteristics in that each of them is a data consumer 302 (DC), a data source 304 (DS), a services consumer 306 (SC), and a services source 308 (SS). Advantageously, in addition to providing the essential control information needed for the devices to achieve their local and immediate objectives, the extensible devices and services platform can also be configured to harness the large amount of data that is flowing out of these devices. In addition to enhancing or optimizing the actual operation of the devices themselves with respect to their immediate functions, the extensible devices and services platform can also be directed to “repurposing” that data in a variety of automated, extensible, flexible, and/or scalable ways to achieve a variety of useful objectives. These objectives may be predefined or adaptively identified based on, e.g., usage patterns, device efficiency, and/or user input (e.g., requesting specific functionality). - For example,
FIG. 3 showsprocessing engine 206 as including a number of paradigms 310.Processing engine 206 can include a managedservices paradigm 310 a that monitors and manages primary or secondary device functions. The device functions can include ensuring proper operation of a device given user inputs, estimating that (e.g., and responding to) an intruder is or is attempting to be in a dwelling, detecting a failure of equipment coupled to the device (e.g., a light bulb having burned out), implementing or otherwise responding to energy demand response events, or alerting a user of a current or predicted future event or characteristic.Processing engine 206 can further include an advertising/communication paradigm 310 b that estimates characteristics (e.g., demographic information), desires and/or products of interest of a user based on device usage. Services, promotions, products or upgrades can then be offered or automatically provided to the user.Processing engine 206 can further include asocial paradigm 310 c that uses information from a social network, provides information to a social network (for example, based on device usage), processes data associated with user and/or device interactions with the social network platform. For example, a user's status as reported to their trusted contacts on the social network could be updated to indicate when they are home based on light detection, security system inactivation or device usage detectors. As another example, a user may be able to share device-usage statistics with other users.Processing engine 206 can include a challenges/rules/compliance/rewards paradigm 310 d that informs a user of challenges, rules, compliance regulations and/or rewards and/or that uses operation data to determine whether a challenge has been met, a rule or regulation has been complied with and/or a reward has been earned. The challenges, rules or regulations can relate to efforts to conserve energy, to live safely (e.g., reducing exposure to toxins or carcinogens), to conserve money and/or equipment life, to improve health, etc. - Processing engine can integrate or otherwise utilize
extrinsic information 316 from extrinsic sources to improve the functioning of one or more processing paradigms.Extrinsic information 316 can be used to interpret operational data received from a device, to determine a characteristic of the environment near the device (e.g., outside a structure that the device is enclosed in), to determine services or products available to the user, to identify a social network or social-network information, to determine contact information of entities (e.g., public-service entities such as an emergency-response team, the police or a hospital) near the device, etc., to identify statistical or environmental conditions, trends or other information associated with a home or neighborhood, and so forth. - An extraordinary range and variety of benefits can be brought about by, and fit within the scope of, the described extensible devices and services platform, ranging from the ordinary to the profound. Thus, in one “ordinary” example, each bedroom of the smart home can be provided with a smoke/fire/CO alarm that includes an occupancy sensor, wherein the occupancy sensor is also capable of inferring (e.g., by virtue of motion detection, facial recognition, audible sound patterns, etc.) whether the occupant is asleep or awake. If a serious fire event is sensed, the remote security/monitoring service or fire department is advised of how many occupants there are in each bedroom, and whether those occupants are still asleep (or immobile) or whether they have properly evacuated the bedroom. While this is, of course, a very advantageous capability accommodated by the described extensible devices and services platform, there can be substantially more “profound” examples that can truly illustrate the potential of a larger “intelligence” that can be made available. By way of perhaps a more “profound” example, the same data bedroom occupancy data that is being used for fire safety can also be “repurposed” by the
processing engine 206 in the context of a social paradigm of neighborhood child development and education. Thus, for example, the same bedroom occupancy and motion data discussed in the “ordinary” example can be collected and made available for processing (properly anonymized) in which the sleep patterns of schoolchildren in a particular ZIP code can be identified and tracked. Localized variations in the sleeping patterns of the schoolchildren may be identified and correlated, for example, to different nutrition programs in local schools. -
FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of an HVAC system, according to some embodiments.HVAC system 103 provides heating, cooling, ventilation, and/or air handling for an enclosure, such asstructure 150 depicted inFIG. 1 .System 103 depicts a forced air type heating and cooling system, although according to other embodiments, other types of HVAC systems could be used such as radiant heat based systems, heat-pump based systems, and others. - For carrying out the heating function, heating coils or
elements 442 withinair handler 440 provide a source of heat using electricity or gas vialine 436. Cool air is drawn from the enclosure viareturn air duct 446 throughfilter 470, usingfan 438 and is heated through heating coils orelements 442. The heated air flows back into the enclosure at one or more locations via supplyair duct system 452 and supply air registers such asregister 450. In cooling, anoutside compressor 430 passes a refrigerant gas through a set of heat exchanger coils and then through an expansion valve. The gas then goes throughline 432 to the cooling coils orevaporator coils 434 in theair handler 440 where it expands, cools and cools the air being circulated viafan 438. Ahumidifier 454 may optionally be included in various embodiments that returns moisture to the air before it passes throughduct system 452. Although not shown inFIG. 4 , alternate embodiments ofHVAC system 103 may have other functionality such as venting air to and from the outside, one or more dampers to control airflow within theduct system 452 and an emergency heating unit. Overall operation ofHVAC system 103 is selectively actuated bycontrol electronics 412 communicating withthermostat 102 overcontrol wires 448. -
FIGS. 5A-5D illustrate a thermostat having a rounded exterior appearance and including one or more sensors for detecting environmental conditions, such as occupancy and/or users, temperature, ambient light, humidity, and so forth.FIG. 5A is front view,FIG. 5B is a bottom elevation,FIG. 5C is a right side elevation, andFIG. 5D is perspective view ofthermostat 102. Unlike many prior art thermostats,thermostat 102 has a simple and elegant design. Moreover, user interaction withthermostat 102 is facilitated and greatly enhanced over known conventional thermostats. Thethermostat 102 includes control circuitry and is electrically connected to anHVAC system 103, such as is shown inFIGS. 1-4 .Thermostat 102 is wall mountable, is circular in shape, and has an outerrotatable ring 512 for receiving user input.Thermostat 102 has a large convex rounded front face lying inside the outerrotatable ring 512. According to some embodiments,thermostat 102 is approximately 84 mm in diameter and protrudes from the wall, when wall mounted, by 30 mm. The outerrotatable ring 512 allows the user to make adjustments, such as selecting a new setpoint temperature. For example, by rotating theouter ring 512 clockwise, the real-time (i.e. currently active) setpoint temperature can be increased, and by rotating theouter ring 512 counter-clockwise, the real-time setpoint temperature can be decreased. - The front face of the
thermostat 102 comprises acover 514 that according to some embodiments is polycarbonate, and alens 510 having an outer shape that matches the contours of the curved outer front face of thethermostat 102. According to some embodiments, Fresnel lens elements may are formed on the interior surface of thelens 510 such that they are not obviously visible by viewing the exterior of thethermostat 102. Behind thelens 510 is a passive infrared (PIR)sensor 550 for detecting occupancy, a temperature sensor that is thermally coupled to thelens 510, and a multi-channel thermopile for detecting occupancy, user approaches, and motion signatures. The Fresnel lens elements of thelens 510 are made from a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) that has an infrared transmission range appropriate for sensitivity to human bodies. Thelens 510 may also include thin sections that allow a near-field proximity sensor 552, such as a multi-channel thermopile, and a temperature sensor to “see-through” thelens 510 with minimal interference from the polyethylene. As shown inFIGS. 5A-5D , the front edge of the outerrotatable ring 512,cover 514, andlens 510 are shaped such that they together form an integrated convex rounded front face that has a common outward arc or spherical shape arcing outward. - Although being formed from a single lens-like piece of material such as polycarbonate, the
cover 514 has two different regions or portions including an outer portion 514 o and acentral portion 514 i. According to some embodiments, thecover 514 is darkened around the outer portion 514 o, but leaves thecentral portion 514 i visibly clear so as to facilitate viewing of anelectronic display 516 disposed underneath. According to some embodiments, thecover 514 acts as a lens that tends to magnify the information being displayed inelectronic display 516 to users. According to some embodiments the centralelectronic display 516 is a dot-matrix layout (i.e. individually addressable) such that arbitrary shapes can be generated. According to some embodiments,electronic display 516 is a backlit, color liquid crystal display (LCD). An example of information displayed on theelectronic display 516 is illustrated inFIG. 5A , and includescentral numerals 520 that are representative of a current setpoint temperature. Thethermostat 102 may be constructed such that theelectronic display 516 is at a fixed orientation and does not rotate with the outerrotatable ring 512. For some embodiments, thecover 514 andlens 510 also remain at a fixed orientation and do not rotate with theouter ring 512. In alternative embodiments, thecover 514 and/or thelens 510 can rotate with the outerrotatable ring 512. According to one embodiment in which the diameter of thethermostat 102 is about 84 mm, the diameter of theelectronic display 516 is about 54 mm. According to some embodiments the curved shape of the front surface ofthermostat 102, which is made up of thecover 514, thelens 510 and the front facing portion of thering 512, is spherical, and matches a sphere having a radius of between 100 mm and 180 mm. According to some embodiments, the radius of the spherical shape of the thermostat front is about 156 mm. - Motion sensing with
PIR sensor 550 as well as other techniques can be used in the detection and/or prediction of occupancy. According to some embodiments, occupancy information is used in generating an effective and efficient scheduled program. A second near-field proximity sensor 552 is also provided to detect an approaching user. The near-field proximity sensor 552 can be used to detect proximity in the range of up to 10-15 feet. thePIR sensor 550 and/or the near-field proximity sensor 552 can detect user presence such that thethermostat 102 can initiate “waking up” and/or providing adaptive screen displays that are based on user motion/position when the user is approaching the thermostat and prior to the user touching the thermostat. Such use of proximity sensing is useful for enhancing the user experience by being “ready” for interaction as soon as, or very soon after the user is ready to interact with the thermostat. Further, the wake-up-on-proximity functionality also allows for energy savings within the thermostat by “sleeping” when no user interaction is taking place our about to take place. - According to some embodiments, the
thermostat 102 may be controlled by at least two types of user input, the first being a rotation of the outerrotatable ring 512 as shown inFIG. 5A , and the second being an inward push onhead unit 540 until an audible and/or tactile “click” occurs. For such embodiments, thehead unit 540 is an assembly that includes theouter ring 512, thecover 514, theelectronic display 516, and thelens 510. When pressed inwardly by the user, thehead unit 540 travels inwardly by a small amount, such as 0.5 mm, against an interior switch (not shown), and then springably travels back out when the inward pressure is released, providing a tactile “click” along with a corresponding audible clicking sound. Thus, for the embodiment ofFIGS. 5A-5D , an inward click can be achieved by direct pressing on the outerrotatable ring 512 itself, or by indirect pressing of the outerrotatable ring 512 by virtue of providing inward pressure on thecover 514, thelens 510, or by various combinations thereof. For other embodiments, thethermostat 102 can be mechanically configured such that only theouter ring 512 travels inwardly for the inward click input, while thecover 514 andlens 510 remain motionless. -
FIG. 5B andFIG. 5C are bottom and right side elevation views of thethermostat 102. According to some embodiments, thethermostat 102 includes aprocessing system 560,display driver 564 and awireless communications system 566. Theprocessing system 560 is adapted to cause thedisplay driver 564 anddisplay 516 to display information to the user, and to receiver user input via the outerrotatable ring 512. Theprocessing system 560, according to some embodiments, is capable of carrying out the governance of the operation ofthermostat 102 including various user interface features. Theprocessing system 560 is further programmed and configured to carry out other operations, such as maintaining and updating a thermodynamic model for the enclosure in which the HVAC system is installed. According to some embodiments, awireless communications system 566 is used to communicate with devices such as personal computers, other thermostats or HVAC system components, smart phones, local home wireless networks, routers, gateways, home appliances, security systems, hazard detectors, remote thermostat management servers, distributed sensors and/or sensor systems, and other components it the modern smart-home environment. Such communications may include peer-to-peer communications, communications through one or more servers located on a private network, or and/or communications through a cloud-based service. - According to some embodiments, the
thermostat 102 includes ahead unit 540 and a backplate (or wall dock) 542.Head unit 540 ofthermostat 102 is slidably mountable ontoback plate 542 and slidably detachable therefrom. According to some embodiments the connection of thehead unit 540 to backplate 542 can be accomplished using magnets, bayonet, latches and catches, tabs, and/or ribs with matching indentations, or simply friction on mating portions of thehead unit 540 andbackplate 542. Also shown inFIG. 5A is arechargeable battery 522 that is recharged usingrecharging circuitry 524 that uses power from backplate that is either obtained via power harvesting (also referred to as power stealing and/or power sharing) from the HVAC system control circuit(s) or from a common wire, if available. According to some embodiments, therechargeable battery 522 may include a single cell lithium-ion battery, or a lithium-polymer battery. -
FIGS. 6A-6B illustrate exploded front and rear perspective views, respectively, of thethermostat 102 with respect to its two main components, which are thehead unit 540 and thebackplate 542. In the drawings shown herein, the “z” direction is outward from the wall, the “y” direction is the toe-to-head direction relative to a walk-up user, and the “x” direction is the user's left-to-right direction. -
FIGS. 6C-6D illustrate exploded front and rear perspective views, respectively, of thehead unit 540 with respect to its primary components.Head unit 540 includes, aback cover 636, abottom frame 634, abattery assembly 632 with therechargeable battery 522, a head unit printed circuit board (PCB) 654, the outerrotatable ring 512, thecover 514, and thelens 510. Behind the lens is thedisplay assembly 630, which will be described in relation toFIGS. 6E-6F below. Electrical components on thehead unit PCB 654 can connect to electrical components on theback plate 542 by virtue of a plug-type electrical connector on theback cover 636. Thehead unit PCB 654 is secured to head unitback cover 636 anddisplay assembly 630. The outerrotatable ring 512 is held between a bearing surface on thedisplay assembly 630 and bearing surfaces on thebottom frame 634. Motion of the outerrotatable ring 512 in the z direction is constrained by flat bearing surfaces on thedisplay assembly 630 andbottom frame 634, while motion of the ring in x and y directions are constrained at least in part by circular rounded surfaces on thebottom frame 634. According to some embodiments, the bearing surfaces of thebottom frame 634 and/or thedisplay assembly 630 are greased and/or otherwise lubricated to both smooth and dampen rotational movement for theouter ring 512. The head unit printedPCB 654 may include some or all ofprocessing system 560,display driver 564,wireless communication system 566, andbattery recharging circuitry 524 as shown and described with respect toFIG. 5A , as well as one or more additional memory storage components. According to some embodiments, circuitry and components are mounted on both sides ofhead unit PCB 654. Although not shown, according to some embodiments, shielding can surround circuitry and components on both sides of thehead unit PCB 654. -
Battery assembly 632 includes arechargeable battery 522.Battery assembly 632 also includes connectingwires 666, and a battery mounting film that is attached tobattery 522 using a strong adhesive and/or the any rear shielding ofhead unit PCB 654 using a relatively weaker adhesive. According to some embodiments, thebattery assembly 632 is user-replaceable. -
FIGS. 6E-6F illustrate exploded front and rear perspective views, respectively, of thehead unit 540 with an exploded view of thedisplay assembly 630. Thedisplay assembly 630 comprises thecover 514, thelens 510, anLCD module 662, a pair ofRF antennas 661, a headunit top frame 652, asensor flex assembly 663, and amagnetic ring 665. Thesensor flex assembly 663 connects to thehead unit PCB 654 using a connector on a flexible PCB. Thesensor flex assembly 663 also includes thePIR sensor 550 and the near-field proximity sensor 552. Additionally, thesensor flex assembly 663 may include a temperature sensor IC that is positioned close to the lens 515 so as to accurately measure temperature outside of thethermostat 102 without being overly affected by internal heating of thermostat components. Thesensor flex assembly 663 may be comprised of these three sensors, along with a flexible PCB (including the connector for the head unit PCB 654) and a plastic bracket to which the sensors and flexible PCB are mounted. The bracket ensures that thesensor flex assembly 663 is positioned and oriented consistently and correctly with respect to thelens 510. Thelens 510 includes two sections that are thinned to approximately 0.3 mm in front of the near-field proximity sensor 552 and the temperature sensor. Thelens 510 also includes a section with a Fresnel lens pattern in front of thePIR sensor 550. In some embodiments, additional temperature sensors may be placed throughout thethermostat 102, such as a temperature sensor on thehead unit PCB 654 and a temperature sensor on theback plate PCB 680. - The head unit PCB 554 includes a Hall effect sensor that senses rotation of the
magnetic ring 665. Themagnetic ring 665 is mounted to the inside of the outerrotatable ring 512 using an adhesive such that the outerrotatable ring 512 and themagnetic ring 665 are rotated together. Themagnetic ring 665 includes striated sections of alternating magnetic polarity that are diagonally positioned around themagnetic ring 665. The Hall effect sensor senses the alternations between magnetic polarities as theouter ring 512 is rotated. The Hall effect sensor can be controlled by a primary processor, which is a higher powered processor, without excessive power drain implications because the primary processor will invariably be awake already when the user is manually turning the outerrotatable ring 512 to control the user interface. Advantageously, very fast response times can also be provided by the primary processor. - The
antennas 661 are mounted to the top surface of the headunit top frame 652. Thewireless communications system 566 may include Wi-Fi radios of various frequencies (e.g., 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz), along with an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio unit for a local-area smart home device network that may include other thermostats, hazard detectors, security system modules, and so forth. The IEEE 802.15.4 unit may use the Thread protocol for achieving such communications. In some embodiments, thewireless communications system 566 may also include a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) radio for communication with user devices. - The
processing system 560 may be primarily located on thehead unit PCB 654 and may include a primary processor and a secondary processor. The primary processor may be a comparatively high-powered processor, such as the AM3703 chip, or the MCIMX6X3EVK10AB chip from Freescale™, and may be programmed to perform sophisticated thermostat operations, such as time-to-temperature calculations, occupancy determination algorithms, ambient temperature compensation calculations, software updates, wireless transmissions, operation of thedisplay driver 564, and regulation of the rechargingcircuitry 524. The secondary processor, such as the STM32L chip from ST microelectronics, may be a comparatively low-power processor when compared to the primary processor. The secondary processor may interact with the HVAC system to control a series of FET switches that control the functioning of the HVAC system. The secondary processor may also interface with various sensors inthermostat 102, such as the temperature sensors, a humidity sensor, an ambient light sensor, and/or the like. The secondary processor may also share duties with the primary processor in regulating the rechargingcircuitry 522 to provide power to all of the electrical systems on board thethermostat 102. Generally, the primary processor will operate in a “sleep” mode until high-power processing operations (e.g., wireless communications, user interface interactions, time-to-temperature calculations, thermal model calculations, etc.) are required, while the secondary processor will operate in an “awake” mode more often than the primary processor in order to monitor environmental sensors and wake the primary processor when needed. -
FIGS. 6G-6H illustrate exploded front and rear perspective views, respectively, of theback plate unit 542 with respect to its primary components, according to some embodiments. Backplate unit 542 comprises a back platerear plate 682, aback plate PCB 680, and aback plate cover 670. Visible inFIG. 6G are theHVAC wire connectors 684 that include integrated mechanical wire insertion sensing circuitry, and relativelylarge capacitors 686 that are used by part of the power stealing circuitry that is mounted on theback plate PCB 680. According to some embodiments,backplate 542 includes electronics and a temperature/humidity sensor in housing.Wire connectors 684 are provided to allow for connection to HVAC system wires, which pass though the large centralcircular opening 690, which is visible in each of the backplate primary components. Also visible in each of the backplate primary components are two mountingholes FIGS. 6G-6H are abubble level 672 to allow the user to install thethermostat 102 in a level position without additional tools. - The
back plate PCB 680 also may include approximately seven custompower isolation ICs 685 that isolate the internal electronics of thethermostat 102 from the relatively high 24 VAC signals of the HVAC system. Thepower isolation ICs 685 are custom software-resettable fuses that both monitor transient and anomalous voltage/current signals on the HVAC power/return wires and switch off the connection to isolate the thermostat against any dangerous signals that could damage the internal electronics. Thepower isolation ICs 685 receive command signals encoded in a clock square wave from theprocessing system 560 to open and close a pair of power FETs for each HVAC return wire in order to activate the corresponding HVAC function (e.g., fan, air-conditioning, heat, heat pump, etc.). A complete description of thepower isolation ICs 685 is given in the commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/591,804 filed on Jan. 7, 2015, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. -
FIG. 7 illustrates a power management and power harvesting system for a smart thermostat, according to some embodiments.FIG. 7 shows connections to common HVAC wiring, such as a W (heat call relay wire); Y (cooling call relay wire); Y2 (second stage cooling call relay wire); Rh (heat call relay power); Rc (cooling call relay power); G (fan call relay wire); O/B (heat pump call relay wire); AUX (auxiliary call relay wire); HUM (humidifier call relay wire); and C (common wire). As discussed above, thethermostat 102 comprises a plurality of FET switches 706 (such as thepower isolation ICs 685 ofFIG. 6H above) used for carrying out the essential thermostat operations of connecting or “shorting” one or more selected pairs of HVAC wires together according to the desired HVAC operation. The operation of each of the FET switches 706 is controlled by thesecondary processor 708 which can comprise, for example, an STM32L 32-bit ultra-low power ARM-based microprocessor available from ST Microelectronics. -
Thermostat 102 further comprises poweringcircuitry 710 that comprises components contained on both thebackplate 542 andhead unit 540. Generally speaking, it is the purpose of poweringcircuitry 710 to extract electrical operating power from the HVAC wires and convert that power into a usable form for the many electrically-driven components of thethermostat 102.Thermostat 102 further comprisesinsertion sensing components 712 configured to provide automated mechanical and electrical sensing regarding the HVAC wires that are inserted into thethermostat 102.Thermostat 102 further comprises a relatively high-power primary processor 732, such as an AM3703 Sitara ARM microprocessor available from Texas Instruments, that provides the main general governance of the operation of thethermostat 102.Thermostat 102 further comprisesenvironmental sensors 734/738 (e.g., temperature sensors, humidity sensors, active IR motion sensors, passive IR motion sensors, multi-channel thermopiles, ambient visible light sensors, accelerometers, ambient sound sensors, ultrasonic/infrasonic sound sensors, microwave sensors, GPS sensors, etc.), as well as other components 736 (e.g., electronic display devices and circuitry, user interface devices and circuitry, wired communications circuitry, wireless communications circuitry, etc.) that are operatively coupled to theprimary processor 732 and/orsecondary processor 708 and collectively configured to provide the functionalities described in the instant disclosure. - The
insertion sensing components 712 include a plurality ofHVAC wiring connectors 684, each containing an internal springable mechanical assembly that, responsive to the mechanical insertion of a physical wire thereinto, will mechanically cause an opening or closing of one or more dedicated electrical switches associated therewith. With respect to theHVAC wiring connectors 684 that are dedicated to the C, W, Y, Rc, and Rh terminals, those dedicated electrical switches are, in turn, networked together in a manner that yields the results that are illustrated inFIG. 7 by theblocks block 716, which is provided at anode 719, is dictated solely by virtue of the particular combination of C, W, and Y connectors into which wires have been mechanically inserted in accordance with the following rules: if a wire is inserted into the C connector, then thenode 719 becomes the C node regardless of whether there are any wires inserted into the Y or W connectors; if no wire is inserted into the C connector and a wire is inserted into the Y connector, then thenode 719 becomes the Y node regardless of whether there is a wire inserted into the W connector; and if no wire is inserted into either of the C or Y connectors, then thenode 719 becomes the W node.Block 718 is shown as being coupled to theinternal sensing components 712 by virtue of double lines termed “mechanical causation,” for the purpose of denoting that its operation, which is either to short the Rc and Rh nodes together or not to short the Rc and Rh nodes together. Whether theblock 718 will short, or not short, the Rc and Rh nodes together is dictated solely by virtue of the particular combination of Rc and Rh connectors into which wires have been mechanically inserted.Block 718 will keep the Rc and Rh nodes shorted together, unless wires have been inserted into both the Rc and Rh connectors, in which case theblock 718 will not short the Rc and Rh nodes together because a two-HVAC-transformer system is present. Theinsertion sensing circuitry 712 is also configured to provide at least two signals to thesecondary processor 708, the first being a simple “open” or “short” signal that corresponds to the mechanical insertion of a wire, and the second being a voltage or other level signal that represents a sensed electrical signal at that terminal. The first and second electrical signals for each of the respective wiring terminals can advantageously be used as a basis for basic “sanity checking” to help detect and avoid erroneous wiring conditions. - Basic operation of each of the FET switches 706 is achieved by virtue of a respective control signal (e.g., W-CTL, Y-CTL) provided by the
secondary processor 708 that causes the correspondingFET switch 706 to “connect” or “short” its respective HVAC lead inputs for an ON control signal, and that causes the correspondingFET switch 706 to “disconnect” or “leave open” or “open up” its respective HVAC lead inputs for an “OFF” control signal. By virtue of the above-described operation ofblock 718, it is automatically the case that for single-transformer systems having only an “R” wire (rather than separate Rc and Rh wires as would be present for two-transformer systems), that “R” wire can be inserted into either of the Rc or Rh terminals, and the Rh-Rc nodes will be automatically shorted to form a single “R” node, as needed for proper operation. In contrast, for dual-transformer systems, the insertion of two separate wires into the respective Rc and Rh terminals will cause the Rh-Rc nodes to remain disconnected to maintain two separate Rc and Rh nodes, as needed for proper operation. - Referring now to the powering
circuitry 710 inFIG. 7 , provided is a configuration that automatically adapts to the powering situation presented to thethermostat 102 at the time of installation and thereafter. The poweringcircuitry 710 comprises a full-wave bridge rectifier 720, a storage and waveform-smoothing bridge output capacitor 722 (which can be, for example, on the order of 30 microfarads), a buckregulator circuit system 724, a power-and-battery (PAB)regulation circuit 728, and a rechargeable lithium-ion battery 730. In conjunction with other control circuitry including backplatepower management circuitry 727, head unitpower management circuitry 729, and thesecondary processor 708, the poweringcircuitry 710 is configured and adapted to have the characteristics and functionality described hereinbelow. - By virtue of the configuration illustrated in
FIG. 7 , when there is a “C” wire presented upon installation, the poweringcircuitry 710 operates as a relatively high-powered, rechargeable-battery-assisted AC-to-DC converting power supply. When there is not a “C” wire presented, the poweringcircuitry 710 operates as a power-stealing, rechargeable-battery-assisted AC-to-DC converting power supply. As illustrated inFIG. 7 , the poweringcircuitry 710 generally serves to provide the voltage Vcc MAIN that is used by the various electrical components of thethermostat 102, and that in one embodiment will usually be about 3.7V-3.95V. The general purpose of poweringcircuitry 710 is to convert the 24 VAC presented between the input leads 719 and 717 to a steady DC voltage output at the Vcc MAIN node to supply the thermostat electrical power load. - Operation of the powering
circuitry 710 for the case in which the “C” wire is present is now described. When the 24 VAC input voltage betweennodes wave bridge rectifier 720, a DC voltage atnode 723 is present across thebridge output capacitor 722, and this DC voltage is converted by thebuck regulator system 724 to a relatively steady voltage, such as 4.4 volts, atnode 725, which provides an input current IBP to the power-and-battery (PAB)regulation circuit 728. - The
secondary processor 708 controls the operation of the poweringcircuitry 710 at least by virtue of control leads leading between thesecondary processor 708 and thePAB regulation circuit 728, which for one embodiment can include an LTC4085-4 chip available from Linear Technologies Corporation. The LTC4085-4 is a USB power manager and Li-Ion/Polymer battery charger originally designed for portable battery-powered applications. ThePAB regulation circuit 728 provides the ability for thesecondary processor 708 to specify a maximum value IBP(max) for the input current IBP. ThePAB regulation circuit 728 is configured to keep the input current at or below IBP(max), while also providing a steady output voltage Vcc, such as 4.0 volts, while also providing an output current Icc that is sufficient to satisfy the thermostat electrical power load, while also tending to the charging of therechargeable battery 730 as needed when excess power is available, and while also tending to the proper discharging of therechargeable battery 730 as needed when additional power (beyond what can be provided at the maximum input current IBP(max)) is needed to satisfy the thermostat electrical power load. - Operation of the powering
circuitry 710 for the case in which the “C” wire is not present is now described. As used herein, “inactive power stealing” refers to the power stealing that is performed during periods in which there is no active call in place based on the lead from which power is being stolen. As used herein, “active power stealing” refers to the power stealing that is performed during periods in which there is an active call in place based on the lead from which power is being stolen. - During inactive power stealing, power is stolen from between, for example, the “Y” wire that appears at
node 719 and the Rc lead that appears atnode 717. There will be a 24 VAC HVAC transformer voltage present acrossnodes 719/717 when no cooling call is in place (i.e., when the Y-Rc FET switch is open). For one embodiment, the maximum current IBP(max) is set to a relatively modest value, such as 20 mA, for the case of inactive power stealing. Assuming a voltage of about 4.4 volts atnode 725, this corresponds to a maximum output power from thebuck regulator system 724 of about 88 mW. This power level of 88 mW has been found to not accidentally trip the HVAC system into an “on” state due to the current following through the call relay coil. During this time period, thePAB regulator 728 operates to discharge thebattery 730 during any periods of operation in which the instantaneous thermostat electrical power load rises above 88 mW, and to recharge the battery (if needed) when the instantaneous thermostat electrical power load drops below 88 mW. The thermostat 700 is configured such that the average power consumption is well below 88 mW, and indeed for some embodiments is even below 10 mW on a long-term time average. - Operation of the powering
circuitry 710 for “active power stealing” is now described. During an active heating/cooling call, it is necessary for current to be flowing through the HVAC call relay coil sufficient to maintain the HVAC call relay in a “tripped” or ON state at all times during the active heating/cooling call. Thesecondary processor 708 is configured by virtue of circuitry denoted “PS MOD” to turn, for example, the Y-Rc FET switch OFF for small periods of time during the active cooling call, wherein the periods of time are small enough such that the cooling call relay does not “un-trip” into an OFF state, but wherein the periods of time are long enough to allow inrush of current into thebridge rectifier 720 to keep thebridge output capacitor 722 to a reasonably acceptable operating level. For one embodiment, this is achieved in a closed-loop fashion in which thesecondary processor 708 monitors the voltage VBR atnode 723 and actuates the signal Y-CTL as necessary to keep thebridge output capacitor 722 charged. According to one embodiment, it has been found advantageous to introduce a delay period, such as 60-90 seconds, following the instantiation of an active heating/cooling cycle before instantiating the active power stealing process. This delay period has been found useful in allowing many real-world HVAC systems to reach a kind of “quiescent” operating state in which they will be much less likely to accidentally un-trip away from the active cooling cycle due to active power stealing operation of thethermostat 102. According to another embodiment, it has been found further advantageous to introduce another delay period, such as 60-90 seconds, following the termination of an active cooling cycle before instantiating the inactive power stealing process. This delay period has likewise been found useful in allowing the various HVAC systems to reach a quiescent state in which accidental tripping back into an active cooling cycle is avoided. -
FIG. 8 illustrates an example of a smart home environment, such as the smart home environment ofFIG. 1 , within which one or more of the devices, methods, systems, services, and/or computer program products described further herein can be applicable. The depicted smart home environment includes astructure 150, which can include, e.g., a house, office building, garage, or mobile home. In some embodiments, thestructure 150 may correspond to one ofstructures 150A-150N described with reference toFIG. 1 . - Embodiments discussed herein generally relate to techniques for managing demand-response programs and events. The entities in a system for managing demand-response programs and events typically include a utility provider that provides electrical or other forms of energy from a power source (e.g., an electrical generator) to individual's homes or businesses. The individuals typically pay for the amount of energy they consume on a periodic, e.g., monthly, basis. In many embodiments an energy management system is disposed between the utility provider and the individuals. The energy management system operates to intelligently and effectively shift energy consumption of the individuals from one particular time period to other time periods. Such energy shifting is usually performed so as to shift energy consumption from a high energy cost period to a low energy cost period. In the case of DR events, energy is shifted from the DR event period to time periods outside of the DR event period.
- The energy management system according to many embodiments includes an intelligent, network-connected thermostat located at the individual's homes or businesses. Such a thermostat can acquire various information about the residence, such as a thermal retention characteristic of the residence, a capacity of an HVAC associated with the residence to cool or heat the residence, a likelihood of the residence being occupied (via occupancy sensors that, over time, can build an occupancy probability profile), a forecasted weather, a real-time weather, a real-time occupancy, etc. Moreover, the thermostat can be programmed by its users or may learn, over time, the preferences and habits of its users to set scheduled setpoints. In exemplary embodiments, a population of such network-connected thermostats associated with a respective population of individual homes and businesses are configured to communicate with one or more central servers managed by one or more cloud service providers. Each network-connected thermostat is associated with one or more accounts managed by the cloud service provider(s), and data is sent back and forth as needed between each network-connected thermostat and the central server(s) for providing a variety of advantageous functionalities such as facilitating remote control, reporting weather data, reporting HVAC control data and status information, and providing the centralized and/or partially centralized controlling and data communications required to carry out the DR-related, time-of-use (TOU)-related, and/or real-time pricing functionalities described herein.
- It is to be appreciated that although some embodiments herein may be particularly suitable and advantageous for commercial scenarios in which (i) the cloud service provider(s) associated with the population of network-connected thermostats is/are also the provider(s) of the described energy management system, (ii) the provider(s) of the energy management system are separate and distinct business entities from the utilities themselves, and (iii) the energy management system is provided as a value-added service to the utilities, the scope of the present description is in no way limited to such scenarios. In other applicable scenarios, for example, all of the elements can be provided by the utility. In other applicable scenarios, some of the elements can be provided by the utility while other elements can be provided by a governmental entity or by miscellaneous combinations of disparate cooperating businesses or consortia. Prior to a DR event, based on a wealth of information the energy management system possesses regarding the residences it is managing, the energy management system can effectively predict how much energy a residence is likely to consume over an given period, such as over a DR event. Moreover, given the wealth of information regarding the residences, the energy management system may also generate variations to the residence's baseline thermostat setpoints that can be implemented during the DR event period. The variations can be made so that that the residence consumes less energy over the DR event period. Further yet, because of this wealth of information the energy management system has regarding the residences, the energy management system may also accurately predict the amount of energy likely to be reduced over the DR event period or, in other words, shifted from the DR event period to one or more time periods outside (e.g., shouldering) the DR event period.
- The described provisions for such energy consumption prediction and management brings about many advantages as described further hereinbelow. For example, not only does it allow the energy management system to effectively manage the energy consumption of a number of connected residences, but it also allows the energy management system to intelligently select a subset of residences from a large pool for participation in DR programs or events. The physical characteristics of residences and habitual tendencies of occupants of those residents vary widely across regions, and thus the potential energy savings/shifting also varies widely. The energy management system disclosed herein may intelligently choose the participants in an energy savings program to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.
- As the energy management system disclosed herein provides advantageous insight into energy-related characteristics of various residences on both individual and aggregate levels, the energy management system may also provide portals so that other interested parties, such as utility companies, may similarly have access to such information. As it is generally in the interests of the utility company to reduce energy consumption over a particular time period, the utility company similarly has interests in accessing such energy-related characteristics of the various residences individually and in the aggregate so as to more efficiently and effectively generate and manage DR events. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a utility portal is disclosed that enables the utility provider access to consumer-level energy-related information at a variety of levels of detail and complexity, for facilitating both economically smart and environmentally responsible decision making on resource planning and utilization.
- The specifics of these and other embodiments are further disclosed herein, and a further understanding of which can be appreciated with reference to the figures.

Theenergy management system 830 may be operable to engage in real-time two-way communications with electronic devices associated with theresidences 150A-150N via thenetwork 840, as well as in engage in real-time two-way communications with the utilityprovider computing system 820. In one particular embodiment, theenergy management system 830 may be operable to reduce the aggregate amount of energy consumed at theresidences 150A-150N so that the aggregate energy demand does not exceed the maximum energy supply limits of thepower generators 810A-810N. Such reductions may be achieved during any suitable time period through the day. For example, such reductions may be achieved during a demand-response (DR) event communicated by the utilityprovider computing system 820.

Thenetwork 840 may, furthermore, incorporate any suitable network topology.Network 840 may utilize any suitable protocol, and communication over thenetwork 840 may be enabled by wired or wireless connections, and combinations thereof. -
Residences 150A-150N are a variety of structures or enclosures that are associated with energy consumption. The structures may be span a variety of structure types, such as private residences, houses, apartments, condominiums, schools, commercial properties, single or multi-level office buildings, and/or manufacturing facilities. A number of examples described herein refer to the structure as being a private residence in the form of a house, but embodiments are not so limited as one skilled in the art would understand that the techniques described herein could equally be applicable to other types of structures. It is to be appreciated that, while some embodiments may be particularly advantageous for residential living scenarios, the scope of the present teachings is not so limited and may equally be advantageous for business environments, school environments, government building environments, sports or entertainment arenas, and so forth. Thus, while many of the descriptions below are set forth in residential living context, it is to be appreciated that this is for purposes of clarity of description and not by way of limitation. - The
residences 150A-150N typically include one or more energy consumption devices, which could be electrical energy consumption devices such as televisions, microwaves, home audio equipment, heating/cooling systems, laundry machines, dishwashers, etc. Similarly, energy consumption devices could include one or more other types of energy consumption devices such as gas consumption devices. For example, theresidences 150A-150N may include a natural gas (air/water/etc.) heater, stove, fireplace, etc. Theresidences 150A-150N in many embodiments include an intelligent, network connected thermostat that is operable to control the thermal environment of the residence. The thermostats may be considered to part of theenergy management system 830, in that much of the processing subsequently described herein may be performed by computing systems at theenergy management system 830 or by the thermostats themselves. Alternatively, the thermostats may be considered separate from theenergy management system 830 due to their remote geographical location with respect to other components of theenergy management system 830. In either case, electronic devices associated with theresidences 150A-150N may perform one or more of the operations described herein, and may include a variety of computer processors, storage elements, communications mechanisms, etc. as further described herein and as necessary to facilitate the described operations. While most embodiments are described in the context of situations where it is desired to reduce the temperature inside of the structure (e.g., during a hot summer), similar principles apply (just applied in the opposite) in situations where it is desired to increase the temperature inside of the structure (e.g., during a cold winter). For some embodiments, some or all of the intelligent, network-connected thermostats may be the same as or similar in functionality to the NEST LEARNING THERMOSTAT® available from Nest Labs, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. -
Power distribution network 860 is any suitable network for transferring energy from one or more of theelectrical power generators 810A-810N to one or more of theresidences 150A-150N. In an electrical distribution network,power distribution network 860 may include a variety of power lines, substations, pole-mounted transformers, and the like as known in the for carrying electricity from theelectrical power generators 810A-810N to theresidences 150A-150N. In a gas distribution network,power distribution network 860 may include a variety of compressor stations, storage elements, pipes, and the like for transporting natural or other types of energy producing gas from thepower generators 810A-810N (in this embodiment, gas wells and/or processing plants) to theresidences 150A-150N. -
System 800 in certain embodiments is a distributed system for managing demand-response programs and events utilizing several computer systems and components that are interconnected via communication links using one or more computer networks or direct connections. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that such a system could operate equally well in a system having fewer or a greater number of components than are illustrated inFIG. 8 . Thus, the depiction ofsystem 800 inFIG. 8 should be taken as being illustrative in nature, and not as limiting the scope of the present teachings. - The embodiments described herein may begin by scheduling electrical load usage across a variety of electrical devices (storage, electric vehicles, HVAC systems) or across a plurality of structures in a way that simultaneously minimizes overall energy costs, allows participation in load-shedding capacity markets, and maintains a comfortable environment for end-users. These embodiments may employ a centralized approach appropriate for control of a (i) large commercial or university campus, or (ii) a large collection of individual structures. These embodiments may operate on a time-scale of minutes, dispatching schedules to devices/structures under management that incorporate current information, as well as best available predictions. In what follows, a general framework is developed to describe how device models for energy storage, electric vehicles, and/or HVAC systems fit into this approach and to describe cost functions corresponding to a typical commercial power bill and participation in DR programs.
- A feature of what is referred to herein as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheduler is the includes incorporation of predictions for various important quantities (e.g. uncontrolled device loads, EV driver availability, thermal response of buildings, etc.) For the purposes of the simulations described below, relatively simple predictions are considered, as they have been shown to be sufficient for responding to DR events while efficiently minimizing required computing power. This approach can be applied to scheduling various electrical load combinations with the simultaneous goals of reducing electricity costs, supporting the grid through DR support, and keeping end-users happy.
- The following description includes mathematical notation that will be readily understood by one having skill in the art. Specifically, the following description shows how to set up equations used by a dispatch engine to properly describe the optimization problem for selecting individual electrical loads to combine during a DR event. Once this optimization problem is formulated, it can be solved in many different ways, such as using a general linear solver or a “greedy” algorithm that will be described in greater detail below.
- Formally, define u1 . . . , un to be the power consumption of n devices with uiε
- In addition to power consumption, each device also has internal state xiεχT, which describes relevant device-specific quantities. For an HVAC system, this could include internal building temperatures. For an electric vehicle (EV) charging station, this might include a maximum charging rate and a required energy for the currently charging EV. These variables can be important in modeling the impact of power consumption on devices and users, such as changes in internal temperature due to HVAC power consumption.
- A power schedule can be produced for all devices by solving an optimization problem over these x1 . . . , xn and u1 . . . , un variables,
-
minimize f(x 1 . . . , x n ,u 1 , . . . u n) (1) -
subject to g i(u i ,x i)≦0 for i=1, . . . ,n - where the f objective can include both well-known energy costs (e.g., time-of-use charges, demand charges, demand-response penalties) as well as softer costs (e.g., user satisfaction). The gi terms may define hard constraints due to physical limitations (battery capacity) or due to hard user constraints (e.g., the EV must have 5 kWh by 5 pm). Note that while u1 . . . un denotes the scheduled power for each device over the entire time horizon, as is standard in model predictive control, only the first action in this schedule needs to be executed, then the optimization problem can be resolved again with updated information in the next interval.
- Next, the details of terms in the cost function f are described that depend only on power consumption u1 . . . un, and thus make up the utility power bill as well as determine revenue from participating in DR programs. There are essentially two types of cost functions: those that depend on a pre-defined rate plan and that are applied at the meter level, and those based on capacity events that are declared days or hours in advance. Furthermore, whereas the most basic energy charges are additive and thus can be separated at the individual device or structure level, demand charges and capacity events lead to nonlinear functions that apply to a group of devices or structures simultaneously (e.g. all devices behind a single meter) leading to an overall cost function that applies at different levels of granularity. In what follows, cost functions are described for the most common rate plan charges (i.e., time-of-use energy charges, and demand charges) as well as for capacity events.
- The most basic of electricity costs is a fixed time-of-use charge applied to the amount of energy used at a particular time at a given device or structure. This cost function decomposes over the individual devices and
-
- where ci TOU denotes the time of use charge for each individual device. For each device, the energy charge for the rate plan combined with the amount of energy used by the device at that time is given by,
-
f Tou(x;c)=Δx T c (3) - where Δ represents the appropriate constant for converting average power in kW to energy in kWh. For example, h=5/60 if the time interval for scheduling is 5 minutes.
- Like the time of use charges, demand charges can also be codified in the rate schedule for a particular meter. These charges are a rough proxy for utility costs that are incurred due to higher peak power usage. Of course, they only roughly approximate the true utility cost because the peak for an individual meter may not correspond exactly to the peak for the overall grid. Nonetheless, these charges are a significant component of the monthly bill for many rate plans and thus an important term to minimize.
- For demand charges, groups of devices can be considered that are behind a particular meter. Additionally, for the same group of devices, there may be several demand charges that apply over different periods of the scheduling window. For example, scheduling beginning at 9 AM in a summer month, some embodiments may need to consider peak demand charges that are active during the middle of the day, as well as partial peak charges that are active in the morning hours. This can be written as a sum over the demand charges, where each demand charge is determined by the sum of individual devices within that group, such as all devices behind a single meter,
-
- where lk denotes the predicted power consumption for uncontrolled devices behind the same meter, mk represents maximum power consumption thus far in the billing period, and ck (DC) denotes the demand charge rate from the rate plan denominated in $/kW. For each individual meter, the incremental cost incurred can be determined by the amount we increase the maximum power consumption, given by
-
f DC(x;m,c)=cmax{u 1 −m 1 , . . . , u T −m T}. (5) - Unlike time of use and demand charges, capacity events are not fixed in the rate structure, and are instead declared by grid operators with some advanced notice. Typically, participants self-nominate or bid on a particular load capacity that can be shed on demand in order to support the grid. In order to quantify the amount of demand reduction during a capacity event, a baseline methodology may be used to define the power consumption under “normal” conditions. For example, a 10-day average, excluding weekends and holidays, may be considered and adjusted for day-of power consumption prior to the event.
- The goal of this term in the scheduler is to ensure that after events are declared, loads are scheduled in a way that minimizes energy cost due to penalties incurred from not supplying the pre-agreed capacity. These events are typically defined at a relatively coarse granularity that includes multiple meters, but as with demand charges, groups of loads can be enumerated that are relevant for a particular event and the sum of all devices in these groups can be considered together as
-
- where bk denotes the baseline, pk denotes the nominated capacity. The actual penalty function for an event depends on the program in question and can include quantities such as the price to purchase capacity in the real-time energy markets. One example is a non-symmetric cost function with significant penalties for under performance and limited/no upside for shedding more capacity than is required. A simple example places a linear penalty on under-delivering given by
-
f DR(x;b,p)=c T(x−b−p) (7) - Next device models for energy storage devices, electric vehicles, and HVAC systems are described. These constraints are determined by known physical properties (e.g., a lithium-ion battery with a 50 MWh capacity and a 10 MW charge/discharge rate) as well as predictions of physical properties (e.g., weather forecasts, arrival and departure of electric vehicles). Constraints can also be used to incorporate user preferences (e.g. vehicle must have 5 kWh of charge by 5 p.m. or building temperature must between 70°-74° F.), ensuring that the optimal schedule respects the needs of electricity consumers. Alternatively, preferences may be incorporated through additional terms, but this introduces a tradeoff between energy costs and user happiness. By instead making these hard constraints, the assumption that maintaining user happiness is more important than reducing energy costs can be encoded.
- First, a dedicated energy storage device, such as a lithium-ion battery, may be considered. The constraints for these devices may take into account the maximum charge/discharge rate and the physical constraints on battery capacity
-
- where e0 is the initial energy stored in the battery, emax is the maximum capacity measured in kWh, and rmin and rmax are the maximum charge/discharge rates. The first constraint ensures that the total energy remains within the capacity of the battery, while the second constraint bounds the charge/discharge rate at each time interval. Recall that the convention that ut<0 represents sourcing of power, such as discharging the battery.
- Next, consider the scheduling of electric vehicles, which are essentially small energy storage devices that arrive and depart at various times. It can be assumed that EVs do not support bidirectional power flow, but the extension to this case is straightforward. From the perspective of the grid, when scheduling electric vehicle charging stations, a model can be where EV drivers specify their preferences to the scheduler in terms of desired departure time and charge when they plug in (“I need 5 kWh by 5:30 pm”). This leads to the constraints
-
- where the user has specified a need for edesired charge by Tdepart, e0 is the current state of the battery, and rmax corresponds to the maximum EV charging rate (e.g., 6.6 kW for
standard Level 2 charging). In the case that e0 is not observed (e.g. battery state may be unknown when the EV driver begins charging), the initial battery state can be estimated from historical data or conservatively take e0=0. Additionally, when an EVSE is empty or no user constraints are specified, the expected arrival, depature, and required charge can also be estimated from historical data. Note that EV battery controllers slow their charging rate as the battery becomes full, and thus EVSE implementations may communicate with the scheduler to adjust rmax as appropriate, setting rmax=0 when the battery is completely full. - Controlling an HVAC load requires a slightly more complicated model able to specify the relationship between power consumption and internal building temperatures. A linear model may be adopted having the state variables xt representing the internal building temperature with
-
x t+1 =x t +a(T t external −x t)+bu t (10) - where a and b are physical constants representing the thermal properties of the building and cooling efficiency, respectively. User preferences can be incorporated as constraints in the model on internal building temperatures in the range of Tmin≦xt≦Tmax. For example, occupants of an office building may expect temperatures in the range 70°-74° F. under normal circumstances, but may be willing to tolerate slightly higher temperatures for short periods during capacity events. Note that commercial building management systems may have their own sophisticated control systems that maintain desired set points in application-specific ways. The output of the scheduler can be mapped to these systems as a post-processing step and/or by incorporating more application-specific details and state in the constraints.
- To schedule various loads from a plurality of electrical loads for use in energy reduction, the equations and constraints described above can be used as inputs to a linear solver. In some embodiments, an algorithm referred to herein as a “Greedy Tetris” scheduler may be used to schedule different customers' load drop flexibility to achieve a desired aggregate load drop shape in magnitude and time.
- This algorithm begins with two assumptions: (1) each customer or structure can be represented by a time-series of how much they can drop in a given time interval, and for how many time intervals such a drop may occur; and (2) once a customer is dispatched, the dispatch will not stop and restart at another time during the same event. Market rules vary by location and ISO/utility, but here it will be assumed that there is no incentive to over-perform, i.e. to drop more load than was committed up front. An extension for exception cases will be introduced below.
-
FIG. 9 illustrates a flowchart of a method for scheduling individual loads for a load-drop event, according to some embodiments. The method may include, for a first time interval of a load-drop event, selecting available loads to dispatch (902). This initial selection of loads to dispatch may be selected such that there is just enough estimated load drop to meet required capacity that was committed by the energy management system. The first time interval may refer to a unit of performance evaluation, which could be a fixed time interval, such as an hour, or a duration of the entire load-drop event. The initial selection of loads may be calculated by aggregating individual load drops from each load until the required capacity is reached. - The method may also include determining an actual load drop during the first time interval using the initial selection of loads, and determining whether the actual load drop meets the capacity requirement (904). If the actual load drop does not meet the capacity requirement, the scheduling system can dispatch additional electrical loads until the actual load drop meets the capacity requirement (906). These two steps of the process may be repeated during the current time interval as needed. It will be understood that the actual load drop can fluctuate during the current time interval due to customer interactions with their thermostat. When the current time interval is completed, the algorithm can move on to a subsequent time interval (908).
- During a subsequent time interval (908), a determination can be made as to which loads from the previous time interval can remain dispatched and which loads cannot remain dispatched (910). Some customers may limit the length of time that they are willing to shed electrical load during a demand-response event. Other thermostat/HVAC system combinations may simply not shed enough load to make their continued inclusion in the load shedding pool worthwhile. Similar to step 902 above, additional electrical loads can be added until the estimated load drop during the subsequent time interval meets the capacity requirement. After the initial selection of electrical loads during the subsequent time interval, a rebalancing process can be instituted similar to
steps steps 912, 914 can also determine whether the average over the entire event is less than the capacity requirement, and then add additional loads in response. - For each subsequent time interval, a rebalancing process as described above can be used to maintain an average load dispatch over the entire event that is approximately equal to the capacity requirement. As each subsequent time interval expires, the scheduling system can move to the next time interval (916), again determine which loads can remain dropped (910), and rebalance loads according to the average load drop over the entire event in relation to the capacity requirement (912, 914). After the last time interval (916), the event will end, and analysis can be performed regarding the efficiency of the scheduling algorithm described above.
- This general scheme works regardless of whether event performance is judged in discrete intervals, or averaged over the entire event. It is also not dependent on knowing the duration of the event ahead of time. This algorithm is simple and fast, and requires little in the way of computing resources. Although it uses rebalancing, and is not necessary optimal in all cases, this algorithm avoids extensive forward-looking planning. If load-shedding rules include some incentive for over performance (e.g., extra payments for shedding more electrical load than agreed to upfront) then the algorithm of
FIG. 9 can be modified by identifying the optimal drop level to be reached, based on a trade-off of expected payout versus costs. “Cost” in this sense can be represented as the cost of dispatching more customers in terms of user satisfaction. Once the optimal drop level has been determined, the greedy algorithm ofFIG. 9 can proceed as described above, using the optimal drop level instead of the agreed-to capacity requirement. - The dispatch engine described above may be responsible for generating an optimal dispatch schedule given a DR event start time and the constraints that apply to each load (e.g., each home with a customer having a smart thermostat). This optimization performed by the dispatch engine they provide at least two benefits. First, the expected payout for the given event performance may be calculated by using the DR program rules in conjunction with the specific energy-saving characteristics of the grouping of loads provided by the dispatch engine. Second, a significant amount of flexibility may be realized during and after a given event. This flexibility can be potentially used to dispatch into energy markets, so it also carries some real-world monetary value.
- The bidding engine and the load models described above allow a thermostat management server to predict and simulate how different load combinations will perform during future DR events. Parameters can be changed during a simulation to find an optimized combination of loads for given DR program rules. This can be beneficial when energy companies require estimated energy savings prior to DR events. In some arrangements, an energy company may place certain future DR events up for bid among various load-saving customers. For example, a utility company may ask for a 4 MW reduction during a certain date/time. When submitting a bid to provide the required energy reduction, the thermostat management server can calculate the likelihood that the thermostat network will be able to shed the required amount of energy based on simulating various load configurations returned by the dispatch engine described above. These simulations can provide an expected energy savings, along with a statistical risk associated with accepting the utility provider's request. As described above, most utility providers do not offer monetary incentives for overestimating the amount of energy reduced. However, most energy providers do charge monetary penalties for underestimating the amount of energy reduced. Therefore, it may be beneficial for the thermostat management server to determine the optimal combination of loads using the dispatch engine to shed as closely as possible the required amount of energy by the utility provider.
- In order to identify the optimal combination of loads and provide a statistical risk score for each load configuration, a bidding engine can be used in conjunction with the dispatch engine to perform such simulations.
FIG. 10 illustrates a system diagram of a thermostat management server that includes the dispatch engine and bidding engine, according to some embodiments. Thedispatch engine 1004 and thebidding engine 1002 represent the major functional blocks of the load-shedding system. Thebidding engine 1002 may be responsible for determining how much capacity should be nominated for each of the demand response resources. Thedispatch engine 1004, in turn, can schedule individual assets of a resource during demand response events. Information regarding each of the assets/resources (e.g., thermal characteristics of homes, HVAC capacities, etc.) can be stored in adatabase 1006 at the thermostat management server. AnAPI 1008 can connect assistant to external computer systems, such as the utility provider computer system. TheAPI 1008 can also source thermostat-level information, events, and dispatch the actual system instructions for individual thermostats. -
FIG. 11 illustrates a flowchart of a method for estimating an optimal amount of load capacity to agree to shed during future DR events, according to some embodiments. The method may include uploading information about assets and resources, such as their load flexibility, through the API into the database (1102). This information may be uploaded constantly and/or periodically from thermostats in operation in various homes. The method may also include receiving DR parameters for upcoming DR events (1104). This information may be provided by the utility provider computer system, and may generally describe DR events during an upcoming season. For example, this information may request an amount of energy to be shed, along with start times, end times, durations, locations, and so forth. - The method may additionally include a simulation loop performed by the bidding engine, the details of which will be described further below. Within this loop, the dispatch engine can determine a load configuration to be simulated, such as a grouping of homes having smart thermostats installed therein (1106). The bidding engine can perform, for example, a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the amount of load to be shed using that configuration based on varying weather conditions, energy prices, and so forth (1108). This loop (1110) can be performed using many different configurations selected by the dispatch engine.
- After the bidding engine has performed the simulations above, the method may include generating a set of statistical data relating the load capacity shed to the risk of underperformance when agreeing to service the DR events (1112). In an example described below, the statistical information may include a set of curves showing an expected value, a 10th percentile value, a 90th percentile value, and so forth. The statistical information can be provided to the thermostat management system, which can then make a decision as to how much load can be reliably shed based on a desired level of risk. Once the load shedding capability has been determined, the method may include sending the estimate of the capacity to shed load during the future DR events to the utility provider computer system (1114).
- What follows is an illustration of how the bidding engine can generate a set of statistical data that can allow the thermostat management server to determine the optimal amount of load that can be shared during DR events. This approach incorporates (i) a statistical categorization of the drop in energy consumption with respect to a monetized baseline as reported to the utility providers that run the demand response programs, and (ii) a way to use these models with the inherent uncertainty in weather forecasts within a Monte Carlo simulation framework that provides capacity nomination versus payout curves. These embodiments use models of uncertainty to generate many instances, or sample paths, for future monthly demand response event realizations. These models then compute the actual payout outcomes of these different realizations. The result of this analysis is a set of distribution curves as a function of the upfront capacity nomination.
- Characterizing the drop in energy consumption with respect to the utility-reported baseline is one parameter in estimating the ability to respond when the demand response event is called. The key challenges in implementing this procedure were in the amount of uncertainty (noise) that was present in this process. Therefore these embodiments required an approach that placed special attention on how the estimation noise is reduced. The capacity drop analysis was broken down into two components: (i) the difference between the predicted baseline vs the utility-based (monetization) baseline, and (ii) the drop of the actual demand with respect to the predicted baseline (instead of the utility-based baseline). These embodiments have been shown to efficiently control the noise in the estimation procedure, which may be important given the typically very limited DR event history. All the applied methods were statistically rigorous. This is the only known approach that incorporates noise and provides the risk-averse strategy in coming up with the DR program nominations.
- First, the approach in estimating the drop includes estimating a difference between the actual load during the demand response event and the utility baseline based on which the resource is monetized. Predicting this quantity can be challenging due to the inherent uncertainty of the utility baseline and the fairly small number of available demand response events that can be used to build the capacity drop prediction model. The noise can be limited in the capacity drop estimation by exploiting the following equality.
-
(B(t)−A(t))I DR(t)=(B(t)−P(t))+(P(t)(1−I DR(t))−A(t)I DR(t)) (10) - A(t) represents the actual power at time t, B (t) represents the utility baseline at time t, P(t) represents the baseline prediction at time t, DR(t) represents the DR state at time t, and/represents an indicator function. Note that the first term in (10) does not depend on the demand response event. Instead, it represents the difference between the utility baseline and the corresponding prediction, and the model can be built using all of the available historic data. On the other hand, the second term in (10) depends on actual DR events, and the estimation uncertainty stems from a commonly small number of events, as well as the uncertainty in demand and weather forecasts. Bid nominations are usually registered at least a month ahead. However, in general, month-ahead predictions are very noisy especially for loads that depend on the outside temperature, such as HVACs.
- Assigning loads to a DR program depends on the ability of the utility baseline to track actual load. The drop of the actual demand with respect to the utility provided baseline is noisy. Thus, the estimation noise can be controlled by considering the terms in (10) separately, while adding the correlation between the two terms. However, the drop with respect to the predicted power exhibits a more clear trend as a function of outside temperature and the power prediction. This is due to the fact that the trained power prediction algorithms take into account many more effects than the utility's baseline procedure. There is a limit to what can be done in predicting the utility baseline—it is always going to be noisy to some degree—unless the demand cab be controlled to reduce the load variability. To that end, the estimation can be optimized by focusing on the DR-likely days, including the actual event days. Using a Principle Component Analysis (PCA), the historical information can be used to identify warm days with similar daily consumption profiles.
- In order to predict the DR capacity drop with respect to the predicted power during the DR event, uncertainty in predicting the drop depends on different factors, such as the DR event frequency and the data availability (e.g., power data, temperature forecasts). A differentiation can be made between models that (i) capture the DR state and its duration, and directly provide drop estimate, and (ii) exploit clustering techniques to improve predictions accuracy. In some embodiments, a linear model can accept temperature and weather conditions, time of the week, day of week, and DR related states as inputs. One way to improve the drop prediction accuracy is by focusing only on the event days. Note that the drop is a function of the time of day, which can be excluded from the analysis below, since DR events are almost always triggered at the same time.
- With the capacity estimation process established above, the system can then execute a risk-aware bidding procedure. Each DR program has a payout that is a function of B(t)−A(t) at times for which DR (t)=1, along with other factors, such as month of the year, type of the program (“day ahead” or “day of”), and so forth. There are two concepts that characterize the available payments. The first is the payment ratio based on the delivery ratio. In other words, each month, a certain DR capacity can be nominated. The performance achieved during the DR event (i.e. actual drop from baseline) relative to the nominated capacity is the delivered capacity ratio. The payment or penalty based on this delivered capacity ratio is shown in
FIG. 12 . Note that the Payment Ratio levels off as the Delivered Capacity Ratio increases, leveling off at a ratio of 1.0. This signifies that there is no benefit to over estimating the capacity reduction. - This capacity payment determined by the Payment Ratio is a function of a random process of hourly event drops throughout a given month. In order to evaluate its behavior, a Monte-Carlo simulation can be used. N monthly samples can be generated (i.e., sequences of monthly event drops) using the previously discussed prediction models. Given the selected DR nomination value, the quantile values can be estimated which converge to the actual values as the number of samples N grows. Specifically, the bidding engine derives the expected payoff for different capacity nominations for a given load combination. At this stage, all the uncertainties (e.g., load performance, weather, timing of events) are taken into account to yield a performance distribution for each given capacity nomination. The bidding engine is implemented as a Monte Carlo outer loop around the dispatch engine, which tests dispatch behavior by running many iterations for each capacity point. For each iteration, the bidding engine chooses a given event time and duration from the event distribution, along with a load drop for each flexible load from its model, and then runs the dispatch engine to obtain a load schedule. The bidding engine then evaluates that schedule based on the DR program rules. After many iterations, the results are collected into a graph that shows the distribution of payouts (over a DR season) for different capacity nominations for a given set of load combinations.
-
FIG. 13 illustrates an example set of curves, according to some embodiments.Line 1302 captures the expected value of payout for each given capacity nomination for a given resource. But given that the payout is based on a number of uncertainties that are modelled, there is a certain distribution to the payout amount for each capacity.Line 1304 and line 1306 capture the 90th and 10th percentile of the payout, respectively. This is the payout amount that will be achieved in at least 90 and only 10 percent of the cases. There is aspecific capacity value 1308 which maximizes the expected payout. To the left of this capacity value 1308 (i.e. for smaller capacity values) the expected payout is reduced, but the distribution width is also reduced. In other words, there is a risk/reward trade-off that can be made, with a lower expected value but also a higher 90th percentile. - Implementation of the techniques, blocks, steps and means described above may be done in various ways.
