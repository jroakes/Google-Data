Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to communications within in computer network systems, and in particular to communications among various entities.
- On-line collaboration tools can permit a community of users to collaborate on projects, share information, meet and discuss issues, and make presentations, all on-line. They can be used with various sizes and types of user communities such as work teams, social networks, and other associations of users.
- a particular user community must be defined and set up by an administrator.
- the administrator determines and defines the membership of the community as well as members' permissions and rights with respect to a collaboration space. Oftentimes, the administrator will need to modify the membership of the community to reflect various changes in the community and/or permissions with respect to the collaboration space.
- the administrator also configures and maintains the collaboration space itself. In some instances, the rights and responsibilities of an administrator can be delegated to one or more members of the community. Such collaboration spaces, therefore, tend to require more than an insignificant amount of overhead to set up and maintain.
- methods and systems for providing communications include identifying a set of users satisfying a first condition and dynamically creating a shared communication space for the set of users.
- a respective set of communication permissions is identified for each of the users in the set of users with respect to the shared communication space and communication by the set of users is enabled with the shared communications space in accordance with the communication permissions.
- FIG. 1 depicts an environment in which embodiments of the invention can operate.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of a process for dynamically generating a shared space in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.

- An agent can be located on a client 102 and/or client or server in the network.
- Users can be identified as sharing a common set of characteristics in a number of ways. For example, users can be identified as sharing a common set of characteristics when they are performing the same or related activities, either directly or indirectly. In some embodiments, the identification is bounded by a time period (e.g., 15 minutes) within which the same or related activities are being performed by the users.
- a time period e.g. 15 minutes
- the activities can include, for example: submitting the same or related queries to a search system (such as search system 114 ), browsing and/or searching for information relating to the same or related topics (e.g., topics such as those found in the Open Directory Project, http://dmoz.org), shopping on-line for the same or related items and/or services, browsing within a group of related sites (e.g., sites associated with a directory structure such as the Open Directory Project), browsing the same or related content, and playing the same or a related electronic game.
- a user's browsing of content can include, but is not limited to, browsing content on a web page, web site, or other any source of content.
- a user's activities can be further characterized by identifying that the user is performing one or more activities associated with a particular locality (e.g., a user seeks to purchase an item within a defined geographical area).
- the activities can include composing, reading or otherwise accessing documents and/or services related to a same or similar topic, messaging to other users on the same or related topic (e.g., emailing to or instant messaging with another user a message whose contents is similar and/or related to a particular topic).
- it is sufficient that the users are involved in an activity where a user's computing experience may be supplemented by communicating with other users doing the same or a similar activity.
- mutually identified characteristics can be used to identify users. For example users sharing one or more common interests and/or characteristics (e.g., as might be found in a user profile) can be determined.
- the interests can include, for example, an identification that the user is interested in one or more topics (such as those found in the Open Directory Project).
- a user can identify interests and a user's preference toward one or more topics.
- Certain interests of the user can be inferred from a user's actions.
- the characteristics of a user can include, for example, age, gender, and geographic location.
- a user's membership in a group can be used to identify that user with the other members in the group.
- a client assistant 110 can monitor a user's activities with respect to one or more applications, such as a client application 108 , and provide information about the user's activities to an information system 106 .
- an information item (such as a cookie) that is provided along with a search or a resource request to a system (e.g., to the information system 106 ) can contain a user identifier that can be used to associate the user with the search or request.
- a user can be logged in to a service (e.g., an instant messaging service or web service) and the service can provide information about the user's activities.

- the various sources from which the shared space manager can obtain and/or receive information can include, but is not limited to, for example, the client 102 , the search system 114 , the messaging systems 138 and the other systems 140 .
- the shared space manager 134 can obtain and/or receive information with respect to interests shared by a plurality of users (e.g., by querying the user information database 118 ) to identify those users which share common interests.
- the various sources can communicate to the shared space manager 134 an on-line status of the user (e.g., active, inactive, away, or busy).
- shared space settings can be determined for the users.
- the shared space settings for a user can describe a user's desired communications to and from the shared space with varying degrees of granularity.
- a user can define (by permitting or prohibiting) what types of information can be received, what types of filtering should be applied to the received information, from which sources information may be received, and to which receivers the user's information can be provided.
- the types of information (sometimes referred to in this specification as “information items”) which can be permitted or restricted can fall into two general areas: static information and streaming information. Additionally, archived information of those types can be included, as well as group editing of any of the types.
- Static information can include, but is not limited to: text, advertisements, images, news items, map links, product reviews, phone numbers, e-mails, e-mail addresses, web page links, dictionary entries, syndication feeds, blog (web log) events, user polls, search queries, result selections from search results, advertisement selections, and links to files or other content on the client 102 .
- Syndication feeds can provide content distributed from various sources on a network (e.g., the Internet). Typically, syndication can be used for distributing various types of content to a number of receivers simultaneously (e.g., stock prices and weather reports).
- News items can be news items from one or more sources.
- Blog events can be events generated from one or more web logs (blogs).
- User polls can be polls that the user may participate in which may come from a variety of sources.
- Streaming information can include, but is not limited to: audio, video, chatroom participation, instant messaging, and computer control such as browsing, navigation, mouse location, keyboard events, and screen contents.
- a filter can provide a user with a means to restrict certain content based on various criteria (e.g., filtering out adult content). Filters can be user-created or system-provided. A user-created filter can be based on arbitrary criteria (e.g., specific word or word phrases).
- a user can describe in the user's shared space settings from which sources information items can be received.
- a user can, for example, restrict and/or permit information items from an arbitrary set of sources and/or a set based on an arbitrary set of attributes associated with sources (e.g., restricting information originating from sources in the “.prof” top level domain).
- a user can describe in the shared space settings to which receivers the user's information items can be sent.
- a user can, for example, restrict and/or permit receivers from receiving all or part of the user's information items to an arbitrary set of receivers and/or to a set of receivers based on an arbitrary set of attributes associated with receiver (e.g., permitting information to be provided to users who have a Google Gmail account).
- a user's shared space settings can be stored in the user information database 118 and/or the client memory 112 .
- a user's shared space settings can be established during a prior set up session for the user and/or during a transaction as part of an invitation transaction for inviting a user to participate in a shared space (described below).
- a user can modify the shared space settings at other times.
- a user can have different shared space settings for each shared space in which the user is a participant.
- a user can create default shared space settings that can be applied to new shared spaces to which the user is invited and/or reset shared space settings for one or more current shared spaces to a default state.
- a system default shared space setting can be established for one or more users.
- a user can be permitted to control the sharing of an information item on a per information item basis as that information is about to be shared.
- a set of system settings can be created that can apply to one or more shared spaces.
- the system setting can include constraint or permissions with respect to: certain users; transmissions to a set for receivers larger than a particular size (e.g., as might be done to minimize spam); sending or receiving information based on arbitrary attributes of the information item's content (e.g., a filter); and arbitrary restrictions placed by the users to whom the space has been allocated (e.g., by settings modifiable within the shared space itself).
- the system settings can be stored in the shared space manager 134 .
- a shared space can be created ( 206 ).
- a shared space can take a variety of forms.
- a shared space can be a chatroom, a pop-up window, a separate application window, a shared white board, a web page, or a combination thereof. It is sufficient that the shared space facilitate a one-way and/or two-way exchange of information items among users.
- the information items displayed in the shared space can include information items relevant to the common set of characteristics and/or information items provided by or selected by users, and other information items.
- the contents of a shared site can depend on the common set of characteristics.
- a shared space where the common set of characteristics involves searching for a particular shopping item can include for example, a chat space, searches performed by one or more of the users, results from one or more searches for the item, product reviews of the item, links to on-line auctions for the item, links to information on a network (e.g., the Internet or otherwise) relating to the item, advertisements relating to the item, and/or other resources relating to shopping for the item.
- a chat space searches performed by one or more of the users, results from one or more searches for the item, product reviews of the item, links to on-line auctions for the item, links to information on a network (e.g., the Internet or otherwise) relating to the item, advertisements relating to the item, and/or other resources relating to shopping for the item.
- a shared space where the common set of characteristics involves searching for information about a particular public company can include links to the company web site, links to on-line articles or news items relating to the company, one or more pieces of information relating to the company's stock price (e.g., a chart), links to the company governmental filings, and so on.
- Information relating to a shared space can be stored in the shared space memory 137 .
- one or more user can edit the types of information items displayed in the shared space (e.g., adding news feeds or product reviews).
- communications can be enabled for users in accordance with their respective shared space settings and any system settings ( 208 ).
- Users for example, can be provided an invitation to join a shared space.
- the invitation can include a link to the shared space and/or instructions for connecting to the shared space.
- the invitation can include options for the user to create the user's shared space settings with respect to that shared space.
- the user can have an option to use a default setting.
- the default setting can be a user's default setting or a system-supplied default setting.
- a user can choose to have revealed or to not have revealed the user's email address within the shared space and/or to the other users of the shared space.
- a user can choose to receive no advertisements as part the user's participation in particular shared space. Another user, however, can elect to receive advertisements for that same shared space. Accordingly, users may participate and receive information in accordance with their own shared space settings.
- the display on the client 102 of the shared space can therefore vary from user to user.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary screenshot of a shared space.
- a shared space window 302 includes a chat area 304 , a user identifier area 306 , an advertisements area 308 and other information items area 310 .

- the user identifier area 306 can include identifiers for the user of the shared space.
- the information presented about a user can be governed according to the user's shared space settings (e.g., a user may not desire to have his or her email revealed to the other users).
- the advertisements area 308 can include one or more advertisements relating to the common characteristics of the shared space.
- the advertisements can change based on the contents of one or more of the information items being displayed in the window 302 .
- the other information items area 310 can contain one or more information items as described above (e.g., product reviews).
- shared space window 302 is merely exemplary and a shared space may contain fewer, more, and/or different areas.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a client 400 .
- the client 400 generally includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 402 , one or more network or other communications interfaces 404 , memory 406 , and one or more communication buses 408 for interconnecting these components.
