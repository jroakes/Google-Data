Abstract
A search engine provides personalized rankings of search results. A user interest profile identifies topics of interest to a user. Each topic is associated with one or more sites, and a boost value, which can be used to augment an information retrieval score of any document from the site. Search results from any search are provided to the user, with a variable control of the ranking of the results. The results can be ranked by their unboosted information retrieval score, thus reflecting no personalization, or by their fully or partially boosted information retrieval scores. This allows the user to selectively control how their interests affect the ranking of the documents.

Technical field
The application's case relates to the on-line search engine by and large, and in particular to the personalization to Search Results.
Background technology
The present art of on-line search engine technique can be in response to very advanced aspect the ability of the document (for example webpage or its some part, image or the like) of query term in its retrieval.The particular document that search engine fast searching now and query term are complementary.Yet, though current search engine usually returns the document that does not reflect user's basic interest exactly corresponding to the ad hoc inquiry item at all.Therefore, (one of them is very interested in physical culture for two different users, and another is interested in politics) in a given inquiry, will obtain identical result, for example " medicine inspection in the baseball ", even first user may to have implemented medicine inspection interested in understanding which team, then user may be to understanding with to carry out the relevant legislation of medicine inspection in physical culture interested.Therefore, need provide a kind of interest to make the mechanism and the method for Search Results personalization according to the user.
In addition, though the user may have applicable to one group of specific interest of handling its search inquiry, the user may not think always to make these interest influence Query Result.Therefore, mechanism and the method that the degree that is desirable to provide a kind of user of making and can influences his interest the result of a given inquiry is carried out variable adjustment.
Summary of the invention
The invention provides and make a user influence system and the mode that the degree of the representation as a result of a given inquiry is carried out variable adjustment his or her personal interest.The present invention has a plurality of embodiment, comprises a kind of system that is used to provide a search engine, a kind of method that is used to handle a search inquiry and a kind of user interface of described influence degree being carried out variable adjustment for the user.
From user's viewpoint, the invention provides a kind of mechanism that is used to make the Search Results personalization.Described user can stipulate that one group of interest (one group of theme of for example described user's interest or classification) is as an interest profile.Then, described user is committed to a search engine with a search inquiry.The described search engine pair document relevant with described inquiry retrieves and provides these documents as Search Results.At first (though not certainly all like this) arranged described Search Results under the situation of not considering user interest.This makes the user can see the correlativity of described document and not influenced by his personal interest.The user can control arrangement to document in the search result set by variable mode.In a preferred embodiment, this is undertaken by direct manipulation figure control element (a kind of personalized control).This graphic elements can have different diagrammatic representation forms, and it is expressed as a slide sign in one embodiment.Adjust described control element just can interest profile according to him in expressed user interest adjust described result's degree of alignment.In response to the change in location of described control element, described Search Results is rearranged, thereby make described user can see how his interest influences the ordering to the result.
In one embodiment, the arrangement of Search Results can work to increase the correlativity score of the document that is associated with subject catalogue.Each theme in the described catalogue all is considered to the document (for example website) relevant with described theme and is associated with one group.For each document (being similarly the website), all provide the lifting values of the degree of correlation of a described website of indication and described theme.All pages in the one given website all obtain the lifting values of this website.Described lifting values can be regarded as the proportionality factor of the correlativity of a described website of expression and described theme.During query processing, return this group document and score and do not consider that it is contained in the described subject catalogue.In addition, determine the independent score of each document, the basic correlativity score of wherein said document is to adjust by its lifting values (if there is) that is associated, for example by described correlativity score be multiply by described lifting values, thus the correlativity of described document of bi-directional scaling and described inquiry.Generally speaking, those documents that only belong to listed website in the described catalogue just can have a correlativity score that promotes, and other document in the described Search Results will can not have the correlativity score of described lifting.Therefore, according to the correlativity score of the lifting of document document is rearranged can change with the position of personalization control-position of described personalized control from have no effect (wherein said lifting values is had no effect to described correlativity score) to influence (wherein lifting values 100% ground with each document is applied to described correlativity score) fully, reach the intermediate application level of any amount.Therefore, the user can come immediately the document in the described Search Results to be rearranged by the position of adjusting described control.
One system embodiment comprise one be used for to the user provide the search engine of the website that the subject catalogue, of theme (classification) is used for searching in response to user's inquiry tape index and index, and an interest that is used for according to the user be that described Search Results is determined the personalization component that described Search Results at least a (and preferable a group) is arranged.One user interface embodiment comprise a subject catalogue with various themes, and wherein said user can select interest topic some graphics controllers (for example check box), and one allow the user to come described Search Results is arranged the graphics controller of adjusting according to his interest profile.
Next, graphic and diagram and technical information are set forth the present invention with reference to each.Describedly graphicly just describe various embodiments of the present invention for illustrational purpose.The those skilled in the art will easily know by hereinafter illustrating, reach the alternate embodiment of described structure, method and function shown in also can adopting, and this does not deviate from principle of the present invention.

Embodiment
Referring now to Fig. 1,, shows the inlet (or login page) 100 of a search engine among the figure.Described search engine comprise one wherein the user import the inquiry input field 102 of a search query term.One search button 106 is submitted to described search engine with described inquiry and is handled.Described user will also not be used to make the user profile of Search Results personalization to define to one, and this is shown a message when visiting described search engine first.Described user-accessible editor Edit Profile (configuration file) link 104 is so that create its personal interest.
Click editor's link 104 and just can visit the page shown in Fig. 2 200.This page shows the top layer theme 204 of a subject catalogue 202.Theme in the described catalogue can be (for example) and is being present in
Http:// dmoz.org/The place OpenDirectory Project (open catalogue plan) in defined theme or can be a certain other subject catalogue.(in this disclosure, term " theme " is interchangeable with " classification ", and " subtopic " is also interchangeable with " subclass ".) described top layer topic links can have one group of subtopic by arrow 206 indication.At any one time, with beginning a search by clicking StartSearching (beginning search) button 208 per family.Click once specific top layer theme and the user can be taken to a page that is associated with the subtopic of described theme.
The result of this step of the theme " Computer " on the page 200 has been clicked in Fig. 3 graphic extension wherein user.As shown in Figure 3, the subtopic 302 of theme " Computer " has been presented in the row of the right hand.What be close to each subtopic 302 is a check box 314.The user can select check box 314 to indicate him interested in a specific subtopic.Perhaps, the user can select check box 316 at whole subtopic itself " Computer (General) ".This indication user is interested in all subtopics of theme " Computer ".This user-selected group theme can be called user profile, personalized configuration file or interest profile.In the left side of Fig. 3, after the user has selected one or more interest topics, in interest hurdle 306, list these themes.What be close to each subject name is one to make the user can delete the Remove Links 308 of each theme respectively.The user also can delete all themes by selecting " Delete all preferences " link 310.
Described subtopic itself can have the additional subtopic layer of arbitrary quantity.For example, Fig. 4 graphic extension subtopic " Games " further has subtopic 402 " Board Games ", " Card Games " or the like.These recreation are close to the subtopic arrow 206 of " Games " theme label and present to the user in response to user's click.Equally, the user can select whole subclass by selecting any one check box in check box 404 or each subtopic check box 406.In one embodiment, except that top layer theme 204, also have two subtopic layers.This can provide enough the theme cover width and the size of space, and can not apply unnecessary computation complexity.
Again referring to Fig. 3, the user has indicated him interested in the computing machine usually.Can call searched page 100 once more by clicking Start Searching (beginning search) button 208, searched page 100 shows that no longer the request user creates the message of personalized configuration file.At this moment, the user imports a search inquiry in described search column, and inquiry described herein is " Stanford " shown in Fig. 5.Search engine is implemented search and Search Results is provided its index.Fig. 6 graphic extension initial search result page 600.In addition, Search Results 602 comprises that one group shows the page text segment 619 of the part of described document context together with a link 615 and of leading to the described page to the user by the document 604 of a URL 617 indication respectively.Near described page top is personalized controller 608.In the context of the application's case, " document " is interpreted as the medium of arbitrary type that can be indexed and be retrieved by a search engine, comprises webpage, image, multimedia file, text document, PDF or the like.Use generic term " document " and unexpectedly containing and limit the scope of the invention.
Personalized controller 608 makes the user come the arrangement of each document/page of Search Results is adjusted according to his interest (represented in the preferable personalized as described configuration file).Described personalized controller may be interpreted as the degree of control user's interest profile to the influence or the effect of the arrangement of Search Results.Controller 608 among the embodiment that it is a slide sign type controller that Fig. 6 is illustrated in its middle controller 608, controller 608 comprise a joystick 610 that moves to property dimension along the line between the maximal value 614 in minimum value 610.The controller 608 of this type is very directly perceived usually and be easy to the user and understand its mode of operation.Alternate embodiment comprises equally index dial type controllers that variable adjustment is provided, and some radio buttons that has a relevant predetermined adjustment amount respectively (for example five respectively with 0%, 20%, 40%, 80% and 100% radio button that is associated) between minimum and maximal value.The technician in user-interface design field will understand, and also can adopt the controller of other type to reach essentially identical effect.
In example shown in Figure 6, personalized controller 608 is set to its minimum value 612 always.Therefore, come Search Results is correspondingly arranged according to the correlativity of Search Results and inquiry and with the irrelevant information (for example PageRank) of inquiry, PageRank be disclosed in the name be called " the node aligning method in the linked database (Method for noderanking in a linked database) " the 6th, 285, in No. 999 United States Patent (USP)s, the full text of this patent and whole teaching content thereof are incorporated herein with way of reference.It should be noted that described Search Results is relevant with Stanford University (Stanford University) usually.
Referring now to Fig. 7,, be presented among the figure user slide sign 610 has been adjusted to one behind the centre position that approximately is in mid point between minimum value and the maximal value to the arrangement of Search Results 602.At this moment, each document 604 is rearranged, and those more relevant with user's interest (front be designated " Computers (General)) " have a higher order.In order to make the user distinguish the document more relevant with his interest, those documents are indicated by an individual icon 618 that is close to link text 615.Noticing, under the situation that slide sign 610 mediates, just is a personalization results every a document approximately, although and nonessential like this.Notice that further segment 619 texts have the text relevant with computing machine (for example " hacking (breaking in) "), even this term is not included in the initial search query.
Referring now to Fig. 8,, is presented at the arrangement that the user has been adjusted to slide sign 610 its maximum position 614 back Search Results 602 among the figure.At first, in this example, all documents 604 in the Search Results 602 all reflect user's personalized configuration file and explain with individual icon 618.Secondly, the document in the described Search Results is relevant with computing machine and Stanford university, thereby the reflection user is to the interest of computing machine, because it is relevant with inquiry " Stanford ".For example, preceding two results are relevant with " breaking in " at Stanford; Ensuing three documents are concrete relevant with the various computer science projects of Stanford.Therefore, the 3rd document is the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) at Stanford, the 4th document is the Center for the Study of Language and Information (language and Information Research Center) at Stanford, and the 5th document is the Database Group (database group) at Stanford.All the other documents are same relevant with " Computers " interest of user.Further notice, no longer coming across among the first eight result with linking of homepage Stanford university as first (for example maximally related) is the result when not personalized application (Fig. 6) and when only using medium personalization (Fig. 7) before this.
In Fig. 6-8 example illustrated, the user can dynamically adjust the arrangement of document in real time, and search engine need not to recomputate Search Results.This further helps the user can probe into described Search Results.
Shown in Fig. 6-8, an Edit Profile (editor's configuration file) link 616 can be at any time edited the user to his interest of user profile.Fig. 9 graphic extension user has been back to the subject catalogue page 200 shown in Fig. 2, deleted his existing C omputers theme interest and created " Music (music) " this different interest.Then, the user reselects Start Searching (beginning search) button 208.Search engine provides the last set result through upgrading, described last set result's document through upgrading will with before identical because do not change described query term as yet.Yet, for last search, the user has been positioned controller 610 personalized fully place, and therefore described search engine is used this setting and according to existing (and new) personalized configuration file (this moment is at " Music (music) ") document arranged.This greatest differences that in described Search Results, is produced of Figure 10 graphic extension.Herein, six results at top are all relevant with music and art, and before all are not in the top of described search result list about the result of computing machine.This shows how user's personalized configuration file can change the arrangement to one group of given document significantly.
In one embodiment of this invention, the personalization to Search Results is realized by following method.The technician in Design of Search Engine field can understand the basic structure and the operation thereof of the search engine that wherein can adopt the method easily.
1) when the user selects theme (classification), described theme (classification) is added in the trace file of tabulation of an interest IN who comprises him (wherein IN is the abbreviation of " interests (interest) ").Described interest can be expressed as text token (for example " computers (computing machine) ") or be expressed as adding index in the catalogue, and wherein each theme/subtopic all has a call number.When the described website of user capture, this interest list is retrieved from described trace file by system.Perhaps, described website can provide a user who makes the user register a user name and password therein to register the page, and user's interest is stored in the database at the search engine site place, and logins in response to the user it is retrieved.
2) when the user sends a search inquiry Q, just described tabulation IN is sent to a front-end web servers.
3) then, described front-end web servers is with two request (Q, empty) and (Q IN) issues a rear end search engine, and it is individually R_base (conventional) and R_in (personalized) results set that described rear end search engine returns two to described front-end web servers.
4) described basis inquiry (Q, sky) with in that not apply the search of under any personalized situation Q being carried out on the search engine identical, thereby R_base is the results set that described search engine will return in response to described inquiry usually.As indicated above, according to the correlativity of itself and described inquiry and for example any other factors such as PageRank come correspondingly described Search Results to be arranged, PageRank be disclosed in name be called " the 6th of the node aligning method in the linked database (Method for node ranking in a linked database); 285; in No. 999 United States Patent (USP)s, the full text of this patent and all the teaching content be incorporated herein with way of reference.
5) (Q IN) comprises user's interest list in Ge Xinghua inquiry.Described search engine is followed one and is similar to conventional processing controls flow process of inquiring about, but it is in activation one personalization component between functional period of keeping the score, with " lifting " document relevant with described interest IN set.
In one embodiment of this invention, use the mapping (each mapping of each the theme/subtopic in the described catalogue) of one group of following form to implement these liftings:
Website-๏ผpromote
Thereby for example, the mapping that classification " Health (health) " has following form
Website-๏ผpromote
It comprises following input:
nih.gov-๏ผ5.8
cdc.gov--๏ผ7.9
med.stanford.edu-๏ผ3.5
Nih.gov wherein, cdc.gov and med.Stanford.edu are for determining (with manual or automated manner) each website relevant with theme " Health ".In other words, for each theme in the described catalogue, all exist one group to determine the website relevant, and, all define a lifting values for each website in these websites with described theme.
Usually determine the lifting of website listed in the described subject catalogue by following mode:
A) produce one " site map ", each node of wherein said figure is website (being essentially the page on the same main frame), and according to from a website link to the page on another main frame page quantity come the edge between each node is weighted.Can use the figure of this same type to calculate all themes lifting mappings.
B) for each theme in the described catalogue, for example " Health " selects several its homepages to be shown in website among the OpenDirectory (open catalogue) as " initial " website S0.For example, for a university, as Stanford, initial website may be selected to arbitrary website with the .stanford.edu ending.
C) branch calculates for twice:
I) at first, discern one group by those websites among the S0 the website S1 of a large amount of links, wherein how to be fetched by the institute of the website among S0 chain in large quantities and be its assignment one weight according to each website among the S1.
Ii) then, discern those by those websites among the S1 the website S2 of a large amount of links, and it is weighted as S1.
D) promote website among the S2 with the weight that it was assigned to.
When personalized enquire has interest set ({ Health (health) for example, Music (music) }) time, then described personalization component is consulted mapping separately, and subsequently for the Query Result (being document) that is in these mappings, described personalization component promotes the IR score of these Query Results, so that it will obtain higher ordering.Described IR must be divided into the information retrieval score that described search engine provides for each document, and can with document relevance and for example other factors such as PageRank change.
For example, if http://www.med.stanford.edu/research/ is one of result of inquiry Q and the IN that comprises " Health ", then because of the described page is positioned on the website med.stanford.edu, described result's IR score will obtain one 3.5 times multiplication lifting.For a plurality of interest, the value in each correspondence mappings be multiply by together mutually obtain a combined effect.A kind ofly be used to described catalogue to promote website in the mapping to determine that the further details of the embodiment of described lifting values is set forth in the 10/646th, No. 331 U.S. patent application case, this patent application case is incorporated herein with way of reference.
6) described front-end web servers receives R_base and R_in.The R_base representative is set at 0 (or its minimum position 612) result 602 that the user saw when locating at personalized controller 608.The result 602 that the user was seen when R_in representative was in its maximum position 614 (promptly 10) at described slide sign.In one embodiment, described controller has 11 positions, but also can use any amount of position.Interpolation is carried out in the arrangement between 0 and 10 that is shown to the user; This means, by R_base and R_in, described personalization component is arranged (R_1...R_9) by each independent result is moved to the virtual route of position when controller 608 is in its maximum position from its position when controller 608 is in its minimum position along one in the middle of constructing.
7) how to provide the slide sign effect to the user:
Described front-end web servers is attached to R_base with the result who is not among the R_base among the R_in, to obtain a tabulation about all unique results (in R_base or R_in) that is called R_all.Then, described front-end web servers is that the continuous identifier of assignment as a result among the R_all is to serve as identifier.Then, described front-end web servers sends two items to user's browser:
A) each result's mapping among the R_all identifier-๏ผresult }, it all comprises its identifier in described result for each document; And
B) N vector, its mark user should see the arrangement of (representing with identifier as a result), wherein N is the number of positions of slide sign, and each vector is all represented the sort result according to personalized degree.In this example, will have the position 0 to 10 of 11 vectors corresponding to controller 608.In one embodiment, vector 0 is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], and its reflection has the result's of the local ident that begins with R_0 non-personalized the arrangement to assignment.Vector 10 be the ordering among the R_in as a result of fully personalization; For example, it may be [15,17,5,0,1,2,3,4,8,9,10], the document in the correlation map of document 15 and 17 (for example) subject catalogue that obtains promoting according to the lifting values in the mapping graph and the value that is associated with the position of controller 608 for its IR score wherein.Described N arrangement vector transferred to client just can make described client browser can recomputate described arrangement apace, rather than make server bear described calculating.
8) last, the Javascript code in the described results page makes user's browser use suitable in described 11 positional alignment vectors one to come described Search Results is resequenced in response to the user changes the position of controller 608.The further details of the embodiment of above-mentioned steps 6-8 is set forth in the 10/641st, No. 489 U.
