Definitions
- the invention relates to the field of error indication systems associated with computerized devices, and more particularly to automated detection and identification of audible error codes.
- error codes are often invoked via a BIOS system and typically consist of simple combinations of audible tones of varying duration. For example, one long tone followed by two short tones might indicate a disk adapter error on a particular device, while the same tone sequence from another device might indicate a video vertical retrace error.
- an error code lookup table may be available within documentation provided by the manufacturer in either hard copy form, such as printed manuals, or soft copy form, such as CD-ROM files or Internet web pages.
- One problem relates to the environments in which electronic equipment is typically used. Often, electronic equipment is used in an environment where the ambient noise level makes discernment of audible error codes difficult. For example, ambient noise levels may be affected by human conversations, noise from heating and ventilation systems, mechanical equipment emissions, or similar sources found within the diverse environments where electronic equipment is used.
- audible transmission of error codes does not allow hearing-impaired service technicians and customers to identify error conditions and perform maintenance on malfunctioning machines.
- the number of audible error codes a system can use is also limited, in that current systems typically require human perception, retention, and identification of the particular emitted error codes generated in response to an error condition.
- a method and apparatus capable of identifying specific error conditions through detection and processing of audible error codes.
- Such a method and apparatus preferably would be independent of the hardware and software of the electronic equipment producing the error code. Additionally, the method and apparatus would be capable of detecting and discerning audible codes within noisy environments.
- the solution would implement automated documentation referencing at the time an error code is generated and provide a means for conversion of the detected error code to a discernable message for use by a service technician or customer, regardless of possible hearing impairment.
- the present invention has been developed in response to the present state of the art, and in particular, in response to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved by currently available error code detection and identification means and methods. Accordingly, it is an overall object of the present invention to provide an audible error code detection and identification apparatus and method that overcome many or all of the above-discussed shortcomings in the art.
- an audible error code detection and identification apparatus is provided and is configured to detect audible error codes, such as those generated by electronic equipment, and output an identified error message to an operator.
- the audible error code detection and identification apparatus is provided with a logic unit containing a plurality of modules configured to carry out the individual steps of the detection and identification process.
- These modules in the described embodiments include an input module, a signal detection module, a signal conversion module, a signal comparison module, an output module, and an error message lookup module.
- an audible error code detection and identification apparatus is capable of receiving and processing an audible error code generated by an electronic device.
- the detection and identification apparatus is configured to convert an audible error code to a set of signal detection parameters and to compare the signal detection parameters with values within an error code signature table to provide an error code index.
- the error code index is then used to access an error message lookup table and retrieve message parameters from which an error message is constructed and communicated to the service technician or equipment operator.
- the error code signature table and the error message lookup table are typically stored within a non-volatile memory such as a flashable ROM.
- the detection and identification apparatus may include a communications port for receiving revised or new lookup tables. Additionally, the apparatus may include input selector buttons that are used to navigate through setup menus and device configuration settings, such as language, output mode, receive mode, or other typical setup options pertaining to the use of the apparatus.
- the input selector buttons are also used to scroll through a list of manufacturers and models.
- the chosen make and model of equipment determines the error code signature table containing ideal values with which the signal detection parameters are compared. Once an error code comparison yields a match, a corresponding error code index is used to access an error message lookup table. The retrieved error message is then output to an operator.
- the operator may be a service technician, customer, or other party interested in the electronic device error.
- the error message of the detected and identified error condition is preferably conveyed through a visual and/or an audible means that reports the identified error condition corresponding to the received audible error code.
- the apparatus receives an audible code comprising a tone sequence, converts the audible code to a digital signal, and outputs a visual signal via an LED that mimics the tone sequence in signal on/off states and duration.
- the detection and identification apparatus converts the received audible error code signal to a set of signal detection parameters, compares the signal detection parameters to a set of known error code signatures, references an error message lookup table for a corresponding error message, and outputs the error message to an operator via a LCD, or similar display.
- instructions and information related to the identified error condition and required maintenance are also displayed.
- a method of the present invention is also presented for detecting and identifying an audible error code. The method is initiated with the selection of apparatus settings, including make and model of the electronic test equipment.
- the signal detection module Upon selection of the apparatus settings and receipt of an audible error code, the signal detection module receives and converts the audible error code to a set of signal detection parameters.
- the detection and receipt of the audible error code includes means to filter out unrelated ambient or equipment noise so as to enhance the detection capability of the device.
- the signal detection parameters resulting from the conversion of the audible error code are then compared with values from an error code signature table in order to determine an error code index.
- the error code signature table contains error code signatures that exclusively correspond to the electronic device indicated during selection of the apparatus settings.
- the identified error code index is used to select the appropriate error message from a table of error messages.
- the appropriate error message is output via an output indicator that conveys a representation of the identified error condition to an operator who is capable of using that information.
- the method and apparatus as described above provide for a more practical, independent, and cost effective process through which audible error codes are detected and identified.
- the apparatus has advantages over prior art in that it may be a stand-alone device that does not depend on connection to the hardware or update of the firmware of the electronic device.
- the apparatus offers flexibility within the dynamic market of computers and electronic devices—the memory allows for storage of revised lookup tables for modified or soon-to-be-released equipment.
- the local storage of such tables provides increased convenience, and consequently lower user cost, than present methods of searching for paper or electronic copies of the lookup table documentation.
