Description
- Embodiments relate to cameras in computing devices.
- Computing devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, etc.) can include one more emissive displays. Expanding a display to cover more area of a computing device may be desirable from, at least, a user experience standpoint. However, electro-optical devices positioned on a side of the mobile device that also includes the display (e.g., a front-facing camera) may compete for real estate on the side of the device that includes the display. Thus, in conventional computing devices cameras that share a surface of computing device with a display are generally positioned outside of the light-emitting display portion of the surface, although the cameras may be positioned under a transparent surface element (e.g., a cover window layer) that also is part of the light-emitting display of the computing device. In such a configuration, light can pass through a portion of the transparent surface element to reach the camera, and this portion can appear as, or can be referred to as, a notch, a cutout, a punch hole, etc. in the light-emitting display. However, the existence of the notch, cutout, or punch hole reduces the area of, and causes an irregular shape to, the light-emitting display on the surface of the computing device.
- In a general aspect, a device, a system, a non-transitory computer-readable medium (having stored thereon computer executable program code which can be executed on a computer system), and/or a method can perform a process with a device including a display including a main portion, a first region and a second region, the first region and the second region being in different positions within a boundary of the main portion, the first region having a first structure of light-blocking elements that distort light transmitted through the display, and the second region having a second structure of light-blocking elements that distort light transmitted through the display differently as compared to the first structure, a first light sensor positioned under the first region, the first light sensor being configured to capture a first image having at least one first characteristic, wherein the first characteristic depends on the first structure, a second light sensor positioned under the second region, the second light sensor being configured to capture a second image having at least one second characteristic, wherein the second characteristic depends on the second structure, and a memory including code that when executed by a processor causes the processor to generate a third image based on the first image and the second image.

- Implementations can include one or more of the following features. For example, the at least one first characteristic can include one or more of quality, sharpness, and distortion, and the at least one second characteristic can include one or more of quality, sharpness, and distortion.

These drawings are not, however, to scale and may not precisely reflect the precise structural or performance characteristics of any given embodiment and should not be interpreted as defining or limiting the range of values or properties encompassed by example embodiments. For example, the relative thicknesses and positioning of molecules, layers, regions and/or structural elements may be reduced or exaggerated for clarity. The use of similar or identical reference numbers in the various drawings is intended to indicate the presence of a similar or identical element or feature.
- As descried herein, to eliminate the notch, cutout, or punch hole in a display, while also allowing for the transmission of light to a camera, computing devices can include an emissive display having one or more portion(s) through which light is transmitted to reach a one or more camera sensors located under the emissive display. In such a configuration, the portion of the display through which light is transmitted to the camera sensor(s) functions as a portion of the light-emitting display of the computing device. However, the light-emitting display includes opaque and diffractive elements that distort light as the light is transmitted through the portion(s) of the display above the camera sensor(s). To mitigate the impact of the distortion of light that reaches the camera sensor(s) on images formed by the sensor(s), particular patterns of opaque and diffracting elements can be used in the portion of the display above the camera sensors(s), which patterns may be different than the pattern of opaque and diffracting elements used in other portions of the display. Further, a type of camera sensor can be selected for use under a portion (or region) of the display based on the particular patterns of opaque and diffracting elements. In addition, one or more image correction algorithms can be applied to images formed from data captured by camera sensors located under the light-emitting display, where the image correction and/or image fusion algorithms may be based on the fusion of images generated by different camera sensors, at least two of which are located under the light-emitting display.
- Thus, example implementations, described herein, allow the emissive display of the computing device display to operate over a large area of the surface of the device, without any notches, cutouts, or punch holes in the emissive display, even when a camera is positioned under the display and receives light that is transmitted through the display. The computing device can include a display having two or more cameras located under the display, and light pass can through one or more portions or regions of the display to reach the camera(s), while the display continues to perform the functions of the display. Such example implementations are preferable to conventional displays, because a user experience is improved when the display performs the functions of the display (e.g., displays images) over a large area of the device and allows the use of a camera without disrupting the operation of the display.

FIG. 1A illustrates a first camera configuration on a mobile device. As shown inFIG. 1A , adevice 105 includes abezel 125, adisplay 130, adisplay cutout 135,cameras 140, and aspeaker 145. Thedevice 105 can be a mobile device, a cell phone, a tablet, a laptop, and/or the like. Thebezel 125 can include a portion of a frame configured to fix thedisplay 130 on thedevice 105. The display 130 (e.g., an emissive display) can include a display main portion, and thedisplay cutout 135 can include a portion of the surface of the device that does not include emissive display elements. That is, thedisplay cutout 135 can include a portion of the surface of the device that is not part of thedisplay 130. In other words, thedisplay cutout 135 may not be configured to operate (e.g., show text, images, a background, and/or the like) as thedisplay 130 operates. Thedisplay cutout 135 can be configured to provide a location to place thecameras 140 and thespeaker 145, such that the camera can take a picture of a scene without thedisplay 130 distorting (e.g., blocking, redirecting, and/or the like) light. -
FIG. 1B illustrates a second camera configuration on a mobile device. As shown inFIG. 1B , adevice 110 includes thebezel 125, thedisplay 130, adisplay punch hole 150, and thecamera 140. Thedevice 110 can be a mobile device, a cell phone, a tablet, a laptop, and/or the like. Thebezel 125 can include a portion of a frame configured to fix thedisplay 130 on thedevice 110. Thedisplay 130 can include a display main portion, and thedisplay punch hole 150 can include a portion of thedisplay 130. Thedisplay punch hole 150 can include a portion of thedisplay 130 that does not include emissive elements (e.g., LEDs). In other words, thedisplay punch hole 150 may not be configured to operate (e.g., show text, images, a background, and/or the like) as thedisplay 130 operates. Thedisplay punch hole 150 can be configured to provide a location to place thecamera 140 such that the camera can take a picture of a scene without thedisplay 130 distorting (e.g., blocking, redirecting, and/or the like) light transmitted through the hole. -
FIG. 1C illustrates a third camera configuration on a mobile device. As shown inFIG. 1C , adevice 115 includes thebezel 125, thedisplay 130, adisplay extension 155, and thecamera 140. Thedevice 115 can be a mobile device, a cell phone, a tablet, a laptop, and/or the like. Thebezel 125 can include a portion of a frame configured to fix thedisplay 130 on thedevice 115. Thedisplay extension 155 can be configured to provide a location to place thecamera 140 such that the camera can take a picture of a scene without thedisplay 130 distorting (e.g., blocking, redirecting, and/or the like) light. Thedisplay extension 155 can be configured to extend from thebezel 125 to allow the camera to operate and retract into thedevice 115 when the camera is not in operation. Thedisplay extension 155 can be operably configured to switch between extending from thebezel 125 and retracted into thedevice 115. -
FIG. 1D illustrates a camera configuration on a mobile device according to at least one example embodiment. As shown inFIG. 1D , adevice 120 includes thebezel 125, thedisplay 130, afirst display region 160, afirst camera 165, asecond display region 170, and asecond camera 175. Thedevice 120 can be a mobile device, a cell phone, a tablet, a laptop, and/or the like. Thedisplay 130 can include a display main portion. Thefirst display region 160 can be included in a first portion of thedisplay 130, and thesecond display region 170 can be included in a second portion of thedisplay 130. - In an example implementation, the
first display region 160 can have a structure (e.g., layout pattern or shape of light-emitting devices of the display or of transistors that drive the light-emitting devices) that can allow light to pass through thedisplay 130. Thefirst display region 160 can have a structure that causes light to be distorted (e.g., blocked, diffracted, redirected, etc.) when it is transmitted through thefirst display region 160. Thesecond display region 170 can have a structure (e.g., layout pattern or shape of light-emitting devices of the display or of transistors that drive the light-emitting devices) that can allow light to pass through thedisplay 130. Thesecond display region 170 can have a structure that causes light to be distorted (e.g., blocked, diffracted, redirected, etc.) when it is transmitted through theregion 170. Thefirst display region 160 can cause light to be distorted differently than thesecond display region 170 distorts light. - In an example implementation,
camera 165 andcamera 175 each can be configured as under-display cameras.Camera 165 andcamera 175 can be positioned under thefirst display region 160 and thesecond display region 170, respectively.Camera 165 andcamera 175 can have different light sensitivity. For example,camera 165 can have a lower light sensitivity as compared tocamera 175. - In an example implementation,
camera 165 can include an RGB sensor, and thefirst display region 160 can have a circular LED or transistor layout structure. Furthermore,camera 175 can include a monochrome sensor, and thesecond display region 170 can have a rectangular LED or transistor layout structure. The combination of an RGB sensor and a circular layout structure can generate signals causing an image to have a first characteristic(s) (e.g., quality, sharpness, distortion, and the like) based on light distortion and camera sensitivity. The combination of a monochrome sensor and a rectangular layout structure can generate signals that can generate signals causing an image to have a second characteristic(s) (e.g., quality, sharpness, distortion, and the like) based on light distortion and camera sensitivity. For example, the rectangular layout structure allows more light to pass through and also generates images with better sharpness, and the monochrome sensor is more suitable than the RGB sensor to pick up these characteristics. Overall, the first display-sensor combination and the second display-sensor combination can be designed to pick up first and second characteristics that are complementary to each other. The two images can be fused afterwards so that the resulting image has both complementary characteristics. - The display configuration of
device 120 can allow thedisplay 130 to operate (e.g., show text, images, a background, and/or the like) over the entirety of thedisplay 130. In other words, thefirst display region 160 includes LEDs and/or transistors that drive the LEDs, and thesecond display region 170 includes LEDs and/or transistors that drive the LEDs. The LEDs and/or transistors can be used throughout thedisplay 130 to enable operation (e.g., the emission of light) of thedisplay 130. The display configuration ofdevice 120 is preferable over the display configuration ofdevice 105 and the display configuration ofdevice 110, becausedevice 105 anddevice 110 omit LEDs and/or transistors that drive LEDs from a notch or punch hold in a portion of the display. Therefore, the display configuration ofdevice 105 anddevice 110 do not allow thedisplay 130 to operate (e.g., show text, images, a background, and/or the like) over the display area as large as the display area ofdevice 120. The display configuration ofdevice 120 is preferable over the display configuration ofdevice 115, at least, because there are no moving parts associated with placing a camera in a position to capture an image of a scene indevice 120 and there are moving parts associated with placing a camera in a position indevice 115 in order to capture an image of a scene. -
FIG. 2 illustrates a side, cross-sectional view of an emissive display (e.g., an AMOLED display) suitable for use with the mobile device ofFIGS. 1A-1D . While the principles of the disclosure may be applied to display technologies other than AMOLED displays, the implementation of an AMOLED display will be considered throughout the disclosure. - As shown in
FIG. 2 , the display 200 (e.g., an AMOLED display) includes a plurality of layers that make up adisplay panel 260. The layers include acover glass layer 210 that can form the front surface of the mobile device (e.g., device 120). In a possible implementation, thedisplay 200 can include apolarizer film layer 215. Thedisplay 200 can also include atouch sensor layer 220 that includestouch sensor electrodes 222. Thedisplay 200 can also include apixel circuit layer 225.Pixels 237 for the display are formed from acathode layer 230, anOLED emitter stack 235, and separate elements of ananode layer 236. Elements of theanode layer 236 may be reflective so that light emitted from theOLED emitter stack 235 is directed in a vertical (z) direction from theanode layer 236. - An element of the
anode layer 236 can be coupled to a thin film transistor (TFT)semiconductor structure 240 that includes a source, a gate, and a drain, which can be controlled by electrical signals transmitted over signal lines 242. Thedisplay 200 can further include atransparent barrier layer 245 that includes, for example, SiNx or SiONx and atransparent substrate layer 250 that includes, for example, polyimide (PI) and/or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). An opaque layer/film 270 for mechanical support, heat spreading, and electrical shielding can be located below thedisplay panel 260 to protect the display from localized hot spots due to heat-generating elements in the mobile device, such as, for example, a CPU, a GPU, etc., as well as from electrical signals/electrical noise from electrical components in the device located below thedisplay 200. As discussed in more detail below, transparent openings may be created in the opaque layer/film 270 to allow light to pass throughdisplay 200 to reach a camera sensor located below thedisplay 200. - The layers of the
display 200 may include transparent and non-transparent circuit elements. For example, theTFT structure 240, thepixels 237, thesignal lines 242, and/ortouch sensor electrodes 222 may all block light from propagating through thedisplay 200. Light can be either reflected or absorbed by the non-transparent (i.e., opaque) circuit elements. In an example implementation, theTFT structure 240 associated with thepixels 237 can be varied in portions or regions of thedisplay 200. Varying theTFT structure 240 can include varying a layout of thepixels 237, thesignal lines 242 and/ortouch sensor electrodes 222, a shape of thepixels 237 and/ortouch sensor electrodes 222, a proximity of at least two of thepixels 237, at least two of thesignal lines 242 and/or at least two of thetouch sensor electrodes 222, a space between at least two of the pixels, at least two of thesignal lines 242 and/or at least two of thetouch sensor electrodes 222, and/or the like. Varying theTFT structure 240 can impact (or influence) light transmitted (or traversing) through thedisplay 200. For example, the light can be blocked by the pixels 237 (e.g., thepixels 237 can be opaque) or refracted by the pixels 237 (e.g., a shape of thepixels 237 can influence refraction of light). -
FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of a signal flow for processing an image according to at least one example embodiment. As shown inFIG. 3 , thesignal flow 300 includes aregion 1 310 block, aregion 2 315 block, asensor 1 320 block, asensor 2 325 block, animage processing 330 block, animage processing 335 block, animage fusion 340 block, and animage 345 block. Thesignal flow 300 can be configured to generateimage 345 based on at least a portion ofscene 305. -
Region 1 310 andregion 2 315 can each be included in a portion of a device (e.g., a mobile device, a tablet, a laptop, and/or the like) display (e.g., display 200).Region 1 310 andregion 2 315 can be included in a main display portion of the device display.Region 1 310 andregion 2 315 can have a different structure (e.g., a different TFT structure 240) as compared to each other and the main display portion. - The device can include at least one camera positioned under the display.
Sensor 1 320 andsensor 2 325 each can be configured as an under-display camera.Sensor 1 320 andsensor 2 325 can be positioned underregion 1 310 andregion 2 315, respectively.Sensor 1 320 andsensor 2 325 can have different light sensitivity. For example,sensor 1 320 can have a lower light sensitivity as compared tosensor 2 325. The lower light sensitivity ofsensor 1 320 can be compensated by using a more transmissive display or display portion. Accordingly,region 1 310 can have a structure (e.g., layout pattern) that can allow more light to pass through as compared toregion 2 315 (and/or the main display portion of the device display). - In an example implementation, the
sensor 1 320 and/orsensor 2 325 can include a color sensor, a monochrome (e.g., black and white, grayscale, and/or the like) sensor, an infrared sensor, and/or the like. A color sensor can be configured to detect light in the visible spectrum emitted from a target scene (e.g., scene 305). The color sensor detects one of several primary colors (e.g., red (R), green (G) and blue (B)) at each photosite (e.g., pixel) in an alternating pattern, using a color filter array (CFA). A monochrome sensor can be configured to detect light in the visible spectrum emitted from a target scene (e.g., scene 305). The monochrome sensor can be configured to detect substantially all incoming light at each photosite (e.g., pixel) regardless of color. Therefore, each photosite of the monochrome sensor receives up to 3 times (3X) more light compared to the color sensor. An infrared sensor can be configured to detect infrared radiation emitted from a target scene (e.g., scene 305). For example, the infrared sensor can be configured to detect mid wave infrared wave bands (MWIR), long wave infrared wave bands (LWIR), and/or other thermal imaging bands. - The device can include an image processing pipeline.
Image processing 330 andimage processing 335 can include portions of the image processing pipeline.Image processing 330 and/orimage processing 335 can be configured to generate a color image including three values (e.g., RGB) or one luma and two chrominance (e.g., YUV)) based on the light detected by the sensor (e.g.,sensor 1 320 and/orsensor 2 325 respectively). Alternatively,image processing 330 and/orimage processing 335 can be configured to generate a monochrome (e.g., black and white, grayscale, and/or the like) image based on the light detected by the sensor (e.g.,sensor 1 320 and/orsensor 2 325 respectively). Alternatively,image processing 330 and/orimage processing 335 can be configured to generate an infrared image based on the infrared radiation detected by the sensor (e.g.,sensor 1 320 and/orsensor 2 325 respectively). - The
image fusion 340 block can be configured to generate animage 345 based on the fusion of an image received from theimage processing 330 with an image received fromimage processing 335. Fusing the two images can include using a machine learned (ML) model or algorithm. The ML model can be trained using images captured using sensor and region structure combinations. - In an example implementation,
sensor 1 320 can include an RGB sensor andregion 1 310 can have a circular LED or transistor layout structure. Furthermore,sensor 2 325 can include a monochrome sensor, andregion 2 315 can have a rectangular LED or transistor layout structure. The combination of an RGB sensor and a circular layout structure can generate signals causing an image to have a first characteristic(s) (e.g., quality, sharpness, distortion, and the like). For example, the combination of an RGB sensor and a circular layout structure can generate signals based on detected light that can cause theimage processing 330 block to generate a color (RGB) image that can be distorted (e.g., blurry) with improved flare performance. The combination of a monochrome sensor and a rectangular layout structure can generate signals causing an image to have a second characteristic(s) (e.g., quality, sharpness, distortion, and the like). For example, the combination of a monochrome sensor and a rectangular layout structure can generate signals based on detected light that can cause theimage processing 335 block to generate a monochrome image with improved distortion (e.g., sharpness and signal-to-noise ratio) performance. - The
image fusion 340 block can be configured to generateimage 345 from a distorted color image and a sharp monochrome image using a ML model trained to generate a sharp color (RGB) image based on the two input images. Therefore, the ML model can be trained using distorted color images and sharp monochrome images. -
FIG. 4A is a schematic diagram an implementation of adisplay panel 400 and asensor 402 located under thedisplay panel 400 illustrating light propagating through the display panel to the sensor. Thesensor 402 can be coupled to asensor module 403 containing control electronics for operating the sensor. - The
display panel 400 can include multiple layers. For example, thedisplay panel 400 can include acover glass layer 406, a polarizer layer that can include alinear polarizer 408 a and a quarter-waveplate 408 b and that can reduce the amount of light reflected off of an OLED layer in the panel that exits the front surface of the display, an encapsulation/touch sensor layer 410 containing touch sensor electrodes, acathode layer 412, anOLED layer 414, apixel circuit layer 416 containinganodes 418 for supplying current to the OLEDs andsemiconductor circuit elements 420 for controlling the current provided to the anodes, aPI layer 422, aPET layer 424, and an opaqueback cover layer 426. An opening in the back-cover layer 426 allows light from outside the display panel to pass through the panel and through theopening 428 to reach thesensor 402. - Three
paths display panel 400 are shown inFIG. 4A , with each path showing a possible reflection of light within the panel. Inpath 432, light can traverse the transparent elements of thedisplay panel 400 and be reflected by an opaque structure including a top surface of theanodes 418, such that the light is then directed back into the transparent elements of thedisplay panel 400. In anotherpath 430, light can traverse the transparent elements of thedisplay panel 400 and be detected by thesensor 402. The light inpath 430 can traverse between two of theanodes 418, such that a significant portion of the energy of the light can be detected by thesensor 402. Inpath 434, light can traverse the transparent elements of thedisplay panel 400, get refracted by an opaque structure including a side surface of theanodes 418 and be detected by thesensor 402. The refraction of the light inpath 434 can depend on a shape of theanodes 418. For example, a shape including a flat surface (e.g., a rectangle, a triangle, and/or the like), can refract the light differently than a curved surface (e.g., a circle). -

The portion of the emissive display can be a portion of thepixel circuit layer 416 that includes emissive areas 452-1 that include multiple light-emitting sub-pixels 442-1, 444-1, 446-1 and electricallyconductive signal lines 454 providing electrical signals to pixel circuits that drive the sub-pixels. InFIG. 4B , pixels in the display can include a plurality of light emitting elements (e.g., light emitting diodes) that emit different colors, so that all visible colors can be produced by a pixel by mixing amount of light from the different elements. For example, in some implementations, a pixel can include a red LED 442-1, a blue LED 444-1 and two green LEDs 446-1. InFIG. 4B , the sub-pixels 442-1, 444-1, 446-1 in thepixel circuit layer 416 can have the shape of a square. Each square can have different dimensions. - A portion(s) 461 of the display depicted in
FIG. 4B can include an arrangement of open space configured to allow light to pass through the display. The open space can have a transmissivity, where transmissivity is a percent (%) of light that makes it though the open space. For example, the portion(s) 461 may allow light to pass through the display, because there are no opaque (or non-transparent) elements, such assignal lines 454, emissive areas 452-1 (including pixels 442-1, 444-1, 446-1), and transistors placed in the portion (e.g., portion(s) 461) of the display. The light passing through the display may interact with (e.g., the traversal (or path taken) and/or transmissivity of the light may be impacted by) some pixels and somesignal lines 462 running in a vertical (y) direction orsignal lines 463 running in a horizontal (x) direction, which can affect the propagation of light through the display. -
FIG. 4C depicts a top view of a portion of an emissive display. The portion of the emissive display can be a portion of thepixel circuit layer 416 that includes emissive areas 452-2 that include multiple light-emitting sub-pixels 442-2, 444-2, 446-2 and electricallyconductive signal lines 454 providing electrical signals to pixel circuits that drive the sub-pixels. InFIG. 4C , pixels in the display can include a plurality of light emitting elements (e.g., light emitting diodes) that emit different colors, so that all visible colors can be produced by a pixel by mixing amount of light from the different elements. For example, in some implementations, a pixel can include a red LED 442-2, a blue LED 444-2 and two green LEDs 446-2. InFIG. 4C , the sub-pixels 442-2, 444-2, 446-2 in thepixel circuit layer 416 can have the shape of a circle. Each circle can have a different diameter. -
FIG. 4D depicts a top view of a portion of an emissive display. The portion of the emissive display can be a portion of thepixel circuit layer 416 that includes emissive areas 452-3 that include multiple light-emitting sub-pixels 442-3, 444-3, 446-3 and electricallyconductive signal lines 454 providing electrical signals to pixel circuits that drive the sub-pixels. InFIG. 4D , pixels in the display can include a plurality of light emitting elements (e.g., light emitting diodes) that emit different colors, so that all visible colors can be produced by a pixel by mixing amount of light from the different elements. For example, in some implementations, a pixel can include a red LED 442-3, a blue LED 444-3 and two green LEDs 446-3. InFIG. 4D , the sub-pixels 442-3, 444-3, 446-3 in thepixel circuit layer 416 can have the shape of a rectangle. Each rectangle can have different dimensions. -
FIG. 4E depicts a top view of a portion of an emissive display. The portion of the emissive display can be a portion of thepixel circuit layer 416 that includes emissive areas 452-4 that include multiple light-emitting sub-pixels 442-4, 444-4, 446-4 and electricallyconductive signal lines 454 providing electrical signals to pixel circuits that drive the sub-pixels. InFIG. 4E , pixels in the display can include a plurality of light emitting elements (e.g., light emitting diodes) that emit different colors, so that all visible colors can be produced by a pixel by mixing amount of light from the different elements. For example, in some implementations, a pixel can include a red LED 442-4, a blue LED 444-4 and two green LEDs 446-4. InFIG. 4E , the sub-pixels 442-4, 444-4, 446-4 in thepixel circuit layer 416 can have the shape of a triangle. Each triangle can have different dimensions. - In the layout of
FIGS. 4B-4E , the density of emissive areas 452 are sparsely illustrated. However, thepixel circuit layer 416 can include a denser layout of emissive areas 452. Thepixel circuit layer 416 of the display panel can include a consistent layout of the emissive areas 452 throughout the pixel circuit layer 416 (e.g., in a main portion of the display). In example implements, thepixel circuit layer 416 includes more than one portion, region, area and the like, each having a different emissive areas 452 layout (e.g., a different TFT structure). For example, thepixel circuit layer 416 can include a main portion that includes a significant portion (e.g., almost all) of thepixel circuit layer 416. The main portion of thepixel circuit layer 416 can include an emissive areas 452 layout. The main portion of thepixel circuit layer 416 can include a first region and a second region within the boundaries of the main portion of thepixel circuit layer 416. The first region can include a first emissive areas 452 layout (e.g., TFT structure) and the second region can have a second emissive areas 452 layout (e.g., TFT structure). For example, the first region can have the emissive areas 452 layout illustrated inFIG. 4B and the second region can have the emissive areas 452 layout illustrated inFIG. 4C . - In an example implementation, a first type of sensor (e.g., sensor 402) can be positioned under the first region and a second type of sensor (e.g., sensor 402) can be positioned under the second region. For example, a monochrome sensor can be positioned under the first region and a color sensor can be positioned under the second region.
- The emissive areas 452 layout(s) illustrated in
FIGS. 4B-4E illustrate a same positioning (e.g., layout) of the sub-pixels 442, 444, 446. However, example implementations are not limited thereto.FIGS. 4F-4K illustrate possible sub-pixel layouts. The illustrated layouts are just a few examples for the sake of brevity. - As illustrated in
FIG. 4F , the emissive area 452-5 can include a red LED 442-5, a blue LED 444-5 and two green LEDs 446-5 clustered together within the emissive area 452-5 and having the same shape (e.g., circle). As illustrated inFIG. 4G , the emissive area 452-6 can include a red LED 442-6, a blue LED 444-6 and a green LED 446-6 linearly spread out within the emissive area 452-6 and having the same shape (e.g., rectangle). As illustrated inFIG. 4H , the emissive area 452-7 can include a red LED 442-7, a blue LED 444-7 and a green LED 446-7 linearly clustered together within the emissive area 452-5 and having the same shape (e.g., circle). - As illustrated in
FIG. 4I , the emissive area 452-8 can include a red LED 442-8, a blue LED 444-8 and a green LED 446-8 clustered together and rotated within the emissive area 452-8 and having the same shape (e.g., triangle). As illustrated inFIG. 4J , the emissive area 452-9 can include three red LEDs 442-9 linearly clustered together within the emissive area 452-9 and having the same shape (e.g., rectangle). As illustrated inFIG. 4K , the emissive area 452-10 can include a red LED 442-10, a blue LED 444-10 and two green LEDs 446-10 clustered together within the emissive area 452-10 and having a different shape (e.g., circle and rectangle). -
FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate images generated from light transmitted through different display regions that have different shapes or layout patterns of opaque and/or diffracting structures with the same sensor configuration (or combination) according to at least one example embodiment.FIG. 5A illustrates an image captured by a camera (e.g., a monochrome or color camera) under a first region having a first layer structure or layout that influences the light that passes through the first region to the camera.FIG. 5B illustrates an image captured by a camera under a second region having a second layer structure or layout that influences the light that passes through the second region to the camera. The image inFIG. 5A has a first characteristic(s) (e.g., quality, sharpness, distortion, and the like) based on light distortion and the image inFIG. 5B has a second characteristic(s) (e.g., quality, sharpness, distortion, and the like) based on light distortion. - The light distortion associated the first layer structure or layout of the first region is different than the light distortion associated with the second layer structure or layout of the second region. Therefore, the first characteristics of the image in
FIG. 5A can be different than the second characteristics of the image inFIG. 5B . For example, the image ofFIG. 5A can have more defined features (e.g., be less blurry) of the elements (e.g., the sun, trees, and/or the like) in the image as compared to the image ofFIG. 5B .FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate that images captured with the same sensor when light is transmitted though different display layers to the sensor can have different characteristics. Some characteristics can be desirable (e.g., color representation of the scene or minimized blur) using a layer structure or layout and sensor type configuration. However, one of the images ofFIG. 5A or 5B could have other desirable characteristics as compared to the images shown had an image been captured using a different sensor. -
FIG. 6A illustrates a block diagram of a portion of an apparatus including an image processing system according to at least one example embodiment. As shown inFIG. 6A , theapparatus 600 includes at least oneprocessor 605, at least onememory 610, and acontroller 620. The at least one memory includes animage fusion 625 module. The at least oneprocessor 605, the at least onememory 610, and thecontroller 620 are communicatively coupled viabus 615. - In the example of
FIG. 6A , theapparatus 600 may include at least one computing device and should be understood to represent virtually any computing device configured to perform the techniques described herein. As such, theapparatus 600 may be understood to include various components that may be utilized to implement the techniques described herein, or different or future versions thereof. For example, theapparatus 600 is illustrated as including at least oneprocessor 605, as well as at least one memory 610 (e.g., a computer readable storage medium). - Therefore, the at least one
processor 605 may be utilized to execute instructions stored on the at least onememory 610. As such, the at least oneprocessor 605 can implement the various features and functions described herein, or additional or alternative features and functions. The at least oneprocessor 605 and the at least onememory 610 may be utilized for various other purposes. For example, the at least onememory 610 may be understood to represent an example of various types of memory and related hardware and software which can be used to implement any one of the modules described herein. According to example implementations, theapparatus 600 may be included in larger system (e.g., a server, a personal computer, a laptop computer, a mobile device and/or the like). - The at least one
memory 610 may be configured to store data and/or information associated with theimage fusion 625 module and/or theapparatus 600. The at least onememory 610 may be a shared resource. For example, theapparatus 600 may be an element of a larger system (e.g., a server, a personal computer, a mobile device, and the like). Therefore, the at least onememory 610 may be configured to store data and/or information associated with other elements (e.g., web browsing or wireless communication) within the larger system (e.g., an audio encoder with quantization parameter revision). - The
controller 620 may be configured to generate various control signals and communicate the control signals to various blocks in theapparatus 600. Thecontroller 620 may be configured to generate the control signals in order to implement searching using object recognition based on an image technique or other techniques described herein. - The at least one
processor 605 may be configured to execute computer instructions associated with theimage fusion 625 module, and/or thecontroller 620. The at least oneprocessor 605 may be a shared resource. For example, theapparatus 600 may be an element of a larger system (e.g., a server, a personal computer, a mobile device, and the like). Therefore, the at least oneprocessor 605 may be configured to execute computer instructions associated with other elements (e.g., serving web pages, web browsing or wireless communication) within the larger system. -
FIG. 6B illustrates a block diagram of a module of the image processing system according to at least one example embodiment. As shown inFIG. 6B , theimage fusion 625 module includes animage 630, animage 635, a machine learned (ML)model 640, and a fusedimage 645. Theimage 630 can include an image captured using a first sensor under a first region or display region as described above. Theimage 635 can include an image captured using a second sensor under a second region or display region as described above. - The
ML model 640 can be executed (as programing code) by the at least oneprocessor 605 withimage 630 andimage 635 used as input. TheML model 640 can be used to generate a fusedimage 645 based onimage 630 andimage 635. Generating fusedimage 645 based onimage 630 andimage 635 can include fusingimage 630 andimage 635 together. - The
ML model 640 can be trained to keep preferred characteristics associated withimage 630 andimage 635 and to remove undesirable characteristics associated withimage 630 andimage 635. Therefore, fusingimage 630 andimage 635 together can include the desirable characteristics associated withimage 630 andimage 635 and not the undesirable characteristics associated withimage 630 andimage 635. TheML model 640 can include a convolutional neural network (CNN) as described in more detail below. -
FIG. 7A illustrates layers in a convolutional neural network (CNN) with no sparsity constraints.FIG. 7B illustrates layers in a convolutional neural network (CNN) with sparsity constraints. With reference toFIGS. 7A and 7B , various configurations of neural networks for use in at least one example implementation will be described. An example layered neural network is shown inFIG. 7A . The layered neural network includes threelayers layer neurons 705. In this implementation, no sparsity constraints have been applied. Therefore, allneurons 705 in eachlayer neurons 705 in any neighboringlayers - The example neural network shown in
FIG. 7A is not computationally complex due to the small number ofneurons 705 and layers. However, the arrangement of the neural network shown inFIG. 7A may not scale up to larger sizes of networks due to the density of connections (e.g., the connections between neurons/layers). In other words, the computational complexity can be too great as the size of the network scales and scales in a non-linear fashion. Therefore, it can be too computationally complex for allneurons 705 in eachlayer neurons 705 in the one or moreneighboring layers - An initial sparsity condition can be used to lower the computational complexity of the neural network. For example, if a neural network is functioning as an optimization process, the neural network approach can work with high dimensional data by limiting the number of connection between neurons and/or layers. An example of a neural network with sparsity constraints is shown in
FIG. 7B . The neural network shown inFIG. 7B is arranged so that eachneuron 705 is connected only to a small number ofneurons 705 in the neighboringlayers - In some implementations, neural networks that are fully connected or not fully connected but in different specific configurations to that described in relation to
FIG. 7B can be used. Further, in some implementations, convolutional neural networks that are not fully connected and have less complexity than fully connected neural networks can be used. Convolutional neural networks can also make use of pooling or max-pooling to reduce the dimensionality (and hence complexity) of the data that flows through the neural network. Other approaches to reduce the computational complexity of convolutional neural networks can be used. -
FIG. 8 illustrates a block diagram of a model according to an example embodiment. AML model 800 can be configured to implement pixel-level image fusion. TheML model 800 can include, for example, a regression-type, a classification-type convolutional neural network (CNN). Pixel-level image fusion can generate a composite image from at least two images (e.g.,image 630 and image 635) having complementary characteristics and information corresponding to the same scene (e.g., scene 305). - A convolution layer or convolution can be configured to extract features from an image. Features can be based on color, frequency domain, edge detectors, and/or the like. A convolution can have a filter (sometimes called a kernel) and a stride. For example, a filter can be a 1×1 filter (or 1×1×n for a transformation to n output channels, a 1×1 filter is sometimes called a pointwise convolution) with a stride of 1 which results in an output of a cell generated based on a combination (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or the like) of the features of the cells of each channel at a position of the M×M grid. In other words, a feature map having more than one depth or channels is combined into a feature map having a single depth or channel. A filter can be a 3×3 filter with a stride of 1 which results in an output with fewer cells each channel of the M×M grid or feature map.
- The output can have the same depth or number of channels (e.g., a 3×3×n filter, where n=depth or number of channels, sometimes called a depthwise filter) or a reduced depth or number of channels (e.g., a 3×3×k filter, where k<depth or number of channels). Each channel, depth or feature map can have an associated filter. Each associated filter can be configured to emphasize different aspects of a channel. In other words, different features can be extracted from each channel based on the filter (this is sometimes called a depthwise separable filter). Other filters are within the scope of this disclosure.
- Another type of convolution can include a combination of two or more convolutions. For example, a convolution can include a depthwise and pointwise separable convolution. This can include, for example, a convolution in two steps. The first step can include a depthwise convolution (e.g., a 3×3 convolution). The second step can include a pointwise convolution (e.g., a 1×1 convolution). The depthwise and pointwise convolution can include a separable convolution in that a different filter (e.g., filters to extract different features) can be used for each channel or ay each depth of a feature map. In an example implementation, the pointwise convolution can transform the feature map to include c channels based on the filter. For example, an 8×8×3 feature map (or image) can be transformed to an 8×8×256 feature map (or image) based on the filter. In some implementation more than one filter can be used to transform the feature map (or image) to an M×M×c feature map (or image).
- A convolution can be linear. A linear convolution describes the output, in terms of the input, as being linear time-invariant (LTI). Convolutions can also include a rectified linear unit (ReLU). A ReLU is an activation function that rectifies the LTI output of a convolution and limits the rectified output to a maximum. A ReLU can be used to accelerate convergence (e.g., more efficient computation).
- In an example implementation, the first type of convolution can include a 1×1 convolution and the second type of convolution can include a depthwise and pointwise separable convolution. Each of the plurality of
convolution layers layer 830 can be used to transform theimage layer 830 can transform theimage - In an example implementation, the
ML model 800 CNN (e.g., regression-type CNN) can include a plurality ofconvolutional layers convolutional layers FIG. 8 , theconvolutional layer 805 can include a first convolution type, theconvolutional layer 810 can include a second convolution type, theconvolutional layers convolutional layer 835 can include the third convolution type, theconvolutional layer 840 can include a fourth convolution type, theconvolutional layers convolutional layers convolutional layer 870 can include a seventh convolution type. - Each convolutional layer can generate many alternate convolutions, so the weight matrix is a tensor of x*y*n, where x*y the size of a sliding window (typically x=y) and n is the number of convolutions. The
image 630 and theimage 635 can be input to the CNN. In the first convolution type, theimage 630 and theimage 635 that can transform the images using a 224*224*3 weight matrix. Theconvolutional layer 810 can transform the resultant feature map using a 224*224*64 weight matrix, theconvolutional layer 815 can transform the resultant feature map using a 112*112*128 weight matrix, the convolutional layer 820 can transform the resultant feature map using a 56*56*256 weight matrix, theconvolutional layer 825 can transform the resultant feature map using a 28*28*512 weight matrix, theconvolutional layer 830 can transform the resultant feature map using a 14*14*512 weight matrix, and theconvolutional layer 835 can transform the resultant feature map using a 7*7*4096 weight matrix. - The next part of the
ML model 800 can be configured to transform the feature map out fromconvolution layer 835 to an image with a size that is equivalent to the input image (e.g.,image 630 or image 635).Convolution layer 840 receives a feature map fromconvolution layer 835 and transforms the feature map using a 7*7*4096 weight matrix. Theconvolutional layer 845 can transform the resultant feature map using a 7*7*classes weight matrix (where classes is a number of in the feature map), theconvolutional layer 850 can transform the resultant feature map using a 14*14*classes weight matrix, theconvolutional layer 855 can transform the resultant feature map together with the feature map output from convolution layer 825 (convolution layer 875) using a 14*14*classes weight matrix, theconvolutional layer 860 can transform the resultant feature map using a 28*28*classes weight matrix, theconvolutional layer 865 can transform the resultant feature map together with the feature map output from convolution layer 820 (convolution layer 880) using a 28*28*classes weight matrix, theconvolutional layer 870 can transform the resultant feature map using a 224*224*classes weight matrix, the resultant feature map can include the output image (e.g., fused image 645). - Once a model (e.g., ML model 800) architecture has been designed (and/or in operation), the model should be trained (sometimes referred to as developing the model). The model can be trained using a plurality of images (e.g., scenes, products, portions of products, environmental objects (e.g., plants), portraits, and/or the like).
- In an example implementation, a first sensor (e.g., an RGB sensor) and a first region of a device display can have first structure (e.g., a circular LED or transistor layout), and a second sensor (e.g., a monochrome sensor) and second region of the device display can have a second structure (e.g., a rectangular LED or transistor layout). The combination of the first sensor and the first region having the first structure can distort light transmitted through the first region and reaching the first sensor, such that an image generated from the light detected by the first sensor has first characteristic(s) (e.g., quality, sharpness, distortion, and the like). The combination of the second sensor and the second region having the second structure can distort light transmitted through the second region and reaching the second sensor, such that an image generated from the light detected by the second sensor has second characteristic(s) (e.g., quality, sharpness, distortion, and the like). The two resultant images can be combined (e.g., fused) together to generate a third image. The third image can be stored in a memory and/or displayed on the device display.
- Image fusion using machine learning (ML) models can include two phases. In a first phase fusion, algorithms can be trained using supervised learning. In a second phase, the fusion algorithm can be deployed. As discussed above, example implementations can use a convolutional neural network (CNN) based fusion algorithm. In the first phase, the neural network can be trained. For example, two images can be input with first and second characteristics to the network. The output of the network can be compared with a ground truth image that has the most desirable characteristics we want the network to reproduce. An evaluation metric can be used to quantify the difference between the output and the ground truth images. This difference is used to update parameters of the network, which represents the training process. This process is repeated iteratively using a plurality of image examples until the difference between the output and the ground truth image is within a desirable margin and that concludes the training process.
- As discussed above, a first camera can be a color camera generating a color image and a second camera can be a monochrome (or IR) camera generating a monochrome image. In example implementations, the CNN algorithm can result in selecting features from the color image and features from the monochrome image. For example, features associated with color can be selected from the color image and features associated with sharpness can be selected from the monochrome image. A region of the image that is not blurred by flares can be selected from the color image. These features can be selected based on what ground truth image we have shown to the network during the training process. Once the network is trained, it can be deployed in phase two to fuse any input images to output an image with desirable characteristics of the two input images.
- This device display configuration can allow the device display to operate (e.g., show text, images, a background, and/or the like) over the entirety of the device display. In other words, the first region can include LEDs and/or transistors having a first structure or layout and the second region can include LEDs and/or transistors having a second structure or layout. The LEDs and/or transistors can be used throughout the device display to enable operation (e.g., the projection of light) of the display while also being configured to sense light used to generate an image. The display configuration of this device is preferable over a display configuration of device that removes (e.g., remove LEDs and/or transistors) a portion of the display to allow light to pass through to a sensor and over a device that includes a camera with moving parts used to position the camera to capture an image.

FIG. 9 illustrates a block diagram of a method for performing image fusion according to at least one example implementation. The steps described with regard toFIG. 9 may be performed due to the execution of software code stored in a memory (e.g., at least one memory 610) associated with an apparatus (e.g., as shown inFIG. 5A ) and executed by at least one processor (e.g., at least one processor 605) associated with the apparatus. However, alternative embodiments are contemplated, such as a system embodied as a special purpose processor. Although the steps described below are described as being executed by a processor, the steps are not necessarily executed by the same processor. In other words, at least one processor may execute the steps described below with regard toFIG. 9 . - As shown in
FIG. 9 , in step S905 a first image is received. For example, the first image can be received from an image processing pipeline associated with a device (e.g., a mobile device). The image pipeline can be configured to generate the first image based on a first signal received from first a camera and/or sensor. The first signal can represent light emitted from a scene. The first image can be received after the image pipeline has performed all image processing functions. Alternatively, the first image can be received after the image pipeline has performed a portion of the image processing functions (e.g., before image error correction). The first signal can be generated based on light that passes through a first region of a display of the device. - In step S910 a second image is received. For example, the second image can be received from an image processing pipeline associated with the device. The image pipeline can be configured to generate the second image based on a second signal received from a second camera and/or sensor. The second signal can represent light emitted from the scene. The second image can be received after the image pipeline has performed all image processing functions. Alternatively, the second image can be received after the image pipeline has performed a portion of the image processing functions (e.g., before image error correction). The second signal can be generated based on light that passes through a second region of the display of the device. The second region of the display of the device having a structure that is different than a structure of the first region of the display of the device.
- In step S915 a third image is generated based on the first image, the second image and the image fusing operation. For example, the first image and the second image can be fused to generate the third image. Fusing can include using a ML model having the first image and the second image as input.

The program storage medium may be magnetic (e.g., a floppy disk or a hard drive) or optical (e.g., a compact disk read only memory, or CD ROM), and may be read only or random access. Similarly, the transmission medium may be twisted wire pairs, coaxial cable, optical fiber, or some other suitable transmission medium known to the art. The example embodiments not limited by these aspects of any given implementation.
