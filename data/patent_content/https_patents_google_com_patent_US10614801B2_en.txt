- Systems and methods of the present disclosure relate generally to a data processing system that optimizes or dynamically content items for transmission to client computing devices.
- the data processing system can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data packet transmission over one or more computer networks by, for example, dynamically selecting content items from a plurality of content items for transmission to a client computing device.
- the systems and methods described herein can include a data processing system that receives an input audio query. From the input audio query the data processing system can identify a request and a trigger keyword corresponding to the request. Based on the trigger keyword or the request, the data processing system can determine a thread that indicates a plurality of sequence dependent operations. For example, the thread can indicate a first action, a second action that is subsequent to the first action, and a third action that is subsequent to the second action.
- the actions can be completed over a period of time.
- the content items that are transmitted to the client computing device in response to each of the actions take a predetermined amount of time to present via the client computing device.
- the content item can be a content item describing the weather that takes 30 seconds to play form beginning to end.
- the content items that are transmitted to the client computing device in response to the actions can have predicted exposure intervals.
- the exposure interval can a period of time that a content segment is predicted to be exposed to a user in response to actions.
- the content items can be inserted into the content segment.
- the system can reduce network bandwidth utilization by selecting content items that substantially match the predicted exposure interval of the content segments. Matching the content item length to the predicted exposure length can reduce network bandwidth utilization by not transmitting content items to the client computing device with a low probability of presentation.
- Systems and methods of the present disclosure relate generally to a data processing system that optimizes or dynamically adjusts an order of processing sequence dependent operations via data packet based transmissions in a voice activated computer network environment.
- the data processing system can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data packet transmission over one or more computer networks by, for example, asynchronously, out-of-sequence, or dynamically selecting operations from a plurality of sequence dependent operations.
- Data packets or other protocol based signals corresponding to the selected operations can be routed through a computer network between multiple computing devices.
- the data processing system can temporarily or permanently skip initial operations of a set of sequence dependent operations and can instead proceed to an operation that corresponds to a later-in-time or final operation.
- the data processing system can reduce, delay, or eliminate data processing associated with the early stage operations. This saves processing power and other computing resources such as memory, reduces electrical power consumption by the data processing system and the reduced data transmissions via the computer network reduces bandwidth requirements and usage of the data processing system.
- the systems and methods described herein can include a data processing system that receives an input audio query. From the input audio query the data processing system can identify a request and a trigger keyword corresponding to the request. Based on the trigger keyword or the request, the data processing system can determine a thread that indicates a plurality of sequence dependent operations. For example, the thread can indicate a first action, a second action that is subsequent to the first action, and a third action that is subsequent to the second action.
- the third action which in this example is the last action in a thread of sequence dependent operations, can be used by the data processing system to select a content item prior to occurrence of the first action and prior to occurrence of the second action. This can be done before or without performing at least some of the data processing operations based on the first action or the second action. Bypassing these processing operations causes the content item for the third action to be selected with less data processing and less electrical power usage than would be the case without the bypass.
- the content item can include an output signal.
- the data processing system can provide the content item including the output signal by packet or other protocol based data message transmission via a computer network to a client computing device.
- the output signal can cause an audio driver component of the client computing device to generate an acoustic wave, e.g., an audio output, which can be output from the client computing device.
- the audio output corresponds to the third (e.g., last or latest in time) action and can by output from the client computing device prior to occurrence of the first action or prior to occurrence of the second action.
- the bypassing of the first and second actions (or the bypassing of selecting and providing content items corresponding to these actions) to first select and send the content item corresponding to the third action prior to occurrence of the first and second sequence dependent actions results in fewer data processing operations, less memory usage, and less network bandwidth utilization than would be the case without the bypass.
- content items (also referred to as content items in some embodiments) associated with various bid types can be deployed across content segments (such as webpages or portions thereof) in a manner that improves or optimizes the revenue such content items (and their associated bids) generate for the content publishers on whose webpages the content items are presented.
- bid types are bids which are monetized as a function of the time (e.g., per second, per minute, etc.) that the associated content items are exposed to/viewable by website viewers/users.
- Determinations of the content item (or content items) to deploy within a particular content segment or segments can be computed with reference to the associated bid type(s) and an exposure interval of the content segment (reflecting the amount of time the content segment is expected to be exposed to/viewable by a user).
- the exposure interval can be further computed or refined with respect to a particular group or demographic. In processing an exposure interval with the bids associated with various content items, a determination of which content item is expected to generate a greatest amount of revenue within a particular content segment can be identified.

- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for content items to the content item management system 104 .
- the request can include a number of content items desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the content items, and/or a variety of other factors. In some implementations, the number of desired content items will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for content items can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information can include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the content item management system 104 includes an auction process to select content items from the service provider device 285 .
- the service provider device 285 can be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the service providers are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click of) a content item, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an service provider pays when, for example, a user clicks on a content item.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the service provider is willing to pay for each click of a content item based on a keyword, e.g., a word or words in a query.
- Other bid types can also be used. Based on these bids, content items can be selected and ranked for presentation.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the content items provided by the content item management system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the users 108 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the content items, so as not to confuse the user between paid content items and presumably neutral search results.
- one or more content provider device 284 can submit requests for content items to the content item management system 104 .
- the content item management system 104 responds by sending content items to the requesting content provider device 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property. For example, if a content provider device 284 publishes a sports-related web site, the content item management system can provide sports-related content items to the content provider device 284 .
- the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with the user 108 , e.g., by the execution of a particular script when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- a content item push model is used to provide content items from service provider device 285 .
- content items can be pushed to idle screens (e.g., of a mobile devices or particular applications) based on particular criteria (e.g., the user's location).

- the mobile application can also include content items positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar to content provider device 284 , the content items can be received from the content item management system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of an example system 200 for improved content item deployment.
- a service provider device 285 A- 285 N (referred to collectively as service provider device 285 ) can submit one or more content items 210 A- 210 N (also known as “creatives”) (referred to collectively as content items 210 ) to a content item system 204 , and such content items 210 are stored in a content item repository 202 .
- Each content item can include one or more words, phrases, web links, and/or any other such element and/or component (e.g., images, video, audio, etc.) that are provided to one or more users 108 (e.g., banner content items, text-only content items, image content items, audio content items, video content items, etc.).
- one or more keywords are associated with one or more creatives in order to enable the identification and selection of pertinent content items for display to a user based on one or more search queries received from the user.
- content items 210 are described herein as referring to individual content items, in certain implementations content items 210 can refer to groups of content items, such as content item groups, campaigns, and/or categories.
- Content item system 204 can also include a content item presentation manager 260 .
- the content item presentation manager 260 can identify content items in the content item repository 202 to present to a user 108 , for example based on various criteria such as keywords in a search query, web page content, context, location, content item financials (e.g., cost per impression).
- content item presentation manager 260 can identify one or more content items 210 associated with one or more keywords that are similar and/or identical to the search query provided by the user, and such creatives can be provided to the user in any number of content item formats.
- the content item system 204 can interact with a search system, for example presenting content items alongside search results.
- the content item system 204 can interact with content publishers, for example, providing content items to publishers or users for presentation along with web content, e-mail, or other content.
- Content item system 204 can also include one or more content item logs 212 .
- Content item log 212 can track and store one or more performance metrics that reflect the performance or success of a particular content item. For example, for a given content item, content item log 212 can track the ‘click through rate,’ reflecting the percentage of users presented with a creative that click on or otherwise select the presented content, though it should be understood that any number of other performance metrics can be similarly tracked (e.g., conversion rate), as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
- content item system 204 can include a content item deployment improvement engine 206 .
- the content item deployment improvement engine 206 can process a content segment such as a webpage, in order to determine one or more content items to be deployed within the content segment. It should be understood that content item deployment improvement engine 206 can process any number of elements and/or components of various content items, content segments, publishers, service providers, users, and/or bid types, in order to compute and/or generate such determinations. It should also be understood that in some implementations, the content item deployment improvement engine 206 can include one or more processors configured by code to implement the functionality of the content item deployment improvement engine that is being described.
- Content item system 204 can also include one or more bid types 230 .
- a particular bid type can reflect one or more ways or methods in which an service provider device 285 can elect to provide to an content auction, and subsequently to pay for the serving of a particular content item 210 by content item system 204 .
- Examples of such bid types 230 include: cost per impression (referred to herein as “CPM”) bid 232 , whereby an service provider bids a specified amount for an instance of display/serving of a content item to a user 108 (irrespective of the length of time that the content item is viewable and/or any subsequent interaction with the content item), cost per click (referred to herein as “CPC”) bid 234 , whereby an service provider bids a specified amount for an instance of user interaction with the content item, such as a click by the user on the content item, and/or cost per time unit (referred to herein as “CPT”) bid 236 , whereby an service provider bids a specified amount per time unit (such as seconds, minutes, etc.) that a content item is displayed to and/or viewable by a user.
- CPC cost per click
- CPT cost per time unit
- bid types 232 - 236 are merely exemplary, and that other content item bid types can be similarly employed, such as bids based on conversion rates, as are known to those or ordinary skill in the art.
- bid types 230 can be associated with one or more content items 210 .
- content item 210 A can be associated with a particular CPM bid 232 (e.g., a bid to pay up to $0.02 per impression) while content item 210 N can be associated with a particular CPT bid 236 (e.g., a bid to pay up to $0.005 per second).
- bids such as CPM bids and CPC bids can be characterized as being non-CPT bids, on account of the fact that their respective bids are not implemented as a function of time.
- Content item system 204 can also include one or more service provider accounts 240 .
- Each individual service provider account (not shown) corresponds to content funds associated with a particular service provider device 285 . Funds are deducted from such accounts upon the successful serving of one or more content items on behalf of a particular service provider, such as in the manner described in detail herein.
- one or more content provider device 284 can be in communication with content item system 204 through network 110 .
- content provider device 284 can maintain content exposure data 250 with respect to the content (e.g., one or more websites, webpages, blogs, media files, etc.) provided by the publisher, thought it should be understood that in other implementations such content exposure data 250 can be similarly maintained by another entity, such as content item system 204 .
- Examples of content exposure data 250 include one or more metrics that reflect the time and/or degree that users 108 engage with the content provided by content provider device 284 , such as particular areas, regions, and/or pages of a particular website.

- the third action includes returning home from the theater.
- the second action in the sequence watches the movie
- the first action is subsequent to and dependent on the first action (going out to dinner)
- the third action returning home
- the third action can be considered subsequent to and dependent on the second action, as having expressed an intent to do so, the data processing system 266 predicts that the end user would watch the movie in the theater before returning home as well.
- the data processing system 266 can include an application, script or program installed at the client computing device 279 , such as an app to communicate input audio signals to the interface 268 of the data processing system 266 and to drive components of the client computing device to render output audio signals.
- the data processing system 266 can receive data packets or other signal that includes or identifies an audio input signal.
- the data processing system 266 can execute or run the NLP component 267 to receive the audio input signal.
- the NLP component 267 can convert the audio input signal into recognized text by comparing the input signal against a stored, representative set of audio waveforms (e.g., in the data repository 274 ) and choosing the closest matches.
- the representative waveforms are generated across a large set of users, and can be augmented with speech samples.
- the NLP component 267 can match the text to words that are associated, for example via training across users or through manual specification, with actions that the data processing system 266 can serve.
- the audio input signal can be detected by the sensor 280 (e.g., a microphone) of the client computing device. Via the transducer 281 , the audio driver 282 , or other components the client computing device 279 can provide the audio input signal to the data processing system 266 (e.g., via the network 110 ) where it can be received (e.g., by the interface 268 ) and provided to the NLP component 267 or stored in the data repository 274 as content data 277 .
- the data processing system 266 e.g., via the network 110
- the NLP component 267 can obtain the input audio signal. From the input audio signal, the NLP component 267 can identify at least one request or at least one trigger keyword corresponding to the request.
- the request can indicate intent or subject matter of the input audio signal.
- the trigger keyword can indicate a type of action likely to be taken. For example, the NLP component 267 can parse the input audio signal to identify at least one request to leave home for the evening to attend dinner and a movie.
- the trigger keyword can include at least one word, phrase, root or partial word, or derivative indicating an action to be taken.
- the trigger keyword “go” or “to go to” from the input audio signal can indicate a need for transport.
- the input audio signal (or the identified request) does not directly express an intent for transport, however the trigger keyword indicates that transport is an ancillary action to at least one other action that is indicated by the request.
- the prediction component 269 (or other mechanism of the data processing system 266 ) can determine, based on the request or the trigger keyword, at least one thread associated with the input audio signal.
- the thread can indicate a set of sequence dependent operations, such as a series of actions.
- the thread can include any two or more actions, such as a first action, a second action, and a third action.
- the input audio signal “OK, I would like to go to go dinner and then a movie tonight” can include at least one request indicating an interest to attend dinner and a movie, and at least one trigger keyword, e.g., “go” indicating a need for transportation.
- the prediction component 269 can identify a thread with at least three actions, such as a dinner action (first action), a movie action (second action), and a transportation home action (third action). In this example, from the request or the trigger keyword the prediction component 269 predicts, estimates, or otherwise determines the three actions.
- the thread can include other actions, such as an initial transport to dinner action.
- the data processing system 266 or component thereof such as the prediction component 269 can determine that the actions of the thread are sequence dependent operations. For example, the prediction component can determine that the second action of watching the movie is subsequent to the first action of eating dinner, and that the third action of traveling home from the movie theater is after the second action of watching the movie.
- the prediction component 269 can access the parameters 275 or policies 276 in the data repository 274 to determine or otherwise estimate the order of the sequence dependent actions.
- the parameters 275 or policies 276 could indicate that a transport action (e.g., a taxi home) can occur after an event action (e.g., watching a movie).
- the prediction component 269 can determine a predicted exposure interval for the one or more actions of the thread or the thread itself.
- the prediction exposure interval can be based on the content item, content segments, and elements the content selector component 270 selects in response to the actions of the thread.
- the content selector component 270 is described further below, but briefly, the content selector component 270 can select content to provide to the client computing device 279 .
- the content item can include an audio message offering services of a car share company, responsive to an action in the thread that indicates a transportation need.
- the content selector component 270 can query the data repository 274 to select or otherwise identify the content item, e.g., from the content data 277 .
- the content selector component 270 can also select the content item from the content provider computing device 284 .
- the content provider computing device 284 can provide a content item to the data processing system 266 (or component thereof) for eventual output by the client computing device 279 .
- the content item can be a text based message that is displayed on a screen of the client computing device 279 .
- the content item can have a notification window that appears on the client computing device 279 that offers the services of a car share company in response to an action that indicates a transportation need.
- the prediction component 269 can determine the exposure interval based on the length of the selected content segment or content items. In some implementations, the exposure interval can be based on the content items selected in response to a previous request similar to the current request. For example, the prediction component 269 can predict that a first request “OK, what is the news today” has a longer exposure interval than a second request “OK, what is 84 divided by 4.”
- the response to the first request can include providing a first content segment that can include one or more elements and content items.
- the elements can include audio segments from different news agencies reporting on local, national, and world news.
- the response to the second request can include providing a content segment item that includes a single audio segment element stating “the answer is 21.”
- the predicted exposure interval can be greater for the first request because the time to play each of these audio segments of the first content item is greater than the time to play the audio segment of the second content item.
- the prediction component 269 can determine the predicted exposure interval based on characteristics of the request within an input signal.
- the characteristics can include the likelihood that request is to initiate a back-and-forth conversation.
- Another characteristic can include the likelihood that the request is to initiate related sessions.
- the prediction component 269 can predict that input audio signals that are likely to initiate a back-and-forth conversation have a relatively high exposure interval.
- the conversation can include a back-and-forth voice or audio based conversation between the client computing device 279 and the service provider computing device 285 .
- the conversation can include multiple threads. For example, an input audio signal of “OK, I would like to go to the movies tonight” can initiate a back-and-forth conversation as the system suggests different movies, movie times, restaurants, and restaurant times that are available to fulfill the input audio signal.
- the input response that is likely to generate a back-and-forth conversation can have a high exposure interval because multiple responses (and content items) are likely to be provided to the client computing device 279 in response to the initial input.
- the back-and-forth conversation can include single or multiple sessions.
- the request can be associated a relatively high likelihood that related requests, initiating related sessions, will be received after the first request.
- the related sessions can be similar to a back-and-forth conversation, where each of the sessions includes one or more threads.
- the related sessions can be different than a single back-and-forth conversation in that one or more of the threads of the conversation can be separated from subsequent threads by an unrelated thread.
- planning a vacation can include a plurality of related sessions.
- a first input request can ask for hotel availability in a vacation city.
- the related sessions could include threads such asking for the weather in the vacation city, making dinner reservations in the vacation city, or making other plans in the vacation city.
- a content provider device 284 may desire for their content items to be provided in response to requests associated with greater predicted exposure intervals when compared to requests associated with shorter predicted exposure intervals. For example, when the predicted exposure interval is longer, there is an increased opportunity to the publisher to provide multiple content items. In the case where the content item is a content item, exposing a user to the content item multiple times can increase the probability that the content item will result in a conversion. As described herein, the selection of a content item can be made through an auction process. The content provider device 284 can set rules with the content item system 204 such that content provider device 284 automatically bids more for content items with relatively higher predicted exposure intervals.
- the content selector component 270 can obtain indications of any of the actions of the thread.
- the prediction component 269 can directly or indirectly (e.g., via the data repository 274 ) provide an indication of the third (or any other) action to the content selector component 270 .
- the content selector component 270 can obtain this information from the data repository 274 , where it can be stored as part of the content data 277 .
- the indication of the third action can inform the content selector component 270 of a need for transportation from the location of the movie theater to a location as determined or indicated by the client computing device 279 , such as a ride to an end destination.
- the content selector component 270 can obtain indications of a later action in the thread prior to the occurrence of at least one earlier action. For example, the content selector component 270 can receive an indication of the third action (e.g., a need for a ride from the movie theater) before the movie plays in the theater (second action), or before the person who input the input audio signal into the client computing device 279 eats dinner at the restaurant (first action). The content selector component 270 can obtain indications of at least one action of the thread before completion of at least one action of the thread.
- the third action e.g., a need for a ride from the movie theater
- second action e.g., a need for a ride from the movie theater
- first action e.g., a need for a ride from the movie theater
- the content selector component 270 can obtain indications of at least one action of the thread before completion of at least one action of the thread.
- the content selector component 270 can identify at least one content item.
- the content item can be responsive or related to the third action.
- the content item can include an audio message offering services of a car share company, responsive to the third action that indicates a transportation need.
- the content selector component 270 can query the data repository 274 to select or otherwise identify the content item, e.g., from the content data 277 .
- the content selector component 270 can also select the content item from the content provider computing device 284 . For example responsive to a query received from the data processing system 266 , the content provider computing device 284 can provide a content item to the data processing system 266 (or component thereof) for eventual output by the client computing device 279 .
- the audio signal generator component 271 can generate or otherwise obtain an output signal that includes the content item responsive to the third action.
- the data processing system 266 can execute the audio signal generator component to generate or create an output signal corresponding to the content item.
- the interface 268 of the data processing system 266 can provide transmit one or more data packets that include the output signal via the computer network 110 to the client computing device 279 .
- the interface 268 can be designed, configured, constructed, or operational to receive and transmit information using, for example, data packets.
- the interface 268 can receive and transmit information using one or more protocols, such as a network protocol.
- the interface 268 can include a hardware interface, software interface, wired interface, or wireless interface.
- the interface 268 can facilitate translating or formatting data from one format to another format.
- the interface 268 can include an application programming interface that includes definitions for communicating between various components, such as software components of the system 265 .
- the data processing system 266 can provide the output signal from the data repository 274 or from the audio signal generator component 271 to the client computing device 279 .
- the data processing system 266 can also instruct, via data packet transmissions, the content provider computing device 284 or the service provider computing device 285 to provide the output signal to the client computing device 279 .
- the output signal can be obtained, generated, transformed to or transmitted as one or more data packets (or other communications protocol) from the data processing system 266 (or other computing device) to the client computing device 279 .
- the content selector component 270 skips to a later (e.g., third) action in a set of sequence dependent operations to select a content item for the third action prior to occurrence (and prior to an immediate need) for activity corresponding to the third action.
- a later sequenced action the data processing system 266 is not required to process information related to the first action or the second action to select content items for those actions. This reduces processor utilization, power consumption and bandwidth from data transmissions that would otherwise be associated with selecting a content item (for the first action) or a content item (for the second action) prior to selecting the content item for the third action.
- the content selector component 270 can select the content item for the (subsequent or later) third action as part of a real-time content selection process.
- the content item can be provided to the client computing device for transmission as audio output in a conversational manner in direct response to the input audio signal.
- the real-time content selection process to identify the content item and provide the content item to the client computing device 279 can occur within one minute or less from the time of the input audio signal and be considered real-time.
- the output signal that corresponds to the content item can cause the client computing device 279 to execute the audio driver 282 to drive the speaker 283 to generate an acoustic wave corresponding to the output signal.
- the acoustic wave can include words of or corresponding to the content item for the third action.
- the output signal that corresponds to the content item can also include non-audio content items that render on the client computing device 279 that is the source of the input audio signal or on a different client computing device 279 (e.g., a wearable device computing device) as text or image messages that can render without audio elements.
- the acoustic wave can be output from the client computing device 279 before the occurrence of the first action or the second action.
- the acoustic wave can include the audio output of “Would you like a taxi waiting for you after the movie?”
- the data processing system 266 obtains the input audio signal of, for example, “OK, I would like to go to go dinner and then a movie tonight.” From this information the NLP component 267 identifies at least one request or at least one trigger keyword, and the prediction component 269 uses the request(s) or trigger keyword(s) to identify at least one thread.
- the thread includes a series of sequence dependent actions, e.g., a first dinner action, a second movie action, and a third transport home action.
- the prediction component 269 can determine (e.g., with at least a threshold level of confidence such as 75% confident) that these actions will occur in sequential order, where the end user of the client computing device 279 will first eat dinner, then after dinner go to a movie, then after dinner take transportation home or away from the movie theater.
- the content selector component 270 can, for example, bypass processing associated with content item selection for the first action and the second action and instead first selects a content item for the third action, e.g., a content item for a car share service to arrange for transport with a pick-up location of the movie theater.
- the data processing system 266 or component thereof such as the audio signal generator component 271 can provide the content item for the third action to the client computing device 279 .
- the acoustic wave can be output from the client computing device 279 subsequent to the occurrence of the first action and before the occurrence of the second action, e.g., between prior actions in the thread.
- the content item for the third item can render at least in part as an audio output from the client computing device 279 before the first action or the second action has occurred.
- the output signal that includes the content item for the third action can render as a human or automated voice that states “Would you like a ride home from the movie theater?”
- the data processing system 266 can receive a response to the content item for the third action prior to occurrence of one, more than one, or all of the prior actions in the ordered sequence of actions.
- the data processing system 266 can provide the content item for rendering and receive a response, e.g., via the interface 268 , before the end user has gone to dinner or before the end user has watched the movie.
- the data processing system 266 can provide the output signal that includes the content item in direct or real-time response to the input audio signal of “OK, I would like to go to go dinner and then a movie tonight” so that the packet based data transmissions via the computer network 110 that are part of a communication session between the data processing system 266 and the client computing device 279 has the flow and feel of a real-time person to person conversation.
- This packet based data transmission communication session can also include the content provider computing device 284 or the service provider computing device 285 .
- the content selector component 270 can select content items provided in response to the third (or any non-first) action in the sequence dependent set of actions before selecting any content item for any prior action in the sequence. This avoids the need to process at least some of the data corresponding to the prior actions, which causes the third content item to be selected with a reduced number of processing operations than would occur if the content items were selected in an order that matches the order of the sequence of actions.
- Content items for the prior (e.g., first and second) actions may or may not be selected, for example after selection of the content item for the third action.
- the content selector component 270 can select the content item (e.g., for the third action) based on at least one trigger keyword of the thread that indicates subject matter different than subject matter of the one or more requests of the same thread. For example, the requests of the thread responsive to “OK, I would like to go to go dinner and then a movie tonight” can indicate subject matter of a dinner request (first action), and subject matter of a movie request (second action). This subject matter does not indicate any transportation request.
- the NLP component 267 or the prediction component 269 (or other data processing system 266 components executing as part of the direct action API 272 ) can identify the trigger keyword “go” “go to” or “to go to” and can determine a transportation request (third action) based at least in part on the trigger keyword.
- the data processing system 266 can infer actions from the input audio signal that are secondary requests that are not the primary request or subject of the input audio signal.
- the data processing system 266 can prevent or delay transmission of the output signal that includes the content item.
- the interface 268 or a script executing via the direct action API 272 can prevent transmission of data packets that include the output signal corresponding to the content item until a triggering event.
- the triggering event can include expiration of a pre-determined time period, such as two hours or a time coinciding with occurrence of an earlier action in the thread, such as a scheduled end time of a movie.
- the triggering event can also include an authorization indication received by the data processing system 266 from the client computing device 279 .
- the authorization indication can originate as a subsequent audio input associated with the thread but received by the data processing system subsequent to the input audio signal, a text-based or other non-audible signal, or can include an indication of a setting of the client computing device 279 that authorizes receipt by the client computing device 279 of content items.
- the data processing system 266 can also delay transmission of the content item associated with a second or subsequent to second action of the thread to optimize processing utilization. For example, the data processing system 266 can delay content item transmission until an off-peak or non-peak period of data center usage, which results in more efficient utilization of the data center by reducing peak bandwidth usage, heat output or cooling requirements.
- the data processing system 266 can also initiate a conversion or other activity associated with the content item, such as ordering a car service, based on data center utilization rates or bandwidth metrics or requirements of the network 110 or of a data center that includes the data processing system 266 .
- the content items can correspond to the actions of the thread, and the content selector component 270 can select a content item for one, more than one, or all actions of the thread.
- the prediction component 269 can identify the sequence dependent thread of actions of, for example, “dinner” (first action) “movie” (second action) and “transport from movie location” (third action).
- the direct action API 272 can execute programs or scripts, for example from the NLP component 267 , the prediction component 269 , or the content selector component 270 to identify content items for one or more of these actions.
- the direct action API 272 can execute a specified action to satisfy the end user's intention, as determined by the data processing system 266 .
- the direct action API 272 can execute code or a dialog script that identifies the parameters required to fulfill a user request. Such code can lookup additional information, e.g., in the data repository 274 , such as the name of a home automation service, or it can provide audio output for rendering at the client computing device 279 to ask the end user questions such as the intended destination of a requested taxi.
- the direct action API 272 can determine necessary parameters and can package the information into an action data structure, which can then be sent to another component such as the content selector component 270 or to the service provider computing device 285 to be fulfilled.
- the direct action API 272 of the data processing system 266 can generate, based on the request or the trigger keyword, data structures for the actions of the thread.
- the action data structures can be generated responsive to the request.
- the action data structure can be included in the messages that are transmitted to or received by the service provider computing device 285 .
- the direct action API 272 can determine to which of a plurality of service provider computing devices 285 the message should be sent. For example, if an input audio signal includes “order a taxi,” the NLP component 267 can identify the trigger word “order” and the request for a taxi.
- the direct action API 272 can package the request into an action data structure for transmission as a message to a service provider computing device 285 of a taxi service.
- the message can also be passed to the content selector component 270 .
- the action data structure can include information for completing the request. In this example, the information can include a pick up location and a destination location.
- the direct action API 272 can retrieve a template 278 from the repository 274 to determine which fields to include in the action data structure.
- the direct action API 272 can retrieve content from the repository 274 to obtain information for the fields of the data structure.
- the direct action API 272 can populate the fields from the template with that information to generate the data structure.
- the direct action API 272 can also populate the fields with data from the input audio signal.
- the templates 278 can be standardized for categories of service providers or can be standardized for specific service providers. For example, ride sharing service providers can use the following standardized template 278 to create the data structure: ⁇ client device identifier; authentication credentials; pickup location; destination location; no passengers; service level ⁇ .
- the content item for the third action can be provided for rendering at the client computing device 279 as an audio response that states “Would you like a ride home from the movie theater?” in response to the audio input signal.
- the data processing system 266 can select or provide a content item, e.g., “the Italian restaurant downtown has an opening for 7 pm tonight?” for the first action (dinner), and can select or provide another content item, e.g., “would you like tickets to the 9 pm movie at the downtown theater?” for the second action (movie).
- the data processing system 266 can provide (which includes instructing the content provider computing device 284 to provide) these content items responsive to the input audio signal for rendering by the client computing device 279 as audio output content items.
- the data processing system 266 via the interface 268 , can select or provide these content items in any order to the client computing device 279 .
- the content item for the third (e.g., last) action can be selected or provided first, before content items corresponding to other, earlier actions of the thread.
- the data processing system 266 can receive a response to the content item “would you like a ride home from the movie theater?”
- the response can include an input audio signal, e.g., “yes please” that was entered into the client computing device 279 by the end user and received by the data processing system 266 .
- the direct action API 272 can communicate with the service provider computing device 285 (that can be associated with the content item, such as a car share company) to order a taxi or ride share vehicle for the location of the movie theater at the time the movie ends.
- the data processing system 266 can obtain this location or time information as part of the data packet (or other protocol) based data message communication with the client computing device 279 , from the data repository 274 , or from other sources such as the service provider computing device 285 or the content provider computing device 284 . Confirmation of this order (or other conversion) can be provided as an audio communication from the data processing system 266 to the client computing device 279 in the form of an output signal from the data processing system 266 that drives the client computing device 279 to render audio output such as, “great, you will have a car waiting for you at 11 pm outside the theater.”
- the data processing system 266 via the direct action API 272 , can communicate with the service provider computing device 285 to confirm the order for the car.
- the data processing system 266 can obtain the response (e.g., “yes please”) to the content item (“would you like a ride home from the movie theater?”) and can route a packet based data message to the service provider NLP component 286 (or other component of the service provider computing device).
- This packet based data message can cause the service provider computing device 285 to effect a conversion, e.g., to make a car pick up reservation outside the movie theater.
- This conversion—or confirmed order—(or any other conversion of any other action of the thread) can occur prior to completion of one or more actions of the thread, such as prior to completion of the movie, as well as subsequent to completion of one or more actions of the thread, such as subsequent to dinner.
- the data processing system 266 can initiate a conversion or action. This can occur before the end user has begun any activities associated with the thread, e.g., before dinner or before the movie is over. Processors of the data processing system 266 can invoke the direct action API 272 to execute scripts that order a car from a car share service.
- the direct action API 272 can obtain content data 277 (or parameters 275 or policies 276 ) from the data repository 274 , as well as data received with end user consent from the client computing device 279 to determine location, time, user accounts, logistical or other information in order to reserve a car from the car share service.
- the data processing system 266 can also communicate with the service provider computing device 285 to complete the conversion by in this example making the car share pick up reservation.
- the direct action API 272 can initiate the conversion or activity to accomplish an action of the thread at any time during a time period from receipt by the data processing system 266 of the first input audio signal associated with the thread, (e.g., “OK, I would like to go to go dinner and then a movie tonight”) until a threshold time period subsequent to completion of one of the actions of the thread, (e.g., until 15 minutes after the end of the second action of watching the movie).
- the data processing system 266 can also determine the end of this time period based on other factors, such as an indication that the end user has completed the actions of the thread, e.g., has returned home or is no longer located at the movie theater.
- the data processing system 266 can also obtain an indication from the client computing device 279 (a data message transmitted via the network 110 ) that the thread is canceled or dormant or that the end user has canceled or completed actions of the thread.
- the direct action API 272 can initiate the conversion or activity to accomplish an action of the thread based on completion or time of completion of other actions of the thread.
- the data processing system 266 can order a good or service (car share pick-up) directly or by communicating with the service provider computing device 285 within a threshold time period of a conclusion of a prior action in the thread.
- the data processing system 266 can confirm or order a car share service to send a car to pick up the end user at the movie theater (subsequent, third action). This can occur in the absence of input received from the end user computing device 279 during this time period, or responsive to a prompt received from the end user computing device 279 during this time period.
- the direct action API 272 can initiate the conversions or other activity associated with the sequence dependent operations of the thread in any order.
- the direct action API 272 (or other data processing system 266 component) can initiate activity corresponding to a final action (e.g., the third action in a three action thread such as ordering a taxi) prior to initiating activity corresponding to an earlier thread in the sequence, (e.g., prior to making a dinner reservation or prior to ordering movie tickets).
- the data processing system 266 initiates activity for an earlier (e.g., second) action subsequent to initiation of activity for the later (e.g., third) action.
- the content selector component 270 can identify, select, or obtain multiple content items resulting from a multiple content selection processes.
- the content selection processes can be real-time, e.g., part of the same conversation, communication session, or series of communications sessions between the data processing system 266 and the client computing device 279 that involve a thread.
- the conversation can include asynchronous communications separated from one another by a period of hours or days, for example.
- the conversation or communication session can last for a time period from receipt of the first input audio signal until an estimated or known conclusion of a final action of the thread, receipt by the data processing system 266 of an indication of a termination of the thread. This can be referred to as the active time period of the thread.
- the content selector component 270 can select at least one content item for each action.
- the content selector component 270 can run or obtain results from a different content selection process for each action.
- the content provider computing device 279 can set forth content items for selection by the content selector component 270 .
- the content item selector component can select or otherwise identify a first content item for the first action via a first content selection process, a second content item for the second action via a second content selection process, and a third content item for the third action via a third content selection process.
- the data processing system 266 that provides these content items for rendering by the client computing device 279 during the active time period of the thread can be considered to be operating in real-time. In this example the content selection processes and rendering of the content items occurs in real time.
- the data processing system 266 can cancel actions associated with content items. For example, after ordering the car service the end user may watch the movie but then decide to walk home, or to have desert after the movie instead of taking a car home.
- An app or other program executing at the client computing device 279 as part of the data processing system 266 can receive an input audio signal of “cancel my ride home”.
- the NLP component 267 can receive this input audio signal, for example as one or more packet based data messages, and can determine that this input audio signal relates to a pre-existing thread (e.g., dinner, movie, transport home) and is part of the same conversation or communication.
- the NLP component 267 (or other data processing system 266 component) can evaluate time data, location data and pre-existing thread data such as past, present, or scheduled actions of a thread from the content data 277 of the data repository 274 to determine that an input audio signal relates to a pre-existing thread. Based, for example, on the request “ride” or the trigger keyword “cancel” the NLP component 267 can determine that the input audio signal “cancel my ride home” relates to the content item “would you like a ride home from the movie theater?” that corresponds to the third action of a pre-existing thread.
- the direct action API 272 (or other component) can cause the data processing system 266 to communicate via the interface 268 with the service provider computing device 285 to cancel the order for the taxi or car share service to have a car waiting for the end user outside the movie theater upon conclusion of the movie.
- the NLP component 267 can receive the data packet or other protocol based message to cancel an action of the thread prior to or subsequent to completion of any action of the thread.
- the NLP component 267 can receive from the client computing device 279 (or obtain from the data repository 274 ) a data message (inbound audio signal) to cancel an action of the thread within a time interval triggered by an earlier action of the thread.
- a data message inbound audio signal
- the data processing system 266 can receive the transport cancellation data message within 5 minutes (or other time period) of the conclusion of the movie.
- the data processing system 266 can prompt for confirmation of a product or service related to an action of the thread.
- the data processing system 266 can transmit a data message to the client computing device 279 that, when rendered at the client computing device 279 outputs the audio or text message stating “just confirming that you still want a car waiting for you after the movie.”
- the data processing system 266 can receive a response, e.g., “yes, confirmed” or “no, cancel the car”.
- the direct action API 272 can execute scripts to process this information and can communicate with the service provider computing device 285 to indicate the confirmation or the cancellation.
- an exemplary screenshot 300 is provided, reflecting an exemplary webpage 302 provided by content provider device 284 to user 108 .
- the webpage 302 includes an embedded video 310 with a duration of 15 minutes, and two content item slots 304 and 306 .
- Content item slots refer to areas within a webpage that are designated or reserved for the display of content items. It can be appreciated that content items 210 are deployed in the respective content item slots 304 , 306 .
- FIG. 3B depicts an exemplary screenshot 320 of another exemplary webpage 322 .
- This webpage provides a brief reference to a hyperlink 330 to another webpage, as well as two content item slots 324 and 326 within which content items 210 are respectively deployed.
- users 108 on average, are likely to spend relatively less time viewing the webpage shown in FIG. 3B (consisting primarily of a hyperlink to another site) than the webpage shown in FIG. 3A (consisting primarily of a 15 minute embedded video), and the results of this discrepancy can be reflected in the content exposure data 250 maintained for each respective page.
- deploying content items associated with various bid types across the different webpages can serve to improve and/or optimize the content revenue generated by each webpage, as described in greater detail herein.
- FIG. 3C depicts an exemplary screenshot 340 of yet another exemplary webpage 342 .
- content such as hyperlinks 330 , embedded video 310 , and some content items are viewable, other content such as blog 350 and content item 3 are not viewable without scrolling the page down.
- certain content segments e.g., embedded video 310
- deploying content items associated with different bid types in proximity to the respective content segments can serve to improve and/or optimize the content revenue generated by the page as a whole, as described in greater detail herein.
- FIG. 4A is a flowchart of an example method 400 for deploying content items.
- the method 400 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium.
- the method 400 can be performed by the content item system 204 of FIG. 2A .
- An exposure interval of a content segment is computed ( 410 ).
- a content segment can be a webpage (e.g., the webpage 302 as depicted in FIG. 3A ), while in other implementations the content segment can be a portion of a webpage (e.g., segment 360 in FIG. 3C , reflecting the portion of webpage 342 containing media/video content 310 ).
- an exposure interval can be measured as a function of time, such as 15 seconds, five minutes, etc.
- previous exposure instances (as contained/reflected, for example, in content exposure data 250 ) can be analyzed to determine an average exposure interval.
- Such previous exposure instances corresponding to data such as ‘time on page,’ bounce rate,' and other such web traffic metrics that reflect aspects, such as duration, of a user engagement with a particular content segment such as a webpage and/or website, as are known to those of ordinary skill in the art), can be processed in order to compute an average exposure interval.
- the average exposure interval reflects an amount of time that users, on average, engage with and/or otherwise view a particular content segment (e.g., 15 seconds, five minutes, etc.).
- the referenced exposure interval/average exposure interval can be computed/refined with respect to one or more user profiles or user types. That is, it can be appreciated that users among a first demographic (e.g., between the ages of 18-25) can relate to various content segments differently than users among a second demographic (e.g., between the ages of 55-65). For example, users between the ages of 18-25 can, on average, spend more time engaging with video/media content as compared to text content, while users between the ages of 55-65 can, on average, spend more time engaging with text content as compared to video/media content.
- a first demographic e.g., between the ages of 18-25
- a second demographic e.g., between the ages of 55-65
- users between the ages of 18-25 can, on average, spend more time engaging with video/media content as compared to text content
- users between the ages of 55-65 can, on average, spend more time engaging with text content as compared to video/media content.
- a particular content segment e.g., a content segment containing an embedded video
- a user profile/demographic can be provided by a user (such as through user profile information composed/provided by the user), while in other implementations such a user profile/demographic can be generated based on user behavior that has been observed (though it should be understood that in some cases a user may opt in or opt out of such an observation, and in some cases, identifiers associated with each user may be anonymized, as referenced above).
- a content segment can be analyzed to identify one or more elements of the content segment ( 412 ).
- elements include media content (such as an embedded video or audio file or stream), text content (such as a blog post or article), a hyperlink, and/or aspects of such elements.
- the HTML code corresponding to/underlying a particular webpage e.g., webpage 302 depicted in FIG. 3A
- a portion of a webpage e.g., segment 360 in FIG. 3C
- elements such as media/video content 310
- an exposure interval can be computed based on the one or more elements ( 414 ). That is, having identified media/video content 310 within a content segment (a webpage/portion of a webpage), an exposure interval can be computed on account of the presence of the media/video content 310 (content which generally increases an exposure interval of a content segment).
- different elements of a content segment can be associated with fixed exposure intervals (e.g., media/video content is ascribed a five minute exposure interval, blog posts/articles are ascribed a two minute exposure interval, hyperlinks are ascribed a five second exposure interval, etc.), while in other implementations certain aspects of such elements can dictate/suggest a particular exposure interval to be ascribed to the pertinent content segment.
- the finite duration of media/video content e.g., 15 minutes, as shown in FIG. 3A
- some function thereof e.g., 50% of the total duration of the media/video content
- the number of words in a blog post or article can dictate/suggest the referenced exposure interval (e.g., each 50 words of a blog post/article is equivalent to one minute of an exposure interval). It can be appreciated that by computing an exposure interval based on elements of a content segment, a determination can be made regarding the exposure interval of the content segment, even in scenarios where there are no previous exposure instances (such as those referenced at 410 ) or in scenarios where such previous exposure instances are not statistically significant.
- exposure intervals such as those computed based on the various elements within a content segment, can be said to be projected exposure intervals, as they reflect a projected exposure interval that can be computed even in scenarios where little or no historical data exists and/or is available.
- two or more content items that are candidates to be provided within a content slot of the content segment can be identified ( 420 ).
- one of the content items can be associated with a CPT bid and another of the content items can be associated with a non-CPT bid.
- content item 210 A can be associated with a particular CPM bid 232 (e.g., a bid to pay up to $0.02 per impression) while content item 210 N can be associated with a particular CPT bid 236 (e.g., a bid to pay up to $0.005 per second).
- a determination is achieved using an amount of the CPT bid (e.g., the CPT bid referenced at 420 ), an amount of the non-CPT bid (e.g., the non-CPT bid referenced at 420 ), and the exposure interval (such as the exposure interval computed at 410 ).
- service provider device 285 can participate in an auction whereby the service providers can bid various monetary amounts, with the highest/winning bid (optionally in combination with the relevance of the particular content item, as referenced above) entitling the service provider to serve their content item to a user.
- an auction process can yield a CPM bid of up to $0.05 per impression, a CPC bid of up to $0.15 for per click, and/or a CPT bid for up to $0.01/second.
- Each respective bid in the auction can be processed with an exposure interval (such as the exposure interval computed at 410 ) in order to determine which content item (and its associated bid) is likely to yield the most revenue.
- a content item associated with a CPM bid yields $0.05 of content revenue for the publisher, while deploying a content item associated with a CPT bid yields $0.04 of content revenue ($0.01/second ⁇ 4 seconds)—thus, a content item associated with a CPM bid is preferable to a content item associated with a CPT bid in such a content segment.
- a content item associated with a CPT bid yields $0.06 of content revenue ($0.01/second ⁇ 6 seconds), while a content item associated with a CPM bid yields $0.05 of content revenue—thus, a content item associated with a CPT bid is preferable to a content item associated with a CPM bid under such circumstances.
- content item associated with a CPC bid can also be accounted for (that is, considered with respect to determining the content item associated with a particular bid type to deploy within a particular content segment) by converting the CPC bid into an equivalent metric.
- CPC bid e.g., $0.15
- CTR predicted/average click-through rate
- the referenced associations of a particular content item with a particular bid type can include a distribution of one or more content items having various respective bid types (e.g., CPC, CPT, etc.) within one or more content segments.
- content segment 360 containing media/video content 310 and content item 2
- a first exposure interval e.g., six seconds
- a second content segment 370 containing hyperlinks 330 and content item 1
- a second exposure interval e.g., four seconds.
- a content item associated with a CPT bid is likely to yield the greatest amount of content revenue when deployed in this content item slot
- content item slot 344 of content segment 370 e.g., content item 1
- a content item associated with a CPM content item is likely to yield the greatest amount of content revenue when deployed therein.
- content revenues can be maximized across the various content segments (when compared to a deployment content items associated only with CPM bids or content items associated only with CPT bids).
- One or more content items are provided in one or more content slots ( 440 ).
- the content items can be provided in response to a determination that a content item associated with one bid type is expected to generate a greater amount of revenue than a content item associated with another bid type (e.g., with respect to a particular content item slot included within a particular content segment), such as in the manner described at 430 .
- the one or more content items can be provided/deployed within a content segment in a manner that optimizes projected revenues generated by the one or more content items, such as in the manner described above.
- the manner in which the content items are deployed can, in certain implementations, be based on an exposure interval, such as the exposure interval computed at 410 .
- providing/deploying content items within a content segment can include providing a suggested arrangement of the content items within the content segment.
- the publisher of website 342 (as depicted in FIG. 3C ) can be presented with one or more suggestions of various arrangements of content items (and their respective associated bid types), such as those referenced above. The publisher can then choose to deploy such suggestions, edit/modify them, and/or reject them.
- various content items can be provided/deployed in a manner that accounts for a user profile of the particular user to whom the content items are being deployed. That is, as referenced above at 410 , it can be appreciated that users from different groups and/or demographics can have different interests and can interact with/view webpages and content items differently. As such, having identified a user as having a particular profile, content items can be deployed in a manner that accounts for such an identification (e.g., deploying content items having associated bid types in a manner that improves or optimizes revenue generation on account of observed or predicted tendencies about other members of the same group/demographic, such as exposure intervals with regard to various content segments, as described herein).
- An association of one or more of the content items is selectively converted from one bid type to another bid type ( 450 ). That is, it can be appreciated that the particular content item objectives of a service provider can change and/or be dependent upon various budgetary considerations. Moreover, it can be further appreciated that certain bid types, such as CPT bids, can entail a degree of unpredictability with respect to the specific amount an service provider will be charged for a particular impression of a content item associated with such a bid (as this charge is ultimately determined by the actual amount of time during which a user is exposed to the content item).
- CPT bids CPT bids
- a certain budgetary threshold e.g., an content account of an service provider falls below a certain threshold, such as a defined amount or a percentage of an original account balance
- the association of one or more content items of a particular service provider can be converted from one bid type to another bid type. For example, once an content account of the service provider falls below a certain threshold the association of one or more content items of a particular service provider with CPT bids can be converted, such that the content items are associated instead with CPM bids.
- an service provider can potentially increase the predictability of the number of content impressions that will be achieved with the remaining content account balance (in light of the fact that, in the case of an association with a CPT bid, longer impression periods will deplete the account balance sooner and provide fewer total impression instances). It should also be noted that such a conversion (e.g., converting the association of a particular content item from a CPT bid to a CPM bid) can be achieved using the principles referenced above (at 430 ) with respect to determining which content item is expected to generate the greatest amount of revenue on the basis of a particular bid associated with the content item and a computed exposure interval.
- a monetization rate of a bid is progressively adjusted ( 460 ). That is, it can be appreciated that in a scenario where a content item associated with a cost per time unit (CPT) bid is deployed, the amount that the service provider ultimately pays for a particular instance of deployment of the content item is variable, depending on the amount of time that a user views/is exposed to the content item. It can also be appreciated that in many cases the utility/value of the viewing of the content item by the user diminishes as time goes on. As such, in some implementations the monetization rate (for example, the amount the service provider pays per time unit) of such CPT bids can be progressively adjusted as time goes on.
- CPT cost per time unit
- a CPT bid can be configured to charge a first rate (e.g., $0.01/second) for a first time period (e.g., the first 10 seconds of content item exposure) and a second rate (e.g., $0.005/second) for a second time period (e.g., the following 10 seconds).
- a monetization cap can be imposed on a CPT bid, representing a maximum value that a service provider can be charged for a single impression (e.g., $0.20). In doing so, the service provider can be protected from significant charges in scenarios where a user maintains an instance of a page having a content item associated with a CPT bid for a lengthy period of time.
- the monetization rate can be optionally configured to increase as time goes on (e.g., in the case of a video content item where the ongoing viewing of the content item is of increasing value to the service provider).
- the monetization rate of a CPT bid can be progressively adjusted based elements of the content segment within which the associated content item is deployed. For example, in the case of a video content item, there can be certain points within the video that are of greater value/importance to the service provider than others (e.g., points where a particular product or feature is shown). It can be further appreciated that such points can be flagged or otherwise designated by the service provider, in a manner known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
- certain points/segments of such a video content item can be monetized at one rate, while other points/segments of the same video can be monetized at a different rate, owing to the differences in importance/value between the various points/segments.
- various content items can be configured to be monetized only if/when the content item is within view of a user.
- Content item 3 is not immediately viewable to the user upon arrival at webpage 342 . Indeed, in certain scenarios the user may never be exposed to Content item 3 (such as if the user leaves the site or otherwise remains idle without scrolling down).
- the content item can be configured to charge the service provider only when Content item 3 is viewable to the user, such as when the user scrolls down webpage 342 .
- a timer response for maintaining the exposure time for content items associated with CPT bids
- a timer can effectively pause until the content item returns to view.
- FIG. 5A is a flowchart of an example method 500 for setting a bid type.
- the method 500 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium.
- the method 500 can be performed by the content item system 204 of FIG. 2A .
- a content item can be processed to compute a target exposure interval ( 510 ).
- a target exposure interval is an ideal or desired time duration for the content item to be presented to/viewable by a user.
- the content of one or more of the content items can be analyzed in order to compute a target exposure interval.
- FIG. 6 depicts exemplary content items 210 and 210 B. It can be appreciated, with reference to FIG. 6 , that content item 210 A (“Buy insurance now!”) is considerably shorter (that is, contains fewer words) than content item 210 B (“Get an instant quote . . . Click here for more!”).
- the target exposure interval (that is, the ideal amount of time to display the content item) of content item 210 A is likely to be significantly less than the target exposure interval of content item 210 B (in light of content item 210 A having relatively fewer words than content item 210 B and thus requiring relatively less time for the content message to be imparted to a user viewing the content item).
- the content of a content item can be analyzed and the target exposure interval can be computed as a function of the number of words in a content item.
- every three words in a content item can be defined to be equivalent to one second of a target exposure interval—thus, content item 210 A of FIG.
- the content type of one or more of the content items can be analyzed/considered in order to compute a target exposure interval.
- certain types of content items e.g., flash content items, interactive content items, etc.
- other types of content items e.g., text content items, banner content items, etc.
- a bid type for association with the at least one content item can be determined based on the target exposure interval ( 520 ). That is, having determined (such as at 510 ) the target exposure interval for a particular content item, the target exposure interval can be processed in a manner substantially similar to that described in detail above at 430 , whereby various bid types can be processed with the target exposure interval in order to determine which bid type is likely to yield the most revenue when associated with a particular content item.
- One or more content items can be deployed as within a webpage ( 530 ).
- the content item can be deployed in response to a selection of the content item, such as on the basis of a bid type associated with the content item. That is, having determined a bid type to associated with a particular content item (such as at 520 ), the content item can be deployed to a user, substantially in the manner described in detail above at 440 .
- Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus.
- the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus.
- a computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them.
- a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal.
- the computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).
- FIG. 5B illustrate a block diagram of an example method 550 for the transmission of packetized data in a voice activated, data packet based computer network environment.
- the method 550 can include receiving data packets that can include an input audio signal (step 552 ).
- the method 550 can include identifying a request in the input audio signal (step 553 ).
- the method 550 can include identifying a content segment to fulfill the request (step 554 ).
- the method 550 can include determining a predicted exposure interval for the content segment (step 555 ).
- the method 550 can include selecting a first and a second candidate content item (or other digital component) to place in the content segment (step 556 ).
- the method 550 can include determining a utility for the first and the second candidate content item (step 557 ).
- the method 550 can include transmitting the first candidate content item (step 558 ).
- the method 550 can include receiving data packets that can include an input audio signal (step 552 ).
- the data processing system can receive the data packets at an interface.
- the input audio signal can be detected by a sensor, such as a microphone, located at or on a client computing device.
- the data processing system can execute, launch, or invoke the
- the NLP component to receive packet or other protocol based transmissions via the network from the client computing device.
- the data packets can include or correspond to an input audio signal detected by the sensor, such as an end user saying “OK, I would like to go to go dinner and then a movie tonight” into a smartphone.
- the method 550 can include identifying a request in the input audio signal (step 553 ).
- the method 550 can also include identifying a trigger keyword in the input audio signal.
- the NLP component can parse the input audio signal to identifying the first request and the trigger keyword that corresponds to the first request. For example, the NLP component can parse the input audio signal to identify requests (“dinner” or “movie”) as well as trigger keywords “go” “go to” or “to go to” that correspond or relate to the request.
- the method 550 can also include determine at least one thread based on the requests and the trigger keywords.
- the thread can include a series of sequence dependent actions that the data processing system can determine will occur in a set order, such as a thread.
- the thread can include a plurality of related actions.
- Receiving a thread by the data processing system can include receiving a series of input audio signals that include related requests. For example, “Ok, what movies are playing tonight” and “Ok, what restaurants are near the theater” can be included in a thread because the two input audio signals relate to activities the user is interested in performing in a single outing.
- the subsequent requests and actions can be dependent on a response to a previous response or content item.
- prediction component can determine a score that indicates the likelihood that the first input audio signal is the beginning of a thread.
- the likelihood score can indicate the likelihood of receiving data packets that include a second input audio signal with a second request that is related to the first request. For example, “Ok, what movies are playing tonight” can have a high likelihood score of being the start of a thread based on historical data indicating that when users generate input audio signals requesting information related to movies, the user over requests additional information such dinner reservation availability.
- input audio signal of “Ok, what is the weather” can have a relatively low likelihood score because historical data can indicate that user do not typically as additional questions relating to the weather after receiving the local weather.
- the prediction component can predict a number of actions associated with the trigger keyword and the first request.
- the method 550 can include identifying a content segment to fulfill the request (step 554 ).
- the content segment that the data processing system identifies can include a plurality of elements.
- the elements can be content items that include audio segments that are identified in response to the request and trigger keyword. For example, in response to the request “OK, what time is it?” The element could be an audio signal that includes the automated voice speaking the current time.
- the content segment and one or more elements can be transmitted to the client computing device that generated the input audio signal for play back to the user.
- the elements can be audio or other templates into which the content items are inserted.
- the elements can be selected based on the request or trigger keyword. For example, a template for “OK, what time is it?” could be “The time is.” To this template, a content item indicating the specific time can be appended.
- the method 550 can include determining a predicted exposure interval for the content segment (step 555 ).
- the predicted exposure interval for the content segment is predicted in a method similar to that described above in relation to steps 410 - 414 of FIGS. 4A and 4B .
- the predicted exposure interval can be a prediction of an amount of time that a user will engage with the content segment or elements within the content segment. The prediction can be based on an average time previous users engaged with the content segment. For example, a content segment can include audio elements that are 60 seconds in length. If, on average, the user terminates the playback of the audio segment after 50 seconds, the content segment can have a predicted exposure interval of 50 seconds.
- the prediction component can predict a predicted exposure interval for each of the content segments that can be identified responsive to the subsequent actions in the thread. For example, if there is a 75% chance that the second request “OK, what dinner reservations are available near the movie theater” will follow the first request of “OK, what movies are playing.”
- the predicted component can calculate the predicted exposure interval for the content segment to fulfill the second request.
- the predicted exposure interval of the content segment to fulfill the second request can be a function of the likelihood that the second request will follow the first request in a thread. For example, in isolation, the content segment to fulfill the second request can have a predicted exposure interval of 45 seconds.
- the content segment to fulfill the second request can be determined to have a predicted exposure interval of 33.75 second (45 seconds ⁇ 75%).
- the prediction component can calculate a total predicted exposure interval as the sum of each of each of the predicted exposure intervals for the content segments to fulfill the requests in the thread.
- the method 550 can include selecting a first and a second candidate content item to place in the content segment (step 556 ).
- the first and the second candidate content items can each have display parameters.
- the first and the second candidate content items can be selected as candidate content items that can possibly be included in the content segment.
- the content items can be referred to as candidate content items.
- the display parameters of the first and the second candidate content items can be different.
- the first candidate content item can have a non-time based display parameter and the second candidate content item can have a time based display parameter.
- the first candidate content item and the second candidate content item can be the same candidate content item, but one version that has a non-time based display parameter and another version that has a time based display parameter.
- the display parameters can be a bid value that a publisher is willing to pay for the presentation of their respective content items.
- the time based display parameter can be CPT bid and the non-time based display parameter can be non-CPT bid, such as CPC bid.
- the first and the second candidate content items can be audio or other media content items that are inserted into or appended to the content segments and transmitted to the client computing device.
- the content item could be information for a specific restaurant.
- the content item could be included with the content segment as response to the request.
- the content item could be appended to the content segment as to provide additional information after the response to the request is provided.
- the content item may include information about an Italian restaurant not close to the movie theater, but one which the user of the client computing device might be interested in visiting.
- the method 550 can include determining a utility for the first and the second candidate content item (step 557 ).
- the utility can be an indication of the expected revenue to be generated by the selection and presentation of the respective content items.
- the step 557 can be similar to the above described step 430 described in relation to FIG. 4A .
- the determination of the utility of the first and second candidate content items can be based on the display parameters of the candidate content items and the predicted exposure interval for the content segments.
- the candidate content items can have the display parameters, a CPM bid of up to $0.05 per impression, a CPC bid of up to $0.15 for per click, and a CPT bid for up to $0.01/second, respectively.
- the predicted exposure interval is four seconds
- deploying the candidate content item associated with a CPM bid yields $0.05 of revenue for the publisher, while deploying the candidate content item associated with a CPT bid yields $0.04 of revenue ($0.01/second ⁇ 4 seconds).
- a candidate content item associated with a CPM bid is preferable, in this example, to a candidate content item associated with a CPT bid in such a content segment.
- the data processing system can increase a bid value of a candidate content item based on the predicted exposure interval. For example, if the predicted exposure interval is high or the input request is likely to be the start of a thread, the additional exposure can be valuable to the publisher because it is more likely that the entirety of their candidate content item will be presented. Based on instructions from the publisher, the data processing system can increase the bid value of the publisher's content items when the predicted exposure interval is above a predetermined threshold.
- the method 550 can include transmitting the first candidate content item (step 558 ).
- the first candidate content item can be selected responsive to having a utility that is greater than the utility of the second candidate content item.
- the first content item can be selected as the content item that is transmitted to the client computing device.
- the content item can be transmitted to the client computing device via an interface.
- the content item can be transmitted as part of an output signal that includes the content segment.
- the output signal can be transmitted as data packets to the client computing device.
- the output signal can be transmitted to a second client computing device that is different than the client computing device that transmitted the input audio signal.
- the output signal when received by the client computing device, can cause an application or other component of the client computing device to drive a speaker that generates an acoustic wave that corresponds to the output signal.
- the data processing system can also transmit additional data packets that additional content items that are selected responsive to the additional requests of the thread.
