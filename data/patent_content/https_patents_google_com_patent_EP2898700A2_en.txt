Abstract
Features of various implementations are used to enable identifying and presenting, in real time, Internet-accessible and/or Internet-based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program concurrently playing on a television or display, as a part of an interactive television suite of technologies. In some implementations, the process of identifying Internet-accessible and/or Internet-based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program is enabled to reduce communication between a primary set-top box and a supplemental set-top box and/or television integrated device, thereby reducing the need for one or more provider specific APIs. For example, one aspect of the disclosure is a computer-implemented method of identifying a media program by capturing display data from the media program, and extracting text from the display data in response to determining that the display data includes the text overlay, wherein the extracted text is associated with the media program.
Description
Identification and Presentation of Internet- Accessible Content Associated with Currently Playing Television Programs
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The disclosed implementations relate to systems, methods and devices configured to collect and present Internet-accessible content associated with playing television programs.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Interactive television technologies generally enable adding Internet-accessible functionality, content and/or services as an overlay to the television signals provided by cable and satellite television providers. For example, one of the aims of interactive television technologies is to deliver Internet-accessible functionality, content and/or services to an individual consumer that are matched to a particular television program the consumer is currently watching. To that end, interactive television technologies often need to determine what each consumer is watching in order to deliver matched functionality, content and/or services.
[0003] According to previously developed systems and methods, a second device, such as a supplemental set-top box, is configured to work with the primary set-top box provided by the cable or satellite television provider. In order to determine what a consumer is watching, the supplemental set-top box sends a query to the primary set-top box requesting information about the currently playing television program selected by the consumer (e.g. the title, names of actors or characters, electronic program guide information, etc.). In order to send such a query or otherwise communicate with the primary set-top box, the supplemental set-top box usually includes one or more provider-specific application program interfaces (APIs) that enable the supplemental set-top box to be paired with a wide variety of primary set-top boxes from various cable and satellite television providers. The development of each API requires the input and cooperation of a respective cable or satellite television provider that provides a primary set-top box to consumers. Developing the APIs with various providers tends to be inefficient, and hinders scaling such technologies across a wide variety of provider-specific platforms.

[0040] In accordance with common practice the various features illustrated in the drawings may not be drawn to scale. Accordingly, the dimensions of the various features may be arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity. In addition, the drawings may not depict all of the components of a given system, method or device; because, known methods, components, and circuits have not been described in exhaustive detail for the sake of brevity.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0041] The various implementations described herein include systems, methods and/or devices that are enabled to identify and present, in real time, Internet-accessible and/or Internet-based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program concurrently playing on a television or display, as a part of an interactive television suite of technologies. In some implementations, the process of identifying associated content is enabled to reduce communication between the primary set-top box and a supplemental set- top box and/or television-integrated device, thereby reducing the need for one or more provider specific APIs. For example, one aspect of the disclosure is a method of identifying and presenting content associated with a media program by capturing display data associated with the media program, extracting text from the display data in response to determining that the display data includes a text overlay, wherein the extracted text is associated with the media program, performing an Internet search based on at least some of the extracted text, and displaying the search results.
[0042] Numerous details are described herein in order to provide a thorough understanding of the example implementations illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
However, the invention may be practiced without these specific details. Well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in exhaustive detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure more pertinent aspects of the example implementations.
[0043] Figure 1A is a diagram of an implementation of a client-server environment
100. While certain specific features are illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the implementations disclosed herein. To that end, the client-server environment 100 includes a set-top box 103, a television (TV) 110, a client device 102 (e.g., a supplemental set-top box), a second screen client device 120 (e.g. a laptop, a tablet computer, smartphone, etc.), a remote control device 112, a communication network 104, a media server 130, a broadcast system 140, and a content provider 150. The second screen client device 120, the client device 102, the media server 130, the broadcast system 140, and the content provider 150 are capable of being connected to the communication network 104 in order to exchange information with one another and/or other devices and systems. The client-server environment 100 is merely an example provided to discuss more pertinent features of the present disclosure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that any number of such devices and/or systems may be provided in a client-server environment, and particular devices may be altogether absent.
[0044] In some implementations, the media server 130 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely for convenience of explanation, the media server 130 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Similarly, in some implementations, the broadcast system 140 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely, for convenience of explanation, the broadcast system 140 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Similarly, in some implementations, the content provider 150 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely, for convenience of explanation, the content provider 150 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Moreover, the functionality of the broadcast system 140 and the content provider 150 can be combined into a single server system. Additionally and/or alternatively, while only one broadcast system and only one content provider are illustrated in Figure 1A for the sake of brevity, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that fewer or more of each may be present in an implementation of a client-server environment.
[0045] In some implementations, the second screen client device 120 (e.g. a tablet computer or laptop, etc.), the set-top box 103, the TV 110, the client device 102, and a remote control 112 are provided in combination within, for example, a home or commercial setting. The set-top box 103 is configured to receive and decode signals including media content from the broadcast system 140 or the like. In operation, the set-top box 103 decodes the signal received from the broadcast system 140 or the like and provides audio and video content to the TV 110 for display. While a TV has been used in the illustrated example, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that any number of displays devices, including computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, smart-phones and the like, can be used to display a video stream and play the associated audio stream. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations the functions of the set-top box 103 and the TV 110 are combined into a single device.
[0046] In operation, the remote control 112 may be used to control the operation of one or more of the set-top box 103, the TV 110, and the client device 102. In one mode of operation, the client device 102 monitors the display 118 of the TV 110 to determine when a program information overlay is provided (i.e., shown on the display 118). In another mode of operation, the client device 102 emulates the function of the remote control device 112 to prompt the set-top box 103 to display the program information overlay. And in yet another mode of operation, the client device 102 receives IR transmissions from the remote control 112 that are directed to the set-top box 103. In turn, the client device 103 may then communicate with any one of the media monitoring server 130, the broadcast system 140, and the content provider 150 through the communication network 104. More specific details pertaining to how the client device 102 acquires real time program information related to what a particular user is watching is described below with reference to Figures 3-5.
[0047] In some implementations, the set-top box 103 is any computer device capable of connecting to the communication network 104, receiving video streams 160, extracting information from video streams 160 and presenting the video streams 160 for the display using the TV 110 (or another display device). In some implementations, the set-top box 103 is configured as a receiver for cable TV and/or satellite TV, a digital video recorder (DVR), a digital media receiver, a TV tuner, a computer, and/or any other device that outputs TV signals. In some implementations, the TV 110 is a conventional TV display that is not connectable to the Internet and that displays digital and/or analog TV content received via over the air broadcasts or a satellite or cable connection.
[0048] Similarly, in some implementations the client device 102 is any computer device capable of connecting to the communication network 104 and the TV 110. As described below with reference to Figure 5, in some implementations, the client device 102 is capable of receiving infrared (IR) transmissions directed to the set-top box 103 from the remote control device 112. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, the client device 102 is capable of wired and/or wireless communication with the client device 120. In some implementations, the client device 102 includes one or more processors 121, non- volatile memory 122 such as a hard disk drive, and a local database 123. In some implementations, the memory 122 includes application instructions 122a and associated data 122b. As discussed in greater detail below, the processor 121 executes the one or more applications in accordance with a set of instructions received from the media monitoring server 130. The client device 102 may also have input devices such as a keyboard, a mouse and/or track-pad (not shown). In some implementations, the client device 102 includes a touch screen display, a digital camera and/or any number of supplemental devices to add functionality.
[0049] As is typical of televisions, the TV 110 includes a display 118 and speakers
(not illustrated). Additionally and/or alternatively, the TV 110 can be replaced with another type of display device for presenting video content to a user, such as for example, a computer, a tablet device, a mobile telephone, a projector, or other type of video display system. The display device can be coupled to the set-top box 103 via a wireless or wired connection.
[0050] As used herein, a TV signal is an electrical, optical, or other type of data transmitting medium that includes audio and/or video components corresponding to a TV channel or program. In some implementations, the TV signal is a terrestrial over-the-air TV broadcast signal or a sign distributed/broadcast on a cable-system or a satellite system. In some implementations, the TV signal is transmitted as data over a network connection. For example, the set-top box 103 can receive video streams 160 from an Internet connection. Audio and video components of a TV signal are sometimes referred to herein as audio signals and video signals. In some implementations, a TV signal corresponds to a TV channel that is being displayed on the TV 110.
[0051] Figure IB is a diagram of a portion of the client-server environment 100 including an example schematic screen display (i.e., a screenshot) on the TV 110. Again, the
TV 110 includes the display 118 on which video of a media program is displayed. Further, while the video is being displayed, the set-top box 103 may provide a text overlay 119 that includes channel and title information. For example, the text overlay 119 typically includes the channel the media program is being presented on, as well as the title of the media program. The text overlay 119 also often includes information about actors, characters, and/or a synopsis of the media program presented as user readable text.
[0052] With further reference to Figure 1A, the second screen client device 120 may be any computer device that is capable of connecting to the communication network 104, such as a computer, a laptop computer, a tablet device, a netbook, an Internet kiosk, a personal digital assistant, a mobile phone, a gaming device, or any other device that is capable of communicating with the media server 130.
[0053] The communication network 104 may be any combination of wired and wireless local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN), such as an intranet, an extranet, including a portion of the Internet, or a wireless network provided by a wireless carrier. It is sufficient that the communication network 104 provides communication capability between the second screen client device 120 and the media monitoring server 130. In some implementations, the communication network 104 uses the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) to transport information using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). HTTP permits the client device 102 to access various resources available via the communication network 104. However, the various implementations described herein are not limited to the use of any particular protocol.
[0054] In some implementations, the media monitoring server 130 includes a front end server 134 that facilitates communication between the media monitoring server 130 and the communication network 104. The front end server 134 receives content information from the client device 102. As described in greater detail below, in some implementations, the content information includes program information, such as the program title, actor names, character names, plot summaries, etc. In some implementations, the front end server 134 is configured to send a set of instructions to the client device 102. In some implementations, the front end server 134 is configured to send content files, links to content files and/or metadata associated with the content files. The term "content file" includes any document or content of any format including, but not limited to, a video file, an image file, a music file, a web page, an email message, an SMS message, a content feed, an advertisement, a coupon, a
playlist or an XML document. In some implementations, the front end server 134 is configured to send or receive one or more video streams 160. In some implementations, the front end server 134 is configured to receive content directly from the broadcast system 140 and/or the content provider 150 over the communication network 104.
[0055] In some implementations, the media monitoring server 130 includes a content database 133. In some implementations, the content database 136 includes advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents, and ratings associated with various media content or any combination thereof. In some implementations, the content database 136 includes links to advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents and ratings associated with various media content. In some implementations, the content database 133 is a distributed database.
[0056] In some implementations, the broadcast system 140 includes media content such as TV programs. In some implementations, the broadcast system 140 also includes metadata associated with one or more of the TV programs, and application program interface instructions. In some implementations, the application program interface instructions include instructions that can be provided to a client device and/or may be executed by the broadcast system 140 under a client-server model or the like in order to link a particular TV program with the associated metadata and/or link the TV program and the associated metadata 142 with external data and/or services, such as a social networking application. Similarly, in some implementations, the content provider 150 additionally and/or alternatively includes media content such as TV programs, as well as metadata associated with one or more of the TV programs.
[0057] Figure 2 is a diagram of an example implementation of the client device 102, discussed above with reference to Figure 1A, and which may be operable as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television-integrated device. While certain specific features are illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the implementations disclosed herein. To that end, the client device 102 includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 402, one or more network or other communications interfaces 408, memory 406, a TV tuner 432, a video I/O 430, and one or
more communication buses 404, for interconnecting these and various other components. The communication buses 404 optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system components. The client device 102 may also include a user interface 412 comprising a display device 413 and a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 414 and/or a remote control (etc.). Memory 406 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 406 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 402. Memory 406, or alternatively the non-volatile memory device(s) within memory 406, comprises a non- transitory computer readable storage medium. In some implementations, memory 406 or the computer readable storage medium of memory 406 store the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof including operation system 416, network communication module 418, an OCR module 426 and data module 420.
[0058] The operating system 416 includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks.
[0059] The network communication module 418 facilitates communication with other devices via the one or more communication network interfaces 404 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on.
[0060] In some implementations, the OCR module 426 enables the client device 102 to process screen shots (e.g. images from the TV 110) to obtain the program information included in the program information overlay provided by the primary set-top box 103. To that end, the OCR module 426 includes OCR instructions 324 and metadata 325.
[0061] In some implementations, the data module 420 includes OCR data 161 and a local database 123 of program information. In some implementations, the program information is received from a broadcast system and/or content provider. In some implementations, the OCR data 161 includes text segments 161-1, images 161-2 and user ID information 161-3.
[0062] Each of the above identified elements may be stored in one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices, and each of the modules or programs corresponds to
a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The set of instructions can be executed by one or more processors (e.g., the CPUs 402). The above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various implementations. In some implementations, memory 406 stores a subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 406 may store additional modules and data structures not described above.
[0063] Figure 3 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of a method 300 of determining what a consumer is currently watching. In some implementations, the method is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining what a consumer is currently watching. For example, with reference to Figure 1A, in some implementations, the method 300 is performed by the client device 102 (i.e., the supplemental set-top box). As noted above, when a user changes the channel or requests program information by, for example, using one or more channel selection options or pressing an "INFO" button, the primary set-top box displays an overlay including program information, such as the current channel, the title of the playing program and information about the program. Accordingly, the method includes identifying instances during which the primary set-top box provides the overlay by monitoring the display output provided by the primary set-top box, and parsing the overlay for the desired information. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, the method includes detecting when channel identifiers are displayed without being prompted by user interaction (i.e., a user pressing a button).
[0064] To that end, the method includes performing a screen or display data capture from the display device that is displaying the television program selected by the consumer through a primary set-top box or the like in order acquire an image of what is being displayed
(301). In some implementations, the screen capture data is obtained from the video signal provided by the primary set-top box. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, the screen capture data is obtained from a display (i.e., video) card included in the set-top box and/or the operating system of the set-top box. Additionally and/or alternatively, the screen capture data is obtained from a TV app running on at least one of the primary set-top box, the supplemental set-top box, the TV, and a second screen device.
Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, the supplemental set-top box (or the like) includes a camera operable to capture an image of the display of a television or the
like. The method includes analyzing the image to identify whether the image includes indicators that an overlay is being displayed by the primary set-top box (302). For example, in some implementations, the indicators include the color of the overlay, the percentage of display area the overlay typically covers when visible, the arrangement of text with the overlay, contrast between a portion of the display likely to be displaying the program and another portion of the display likely to be displaying the overlay.
[0065] The method includes determining whether one or more of the indicators are present as indicated by the image analysis (303). If none of the indicators are present for a particular screen capture ("No" path from 303), the method includes waiting a pseudorandom amount of time or a preset delay time (304) before capturing another screen shot or the like. On the other hand, if at least one indicator is present or another threshold number of the indicators is present ("Yes" path from 303), the method includes applying an optical character recognition technique to the image in order to identify and extract the displayed information (305). Having extracted the title and/or program information, the method includes cross-referencing the extracted information with a local and/or remote database to ensure the validity of the information (306). For example, with further reference to Figure 1A, the client device 102 may communicate with the media server 130 in order to check the validity of the extracted display information. More specifically, the client device 102 may transmit all or a portion of the extracted information to the media server 130. In turn, the media server 130 may then check the extracted information against a content database (e.g., the content database 133, Fig. 1) to ensure that the extracted data is correct and/or provide corrected information to the client device 102 when the extracted data is incorrect but can be matched to database information.
[0066] Figure 4 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of a method 400 of determining what a consumer is currently watching. In some implementations, the method is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining what a consumer is currently watching by, in part, emulating the operation of a remote control device associated with the primary set-top box. To that end, the method includes transmitting a first infrared (IR) code (or the like) to the primary set-top box in order to initiate the display of the program information overlay (401). For example, with further reference to Figure 1A, one of the client device 102 and the client device 120 may transmit an IR code to the set-top box 103.
[0067] The method then includes performing a screen capture to acquire a screen shot
(i.e. image) including the program information overlay (402). Having acquired the screen shot, the method includes transmitting a second IR code (or the like) to the primary set-top box in order to initiate the removal of the program information overlay on the playing television program (403). The method includes analyzing the image or screen shot to obtain the program information presented in the overlay (404). Having extracted the title and/or program information, the method includes cross-referencing the extracted information with a local and/or remote database 133 to ensure the validity of the information (406).
[0068] Figure 5 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of a method 500 of determining what a consumer is currently watching. In some implementations, the method is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining what a consumer is currently watching, by detecting IR transmission from a remote control device associated with the primary set-top box. For example, with further reference to Figure 1A, the client device 102 may detect IR transmissions directed to the primary set-top box 103 from the remote control device 120.
[0069] To that end, the method includes detecting an IR transmission or equivalent from a remote control device associated with a primary set-top box (501). In turn, the method includes parsing the transmission in order to identify the command that is represented by the IR transmission (502). Having identified the command, the method includes determining whether or not the identified command causes the primary set-top box to provide the program information overlay in the video stream provided to the display device. If the detected command is not likely to cause the primary set-top box to provide the program information overlay ("No" path from 503), the method includes circling back to detect another IR transmission. On the other hand, if the detected command is likely to cause the primary set-top box to provide the program information overlay ("Yes" path from 503), the method includes performing a screen or display data capture from the display device that is displaying the television program selected by the consumer through a primary set-top box or the like in order acquire an image of what is being displayed (504). The method includes analyzing the image or screen shot to obtain the program information presented in the overlay (505). And, the method includes cross-referencing the extracted information with a local and/or remote database to ensure the validity of the information (506).
[0070] Figure 6 is a diagram of an implementation of a client-server environment
600. The client-server environment 600 illustrated in Figure 6 is similar to and adapted from the client-server environment 100 illustrated in Figure 1A. Elements common to each include common reference numbers, and only the differences between Figures 1A and 6 are described herein for the sake of brevity. Moreover, while certain specific features are illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the example implementations disclosed herein.
[0071] To that end, with reference to Figure 6, the client-server environment 600 additionally includes a search server system 170, and a number of third party content server systems 180-1, 180-N. In some implementations, the search server system 170 is implemented as a single system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers and systems. Solely for convenience of explanation, the search server system 170 is described below as being implemented as a single system. Similarly, in some implementations, each of the third party content server systems 180-1... 180-N is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations each of the third party content server systems 180-1, ..., 180-N is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely, for convenience of explanation, each of the third party content server systems 180-1 ... 180-N is described below as being implemented on a respective single server system.
[0072] In some implementations, as described in greater detail below with reference to Figure 9, the client device 102 (e.g. a supplemental set-top box, a television integrated device, etc.) is further configured to identify and present Internet-accessible content associated with a media program by capturing display data associated with the media program presented on the television 110. In some implementations, the client device 102 is configured to receive a display signal from the primary set-top box 103 and pass the display signal to the television or the like. As a result, in such implementations, capturing the display data includes processing the display signal provided by the primary set-top box 103. The client device 102 then extracts text from the captured display data in response to determining that the display data includes a text overlay, wherein the extracted text is associated with the media program.
[0073] Subsequently, the client device 102 performs an Internet search based on at least some of the extracted text by submitting a search query to the search server system 170. In turn, the search server system 170 responds to a received search query by providing information and/or access to information stored on one or more of the third party content server systems 180-1, ..., 180-N, as a set of results to the client device 102. The client device 102 operates to display at least a portion of the search results on at least one of the television 110 and the client device 120 (i.e., a second screen device, such as a tablet computer).
[0074] Figure 7A is a schematic diagram of an example screenshot of a television display 118 of the television 110 that is operating to display an information box 710 in accordance with some implementations. While a television is illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that the systems and methods disclosed herein may be used in combination with any media presentation device. In operation, with reference to Figures 6 and 7A, in some implementations, the client device 102 provides display instructions and display data (i.e., a display signal) to the television 110 in addition to the display signal provided by the primary set-top box 103. The display instructions cause the television 110 to display the information box 710, provided by the display data, as visual overlay obstructing at least a portion of the playing television program 720 presented on the screen 118. The display signal provided by the primary set-top box 103 includes the data for presenting the playing television program 720. In some implementations, the display data provided by the client device 102 includes the optical attributes of the information box 710, including, for example, the relative size, shape and color of the information box 710. In some implementations, the display data also includes search results associated with a playing television program 720 obtained by the process briefly described above. For example, as shown in Figure 7A, the information box 710 includes a first indicator of search results 710-1 associated with a first search term and a first number of selectable hyperlinks 711-1. More generally, the information box 710 includes a number of search result indicators up to and including an N* indicator of search results 710-N associated with an N* search term and a N* number of selectable hyperlinks 71 1-N. In some implementations, each indicator of search results is associated with at least one of search results from a general Internet search, a targeted search for associated news items, a targeted search for associated images, a targeted search for associated Internet-accessible media content (e.g. videos, music, etc.), and a targeted search for associated social media content.
[0075] Figure 7B is a schematic diagram of example screenshots of the television display 118 and the second screen client device 120 in accordance with some implementations. In contrast to the example illustrated in Figure 7A, an information box 730, providing search results associated with the playing television program 720, is displayed on the screen 125 of the second screen client device 120. In operation, with reference to both Figures 6 and 7B, in some implementations, the client device 102 provides display instructions and display data (i.e., a display signal) to second screen client device 120. The display instructions cause the second screen client device 120 to display the information box 730, provided by the display data, as visual overlay obstructing at least a portion of the screen 125. In some implementations, the display data includes the optical attributes of the information box 730, including, for example, the relative size, shape and color of the information box 730. In some implementations, the information box 730 is presented in combination with another application (or program) window 750, and/or another portion of the display screen includes other display area 740 that does not include a window or the like. In some implementations, the display data also includes search results associated with a playing television program 720 obtained by the process briefly described above. For example, as shown in Figure 7B, the information box 730 includes a first indicator of search results 730-1 associated with a first search term and a first number of selectable hyperlinks 731-1. More generally, the information box 730 includes a number of search result indicators up to and including an N* indicator of search results 730-N associated with an N* search term and a N* number of selectable hyperlinks 731-N. As noted above, in some implementations, each indicator of search results is associated with at least one of search results from a general Internet search, a targeted search for associated news items, a targeted search for associated images, a targeted search for associated Internet-accessible media content (e.g. videos, music, etc.), and a targeted search for associated social media content.
[0076] Figure 8 is a diagram of an example implementation of a client device 102-1 operable as at least one of a supplemental set-top box, a television-integrated device, and/or second screen client device in accordance with some implementations. Client device 102-1 illustrated in Figure 8 is similar to and adapted from the client device 102 illustrated in Figure 2. Elements common to each include common reference numbers, and only the differences between Figures 2 and 8 are described herein for the sake of brevity. Moreover, while certain specific features are illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present
disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the example implementations disclosed herein.
[0077] To that end, with reference to Figure 8, in some implementations, the memory
406 of the client device 102-1 additionally includes a text evaluation module 810, an associated content search module 820 and a display module 830. Additionally, the data module 420 included in the memory 406 further includes text evaluation results 841, a server provided associated content heuristics cache 842, a search results cache 843, and a display data cache 844.
[0078] As described above, in some implementations, the OCR module 426 enables the client device 102-1 to process screen shots (e.g. images from the TV 110) to obtain the program information included in the program information overlay provided by the primary set-top box 103. To that end, the OCR module 426 includes OCR instructions 324 and metadata 325.
[0079] In some implementations, the text evaluation module 810 enables the client device 102-1 to identify terms pertinent to the television program from the program information obtained by the OCR module 426. To that end, the text evaluation module 810 includes text evaluation instructions 811 and associated metadata 812. The text evaluation instructions 811 are described in greater detail below with reference to Figure 10. In some implementations, the results of the execution of the text evaluation instructions 811 results in data that is stored in the data evaluation module 420 as text evaluation results 841. In some implementations, the text evaluation results 841 , which are separate from the text evaluation metadata 812, include one or more text strings associated with television programs that are frequently selected by the user. In some implementations, as described below with reference to Figure 9, the text strings are refined using at least one of data stored in the server provided associated content heuristics cache 842 and the search results cache 843. In some implementations, the server provided associated content heuristics cache 842 includes heuristics provided by a search server system 170 and/or media server 130 that are associated with one or more television programs. In some implementations, the heuristics include data that has been collected from prior searches submitted by a multitude of other users and/or by the content providers to enable users to more efficiently find Internet-accessible and/or Internet-based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program concurrently playing on a television or display. In some implementations, the
search results cache 843 includes data from prior search queries submitted from the client device 102-1. In some implementations, the data from prior search queries is sorted based on which queries spurred the most interest from the one or more users associated with the client device 102-1, in terms of, for example, following hyperlinks provided in search results from a particular search query.
[0080] In some implementations, the associated content search module 820 enables the client device 102-1 to perform searches for Internet-accessible and/or Internet-based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program concurrently playing on a television or display. In order to perform a search, the associated content search module 820 produces one or more search queries from the one or more pertinent terms identified by the text evaluation module 810, and the one or more search queries are transmitted to a search server system (e.g. search server system 170). To these ends, the associated content search module 820 includes associated content search instructions 821 and corresponding metadata 822. In some implementations, as described below with reference to Figure 9, the one or more search queries are refined using at least one of data stored in the server provided associated content heuristics cache 842 and the search results cache 843.
[0081] In some implementations, the display module 830 operates to provide display instructions and display data to a television or the like. To that end, the display module 830 includes display instructions 831 and corresponding metadata 832. In some implementations, the display instructions 831 and metadata 832 includes the relative size, shape and color of the information box used to display the search results, user preferences, and instructions directing the display on at least one of a television and second screen device. Moreover, in some implementations, the display data cache 844 is used to store images and other data frequently downloaded by the client device 102-1.
[0082] Figure 9 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of a method 900 of identifying and presenting Internet-accessible content associated with a currently playing television program. In some implementations, the method 900 is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining what a consumer is currently watching. For example, with reference to Figures 6 and 8, in some implementations, the method 900 is performed by the client device 102-1 (e.g., a supplemental set-top box). Briefly, the method 900 includes receiving a request for a
content search associated with the currently playing television program, signaling a primary set-top box to display program data, extracting text from displayed program data, performing an Internet search based on at least some of the extracted text, and displaying the search results.
[0083] To that end, the method 900 includes receiving user input data indicative of a user input of a request from associated content (901). For example, with continued reference to Figure 6, the client device 102-1 receives a request for an associated content search from a user operating the remote control 112 and/or the second screen device 120. In accordance with some implementations, the user selects or presses an "INFO" button (or the like) on the remote control 112 or on an application interface displayed on the second screen device 120. The remote control 112 or the second screen device 120 then transmits a data signal indicative of the request for an associated content search to client device 102-1, in response to receiving the user input.
[0084] The method 900 then includes transmitting a first infrared (IR) code (or the like) to the primary set-top box in order to initiate the display of the program information overlay (902). For example, with further reference to Figure 6, one of the client devices 102- 1 and the client device 120 may transmit an IR code to the primary set-top box 103. The method 900 then includes performing a screen capture to acquire a screen shot (i.e., image data) including the program information overlay (903). The method then optionally includes transmitting a second IR code (or the like) to the primary set-top box in order to initiate the removal of the program information overlay on the playing television program (904). In some implementations, the second IR code (or the like) is not transmitted and the overlay is allowed to remain on-screen until the primary set-top box is operates to remove it based on the configuration of the primary set-top box. The method 900 includes performing optical character recognition on the captured screen shot to obtain the program information text presented in the overlay (905). Having extracted the program information text, the method 900 includes analyzing the program information text to generate one or more search queries with pertinent search terms derived from the program information text (906). An example of an implementation of a method of text analysis resulting in one or more pertinent search queries is described below with reference to Figure 10.
[0085] The method 900 optionally includes refining the search queries using search heuristics and/or user preferences. For example, as described above, with further reference to
Figures 6 and 8, in some implementations, the method 900 includes refining the one or more search queries using at least one of data stored in the server provided associated content heuristics cache 842 and the search results cache 843. In some implementations, the server provided associated content heuristics cache 842 includes heuristics provided by a search server system and/or media server that are associated with one or more television programs. In some implementations, the heuristics include data that has been collected from prior searches submitted by a multitude of other users and/or by the content providers to enable users to more efficiently find Internet-accessible and/or Internet-based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program concurrently playing on a television or display. In some implementations, a search results cache includes data from prior search queries submitted from the client device. In some implementations, the data from prior search queries is sorted based on which queries spurred the most interest from the one or more users associated with the client device, in terms of, for example, following hyperlinks provided in search results from a particular search query.
[0086] The method 900 includes performing the search, with the one or more search queries or the refined one or more search queries, for Internet-accessible and/or Internet- based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program concurrently playing on a television or display (908). The example described with reference to Figure 10 more specific details regarding how search results can be sorted, scored and presented so that the more pertinent search results are presented at or near the top of the displayed search results. The method 900 includes displaying the search results on the television and/or a second screen client device (909).
[0087] Figure 10 is a flowchart representation of an implementation of a method 1000 of identifying and presenting Internet-accessible content associated with a currently playing television program. In particular, the method 1000 is an example implementation of a method of text analysis resulting in one or more pertinent search queries. In some implementations, the method 1000 is performed by a device, such as a supplemental set-top box and/or a television integrated module, in order to enable determining what a consumer is currently watching. For example, with reference to Figures 6 and 8, in some implementations, the method 1000 is performed by the client device 102-1 (e.g., the supplemental set-top box). Briefly, the method 1000 parsing text included in display program data in order to identify pertinent search terms associated with a currently playing television program.
[0088] To that end, method 1000 includes identifying one or more descriptive phrases in the program information text obtained by applying an OCR process to the captured screen shot (1001). In some implementations, one or more descriptive phrases are identified by extracting program showing data from the program information text. In some implementations, program showing data includes information associated with the showing (i.e., airing) of a television program, such as for example, show time, show duration, station or channel name, parenthetical references, boilerplate data, etc. For example, using the program information text "The Price Is Right 10:00 AM - 11 :00 AM TV-G Contestants bid for prizes then compete for fabulous showcases," performance of the method 1000 extracts "10:00 AM - 11 :00 AM" as a time phrase and "TV-G" as a common phrase. And the indentified descriptive phrases would include "The Price is Right" and "Contestants bid for prizes then compete for fabulous showcases."
[0089] The method 1000 includes identifying noun phrases from the identified descriptive phrases (1002). In some implementations, the process of identifying noun phrases includes comparing segments of the identified descriptive phrases to known names of television shows, movies, sporting events, as well as known actors and actresses (i.e., known proper names). Additionally and/or alternatively, in some implementations, a natural language processing toolkit is used to identify noun phrases. Continuing the example above, continued performance of the method 1000 identifies "The Price is Right", "contestants", "prizes", and "fabulous showcases" as noun phrases.
[0090] The method 1000 includes identifying a threshold number of the identified noun phrases as keyword phrases for searching (1003). For example, in some implementations the first m (e.g., m = 5) noun phrases are identified as keyword phrases for searching. Optionally, the method 1000 includes refining the keyword phrases to enable more precise and/or accurate searching (1004). For example, in some implementations, the keyword phrases are checked for typographical errors that could have been introduced by the OCR process. In another example, in some implementations, the keywords are cross- referenced against known names of television shows, movies, sporting events, as well as known actors and actresses. In yet another example, in some implementations and with reference to Figures 6 and 8, the keyword phrases are cross-referenced against at least one of data stored in the server provided associated content heuristics cache 842 and the search results cache 843. In some implementations, the server provided associated content heuristics cache 842 includes heuristics provided by a search server system and/or media server that are
associated with one or more television programs. In some implementations, the heuristics include data that has been collected from prior searches submitted by a multitude of other users and/or by the content providers to enable users to more efficiently find Internet- accessible and/or Internet-based functionality, content and/or services associated with a particular television program concurrently playing on a television or display. In some implementations, a search results cache includes data from prior search queries submitted from the client device. In some implementations, the data from prior search queries is sorted based on which queries spurred the most interest from the one or more users associated with the client device, in terms of, for example, following hyperlinks provided in search results from a particular search query.
[0091] The method 1000 includes performing an Internet search using the refined keyword phrases to obtain search results for each (1005). The method 1000 includes categorizing the search results for each keyword phrase (1006). For example, in some implementations, the search results for each keyword phrase are categorized according to a particular search result being a web page, a news story, an image, and/or a social media service link. Subsequently, the method 1000 includes assigning a query rank or score to the top X search results for each category and/or keyword phrase (1007). In some implementations, the query rank or score incorporates at least one of user location data, search history and preferences. The method 1000 then includes assigning a proximity score to each keyword phrase based on the order the keyword phrases appear the program information text (1008). In turn, the method 1000 includes multiplying each query score by a corresponding proximity score to produce a relevance score for each search result associated with a particular keyword score (1009). The method 1000 includes sorting the search results based at least on the relevance scores and displaying the search results based at least on the relevance scores (1010). In some implementations, the search results are presented based on a combination of the categories and the relevance scores. In some implementations, the search results are presented based on a combination of the keyword phrases and the relevance scores. In some implementations, the search results are presented based on a combination of the keyword phrases, the categories and the relevance scores.
