h, AU
j, AU
k.For each TQ, synonym and/or variant can be provided.In some implementations, synonym and variant can be received from database.In some instances, specific T Q can be provided as the index to database, and database can return one or more synonym for TQ and/or one or more variant.For example, TQ can comprise " science friction (science fiction) " and receive synonym and/or variant can comprise " scifi ", " sci fi ", " sci-fi ", " science " and " friction ".
For each AU and TQ to (AU
p, TQ
n), process and AU (AU
p) the text sections that associates to be to provide extracts sections.In some instances, taking passages sections is be confirmed as the text sections relevant to specific T Q.In some instances, if generate extracts sections from each text sections by the part of at least one of any one existence comprised original TQ, synonym and/or variant selecting text sections.In this way, the text sections associated with each AU can be looked back to identify the text sections that can be provided as the extracts sections for specific T Q according to TQ, synonym and/or variant.
In some instances, the words of indicia matched TQ, synonym and/or variant between runic label (such as, HTML).Such as, TQ can comprise " sci fi " and (such as, from the individual biography profile merogenesis of the profile of AU) can provide text sections:
Futurist,Science Fiction Author,Scientist.I promote sci fi moviesthat discuss the future of humanity when Earth resources are depleted andhumans have to travel to other planets and solar systems to survive.Thisfuture is not very far from present.
Thus, example takes passages sections can comprise " Futurist, <b>Science</bGre atT.GreaT.GT<b>FictionLEssT.L TssT.LT/b>Author, Scientist.I promote<b>sci</b ><b>fiLEssT.LTs sT.LT/b>movies that discuss the future of humanity ... "
For each AU

p, TQ
nright extracts.In some instances, the extracts sections number of being omitted added is separated.
In some implementations, can initially based on provide from profile data and comprise original TQ extracts sections generate take passages.In some instances, if the extracts generated based on profile data and original TQ is confirmed as insufficient (such as, too short), then can also based on provide from project data and the extracts sections comprising original TQ generate and take passages.In some instances, if the extracts generated based on project data and original TQ be confirmed as insufficient (such as, too short), then can also based on provide from profile data and/or project data and the extracts sections comprising the synonym of original TQ and/or variant generate and take passages.In some instances, if the extracts generated based on profile data and/or project data and synonym and/or variant be confirmed as insufficient (such as, too short), then can also take passages based on generating from the extracts sections coming from profile data and/or project data.In some instances, if the extracts generated based on profile data and/or project data be confirmed as insufficient (such as, too short), then can also smear (smearing) routine based on the following concrete extracts discussed further and generate extracts.
In some implementations, extracts can comprise and initially takes passages sections.In some instances, from profile data seek and can subsequently from project data and finally from take passages as discussed above smear seek initially to take passages sections.
In some instances, can from come from profile data and the extracts sections comprising original TQ select initially to take passages sections.In some instances, can select initially to take passages sections based on coming from higher seniority among brothers and sisters profile merogenesis.Such as, the first extracts sections and the second extracts sections can comprise original TQ separately.Can determine that the first extracts sections comes from professional profile merogenesis and second takes passages sections and come from and employ profile merogenesis.Such as, because professional profile merogenesis is ranked higher than employing profile merogenesis, so the first extracts sections is provided as initially taking passages sections.
When generating extracts, additional extracts sections can be added to initial extracts sections, and adding more extracts sections until extracts is confirmed as fully.In some instances, the adequacy taken passages can be determined based on the number of characters provided in the excerpt.In some instances, the number of characters that can provide more in the excerpt and thresholding number of characters.If number of characters exceedes thresholding number of characters, then take passages and can be confirmed as fully.If number of characters does not exceed thresholding number of characters, then extracts can be confirmed as insufficient.
In some implementations, whenever will add take passages sections time, can build extracts and by additional extracts sections between calculate likeness coefficient.In some instances, likeness coefficient can be determined to be in take passages and by add extracts sections between editing distance.In some instances, according to likeness coefficient value, take passages whether comprised original TQ, whether additional extracts sections comprised original TQ, the words provided in the excerpt and make one of multiple judgement taking passages the wording provided in sections.Example decision reduces the redundancy in excerpt and comprises: do not add and take passages sections, replace current extracts with extracts sections, remove the extracts sections that previously adds and add and take passages sections or add extracts sections.
Such as, if taken passages similar with taking passages sections (such as, editing distance is below thresholding editing distance) to by indicating to the similarity scores taken passages between additional extracts sections at extracts, then can determine can not add to extracts and take passages sections.As another example, if taking passages sections and taking passages indicating to the similarity scores taken passages between additional extracts sections and take passages sections dissmilarity (such as, editing distance is more than thresholding editing distance), then can determine to take passages sections by adding to extracts.As another example, if determine that the extracts sections previously added does not comprise original TQ and additional extracts sections is comprised original TQ, then can remove previously additional extracts sections and the extracts sections comprising original TQ can be added.
In some instances, can determine that the extracts that generated by additional extracts sections still insufficient (such as, too short).Thus, extracts can be implemented smear to make great efforts to provide abundant extracts.In some instances, extracts is smeared to comprise and is determined whether as AU (such as, being another TQ) provides one or more other extracts.If for AU provides another to take passages, then can look back this another take passages with determine this extracts whether with can associate with the TQ of object TQ synonym.If this another take passages with can associate with the TQ of object TQ synonym, then the extracts being used for object TQ can be provided as another extracts.In this way, but identical extracts can be provided for the TQ of the different synonym of AU.
Non-NULL is taken passages and to be stored and with object AU, TQ to associating.Such as, take passages and can be stored in the AU database 125 of Fig. 1 and can be provided to for display in response to reception TQ as discussed here.
Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3 B depicts the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure 300 that can perform in the implementation of present disclosure.In some implementations, instantiation procedure 300 can comprise and uses one or more data processing equipment and operation that one or more computer program of performing performs.Instantiation procedure 300 can be performed take passages for display to provide.
