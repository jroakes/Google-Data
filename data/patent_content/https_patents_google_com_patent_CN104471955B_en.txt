Content delivery describes the media " content " such as audio or video or computer software and game in delivering media (example
As broadcast or internet) on delivering.Content delivery generally has two parts：For the content of completion of numeral distribution and its
The delivering of subsidiary metadata；And final products are to the delivering of end user.
As used herein, " stream media " is that media are using adaptive bit speed by transmitting supplier as a stream
Received while (" ABR ") streaming method is delivered by end user and be presented to end user.The title refers to media
Delivering method rather than refer to media itself.Difference is commonly used to the media distributed on communication network, for example, " online ", because
For most of other delivery systems inherently transmit as a stream (for example, radio, TV) or inherently non-stream transmission (for example,
Books, Video Cassette, audio CD).Hereinafter, online Media and it is referred to as " matchmaker using the online stream transmission of ABR methods
Body " and " stream transmission ".
ABR stream transmissions are by the way that overall media stream or media file are resolved into the small file download based on HTTP
Sequence and the technology worked, each download loading it is overall may unbounded transport Stream or media basic flow a short segmentation.
When playing stream, client (for example, media player) can be from several containing identical material encoded with a variety of data rates
Alternately stream is selected difference, so as to allow stream transmission session to be adapted to available data rate.In opening for stream transmission session
Begin, player downloads contain the inventory of the metadata of available various subflows.Because standard HTTP transaction is used only in its request, because
This ABR stream transmissions can cross fire wall or proxy server that allowance standard HTTP business passes through, and this is different from being based on UDP
Agreement, such as Real-time Transport Protocol.This also allows for any given stream easily implementation content delivering network.With comprising

Fig. 3 A describe the stream video system 300 according to some embodiments.Stream video system 300 is comprising interior
Hold server 305, network 315, one group of media apparatus 320 and code converter element 322.Content server 305 can be via network 315
By video content or video flowing aggregate transmission to media apparatus 320.Video flowing set can be directed to media program, such as film, electricity
Depending on program etc..Each video flowing in video flowing set can be short video segmentation (for example, two seconds, ten seconds etc.).Video adfluxion
Conjunction can include the thousands of video streams of media program (films of such as two hours).As used herein, can be by such as video
The encoded content such as conveying or basic flow is divided into some fixed duration segmentations (for example, chunk).The segmentation or chunk
Duration generally between 2 seconds and 10 seconds, but it can be longer or shorter.In certain embodiments, shorter segmentation reduction
Decoding efficiency, and larger segmentation influence is adapted to the speed of the change of network throughput.In certain embodiments, video and audio
Transport Stream is made up of the 188 byte bull ladles for being grouped together into HLS chunks or segmentation.However, for the smooth streamings of Microsoft HTTP
Transmission, video and audio stream be grouped into independent data block, be blocked into file fragment and with MP4 or ISO-MBFF " frame " or
" atom " indexes to point out how to find the sample in these containers to player (through coded video and audio frame).
Video flowing set can be provided to content server 305 from code converter element 322.If code converter element 322 is included
Dry code converter resource 323, each of which code converter resource, which is provided, has unique code parameter (for example, bit rate, resolution ratio
Deng) video flowing set.Network 315 can include internet, various Intranets etc..Network 315 can include wire link and wireless
Link.It will be understood that, " media " and the various of " video " are referred to comprising both video content and audio content herein.
Content server 305 includes one group of processor 305a and non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (memory)
305b.Memory 305b can store instruction, described group of processor 305a can perform it is described instruction it is described herein to implement
Various embodiments.Content server 305 includes several computer installations of shared domain.Content server 305 is also comprising reference
The scheduling module 305c that Fig. 3 B are described in further detail.
With reference now to Fig. 3 B, the exemplary schedule window 310 provided by scheduling module 305c is shown.It is desirable that
The maximization network of content server 305 utilizes and maintains suitable video quality across the Media Stream for being sent to media apparatus 320
Grade.Content server 305 can partly realize this target by using scheduling module 305c.Scheduling module
305c can be based on it from one or more code converters communicated with content server 305, content management service, content delivery server
Or media apparatus receive, determine or assume one or more factors and construct and implement schedule window 310.In some embodiments
In, it is in correspond to the need through time-varying code video (it may be from upstream code converter or content server) that scheduling module 305c, which is used,
The metadata and the information such as the subscription parameters of client of the form of vector are asked (for example, for the clothes of streaming services
Business Level Agreements, for example, whether client is SD or HD services or golden/silver/copper payment etc., it may be from operator
The control directory services or redemption manager of management), the client device information (screen directly reported from client media device
Size, A/V decoder capabilities) etc..
As demonstrated, schedule window 310 includes multiple client or the indivedual schedules 320 of media apparatus.Citing comes
Say, schedule 320a is assigned to client #1, assign schedule 320b to client #2, and schedule is assigned to client #N
Arrange 320n.In each indivedual schedules 320 is the order of the segmentation to be delivered to client.For example, client
Hold #1 displayings will be in schedule window period of time TSWInterior delivering segmentation chunk S1+ 1, chunk S1+ 2, chunk S1+ 3 ..., chunk
S1+K1。
As, it is known that it is the necessary component to adapt to network jitter that media apparatus, which receives buffer,.In other words, it can be based on
Buffer fullness and the temporal constraint for relaxing the arrival to media apparatus video data.For example, if media apparatus is at it
There is the video data segment of T amounts, then before media apparatus uses up media data or underflow in buffer, next video point
The arrival of section can be delayed by (T-Tchunk) second.In certain embodiments, player has the media presentation of T seconds in its buffer
Data.If it does not download any new data in next T seconds, then when expiring within T seconds, the buffer of player is by under
Overflow, and it will stop playing audio and video.In certain embodiments, player must download length as Tchunk using a speed
The new segmentation of second, the speed is necessarily equal to decode and reproduces the Mean Speed of video, prolongs thereby using T seconds buffers to absorb
Late.
Do not influence in the case of media apparatus Consumer's Experience to relax to dividing in addition, media apparatus receives buffer and is additionally provided in
The chance for the temporal constraint that section or chunk are downloaded.Therefore, schedule chunk and determine it by schedule window (such as day
Journey arranges window 310) solution in time cycle for defining for the bit rate of each client is desirable.In schedule peace
Arrange under window model, can statistics multiplexing described below：It is assumed that be referred to as with window size TSW schedule window it is predefined when
Between the cycle and play N number of clients of different HLS programs, determine the optimal rate of every HLS clients, it is maximized to network
The utilization of bandwidth maintains good video quality for each client simultaneously.
As indicated in figure 3b, be media apparatus selection different rates and number segmentation the problem of be changed into schedule and ask
Topic.It is being defined as TSWTime cycle in, be media apparatus i schedules KiNumber chunk.KiDepending on media apparatus shape
The value of state and the size of media apparatus buffer subtracts the full scale of media apparatus buffer, for example, available buffer or (TMAX-
Tbuffer).In order to which to select optimal bit rate through schedule chunk, content server 305 is based on the network bandwidth and determines to prop up
Which oeverall quality grade Q held.
HLS client models can be used to determine media device status and available buffer.
Be not intended to by any particular theory constrain in the case of, it has been found that the behavior of HLS clients can through characterize and therefore
To be predictable.For example, when client commences play out stored HLS programs, it is first with specified UR1 from HLS
Server is read inventory file (play list file), the content for dissecting the file and is started with the chunk of minimum sequence number and opened
Begin sequentially request HLS chunks (as described with reference to figure 2).In the whole playback of HLS programs, it was observed that two playback phases
And it is defined as buffer stage and playback phase.Fig. 4 is the exemplary chart 400 for showing following two stages：Buffer stage
410 and playback phase 420.When client starts, it will be in buffer stage 410, and wherein HLS client buffers are sky
, and its will attempt by downloading previous chunk in its completion after demand staging or chunk fill up its HLS client immediately
Buffer.When client fills up its HLS client buffer, it is moved in playback phase 420.In this stage, client
End will extract a HLS chunk during the chunk duration.In other words, it is overall to download chunk speed and its real-time playback speed
Degree matching.
In order to predict client behavior and learn its state, content server 305 is directed to each client or media apparatus
Build the HCM based on state.It is the information in buffer stage or playback phase that HCM, which is provided on client,.HCM is also carried
For the means for the full scale grade for estimating HLS client buffers.Fig. 5 illustrates exemplary HCM block diagrams 500.
HCM block diagrams 500 include player status 510.Player status 510 provides HCM current state, for example, play,
Search, suspend, restart.The also media time 520 included in together with player status 510.Media time 520 is to work as
The preceding media timestamp for playing media frame.
HCM block diagrams 500 also include buffer fullness 530, buffer sizes 540 and current request chunk 550.Buffer full
Degree 530 is the number for the chunk for downloading in HLS client buffers and not yet being consumed by media apparatus.Buffer sizes 540
It is the total size of HLS client buffers, and current request chunk 550 is the sequence number of the chunk of HLS client current requests.
With reference now to Fig. 4 and 5, described herein for construction HCM several variables.For example, TstartIndicate client
End completes to download the first media chunk and commences play out the system time of video.TcurrentIndicate client request current request group
The system time of block 550.Tstart_ptsRepresent the presentation time stamp (" PTS ") of the first frame of video in the first media chunk.
Tcurrent_ptsRepresent the PTS of the first frame of video in current request chunk 550.
Buffer fullness 530 subtracts the discharge of buffer (when actually passing by the filling (with respect to time elapse) of buffer
Between) represent.For example, T is madebufferRepresent with the client buffer full scale 530 of time measure.Stream transmission can be arrived HCM
The video data T with time measure (second)fillingIt is written as：
Tfilling=Tcurrent_pts-Tstart_pts(equation 1)
The video data T with time measure (second) that will can be consumed simultaneously by HCMdrainingIt is written as：
Tdraining=Tcurrent-Tstart(equation 2)
T can be then calculated as belowbuffer：
Tbuffer=Tfilling-Tdraining=(Tcurrent_pts-Tstart_pts)-(Tcurrent-Tstart) (equation 3)
Make TMAXThe size of HLS client buffer sizes 540 is represented, if then Tbuffer＜ TMAX-Tchunk, then HLS visitors
Family end is in buffer stage, and otherwise it is operated in the normal playback stage.
As explained above with reference to Fig. 3, in order to for selecting optimal bit rate, content server through schedule chunk
305 determine which oeverall quality grade Q will be supported based on the network bandwidth.In order to realize credit rating Q, warp knit code bit can be based on
The NPV of speed and calculate institute's bit. rate.
NPV is the number for including video complexity (" VC "), device profile, service priority grade, codec profiles etc.
The synthesis of the individual factor.VC be as the estimation of the complexity level to video content derived from video content.It is assumed that one
NPV, content server 305, which is calculated, obtains which kind of bit rate is target quality level need.This information can be by for constant-quality
A series of curves (such as demonstrated in Figure 6) offer of the bit rate to NPV.Device profile can comprising screen size, supported
Codec profiles (for example, MPEG2 and AVC for video or Dolby AC-3 or AAC for audio), software/hardware/
Firmware version, os release, player application version etc..Service priority grade can include institute in such as service level agreement
Comprising the parameter such as parameter, the guaranteed bandwidth for example supported or to associated with higher and lower cost booking service respectively
Access of the high definition video to single-definition.
Can the content complexity based on each segmentation and calculate NPV, its mean speed is given to NPV curved needle to any
It is linear to determine credit rating.This means if program A NPV is twice of program B NPV, then it is by with program B's
Twice of bit rate obtains program A to maintain similar video quality.
NPV (in units of byte per second) that can be based on warp knit code bit rate and calculate institute's bit. rate, such as below equation
It is middle to be shown：
Byterate (NPV)=α × NPV (equation 4)
Wherein α represents the credit rating of Encoded video and for scalar, and when through normalization its in 0 to 1 scope.
Higher α indicates higher video quality.For single client in K chunk total schedule budget (using byte as
Unit) be then
(equation 5)
For any given budget, content server 305 can determine that the α of single client, it is thus determined that in given budget
Under achievable video quality.Next, content server 305 extends the calculating to α in multiple HLS clients.For pin
Suitable quality is maintained to every HLS clients, identical α values may be selected.Therefore, institute is directed to during schedule window (" SW ")
The total byte for having client can be calculated as：
(equation
6)
Wherein N is the number of HLS clients, SiIt is the sequence number of the chunk of last download for client i, and KiIt is pin
To the number of the chunk of HLS client i schedules.For simplicity, it may be assumed that all chunks have the identical duration
Tchunk。
For the channel of fixed rate, total available network bandwidth is defined as " BW " (in units of byte per second).Cause
This, the master budget for all HLS clients is BW × TSW.Therefore, in order to being defined as TSWWindow size SW during
Send SUMbytes, it must is fulfilled for below equation：
SUMbytes≤BW×TSW(equation 7)
By the known NPV values through schedule chunk, α can be calculated as below in content server 305：
(equation 8)
Then
(equation 9)
Although being not intended to be constrained by any particular theory, have found when media apparatus or client are in normal playback rank
When in section, it will only attempt to download TSW/TchunkNumber chunk.However, during its initial pre-buffering stage, it will be attempted
Chunk as much as possible is downloaded until its client buffer is full.In order to determine the chunk during SW for client
Number, it is important to estimate client buffer full scale and calculate the number of the chunk that will be downloaded during SW.In order to estimate visitor
Family end buffer fullness, content server 305 utilizes equation 3.Based on TbufferValue, determine K (for example, treating down according to following formula
The chunk of load through schedule number)：
K=(TSW+β×(TMAX-Tbuffer))/Tchunk(equation 10)
Wherein β is the weight factor of buffer stage.The short period of client buffer is filled up in larger β instructions, therefore
Shorter buffer stage.
By the known NPV values for each client and chunk through schedule number, content server 305 by
Equation 9 determines α and determines to be directed to the achievable optimum quality of all HLS clients.Then, content server 305 is through day
Journey arranges chunk selection closest to α × NPV bit rate.
Fig. 7 is the exemplary block diagram for the system 700 for implementing HCM 710 and schedule queue 720.In some embodiments
In, HCM 710 indicates the corresponding program in program ID 730 (for example, which kind of it just asks perform) and content server 740
745.HCM 710 follows the trail of associated HLS client states 735 (for example, run, search, suspend, restart).HCM 710
Also estimate the buffer time 750 of its associated HLS client.In certain embodiments, the storage of schedule queue 720 comes from
The newest schedule result of schedule window (not showing) is simultaneously maintained to current service chunk number or request chunk number 755
Pointer.
In certain embodiments, client (for example, associated with HCM 710) will be to the request program of content server 305
745.And non-permitted client selection client receives the bit rate of programme content, but the issue of content server 305 supplies client
Hold the single available bit rate (ABR) received.Therefore, in the figure 7, schedule queue 720 indicates that client will be directed to described specific point
Section request only receives the chunk #1 of bit rate #2 streams.When content server 305 determines the different appointments for particular clients,
Schedule queue 720 almost reflects that appointment changes (for example, postponing with very little or without delay) immediately.In some realities
Apply in example, the appointment from content server 305 can change between different segmentations.In certain embodiments, client's termination is changed
This flexibility of the bit rate of receipts can prevent or minimize client by the number of the segmentation buffered again.
Again referring to Fig. 7, in addition to normal playback is operated, HLS clients, which can also carry out, can influence the one of schedule decision-making
A little common operations.For example, HLS clients switch to different video content (for example, channel change).HLS clients can
Pause content simultaneously restarts playback after for a moment.HLS clients can search ad-hoc location and start to receive from new position
See.HLS clients can complete to play back and leave.All these client events indicate the transformation cycle, and it is needed to being assigned to
The modification of the bandwidth of HLS clients.
As used herein, it is the section for being different from its program currently just played in same client request that channel, which changes,
During mesh.Suspend and restart to be when client does not ask any chunk to be downloaded within the time cycle of extension.However, it connects
Chunk of the request with the sequence number after its chunk downloaded before the time cycle of the extension.Search is in client
Rectify request with not in the chunk of the sequence number after the previous chunk of its download.Completion be in client downloads program most
Afterwards during chunk.
In certain embodiments, it can be used in extra refine of the form of Dynamic gene by bandwidth assignments to client.Lift
For example, for some video frequency programs, it may not be provided with satisfactionBit rate dynamic range
Multiple streams.In this case, content server 305 must dispose the feelings for excessing budget or not enough budget bit rate is assigned
Condition.As used herein, excess budget is that can use lowest order much lower velocity (for example, the position of chunk in calculated α × NP ratios
Speed is more than distributes bandwidth for client) when.Similarly, deficiency can use high bit in calculated α × NP ratios at last in advance
During speed much higher (for example, the bit rate of chunk is less than distributes bandwidth for client).
In certain embodiments, content server 305 can remove not enough budget or the client excessed budget from equation 6
End.For example, it is assumed that client P is beyond/deficiency budget, then the budget for client P is calculated as：
(equation 11)
And
(equation
Formula 12)
In certain embodiments, if bit stream is through precoding and storage, then it can exceed or not enough in available bit rate (ABR)
Occur during budget.In this case, code converter can be used to produce the bit stream close to α × NPV.Content server 305 can pass through
Calculate α and using each chunk interval by the carry-out bit speed adjust of code converter as α × NPV with code converter nearly together work
Make.
As mentioned above to supply, the transformation cycle occurs at the end of client is played back close to program.Because working as client
End is played back close to during the end (for example, being less than K whne the number of the available chunk of schedule) of program, may be not present under being used for
Carry to fill enough chunks of schedule window.In this case, equation 13 can be used come between compensating in schedule window
Gap.
In equation 13, M represents the number of the total surplus chunk for download, and K is represented for schedule window
The number of schedule chunk.In this case, M ＜ K.In order to ensure reaching client in time through schedule chunk, for
Equation 5 makes modification.Instead of using the NPV of M chunk sum, content server 305 get off determine as described in and：
(equation 13)
High bit rate assignment is caused it less than T by this to clientSWM ＜ K groups are completed in the schedule window time
The download of block.Client can terminate session at this moment, and this triggering is applied to new with the remaining client of content server communication
Schedule window calculating.
Finally, in certain embodiments, the network bottleneck problem on client may occur.This can be on client-side
Final network (for example, 802.11g/n Wi-Fi home networks) significantly slow and its bandwidth is dropped below through schedule
Occur during bit rate.Asked questions to solve this, the history of the downloading rate of previous HLS chunks can be stored.Therefore, in some realities
Apply in example, content server 305 checks that the speed that is previously downloaded of client is in transmission before the chunk of HLS client requests
It is no to be higher than the weighted network bandwidth through schedule.If not, being so based on being previously downloaded rate history and HLS clients letter
Cease and calculate new relatively low rate.
In view of many possible embodiments that the principle of this discussion can be applied to, it is recognized that retouched herein in connection with schema
The embodiment stated is intended exclusively for scope that is illustrative and should not be construed as limiting claims.Therefore, as described in this article
Technology cover all such embodiments that can be belonged in the range of appended claims and its equivalent.
