Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in transporting passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself

- An autonomous vehicle operating on a road may rely on identifying lane boundaries for navigation.
- a computing device configured to control the vehicle, may also be configured to have access to map information that may indicate the lane boundaries on the road.
- the map information may include inaccuracies in estimation of the lane boundaries or may not be updated with road changes (e.g., construction zones, etc.).
- lane marker detection systems may have challenges estimating the lane boundaries, such as having false positives occurring due to objects or shadows on the road that may exhibit characteristics similar to lane markers.
- the computing device may be configured to use lane information generated at previous time periods to estimate a projection of the lane boundary ahead of the vehicle.
- the lane information may include, for example, one or more of map information, position tracking information of one or more vehicles on the road, and an image depicting a lane marker.
- the computing device may be configured to use frames or images captured at previous time periods to project the lane boundary ahead of the vehicle.
- the computing device may be configured to project the lane boundary as a straight line ahead of the vehicle.
- the computing device may be configured to receive respective lane information at a present time period, and modify the estimated projection of the lane boundary based on the respective lane information.
- the respective lane information may include an image captured at a present time period by a camera coupled to the vehicle.
- the previously captured lane information may indicate that the lane boundary may extend as a straight line, while the respective lane information captured at the present time period may show that the lane boundary is curving along with the road, for example.
- the computing device may be configured to modify the estimated projection to reflect the curvature detected.
- the computing device may estimate the lane boundary projection probabilistically. For instance, a probability of estimation of the lane boundary on a given portion of the road may be inversely proportional to the distance between the vehicle and the given portion of the road.
- the computing device may thus be configured to determine or assign a level of confidence to the estimation of the lane boundary projection based on the probability of estimation.
- the level of confidence may be based on road geometry and characteristics of the vehicle. For instance, the level of confidence may decrease as a speed of the vehicle increases because estimations based on previously obtained information may be less accurate when the speed of the vehicle is high. Also, if orientation or lateral position of the vehicle relative to the road is different from a corresponding orientation or lateral position from which a previous image, on which the projection is based, was captured, the level of confidence may be decreased.
- An example vehicle control system may be implemented in or may take the form of an automobile.
- a vehicle control system may be implemented in or take the form of other vehicles, such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, boats, airplanes, helicopters, lawn mowers, recreational vehicles, amusement park vehicles, farm equipment, construction equipment, trams, golf carts, trains, and trolleys. Other vehicles are possible as well.

- the level of confidence may also be based on the reliability metric assigned to the lane information generated at the one or more previous time periods.
- the reliability metric may be indicative of a level of certainty for the detection of the lane boundary based on the lane information.
- the level of confidence may be proportional to the reliability metric.
