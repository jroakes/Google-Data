Description
Technical Field
The present description relates to data processing and improving the accuracy of experimental results by selecting geographic locations utilized in the experiment.
Background
Generally, to measure the impact of online digital content on offline behavior, randomization experiments can be utilized. For example, to measure the impact of presenting a particular set of online digital content on user behavior in a specified area (e.g., accessing a particular location), a random experiment may be performed by randomly dividing the user population into two groups (e.g., a control group and an experimental group). The experimental group will receive online digital content from a particular set of online digital content, while the control group will not receive such content. Comparison of the offline behavior of the control and experimental groups may reveal how exposure of a particular set of online digital content will affect the user's offline behavior.

Detailed Description
In the past, geographic experiments were performed by randomly dividing a population of users into two groups (e.g., a control group and an experimental group). However, randomization may not be relied upon in designing a geographic experiment. For example, randomization may not create a balanced set of experiments when certain geographic areas are significantly different from other geographic areas, or when only a few geographic areas are available for experiments. Furthermore, given certain experimental requirements, randomization may not be feasible-such as requiring smaller scale geographical experiments to be run within a given budget, or including a specified geographical region in a specified experiment set. In addition, the ability of users to move between geographic areas can reduce the accuracy of geographic experiments. Thus, implementation of such random experiments may be difficult to implement.
Methods, systems, and computer-readable media are described herein that improve the accuracy of experimental results by selecting geographic locations utilized in the experiment. For example, the described selection process overcomes the deficiencies of random geographic experimentation by identifying a control group of geographic areas that provide the best accuracy (or at least a specified accuracy) in view of the experimental geographic areas that have been selected. In particular, points of interest (such as physical stores) may be located within a geographic region. In some cases, the geographic area may be the smallest physical area that includes most guests to the point of interest. These geographic areas may be used for exposure of digital content (e.g., advertisements or other information). For example, a first geographic area may be used as a control geographic area (e.g., digital content is not exposed within the geographic area) while a second geographic area may be used as an experimental geographic area (e.g., digital content is exposed). The particular geographic area included in each of the experimental and control geographic areas, which may be referred to as the most suitable geographic area, may be selected, for example, such that the results of experiments performed using the experimental and control geographic areas provide the greatest accuracy (or at least a specified amount of accuracy). The process of selecting the most suitable geographic area for experimentation by optimizing the desired indicators of interest includes evaluating each possible combination of geographic areas.
In some cases, the selection process begins by creating an initial experimental set that includes a set of geographic areas; and creating a matching control group of the initial experimental group, the matching control group including geographic areas not included in the initial experimental group. In other words, the initial experimental set may include a first set of geographic areas (for application of experiments-e.g., exposing digital content), and the initial control set that matches the specified initial experimental set may include a second set of geographic areas not included by the first set (for control-e.g., not exposing digital content). An updated experiment set may then be created that includes the geographic region from the initial experiment set and the additional geographic region. In other words, the updated experimental set is increased by one geographic area (or possibly more than one geographic area) over the initial experimental set. In addition, additional geographic areas are selected that provide a specified level of increase in model quality index as compared to the level of model quality index provided by the initial experimental set. That is, adding a geographic region to the initial experimental set to form an updated experimental set increases the level of model quality index as compared to the initial experimental set. An updated matching control group may then be created based on the updated experimental group, and the process of creating the experimental group and the matching control group may be iteratively repeated until a stop condition occurs. Experiments can then be performed, including receiving input specifying an experiment group size for a given experiment, and performing the experiment using i) an experiment group that includes a certain number of geographic areas that match the received experiment group size and ii) a matching control group created for the experiment group.
Fig. 1 depicts a system 100 for selecting a geographic region for experimentation. The system 100 includes a computing device 102, a geographic region data store 110, and an experimental results data store 112. The computing device 102 may communicate with the databases 110, 112 via one or more networks (not shown). In some examples, computing device 102 may include one or more modules and may be implemented as a combination of computing systems or in the same set of physical hardware.
In some examples, computing device 102 may obtain geographic area data 120 from geographic area data store 110. The geographic area data 120 may include data defining a geographic area, including such data as the location of points of interest included by the geographic area, the geographic dimensions of the geographic area, and the geographic location of the geographic area. The computing device 102 may also receive data identifying an experimental model 142, the experimental model 142 including data indicative of model quality metrics 140. The computing device 102 may selectively apply the experimental model 142 to the geographic areas of the geographic area data 120 to identify results from the distribution of digital content within the selected geographic area, as further described herein. Furthermore, the model quality index 140 may be related to distribution of digital content within a selected region, as further described herein.
Briefly, the computing device 102 may create experimental and control groups, each including a geographic region from the geographic region data 120. The computing device 102 may conduct experiments using the experimental and/or control groups-that is, modifying how the digital content is distributed in the geographic region encompassed by the experimental group, without modifying how the digital content is distributed in the geographic region encompassed by the control group, as further described herein. In some examples, the geographic area data 120 acquired by the computing device 102 may include i) data specifying which geographic areas need to be included in the experimental group, and ii) data specifying which geographic areas are allowed to be included in the control group.
In some implementations, the computing device 102 creates an initial set of experiments for one or more experiments that includes one or more geographic regions. Fig. 2A shows a plurality of geographic areas 202A, 202b, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202g, collectively referred to as geographic areas 202. The geographic area data 120 may include data indicative of a geographic area 202. In the illustrated example, the computing device 102 creates an initial experiment set 210 that includes the geographic area 202 a. In some examples, the initial set of experiments 210 may provide a value (or level) of the model quality indicator 140. Model quality metrics 140 may be metrics of an objective function to be optimized by computing system 102, e.g., based on parameters desired by system 100 and/or provided by a user of system 100. For example, geographic area 202 may include an area that receives distribution of digital content on a respective computing device, e.g., advertising digital content provided to the computing device that includes user profile data indicative of inclusion within the respective geographic area. In this example, the model quality metrics 140 may include metrics related to the distribution of the digital content and the effectiveness of such distribution exhibited by the user-e.g., the user's engagement with points of interest included in the geographic region 202 receiving the digital content distribution. For example, the metrics may include in-store sales of points of interest; however, any metrics may be used for any model related to the distribution of digital content within the geographic area 202 that is desired to be optimized.
In the illustrated example, the computing device 102 creates an initial experiment set 210, the initial experiment set 210 including a single geographic area, such as geographic area 202a. The computing device 102 may create the initial set of experiments 210 such that the initial set of experiments 210 provides a specified level of the model quality index 140. That is, the computing device 102 selects the geographic area 202a for inclusion in the initial experimental set 210 such that the initial experimental set 210 provides a specified level of the model quality index 140. In some examples, computing device 102 selects geographic area 202a for inclusion in initial experiment set 210, initial experiment set 210 providing an optimization level of model quality index 140.
In some examples, computing device 102 creates an initial experimental set to include a set of geographic areas indicated as needed to be included in the initial experimental set as indicated by geographic area data 120. For example, when the geographic area 202a needs to be included in the initial experiment set 210 as indicated by the geographic area data 120, the computing device 102 creates the initial experiment set 210 to include the geographic area 202a. In some examples, the geographic area data 120 may indicate that a number of geographic areas, such as two or more geographic areas 202, are to be included within any of the experimental groups, including the initial experimental group 210.
In some implementations, the computing device 102 creates a matching control group for the initial experimental group that includes geographic areas that are not included by the initial experimental group. That is, in the example shown in fig. 2A, computing device 102 creates a matching control group 212 for initial experimental group 210. The matching control group 212 includes geographic areas 202c and 202d that are not included by the initial experimental group 210. In some examples, the computing device 102 selects geographic areas 202c and 202d from available geographic areas 202b, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202g to optimize the model quality indicators 140 that may be determined using the initial experimental set 210 and the matching control set 212. Specifically, the computing device 102 may conduct experiments using the experimental model 142 of the initial experimental group 210 and the initial control group of the initial experimental group.
For example, computing device 102 may conduct experiments using experiment model 142 using initial experiment set 210 and an initial control set of initial experiment sets. The computing device 102 creates, for each additional geographic area of the plurality of different candidate geographic areas 202, i) a neighboring control group that includes the additional geographic area or excludes one of the geographic areas included in the initial control group of the initial experimental group 210, and ii) determines a level of the model quality index 140 based on results provided by the experimental model 142 using the initial experimental group 210 and the neighboring control group. For example, for each additional geographic area 202, the computing device 102 creates a neighbor control group for each combination of available geographic areas 202-e.g., geographic areas 202 (geographic areas 202b, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202 g) that are not included by the initial experiment group 210. For each combination of available geographic areas 202, i.e., for each adjacent control group, computing device 102 determines a level of model quality index 140 based on results provided by experimental model 142 using initial experimental group 210 and the adjacent control group. For example, the computing device 210 applies the experimental model 140 to each combination of i) the initial experimental set 210 and ii) the adjacent control sets-e.g., any combination of geographic areas 202b, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202 g. The computing device 120 may then determine a level of model quality index 142 provided by the experimental model 142 for each combination of i) the initial experimental group 210 and ii) the adjacent control group. The computing device 102 may assign one of the adjacent control groups corresponding to the highest level of the model quality index 140 as the matching control group 212 of the initial experimental group 210. For example, when the neighbor collation group including the geographic regions 202c, 202d corresponds to the highest second level of model quality index 140, the computing device 102 may assign the neighbor collation group including the geographic regions 202c, 202d as the matching collation group 212.
In some examples, computing device 102 creates a matching control group to include geographic areas 202 that are allowed to be included in matching control group 212 as indicated by geographic area data 120. For example, when any of the geographic areas 202b, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202g is allowed to be included in the matching control group 212 (e.g., as indicated by the geographic area data 120), the computing device 102 creates the matching control group 212 to include a subset of the geographic areas 202b, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202g in the matching control group 212.
In some implementations, the computing device 102 creates an updated experiment set that includes a geographic region from the initial experiment set and additional geographic regions from among a plurality of different qualified geographic regions. That is, in the example shown in fig. 2B, computing device 102 creates update experiment set 220 that includes geographic areas 202a and 202B. In some examples, computing device 102 selects an additional geographic area from a plurality of different qualified geographic areas such that the additional geographic area and the geographic area from the initial experimental group provide a specified level of increase in model quality index for the updated experimental group relative to the level of model quality index provided by the initial experimental group. In the example shown in fig. 2B, the computing device 102 selects the geographic area 202B from the geographic areas 202B, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202g such that the geographic area 202B and the geographic area 202a from the initial experimental set 210 provide a specified level of increase in the model quality index 140 of the updated experimental set 220 relative to the value of the model quality index 140 provided by the initial experimental set 210. In particular, computing device 102 may conduct experiments using experiment model 142 using updated experiment set 210. For example, computing device 102 may conduct experiments using experiment model 142 that uses updated experiment set 220 (i.e., initial experiment set 210 and additional geographic areas). For each additional geographic area from the plurality of different geographic areas of the geographic area data 120 that is eligible for inclusion in the updated experiment set 220, the computing device 102 determines an increase level of the model quality index 140 based on results provided by the experiment model 142 using the initial experiment set 210 and the additional geographic area. For example, for each additional geographic area 202, the computing device 102 determines an increase level of the model quality indicator 140 based on results provided by the experimental model 142 using the initial experimental set 210 and the additional geographic areas 202. In other words, the computing device 210 applies the experimental model 142 to each combination of i) the initial experimental set 210 and ii) the additional geographic area 202 to determine the level of increase in the model quality index 140 provided by the experimental model 142 for each combination of i) the initial experimental set 210 and ii) the additional geographic area 202. The computing device 102 may then select one of the additional geographic areas 202 corresponding to the highest level of increase in the model quality index 140. The computing device 102 may create an updated experiment set 220, the updated experiment set 220 including the geographic region 202a from the initial experiment set 210 and the additional geographic region 202b corresponding to the highest level of increase in the model quality index 140.
In some examples, computing device 102 creates a candidate experiment set that includes additional geographic areas and geographic areas that are currently included in any existing experiment set for an experiment. For each additional geographic region of the plurality of different geographic regions of the geographic region data 120 that qualifies for inclusion in the updated experiment set, the computing device 102 creates a candidate experiment set that includes the geographic region of the existing experiment set and the additional geographic region. For each additional geographic region of the plurality of different geographic regions of the geographic region data 120 that qualifies for inclusion in the updated experimental set, the computing device 102 determines whether the candidate experimental set provides a higher level of model quality metrics 140 than the existing experimental set, for example, based on results provided by the experimental model 142 using the candidate experimental set. When the candidate experimental set cannot provide a higher level of model quality index 140 than the existing experimental set, the computing device 102 does not add the additional geographic region to the existing experimental set.
In some implementations, the computing device 102 iteratively creates each of the following: i) Creating an update matching control group based on the update experimental group and ii) creating an additional update experimental group based on the update matching control group until a stop condition occurs. In the example shown in fig. 2B, computing device 102 creates an update match control group 222 based on update experiment group 220. The update match control group 222 includes geographic areas 202f and 202g that are not included by the update experiment group 220. In some examples, the computing device 102 selects geographic areas 202f and 202g from available geographic areas 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202g to optimize the model quality index 140, which model quality index 140 may be determined using the selected geographic areas 202 of the update experiment set 220 and the update match comparison set 222.
For example, computing device 102 may conduct experiments using experiment model 142 that uses update experiment set 220 and an update control set of update experiment set 220. The computing device 102 creates, for each additional geographic region of the plurality of different candidate collation geographic regions of the geographic region data 120, i) a neighbor collation group that includes the additional geographic region or excludes one of the geographic regions included in the update collation group of the update experiment group, and ii) determines a level of the model quality index 140 based on results provided by the experiment model 142 using the update experiment group and the neighbor update collation group. For example, for each additional geographic area 202, the computing device 102 creates a neighboring update control group for each combination of available geographic areas 202-e.g., geographic areas 202 (geographic areas 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202 g) that are not included by the update experiment group 210. For each combination of available geographic areas 202, i.e., for each adjacent update control group, computing device 102 determines a level of model quality index 140 based on results provided by experimental model 142 using update experimental group 220 and the adjacent update control group. For example, the computing device 210 applies the experimental model 142 to each combination of i) the updated experimental set 220 and ii) the adjacent updated control sets (e.g., any combination of the geographic areas 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202 g), and determines a level of the model quality index 202 provided by the experimental model 142 for each combination of i) the updated experimental set 220 and ii) the adjacent updated control sets. The computing device 102 may then assign one of the adjacent update controls corresponding to the highest level of the model quality index 140 as the matching update control for the update experiment set. For example, when the adjacent update controls including the geographic areas 202f, 202g correspond to the highest level of the model quality index 140, the computing device 102 may assign the adjacent update controls including the geographic areas 202f, 202g as the update match controls 222.
In addition, the computing device 102 creates a further updated experiment set that includes geographic areas from the updated experiment set and additional geographic areas from among a plurality of different qualified geographic areas. That is, in the example shown in fig. 2C, the computing device 102 creates a further updated experiment set 240 that includes the geographic areas 202a, 202b, 202d. In some examples, the computing device 102 selects an additional geographic area from a plurality of different qualified geographic areas such that the additional geographic area and the geographic area from the update experiment set provide a specified level of increase in the model quality index of the further update experiment set relative to the level of the model quality index provided by the update experiment set. Specifically, for each additional geographic area of the plurality of different geographic areas of the geographic area data 120 that is eligible for inclusion in the further updated experiment set 240, the computing device 102 determines an increase level of the model quality index 140 based on results provided by the experiment model 142 using the updated experiment set 220 and the additional geographic area. For example, for each additional geographic area 202, the computing device 102 determines an increase level of the model quality indicator 140 based on results provided by the experimental model 142 using the updated experimental set 220 and the additional geographic areas 202. For example, the computing device 102 applies the experimental model 142 to each combination of i) the updated experimental set 220 and ii) the additional geographic region 202. The computing device 102 determines an increase level of the model quality index 202 provided by the experimental model 142 for each combination of i) the updated experimental set 220 and ii) the additional geographic area 202. The computing device 102 may then select one of the additional geographic areas 202 corresponding to the highest level of increase in the model quality index 140. The computing device 102 may create a further update experiment set 240 that includes the geographic areas 202a, 202b from the update experiment set 220 and the additional geographic area 202d corresponding to the highest level of increase in the model quality index 140.
Further, in the example shown in fig. 2C, the computing device 102 creates a further update matching control group 242 based on the further update experiment group 240. Further updating the matching comparison set 242 includes the geographic area 202g. In some examples, the computing device 102 selects a geographic region 202g from among the available geographic regions 202c, 202e, 202f, 202g to optimize the model quality index 140, and the model quality index 140 may be determined using further updating the experimental set 240 and further updating the selected geographic region 202 of the matching control set 242. For example, the computing device 102 may conduct experiments using the experiment model 142 that uses i) a further updated experiment group 240 and ii) a neighboring further updated control group, which is a combination of the geographic areas 202c, 202e, 202f, 202g. The computing device 210 determines a level of the model quality index 140 provided by the experimental model 142 for each combination of i) the further updated experimental group 240 and ii) the adjacent further updated control group. The computing device 102 may then assign one of the adjacent further updated control groups corresponding to the highest level of the model quality index 140 as a further updated matching control group of the further updated experimental group. For example, when the neighboring further update controls that include the geographic area 202g correspond to the highest level of the model quality index 140, the computing device 102 may assign the neighboring further update controls that include the geographic area 202g as further update matching controls 242.
In some examples, the computing system 102 iteratively creates an update match control group and an update experiment group until a stop condition occurs. That is, the computing system 102 iteratively creates an experimental set (e.g., experimental set 210, 220, 240) and a matching control set (e.g., control set 212, 222, 242) until a stop condition occurs. In some examples, the stop condition may be associated with a maximum specified number of geographic areas to be included in the update experiment set. In particular, computing system 102 may iteratively create an update matching control group and an update experiment group until (last/final) the update experiment group includes a maximum specified number of geographic areas. In some examples, computing system 102 may receive a maximum specified amount of data indicating a geographic area to use under stop conditions. For example, referring to fig. 2A, 2B, 2C, the maximum specified number of geographic areas for the stop condition is three, and thus, the computing system 102 may iteratively create an experimental set (e.g., experimental set 210, 220, 240) and a matching control set (e.g., control set 212, 222, 242) until three geographic areas are included in the final experimental set (e.g., further update experimental set 240). The maximum specified amount of data indicative of the geographic area used under the stop condition may be provided by a user of computing system 102 or automatically determined based on the number of geographic areas of geographic area data 120.
In some examples, computing system 102 may iteratively create an update match control group and an update experiment group until adding another geographic area to the existing experiment group fails to increase the level of model quality index 140 relative to the level of model quality index 140 provided by the existing experiment group. That is, the computing device 102 determines, based on the results provided by the experimental model 142, that adding another geographic region to the existing experimental set cannot increase the model quality index 140. For example, the computing device 102 may determine, based on the results provided by the experimental model 142, that adding another geographic region to the further updated experimental set 240 cannot increase the model quality index 140, and therefore, the stop condition is met, and the computing system 102 stops iteratively creating the updated matching control set and the updated experimental set.
In some examples, computing device 102 creates additional updated experiment groups such that each additional updated experiment group includes additional geographic areas as compared to the previous experiment group. For example, the computing device 102 creates a further update experiment set 240 to include the geographic area 202d, which geographic area 202d is an additional geographic area relative to the previous experiment set (i.e., update experiment set 220).
In some embodiments, computing system 102 receives input 144 specifying a trial group size for a given trial. That is, the experiment set size input 144 indicates a specified number of geographic areas of the geographic data 120 for the experiment set for a given experiment. For example, input 144 may indicate two geographical areas for a given experimental set of experiments-i.e., update experimental set 220. In response to receiving input 144 specifying an experimental group size for a given experiment, computing device 102 performs the experiment using i) an updated experimental group that includes a number of geographic areas that match the experimental group size of input 144 and ii) an updated matching control group created for the updated experimental group. For example, computing device 102 may perform experiments using i) update experiment set 220 and ii) update match control set 222. In some examples, computing device 102 may provide experimental results 160 to experimental results data store 112. In some examples, experimental results 160 may include data associated with providing digital content to i) an updated experimental group that includes a number of geographic areas that match the experimental group size of input 144 and ii) an updated matching control group created for the updated experimental group. In some examples, conducting the experiment by the computing device 102 may include modifying how the digital content is distributed in the geographic region included in the update experiment set, and not modifying how the digital content is distributed in the geographic region included in the matching comparison set. In particular, the computing device 102 may modify how the digital content is distributed in the geographic areas 202a, 202b in the update experiment set 220 and not in the geographic areas 202f, 202g included in the update match comparison set 222.
Referring to fig. 3, in some examples, a hill climbing algorithm (hill climbing algorithm) 300 may be utilized in the system 100 of fig. 1. Specifically, the hill climbing algorithm 300 may be used to optimize the objective function f, i.e., the model quality index 140. Algorithm 300 alternates between a matching phase, which is to identify the "best" set of geographic areas for the control group given the current set of geographic areas for the experimental group, and an enhancement phase, which is to determine whether to add a new geographic area to the experimental group given the current control group. This process is repeated until the experimental group reaches a maximum allowable size, for example, as indicated by a stop condition. Furthermore, hill climbing algorithm 300 generates a plurality of pre-test dates t.epsilon.T 0 During which i=1 for each geographical area, N also needs to specify a set of allowed experimental group assignments Ai and metric(s) m of interest i,t . Let k 0 The algorithm 300 also optionally allows a positive integer K, which represents the maximum number of geographic areas in the experimental set for the experiment. Given these inputs, algorithm 300 provides several different experimental design choices-each of size k=max (k 0 One experimental design choice of experimental group of K. In particular, for each k, a recommended experiment group G is specified * trt,k And matched control group G * ctl,k Wherein an asterisk is used in superscript to distinguish these recommended groups from other non-recommended groups. In addition, note that k= -G * trt,k I represents recommendation group G * trt,k Will precisely contain k geographical areas. Recommendation control group G * ctl,k The subscript k only indicates with which recommended experimental group G it is associated * trt,k Pairing.
Algorithm 300 begins by initializing a geographic region to an experimental set, as defined by equation (8) in line 1 of algorithm 300. In particular, initial recommendation of Experimental group G * trt,k0 Including the geographical area to be assigned to the experimental group, while the initial control group G ctl,k0 Consists of geographical areas allowed to be assigned to the control group. Thereafter, depending on whether G has been determined * trt,k Recommended match control group G * ctl,k The algorithm 300 may then repeatedly alternate between the "match" routine and the "boost" routine until a stopping rule is reached. Note that lines 2-6 of algorithm 300 determine which routine to use first-based on a decision whether any of the geographic areas need to be included in the experimental set.
In the matching routine outlined in lines 9-16 of algorithm 300, the non-recommended control group G is updated incrementally by ctl,k Until a local optimum is reached to find a given recommended experimental group G * trt,k Matching control group G of (1) * ctl,k . This is done by first finding the set R defined by equations (9) and (10) ctl And R is uad To realize, aggregate set R ctl And R is uad Each containing a geographic region that is eligible to be reassigned to a control group or a geographic region that is eligible to be reassigned to an unassigned group. Thereafter, as defined in equation (11), the "adjacent" control group G' ctl,k From G by reassigning geographic regions ctl,k Deriving, when it is matched with recommended experiment group G * trt,k When used in combination, reassignment of the geographic region (from control group to unassigned group or from unassigned group to control group) maximizes f. Then, as described in lines 12-13 of algorithm 1, if f (G * trt,k ,G’ ctl,k )>f(G * trt,k ,G ctl,k ) That is, when combined with G * trt,k When the two components are matched,G’ ctl,k production ratio G ctl,k Higher quality model, algorithm 300 will update control group G ctl,k To be in accordance with G' ctl,k Consistent and this updated control group will then be used for the next iteration of the matching routine.
However, if f (G * trt,k ,G’ ctl,k )≤f(G * trt,k ,G ctl,k ) That is, if local optimality has been reached, algorithm 300 will now aggregate G as shown on lines 14-16 of algorithm 300 ctl,k As recommendation experiment group G of size k * trt,k Recommended match control group G * ctl,k Meanwhile, the enhancement routine detailed in lines 17-22 of algorithm 300 is used to recommend experimental group G from an existing size k * trt,k Deriving a larger recommendation experiment group G with a size of k+1 * trt,k+1 . To achieve this, algorithm 300 first finds a geographic region R that is eligible to be reassigned to the experimental set defined by equation (12) trt Is a set of (3). Thereafter, as can be seen from equation (13), the recommended experiment group G of magnitude k is then enhanced by utilizing the geographic region * trt,k To construct a recommended experiment group G of size k+1 * trt,k+1 Wherein, when compared with the recommended group G * ctl,k When used in conjunction, reassignment of the geographic region to the experimental group maximizes f. Finally, as shown in lines 20-22 of algorithm 300, control group G is recommended * ctl,k And then used as the next call to find G * trt,k+1 The start of the matching routine of the matching control group. As shown in line 8 of algorithm 300, algorithm 300 continues to alternate between the enhancement routine and the matching routine until it has been a block with a size of k=max (k 0 Experimental design of experimental group of k.a recommended experimental group G was determined * trt,k And the corresponding matching control group G * ctl,k Until that point. Furthermore, each of these recommended designs locally optimizes the objective function f in terms of demand, and is matched by the marketer if the assumption of algorithm 300 holds for the entire duration of the geographic area experiment T The geographical area experiments recommended by the method will produce direct causal estimates. In addition, performance calculations (power calculation) may be performed for each recommended experimental design to obtain an estimate of the experimental cost for each design. In particular, as the volume of the experimental group increases, the experimental cost tends to increase proportionally. Thus, since the algorithm 300 recommends that the volume in the experimental group increases with k, the algorithm 300 is able to provide the entity (e.g., advertiser) with several geographic experimental design options that change the cost of the experiment.
FIG. 4 illustrates an example process 400 for selecting a geographic area for experimentation. Process 400 may be performed, for example, by computing system 102 or another data processing apparatus. Process 400 may also be implemented as instructions stored on a computer storage medium and executed by one or more data processing apparatus to cause the one or more data processing apparatus to perform some or all of the operations of process 300.
Computing device 102 creates an initial set of experiments for one or more experiments that includes one or more geographic regions (402). For example, in the example shown in fig. 2A, computing device 102 creates an initial experimental set 210 that includes geographic region 202A. The computing device 102 creates a matching control group for the initial experimental group, the matching control group including geographic areas not included by the initial experimental group (404). For example, in the example shown in fig. 2A, computing device 102 creates a matching control group 212 for initial experimental group 210. The matching control group 212 includes geographic areas 202c and 202d that are not included by the initial experimental group 210. The computing device 102 creates an updated experiment set that includes a geographic region from the initial experiment set and additional geographic regions from among a plurality of different qualified geographic regions (406). That is, in the example shown in fig. 2B, computing device 102 creates update experiment set 220 that includes geographic areas 202a and 202B. In some examples, the computing device 102 selects an additional geographic area from a plurality of different qualified geographic areas such that the additional geographic area and the geographic area from the initial experimental group provide a specified level of increase in model quality metrics of the updated experimental group relative to the model quality metrics level provided by the initial experimental group. In the example shown in fig. 2B, the computing device 102 selects the geographic area 202B from the geographic areas 202B, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f, 202g such that the geographic area 202B and the geographic area 202a from the initial experimental set 210 provide a specified level of increase in the model quality index 140 of the updated experimental set 220 relative to the value of the model quality index 140 provided by the initial experimental set 210.
The computing device 102 iteratively creates each of the following: i) Creating an update matching control group based on the update experimental group and ii) creating an additional update experimental group based on the update matching control group until a stop condition occurs (408). For example, in the example shown in fig. 2C, computing device 102 creates update-matching control group 222 based on update-experimental group 220. The update match control group 222 includes geographic areas 202f and 202g that are not included by the update experiment group 220. Additionally, in the example shown in fig. 2C, the computing device 102 creates a further updated experiment set 240 that includes the geographic areas 202a, 202b, 202 d. Further, in some examples, the stop condition may be associated with a maximum specified number of geographic areas to be included in the update experiment set. The computing system 102 receives an input 144 specifying a trial group size for a given trial (410). That is, the experiment set size input 144 indicates a specified number of geographic areas of the geographic data 120 for the experiment set for a given experiment. In response to receiving input 144 specifying an experiment group size for a given experiment, computing device 102 performs the experiment using i) an updated experiment group that includes a number of geographic areas that match the experiment group size of input 144 and ii) an updated matching control group created for the updated experiment group (412). For example, computing device 102 may perform experiments using i) update experiment set 220 and update match control set 222.
