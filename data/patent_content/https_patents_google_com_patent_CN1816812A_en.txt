The scores may be used in determining whether to serve ads, how to serve ads, to order ads, to filter ads, etc. Items of user information, request-associated information, and/or ad information can be weighted based on previous uses of such information in the serving of ads and the performance of those served ads.
Description
Technical field
The present invention relates to advertisement.Specifically, the present invention relates to determine that relevant especially advertisement or advertising creative serve for example to ask search inquiry or document request according to the user.
Background technology
Use traditional media for example TV, broadcasting, newspaper and magazine to advertise be known.Unfortunately, though prepared demographic studies and about the fully reasonably hypothesis of the typical viewers of various media outlet when using at any time, the advertiser recognizes that also many its advertising budgets have wasted fully.And, be very difficult to identification and eliminate this waste.
Recently, advertisement has become universal on more interactive media.For example, because the number explosive growth of internet usage, so the most effective potential advertisement mode is used as in media and service that the advertiser has begun to provide on the internet.
The advertiser has developed the value maximization that a kind of strategy attempts to make this advertisement.In a kind of strategy, the advertiser is used for providing the popular existence form of interactive media or service or means (not having under the situation of loss of generality to be called as " website " at instructions) as propagating the approach of giving huge spectators.Use this first kind of scheme, the advertiser can be placed on advertisement on the homepage of New York Times website for example or USA Today website.In another kind of strategy, the advertiser can attempt the goal-setting of its advertisement is narrower niche audience, improved the possibility that spectators provide active response thus.For example, the tourism in Costa Rican rainforest promotes that agency can be placed on advertisement on the eco-tour-travelling sub-directory of Yahoo website.
Irrelevant with this strategy, present to its advertising audience with " banner towing " (that is the rectangle frame that, can comprise the figure ingredient) form usually based on the advertisement (being also referred to as " web advertisement ") of website.By clicking one that selects in these banner towings, the hypertext link of embedding guides to spectators advertiser's website usually advertising audience member's (being called as " spectators " or " user " under the situation in loss of generality not in instructions).Wherein spectators have selected this process of an advertisement to be commonly called " point advances " (" point advances " (click-through) is used for containing all users and selects).
The advertiser can use many measure or confirmable user behavior is for example put the efficient that into number of times, click-through rate, conversion times, conversion ratio are judged advertising campaign.The ratio of putting number of times and advertisement exposure number of times (that is the number of times of advertisement displaying) is commonly referred to as " click-through rate " of advertisement." conversion times " be it is said when the user finishes the processing relevant with the advertisement of serving previously and occurred.The thing that constitutes conversion can change along with situation, and can determine according to multiple mode.For example, can be such a case, finish appearance conversion when buying before promptly clicking advertisement, relate to advertiser's webpage and leaving that webpage there the user.Optionally, conversion can be defined as and to give user's display ads and buy on (for example, 7 days) inherent advertiser's the webpage at the fixed time.Also can there be many other to constitute the definition of the thing of conversion.The ratio of the exposure frequency of conversion times and advertisement (that is the number of times of display ads) is commonly called conversion ratio.If conversion is defined as and can have occurred at the fixed time since advertising service, then conversion ratio possible definition can only consider to have served in the past the advertisement of the time longer than the schedule time.
Although still there are several problems in the initial agreement based on the advertisement of website in existing scheme.Though the advertiser can arrive a lot of spectators, they are often dissatisfied aspect its investment in advertising of recovery.
Recently popular trend is for example search inquiry to be submitted to the targeted customer that search engine is set advertisement according to user's request of some types.For example, the Google search engine web site allows advertiser's designated key speech so that comprised those keywords or trigger the service of an advertisement or one group of advertisement during its some derivants in search inquiry.
Except the advertiser target that arrives corresponding spectators, the web host (being called as " web host " or " ad consumer ") that occurs advertisement on it attempts to make the advertising income maximization under the situation of the impression that does not damage its user.The number of site main frame is " Overture.com ", and it provides so-called " search engine " service, is used for according to user search queries the advertisement camouflage being returned as " Search Results ".This Overture.com website allows the advertiser to pay with the more high position of advertisement setting on the hypothesis search result list that will be used for its website (or targeted website).If implemented only under the user has selected the situation of this advertisement, the pay scheme of (be each pay-per-click) of advertiser wherein, then the advertiser lacks the target of encouragement with effective its advertisement of setting, will can selected and therefore will not need defrayment because locate relatively poor advertisement.Therefore, each click the higher advertisement of expense and be presented near top or its, but needn't be transformed into advertisement publishers' true income, because spectators can not click them.In addition, the advertisement that the user can select in addition can be more following what tabulate, so the relevance of advertisement is compromised.
Unfortunately, often there is restriction in conventional online advertisement system aspect the ability of its service relevant advertisements.Specific user's relevant advertisements often can not be selected to be best suited for by the online advertisement system that promptly allows to serve usually relevant advertisements.
Therefore, need to improve the performance of online advertisement.More particularly, need to improve the advertisement of serve association for this requesting users of submission according to specific user's request (for example search inquiry or document request).Do the income that improve web host like this and improved user's impression simultaneously.
Summary of the invention
The invention provides the information (for example, search inquiry or document request) that is used to use user profile and is associated so that advertisement user oriented better with user's request.By using user profile and the information relevant, can realize being better than the remarkable advantage of existing method with request.This is due to the fact that resulting, and when the user submitted to system with request, they were providing some connections (articulation) of information request at that time, on it some relevant ad groups can be arranged.The present invention improves this advertising service process by also having considered user profile for example user's previous behavior (for example, select specific advertisement, watch the particular portion of website to grade) and/or subscriber profile information (for example, demography).By the location of such improvement advertisement, should improve the performance of these advertisements (for example, at aspects such as click-through rate, conversion ratios).The present invention can also use these user profile and customize the creative content of the advertisement that is used to present to the user with the relevant information of request.

In improvement embodiment of the present invention, advertising message storage is as n-gram (length be 1 to certain maximal value word sequence of 3 for example), and (for example have relevant sources (this n-gram can from the title of locator key speech, advertiser websites, the metatag of advertiser websites etc.), URL, classification, this advertisement is used for the software product that uses for Microsoft Windows) or be used for the particular value (for example, this commerce is positioned at specific latitude and longitude place) of different information.The same as known in the art, n-gram is the grammer representative of N level Markov language model, and wherein the possibility of symbol appearance is with the condition that formerly appears as of N-1 other symbol.Construct in the statistics that N-GRAM uses word to occur jointly in corpus determining that order of words possibility cause obtains usually from large-scale text corpus.The N-GRAM model depend on order of words for example word to the possibility of (biliteral group), word triplets (trigram) etc.The N-GRAM model can utilize the document format that comprises the data tuple row to represent that with tree each data tuple row is represented the continuous nodes of a branch and syntax tree.Branch data is the index of the order of words of this n-gram of expression.It after these order of words data the tabulation of one or two integer of expression node branch coefficient and event count.
Referring to the example network environment of Figure 14, advertising message can be stored in the Advertisement Server 1450, but it also can be stored in other positions, perhaps is stored in other positions simultaneously.
4.2.2 example user information
Fig. 5 is the example data structure 500 that is used to store the user profile that can be used by the present invention.The same as shown, user profile can comprise user identifier 510 and one or more user characteristics (being also referred to as " user profile project ") 520.In some embodiments of the present invention, user characteristics 520 can comprise user behavior information and/or user profiles (for example, demographic, geographical, consumer mentality) information.The numerical value of user characteristics can be quantitative (discrete or continuous numerical value, for example age=58 year old; Annual income=$55000; Inhabitation city=San Francisco, CA) or non-quantitative (become one interval or do not become interval, for example Xin Shui $50000-$100000?=be; U.S. resident?=be).
4.2.1.1 the embodiment of user profile
The user profile feature can comprise one or more in the following feature:
The user once visited the web site contents (for example, word, anchor text etc.) of (perhaps visiting) in special time period;
The demographic information;
Geography information;
Consumer mentality information;
The prior search queries that the user makes (and/or relevant information);
The information of the previous advertisement that relevant user watches, selects and/or bought after checking;
The information of the relevant document of watching/asking and/or edit by the user (for example, word processor);
User interest;
About from user's individualized result's express or implied feedback (for example, selection result, selection result not, the time that on the result, spends etc.);
Browse activity; And
The front buying behavior.
This information can be stored on each individual basis, and is perhaps integrated according to variety of way among various people group.This information can make up to obtain compound bay information.
4.2.1.2 how to obtain the example of user profile
User profile for example demography, geography and/or consumer mentality user profile can (a) directly be provided by the user; (b) store from the third party informant; (c) release based on user's further feature; And/or (d) derive according to other (for example similar) user's feature.
4.2.1.3 the example of storing subscriber information how and where
Can use the various means of the vector that for example eigenwert is right to represent user profile, and it is stored with for example any data management scheme described herein.This then user profile can working time with ask relevant information to be used in combination with the active user, to be complementary with the potential advertisement group that will show.In one embodiment of the invention, user profile is stored as n-gram (length 1 to some maximal value for example the sequence of 3 word), and has a relevant source (for example n-gram is from the webpage of being browsed, search inquiry etc.), URL or be used for the concrete numerical value (for example the user is using specific web browser, and perhaps the user is positioned at concrete longitude and latitude etc.) of variety classes information.
The storage of user profile and use can have various form, the storage that comprises (a) client computer one side (for example is the field of browser cookie, local file, hiding form, the perhaps form of URL coding), (b) server one side storage (database of record for example, flat file, be used to store and retrieve the proprietary structure of bay/behavioural information), and/or (c) third party's storage.Therefore, user profile does not need to stay in the storage vault of server one side, in fact can be stored in client computer and/or third party, and sends to information server together with user's request (for example search inquiry or document request).User profile can for example send in web page browsing cookie.
Example network environment with reference to Figure 14, user profile can be stored in one or more client devices 1420, in one or more content server 1430, in one or more search engine 1440, in one or more Advertisement Server 1450, and/or in one or more subscriber information server 1460.In either case, by using some data management scheme (for example database, flat file, proprietary data management system, web browser cookie etc.) can maintenance customer's information.The disparity items of user profile (for example different user characteristicses) can be stored on the different equipment.
4.2.3 the information relevant with request

4.2.4 the refinement of information stores
In order to obtain the system of a practicality, desirable or necessary is will reduce the amount of the user profile of using and/or to its ordering in targeted advertisements.The present invention allows to carry out this minimizing with the minimal losses of information and precision.In addition since desirable or necessary be to suppress the stand-by period of advertisement in providing, therefore in the searching of user profile, Advertisement Server may need to use limited user profile or not use user profile to operate in some cases.According to the present invention, on the information that priorization allows that Advertisement Server focuses on that aiming can obtain in handling is valuable (for example most worthy).Below described and be used for the example technique that data reduce or handle priorization.
In one embodiment of the invention, each at least some information projects has relevant weights of importance.The weights of importance of a plurality of features can be grouped in together or gather according to certain mode.For example, the weights of importance of all words on the webpage checked of user can be utilized following technology grouping and be adjusted at together.
At first, in other all situations, can utilize information type to determine to be assigned to the weights of importance of a information.For example search inquiry can have the higher initial weight of n-gram that extracts than the webpage of having checked from the user.
The weights of importance that is used for information project (for example user characteristics) can be based on a concrete user or one group of user's action and is upgraded.Fig. 9 is the process flow diagram that can be used for according to the illustrative methods 900 of mode managing advertisement information consistent with the present invention or user profile.Shown in trigger event square frame 910, when advertisement when providing and utilize (for example weighting) advertisement that feature selecting provided, manner of execution 900.Shown in square frame 920, for employed (at least some) feature, before leaving this method 900 by RETURN node 930, the performance of the advertisement that provides based on (for example selected or selected) is adjusted the weight of feature.If therefore for example the user selects an advertisement, cause the weights of importance of the recommended user profile project of this advertisement to increase.The amount that weights of importance increases (absolute or relative) can be determined the contribution of advertisement recommender score according to each user profile project to small part.Similarly, the weights of importance of the relevant item of user profile will reduce when the user does not select this advertisement.In one embodiment of the invention, weight reduces the factor and increases the factor less than weight.
In one embodiment of the invention, can cause good recommended frequency (absolute and/or relative), utilize (for example in conjunction with) optional weights of importance of adjusting of overall weight based on this information project in all users.Perhaps, perhaps in addition, can cause good recommended frequency (absolute and/or relative), utilize (for example in conjunction with) optional weights of importance of adjusting of community's weight based on this information project in one group of (for example all are similar) user.
In one embodiment of the invention, if a record or one group of user profile reach specific size, can reduce by utilizing at least the more unessential information project of weights of importance deletion.Also can consider the memory requirement of information project.In this manner, can at first consider to delete need bigger storage but the information project with low weights of importance.
One embodiment of the invention can utilize weights of importance to come single information project sort (even storage).In this embodiment, user information request for given user can provide with the user profile that the quilt that only comprises most important (with regard to weights of importance) information project cuts, perhaps be provided until the enough information of acquisition to pursue part (piecemeal) mode, and/or until not needing or can not being further processed.Therefore, for example can utilize the processing of user profile project according to the order of weights of importance.This allows earlier (for example for efficient, finishing processing etc. in order to satisfy some potential restrictions and to guarantee within the special time restriction) end process.
When increasing new user profile (project), can change the weights of importance of the off-the-shelf item of information.Therefore the order of (for example given user) user profile project may be different with the weights of importance order.Therefore, the present invention can be used for utilizing (for example basis) weights of importance separately to come periodically recorded information project.
In some cases, be utilized in (for example given user) user profile before (for example according to) weights of importance writes down, can carry out the transfer or the processing of user profile according to order roughly.It may be noted that at least some situations and/or some embodiments, will not carry out the storage of physical property ground in proper order according to their weights of importance separately by information project, because this information will be shifted and/or handle effectively according to the sort of order.In fact, at least some situations and/or some embodiments, needn't shift and/or process information according to sequence of importance.For example, if conditions permit can shift and/or handle all information.
4.2.5 the refinement of handling
Processing can separated into two parts, handles (for example being used for given user's) as much as possible user profile processing stage of first within given time restriction, recommends for the terminal user presents advertisement then.Can continue to handle remaining user profile part processing stage of second, up to handling whole group or record, perhaps up to reaching second time restriction.By carrying out this further processing, the adjustment of the information project weights of importance being done based on the performance of the advertisement of recommending can utilize bigger group or the record of handling when subordinate phase finishes.Because user's bay is being similar to of the true interest of user normally, so can not have user's information fully and accurately under this system's normal condition.Consideration can be the advertisement of user's recommendation, for example " Honda " and " S2000 " based on any of two features in user's bay.Consideration is phase one one in the processing feature only, and " Honda ", another feature " S2000 " has lower importance at present in bay.Can be independent recommend " Honda S2000 " advertisement based on first feature, and may cause the point of this advertisement to advance.By provide second the processing stage, can determine that second feature also helps recommended advertisement, therefore can utilize the importance of second feature of this contribution adjustment.
