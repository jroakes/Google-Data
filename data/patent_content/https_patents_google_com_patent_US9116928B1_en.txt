Definitions
- a comparison may be useful in identifying copyrighted audio or video files, such as in the context of a website that allows users to upload such media files, to identify potential infringement.
- some techniques use hashes that characterize the media files or portions of the media files, for example at or near a given time point within the media file. Such techniques may be limited as the number of known media files grows, or as media files become larger. For example, as the number of media files grows, a high number of matching hashes may be retrieved for a given portion of a media file. However, many of the retrieved hashes may not represent true matches to the given media file segment. It may be difficult to identify desirable hashes to use for the comparison. For example, some media files may include segments that result in hashes that are often matched to new media files, but that do not necessarily indicate a good match between the content in those files.
- Embodiments of the disclosed subject matter include techniques, systems, and computer-readable media configured to obtain a plurality of media file feature definitions, each definition associated with a hash of media file content.
- a plurality of linear combinations of the plurality of media file feature definitions may be generated, where each combination is associated with a plurality of feature coefficients.
- Each of the linear combination may be applied with respect to a sample media file and a reference media file to generate a correlation coefficient for the linear combination, [We use the correlation coefficient to measure the “benefit” of a linear combination. But what we are interested in are the linear combinations.]
- Preferred linear combinations may be determined based upon the correlation coefficients.
- Media file features corresponding to the preferred linear combinations may be identified (i.e.
- hash functions are based on these new features, which are linear combinations of the old, raw, features), and used to determine whether the sample media file contains media substantially equivalent to media contained in the first reference media file.
- the linear combinations may exclude known false positive matches between the media file features apparent in the sample media file and in the reference media file.
- Embodiments also may exclude linear combinations which have a variance below a defined threshold.
- the sample media file may be, for example, a video file provided by an end user.
- the first reference media file may be, for example, a copyrighted media file, and the sample media file may be a media file to be tested for the presence of content that is substantially similar to content in the first reference media file.
- FIG. 1 shows a computer according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 2 shows a network configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 3 shows an example process according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- a technique to do so may use labeled data, such as pairs of media files that human observers have identified as “matching” or “non-matching”. According to embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, such labeled data or other feature sets may be used efficiently to generate effective feature combinations.
- a set of eight single-hex-digit hashes may be combined to form a four-byte hash function.
- Other types and sizes of hashes may be used.
- the quality or usefulness of the resulting hashes may depend on how well the features are correlated for “matching” pairs of features between a sample (new) media file and one or more reference (known) media files, compared to a similar correlation in random pairs.
- An embodiment of the disclosed subject matter constructs linear combinations of a set of defined features for each pair of sample and known media files.
- the linear combination of those features that give the optimal correlation coefficients (i.e., most-correlated) is then found.
- the highest correlation coefficients then indicate the “best” or preferred features to use in detecting a match of the sample file. More generally, a higher correlation coefficient indicates a feature that is more likely to reliably indicate whether a portion of a sample media file matches a portion of a known media file.
- Techniques as disclosed herein may be viewed as contrasting the probability that a set of hashes for a sample media file matches a known media file, with the probability that it matches random values.
- FIG. 3 shows an example process according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- media file feature definitions may be obtained, where each definition is associated with features of media file content.
- the feature definitions may be preselected from a larger set of potential features, based upon automatic filtering criteria, human-selected attributes, or any other suitable criteria.
- statistics such as, for example, the average value of the raw features, their variances, and/or covariance for pairs of matching and non-matching media files may be generated.
- a sample media file may be, for example, a media file that is to be tested against a set of preexisting media files to determine if a portion of the sample media file is substantially or exactly similar to a portion of a preexisting media file.
- one or more preferred correlation coefficients may be determined based upon the statistics generated at step 320 .
- a “preferred” coefficient may be one that is closest to 1 out of the potential coefficients for the linear combinations. More generally, a “preferred” coefficient may be a coefficient that is closer to 1 than at least one other coefficient for the linear combinations. More generally, an embodiment may consider vector spaces of linear combinations and find an optimal or preferred d-dimensional vector space. That is, for each dimension d a d-dimensional vector space of linear combinations, such that the minimum over it's the correlation coefficients of linear combinations is maximal. Based upon the optimal correlation coefficient identified at 330 , preferred linear combinations may be identified among those generated at step 320 . The preferred linear combinations are those that result in the optimal correlation coefficient.
- an initial set of features may include any number of features, such as 1000 features.
- a set of preferred linear combinations of those features may be limited to the highest-rated, most preferred, or otherwise “best” combinations.
- 64 linear combinations may be used.
- Each of the 64 linear combinations may be specified by 1000 coefficients, one coefficient for each feature, allowing for a set of 64,000 values that can be used in conjunction with feature values to consider similarities between media files.
- Equation 1 may then be set to ⁇ right arrow over (a) ⁇ T C fp ⁇ right arrow over (a) ⁇ , which then gives the ratio of the correlation coefficients on “true” positives and “false” positives instead of r. This may then be optimized that the combinations “are more similar for matching pairs than for non-matching pairs”. However, since the false positives are a relatively small and biased sample of all media files that do not match, C fp should be used as a “correction” to V, i.e., the following should be optimized for some constant ⁇ >0 instead of Equation 1:
- a correction may be made to avoid false indications that may arise, for example, in combinations that happen to have a very low variance.
- the correction may remove unreliable features from those used to compare a sample media file to a reference media file or provide other analytical benefits. For example, if the measured variance of a linear combination is several orders of magnitude below the variance of one term in this linear combination, a slight measuring error in this term will give relatively very large error in the linear combination when the features are normalized to have a variance of 1. In some cases, these features may not be reliable, so it may be useful to exclude features with extremely low variance.
- An example technique for doing so may be to add a small constant to the diagonal elements of the denominator, i.e., take as a matrix in the denominator V+ ⁇ C fp + ⁇ I ⁇ > 0, ⁇ >0 where I is the identity matrix.
- ⁇ should be, for example, relatively small, but large enough to remove at least some of the false positives.
- ⁇ may be chosen such that the highest absolute value of an eigenvalue of ⁇ C fp , is about 1/10 of the highest eigenvalue of V.
- ⁇ n >0 span a vector space V n of dimension n in which ⁇ M ⁇ right arrow over (v) ⁇ 2 ⁇ n ⁇ right arrow over (v) ⁇ 2 for all ⁇ right arrow over (v) ⁇ V n
- ⁇ M ⁇ right arrow over (v) ⁇ 2 ⁇ n ⁇ right arrow over (v) ⁇ 2 for all ⁇ right arrow over (v) ⁇ V n
- the index of the largest feature was computed. It was then determined whether in all groups the index was the same for corresponding video frames in a pair. The comparison considered three criteria: the number of video segments with zero matches; the number of segments with more, the same, or fewer matches; and the number of “interesting” clips with “significantly more or fewer” matches. For purposes of the test, “interesting” clips were considered those where at least one version had less than 10% matches, and “significant” to indicate a difference of at least 2, and more than 5%.

Abstract
Description
Where the covariance and variance have the conventional definitions of:
By assuming that the samples and references have approximately the same distribution, r then becomes
Where CoVar(xi,xi) is the same as Var(xi). This can be viewed as a calculation to determine the best ai given the measured CoVar(xi,xj) and CoVar(xi,yi). In an illustrative example, the former may contain about 1000 values, whereas the latter may include 2 million values, independent of the number of matching media file segments (e.g., video frames) being considered.
V=Q 1 ·T 1 ·Q 1 −1 ,C=Q 2 ·T 2 ·Q 2 −1
With Qi orthogonal matrices (so Qi −1=Q1 T) and Ti a diagonal matrix with positive entries. The diagonal matrix Di may be set such that Di 2=Ti, and the following may be set:
B i :=D i ·Q i −1 =D i ·Q i T
such that B1 T·B1=V and B2 T·B2=C. Then for
{right arrow over (b)}:=B 1 {right arrow over (a)},
Since {right arrow over (a)}≠0 was selected arbitrarily, {right arrow over (b)} is also arbitrary, and the maximal r is given by the largest eigenvalue of MTM, where M=B2B1γ−1).
{right arrow over (a)} T V{right arrow over (a)}′={right arrow over (a)} T B 1 T B 1 {right arrow over (a)}′=<{right arrow over (v)},{right arrow over (v)}′>=0
This indicates that the corresponding combination features
are uncorrelated:
As previously described, it may be presumed that “if media files a and b do not match, then b and a also don't match”, and Cfp may be enforced to be symmetric by replacing it with the average of Cfp and its transpose.
V+η·C fp +μ·Iη>0,μ>0
where I is the identity matrix. The value μ may be chosen such that the resulting eigenvalues are relatively significantly positive; this also enforces the constraint that the matrix is positive definite. This results in a new positive definite symmetric matrix, so that now
{tilde over (B)} 1 T {tilde over (B)} 1 =V+η·C fp +μ·I
In an embodiment, η should be, for example, relatively small, but large enough to remove at least some of the false positives. As another example, η may be chosen such that the highest absolute value of an eigenvalue of ηCfp, is about 1/10 of the highest eigenvalue of V.
λ1≧ . . . ≧λn>0
span a vector space Vn of dimension n in which
∥
This has the consequence that for all {right arrow over (a)}ε{tilde over (B)}1 −1Vn, for {right arrow over (v)}:={tilde over (B)}1{right arrow over (a)}εVn,
For a basis {right arrow over (a)}i:={tilde over (B)}1 −{right arrow over (v)}i, an orthonormal basis {right arrow over (b)}1, . . . , bn′ of B1B1Vn may be found. Then
{right arrow over (a)} i ′V{right arrow over (a)} i ′={right arrow over (a)} i′=<B1 {right arrow over (a)} i ′,B 1 {right arrow over (a)} j ′>=<{right arrow over (b)} i ′,{right arrow over (b)} j′>=δij
Again, the corresponding feature combinations are uncorrelated, and have a variance of 1.

This test was performed comparing raw features, which were selected to have a certain distance to avoid low entropy resulting from the correlation between nearby features, against new combination features. This test may be considered relatively simple, because normally feature wavelet coefficients are used instead of the raw features. The difference is relative small because, for example, for the false positives there are already 0 matches in all but 12 of the 141 video clips.
Quantity | True Matches | False Positives | ||
Zero matches old | 49 | (12%) | 94 | (66%) | ||
Zero matches new | 19 | (4%) | 116 | (82%) | ||
More matches | 291 | (71%) | 19 | (13%) | ||
Same number of matches | 21 | (5%) | 82 | (58%) | ||
Fewer matches | 95 | (23%) | 40 | (28%) | ||
Interesting, more | 232 | (57%) | 5 | (3%) | ||
Uninteresting | 110 | (27%) | 112 | (79%) | ||
Interesting, less | 65 | (15%) | 24 | (17%) | ||
Similar tests which replaced “False Positives” with “random pairs” were performed, and provided similar results.
