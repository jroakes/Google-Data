Definitions
- the disclosed embodiments relate to the creation of web pages viewable on the World Wide Web using a phone calling a service provider server.
- the World Wide Web allows businesses to market their products and services on the Internet by providing access to publicly viewable web pages. Businesses who are able to create web pages can publish them by storing them on web servers. Users can access a web page by entering the web page's uniform resource locator (URL) into a client web browser, or by clicking on a link to the web page while using a web browser or other application. Additionally, a web page may be accessed by users who receive search results from an Internet search engine, where the search results include a link to the web pages. Online advertisements may also provide access to a web page. When a user clicks on an online advertisement having a link to the web page, the user's web browser downloads and displays the web page.
- URL uniform resource locator
- Internet access to corporate web pages may provide companies with increased market visibility, leading to new business opportunities and increased business revenues.
- current methods of creating web pages typically require some degree of technical sophistication or computer programming knowledge. Businesses without access to a technical staff may have difficulty creating custom web pages or other internet marketing tools.
- a web page is composed for an entity using information obtained by a computer-based service provider during a telephone call.
- a user calls the service provider using a telephone having a telephone number associated with the entity.
- the user receives an audible message listing a first set of information, and sends a response that indicates whether the first set of information is accurate with respect to the entity.
- the user also provides a second set of information concerning the entity.
- the user may send a completion command to the service provider via the telephone.
- the service provider generates a publicly accessible web page based on first and second sets of information.
- a user receives by post a mailing that includes a passcode.
- the user calls a service provider using a telephone, and conveys the passcode via the telephone to the service provider.
- the user then receives an audible message listing a first set of information, and sends a response that indicates whether the first set of information is accurate with respect to the entity.
- the user also provides a second set of information concerning the entity.
- the user may send a completion command to the service provider via the telephone.
- the service provider generates a publicly accessible web page based on first and second sets of information.
- a server associated with a server provider receives a telephone call from a telephone having an associated telephone number, which is also associated with an entity.
- the server sends an audible message listing a first set of information, and receives a response (from a user of the telephone) that indicates whether the first set of information is accurate with respect to the entity.
- the server sends an audible prompt to request a second set of information concerning the entity, receives the second set of information concerning the entity, and generates a publicly accessible web page based on the first and second sets of information.
- the server sends to the entity by post a mailing that includes a passcode.
- the server receives a telephone call, and receives the passcode from a user of the telephone. It then sends an audible message listing a first set of information, and receives a response from the user, wherein the response indicates whether the first set of information is accurate with respect to the entity.
- the server also sends an audible prompt to request a second set of information concerning the entity, receives the second set of information concerning the entity, and generates a publicly accessible web page based on the first and second sets of information.
