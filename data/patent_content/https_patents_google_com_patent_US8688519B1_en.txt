Definitions
- the invention relates generally to location-related services and applications. More particularly, aspects are directed to targeted advertising based on time-sensitive information, location information and user demographic information.
- Mobile applications have experienced significant growth as next generation mobile user devices have become available. Advertising is often provided in conjunction with such applications. It is possible to identify certain advertisements of interest based on search engine queries. For instance, content-based systems may retrieve ads that are semantically relevant to a web page being viewed by a user. However, this may not be feasible for mobile applications, and may not identify relevant advertisements in time-sensitive situations.
- systems and methods perform temporal-spatial evaluations on queries and other activities by users of mobile devices to derive keywords that are suitable for highly targeted advertising.
- the targeted advertising may be provided to the same or different users.
- a method for providing targeted advertising information comprises identifying a region of interest around a physical location; receiving actions from any users within the region of interest, the actions being performed on user devices associated with corresponding ones of the users; determining whether the received actions occurred within a given timeframe; obtaining at least one keyword based upon the received actions within the given timeframe; and using the at least one keyword to select a specific advertising element from an advertisement database for use in an advertisement directed to selected users within the region of interest.
- the received actions include at least one of a search query, an action taken in a mapping application, posting information to other users, and real-time communication with another user.
- the at least one keyword may be obtained by identifying a term within one or more of the received actions.
- the at least one keyword is obtained by deriving it based upon information associated with one or more of the received actions.
- the method further comprises identifying a peak in the received actions within the given timeframe; and providing the advertisement to the selected users within the region of interest during a time near the peak.
- the method further comprises identifying a peak in the received actions within the given timeframe; determining whether the received actions are associated with a recurring event within the region of interest; and providing the advertisement to the selected users within the region of interest prior to the peak at a subsequent recurrence of the event.
- the selected users may be identified based on demographic information associated with the selected users or the user devices of the selected users.
- the received actions are queries sent from the user devices and the method further comprises assigning a confidence to the at least one keyword.
- the confidence is selected depending upon at least one of a frequency of the received actions and when the received actions occur within the given timeframe.
- the actions received within the given timeframe are correlated with at least one user interest category.
- the at least one keyword is obtained depending upon the at least one user interest category.
- a system for providing targeted advertising information comprises memory for storing data and a processor.
- the processor is configured to identify a region of interest around a physical location. It is also configured to receive actions from any users within the region of interest and store information associated with the actions in the memory. The actions are performed on user devices associated with corresponding ones of the users.
- the processor is further configured to determine whether the received actions occurred within a given timeframe, obtain at least one keyword based upon the received actions within the given timeframe, and use the at least one keyword to select a specific advertising element from an advertisement database for use in an advertisement directed to selected users within the region of interest.
- the system further comprises means for communicating with the user devices.
- the processor is further configured to transmit the specific advertising element to the selected users for displaying on the user devices of the selected users during a predetermined timeframe.
- the at least one keyword is obtained by the processor identifying a term within one or more of the received actions.
- the at least one keyword is obtained by the processor deriving it based upon information associated with one or more of the received actions.
- the processor is further configured to identify a peak in the received actions within the given timeframe, and to provide the advertisement to the selected users within the region of interest during a time near the peak.
- the processor is further configured to identify a peak in the received actions within the given timeframe, determine whether the received actions are associated with a recurring event within the region of interest, and provide the advertisement to the selected users within the region of interest prior to the peak at a subsequent recurrence of the event.
- the selected users may be identified based on demographic information associated with the selected users or the user devices of the selected users.
- the received actions are queries sent from the user devices and the system assigns a confidence to the at least one keyword.
- the confidence may be selected depending upon at least one of a frequency of the received actions and when the received actions occur within the given timeframe.
- the actions received within the given timeframe are correlated with at least one user interest category.
- the at least one keyword is obtained depending upon the at least one user interest category.
- FIGS. 1A-B illustrate a computer system for use in accordance with aspects of the invention.
- FIGS. 2A-B illustrate a location scenario in accordance with aspects of the invention.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a plot showing user actions occurring within a given timeframe in accordance with aspects of the invention.
- Search engines may process billions of queries every day. Many queries (e.g., free text keywords) come from mobile devices, or from fixed locations such as desktop PCs, that search for local results on maps. Such information may be used as the basis to derive a set of representative queries for different geographical locations. The set of representative queries may be used as content for targeted advertising.
- queries e.g., free text keywords
- the set of representative queries may be used as content for targeted advertising.
- each search query from a mobile user device may include timestamp and user demographic information.
- the queries Q A may also be associated with a particular time t 1 .
- an advertising application may pull or derive keywords from the set Q A to obtain advertisements that are directed to users around location A at the appropriate time.
- a set of queries Q B may come from mobile user devices at or near location B.
- the users generating the queries Q B may be associated with one or more user interest categories (“UICs”).
- UICs user interest categories
- a given UIC may be identified based upon a search cookie or an advertisement cookie stored on the user's device.
- the queries Q B may be used as targeting data for other users associated with the given UIC. This targeting data is used to select relevant advertisements that can be directed to other users associated with that UIC.
- the advertising system may place a high confidence that the targeting data will obtain a relevant advertisement(s) and a greater likelihood that recipients of that advertisement will act on it.
- the advertising system may be part of a computer network as shown in FIGS. 1A-B .
- FIG. 1A this illustration presents a schematic diagram of a computer system depicting various computing devices that can be used alone or in a networked configuration in accordance with aspects of the invention.

- KFF keyhole flat files
- Content and advertising data may be stored in one or more relational databases.
- the data may also be formatted in any computer readable format such as, but not limited to, binary values, ASCII etc.
- the data may include images stored in a variety of formats such as vector-based images or bitmap images using lossless (e.g., BMP) or lossy (e.g., JPEG) encoding.
- the data may include any information sufficient to identify the relevant information, such as descriptive text, proprietary codes, pointers, references to data stored in other memories (including other network locations) or information which is used by a function to calculate the relevant data.
- processors 124 and memory 126 are functionally illustrated in FIG. 1B as being within the same block, it will be understood that the processor and memory may actually comprise multiple processors and memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing or location.
- some or all of the instructions and data may be stored on a removable recording medium such as a CD-ROM, DVD or Blu-Ray disk. Alternatively, such information may be stored within a read-only computer chip.
- Some or all of the instructions and data may be stored in a location physically remote from, yet still accessible by, the processor.
- the processor may actually comprise a collection of processors which may or may not operate in parallel. Data may be distributed and stored across multiple memories 126 such as hard drives, data centers, server farms or the like.
- server 104 and/or server 106 communicate with one or more client computer devices 102 and/or 108 , as well as client devices such as mobile phone 110 and PDA 112 .
- Each client device may be configured with a processor, memory and instructions, as well as one or more user input devices 118 , 120 and a user output device, such as display 122 .
- Each client computer may be a general purpose computer, intended for use by a person, having all the components normally found in a personal computer such as a central processing unit (“CPU”), display, CD-ROM, DVD or Blu-Ray drive, hard-drive, mouse, keyboard, touch-sensitive screen, speakers, microphone, modem and/or router (telephone, cable or otherwise) and all of the components used for connecting these elements to one another.
- CPU central processing unit
- the servers and client devices are capable of direct and indirect communication with other computers, such as over network 116 .
- network 116 may comprise various configurations and protocols including the Internet, intranets, virtual private networks, wide area networks, local networks, private networks using communication protocols proprietary to one or more companies, Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth and HTTP.
- Servers 104 and 106 may be application servers such as web server.
- the information may be sent via a medium such as a disk, tape, CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-Ray disk or directly between two computer systems via a dial-up modem.
- the information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and manually entered into the system.
- the network 100 may also include one or more databases for storing user data and content, map information and advertising data.
- a location/map database 132 may be directly or indirectly coupled to server 104 .
- the location database 132 may be part of or otherwise logically associated with the server 104 .
- the location database 132 may include different sets or types of data.
- the database 132 may maintain location and/or map-related data, which may be stored in one or more KFFs.
- the database 132 may also store the data 130 in one or more KFFs.
- User-related information may be stored in a database 134 .
- Such information may include, for instance, a search query history, a website searching history, map data, instant messaging archives, calendar entries and the like. Given the sensitive nature of this information, the database 134 should securely store the data to prevent unauthorized access. Thus, the data may be encrypted for storage.
- the database 134 is maintained on network 100 separate from the client devices.
- the database 134 may be locally stored in respective client devices, for example in the memory 126 thereof.
- the database 134 comprises multiple databases or is part of another database.
- FIG. 1A also shows that the network 100 may include a content database 136 and an advertisement database 138 . These databases may be stored in different memory systems in the network.
- FIG. 2A illustrates a mapping application showing a map of the San Francisco area in which there is a region of interest 200 .
- the region of interest is, for example, an area around a given physical location.
- the location may be a pair of latitude/longitude coordinates, a street address, a point on an electronic map or a point of interest.
- the point of interest may be a building, arena, monument, etc.
- FIG. 2B shows a close up view of the region 200 in which a number of users 202 are located.
- the region of interest may be, for example, a certain radius such as 50 or 200 meters. Or it may be expressed as being within a number of blocks or bounded by natural borders such as rivers.
- each user may be known from their use of user devices such as laptop 108 , mobile phone 110 and PDA 112 ( FIG. 1A ).
- Each device may communicate with a network and/or with other devices using different protocols and interfaces. For instance, cellular networks, wireless LANs, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. may be used.
- the location of a given device may be determined based upon GPS, triangulation, reverse geocoding and the like.
- the location of a device may be derived indirectly, for instance through that device's interaction with another device with a known location.
- a customer's mobile telephone may use a coupon in a store that has a known location. Thus, the location of the mobile telephone is known at the time when the coupon is used.
- the users of the devices may take some action, such as request information from the network, for example, by sending search queries via a web page or by panning or zooming through a map in a mapping application.
- the search queries may be coupled with location information from the user's device.
- a user may also “tweet” or send an instant message to another user or may play an interactive mobile gaming application with other users in the region 200 or elsewhere.
- Other actions may include visiting websites for businesses or other points of interest within the region 200 via the Internet.
- the system may store certain data concerning the action or information in one or more databases such as location/map database 132 , user database 134 or content database 136 .
- the data preferably includes time-based information.
- users within the region 200 may communicate with one another or search for information about a particular event (e.g., a concert or lecture) that is occurring or will occur.
- a particular event e.g., a concert or lecture
- the users may send queries via web browsers regarding a concert occurring at 9 pm that night, such as “where is the best place to park for the 9 pm concert on Jessie Street” or “looking for tickets to the concert tonight.”
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example 300 of user actions occurring within the region 200 at a certain time range (timeframe).
- the number of actions may exceed some threshold and become significant enough to identify starting at time t 1 .
- the actions may pertain to a concert that will occur in the region 200 .
- the number of actions may increase until they reach a peak at time t 2 , which may be when the concert starts. And then the number of actions may tail off until they fall below the threshold at time t 3 .
- server 104 or other entity in the system may obtain keywords (e.g., “concert,” “tickets” or “parking”) by identifying text or symbols within the actions. Or the keywords may be obtained by deriving them based upon information associated with the action (e.g., a search for a particular item or service). Those keywords may then be used by a server coupled to the ad database 138 to provide targeted advertising to the users within region 200 , or to users outside of region 200 that may be interested in the concert or other item of interest.
- keywords e.g., “concert,” “tickets” or “parking”
- the selected keyword(s) is applied to the ad database to obtain one or more advertisements that can be sent to users.
- information regarding the location of parking lots, discounted seat prices, coupons for souvenirs, etc. may be provided as tailored advertisements at or near the time of the concert.
- actions pertaining to parking and tickets may be given more weight if they occur before the start of the concert (e.g., before time t 2 in FIG. 3 ). The farther apart they are from the peak, the less weight may be applied to the actions. Thus, tweets that discuss parking for the concert which are made around time t 3 may be given much less weight than those made near time t 2 .
- the system may choose not to display advertisements about parking and instead advertise some other service such as a taxi service.
- the system may also identify actions associated with recurring events or events that will occur at some point in the future. For instance, if a concert is held every Friday evening at 9 pm during the summer at region 200 , the system may detect patterns such as that shown in FIG. 3 and identify that the patterns recur every Friday evening. This information may be coupled with other data, such as concert-related information stored in the content database (e.g., on-line ticket sales or merchandising). Thus, the system may leverage this information and begin providing targeted advertising at or prior to time t 1 each Friday. This a priori knowledge provides a substantial advertising advantage.
- the system may further take advantage of user demographics when determining what keywords to employ.
- these demographics may be derived from knowledge about the users, which may be found in the user database 134 , from the user's device, or by the actions taken by the user within the region 200 .
- this information may be used to refine what types of advertisements are provided to the users in region 200 between times t 1 and t 3 .
- one method of analyzing user actions within region 200 employs frequency-based counting.
- every action e.g., search query
- Another method is analogous to the “inverted document frequency” concept.
- the frequency of a given term e.g., “concert” or “tickets”
- the frequency of a given term may be normalized by the number of locations (e.g., points within region 200 ) where the term occurs.
- the frequency may also be normalized by the time(s) when a given term is used.
- a combination of location(s) and time(s) is used (e.g., with spatial-temporal “buckets” or “bins”) to determine where and when a given term is used, and the frequency of its use.
- This allows the system to identify queries or other actions that are unique or more prevalent in one location or area in a given timeframe and to assign those queries/actions a higher rank or weight than others.
- Contextual targeting may be applied to application content or placement targeting.
- Content for contextual targeting may come from a publisher or the content database management system sending content in an ad request URL. Or the content may come from web pages that mirror the application content.
- Yet another method targets mobile applications by automatically issuing a search query for a given application.
- the system may retrieve the top N results from the application. Some or all of the N results may be used as the content or keyword(s) for targeted advertising.
- the processes and operations set forth herein may be implemented directly by one or more hardware-based processors such as sub-processing units in a multiprocessor array.
- the processes and operations may be stored in a computer-readable recording medium such as flash memory, a CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-ray disk, a hard drive and the like for execution by a processor.
- the information may be stored in electronic or digital format as a program for execution by the processor.
