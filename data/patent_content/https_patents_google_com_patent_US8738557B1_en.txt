- This specification relates to evaluating sources that collect information, for example, to determine if the information includes spam.
- Search engines can be configured to receive search queries provided by users and to provide search results that satisfy the search queries.
- a search engine can communicate with multiple client devices, for example, computers, through one or more networks, such as the Internet.
- the search engine can search from an index of resources when it receives a search query.
- the index can be created by crawling multiple resources, each of which is stored, for example, in one or more computer systems.
- the search engine can additionally rank the resources included in the search results according a relevance of each search result to the search query.
- the resources can include information describing business entities that offer services, products, or both.
- a business entity can have a dedicated resource, for example, a website addressed by a unique uniform resource locator (URL), which the search engine can crawl and index.
- a business entity can provide its business information to one or more of several sources that collect information about such entities, for example, the Yellow Pages.
- a source can store the information (including information describing business entities) in a computer system.
- a search engine can crawl and index the stored information. Alternatively, or in addition, the source can provide the stored information to the search engine. When the search engine receives a search query that references a product, service (or both), the search engine can identify, from the index, relevant business information collected and stored by the source.
- a method and system as described identifies business listing characteristics. Aspects of the disclosure provide a computer implemented method for identifying business listings.

- spam listing in the present context generally refers to a business listing that attempts to manipulate a system to falsely drive traffic to particular websites and/or phone numbers.
- a taxi service may indicate that they are located at a particular busy intersection, when in fact they are located across town. Manipulating their business listing in this manner may cause the taxi service to be identified as the nearest service for a user searching for a taxi at the busy intersection. If a user were to call this taxi service, they would be forced to wait while their taxi comes from across town.
- the system and method extract business listings that are provided by various data sources.
- Each data source may be associated with a level of “trust.”
- trust is generally defined as the likelihood that a listing provided by the data source is a spam listing.
- a data source that is easily spammed is typically associated with a lower level of trust than a data source that is not easily spammed.
- An example of a data source that is easily spammed might be a web form that allows a user to submit a business listing with no verification or oversight.
- An example of a data source that is not easily spammed might be a business listing extracted from the telephone book yellow pages.
- aspects of the disclosure identify various business contexts among the listings provided by the data sources.
- the term “context” refers to a set of business listings that typically contain similar sorts of keywords, such as a particular market (e.g., a set of businesses that share a common type of goods or services). For example, a given context may be defined based upon the type of business (e.g., florists, hotels, record stores, plumbers, attorneys, restaurants). Characteristics of businesses in the particular context are extracted for each data source, and the frequency of each particular characteristic is determined for the particular data source. Characteristic frequencies for data sources of different trust levels are then compared to identify characteristics that are identified more frequently in data sources of a first trust level and less frequently in data sources of a second trust level. For example, a term that appears frequently in an untrusted data source but infrequently in a trusted data source may be indicative of a spam listing, since the untrusted data source typically contains a higher number of spam listings.
- FIG. 1 illustrates one example of a system 102 for identifying business listings.
- the system 102 may include a business listing server 104 in communication with client devices 106 - 110 via a network 112 .

- application-level protocols such as HTTP, a combination of any of the aforementioned protocols, or any other type of network protocol.
- Communication between and within the business listing server 104 and the network 112 may be implemented using one or more interfaces, such as Web Services, or Enterprise Service Bus interfaces.
- interfaces such as Web Services, or Enterprise Service Bus interfaces.
- Other examples of interfaces include message passing, such as publish/subscribe messaging, shared memory, and remote procedure calls.
- the business listing server 104 may be at one node of a network 112 and be operative to directly and indirectly communicate with other nodes of the network.
- the business listing server 104 may comprise a web server that is operative to communicate with the client devices 106 - 110 via the network 112 such that the business listing server 104 uses the network 112 to transmit and display information to a user via the client devices 106 - 110 .
- the business listing server 104 may also comprise a plurality of computers that exchange information with different nodes of a network for the purpose of receiving, processing and transmitting data to the client devices.
- the client devices 106 - 110 may be at different nodes of the network than any of the computers comprising the business listing server 104 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting an example of a process flow 200 for spam detection in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- a trusted source 202 and an untrusted source 204 each provide information containing one or more business listings, such as to a business listing server 201 . If the business listing server 201 trusts that information received from a source does not include spam, then the business listing server 201 may designate that source as a trusted source.
- the business listing server 201 can designate a source as a trusted source based on, for example, a reputation of the source or previous dealings with the source or combinations of them. Sources that the pre-computation business listing server 201 does not designate as trusted sources are untrusted sources.
- a trusted source and an untrusted source can be associated with respective identifiers.
- Whether the source is trusted or untrusted can be determined based on the identifiers.
- each source can be identified by a corresponding identifier.
- designations of a source as trusted or untrusted can be manually configured in the business listing server 201 .
- the business listing server 201 can be configured to determine if a source for instance trusted or untrusted based on a reputation of the source, i.e., through previous interactions between the business listing server 104 and the source.
- sources can collect information from business entities in electronic forms, for example, in XML format.
- An electronic form can include fields that correspond to the attributes into which values, for example, text items can be provided.
- the text item that corresponds to a business entity can be “Company X” and the text item that corresponds to the entity's business category can be “Website Designers in Y,” where “Y” is a name of a city.
- both the trusted source 202 and the untrusted source 204 can collect business information about multiple business entities, and transmit the collected information to the business listing server 201 .
- the business listing server 201 can extract the information, for example, by parsing the electronic forms in which the information is received.
- aspects of the invention may also utilize multiple sources of each variety.
- Other aspects of the invention may include additional levels of trust other than “trusted” and “untrusted” reflecting an overall likelihood of a particular listing supplied by the source as being spam.
- a contextual analysis module 206 analyzes the business listings received via the trusted source 202 and the untrusted source 204 .
- Contextual analysis refers to the process by which the business listing server 201 distributes business listings received from each source into a set of contexts, and determines the frequency of listing characteristics within those contexts.
- each business listing may be associated with a type of business. This type may be specified at the time the business listing is created (e.g., by a user), or it may be dynamically determined during contextual analysis based on the business name, location, phone number, website, or other characteristic information.
- the type of business may be used to establish a context to examine characteristic frequency.
- contextual analysis may be performed on all hotels, plumbers, or florists. Other contexts may be further limited, such as by geographical region (e.g., all hotels in New York City).
- the contextual analysis module 206 determines the frequency of business listing characteristics of each business listing in the specified context.
- listing characteristics may include the frequency with which a particular term appears in a listing title, the length of a listing title, a web page, a phone number, a proprietor, whether the title contains a dollar sign, or the like.
- Different contexts typically have different frequencies of particular characteristics, such that a characteristic that might indicate spam in one context does not in another context. For example, a title with many words may be less indicative of spam in one context (e.g., a law firm with many named partners) than in another context (e.g., a restaurant).
- the contextual analysis module 206 identifies a set of trusted characteristics 208 and a set of untrusted characteristics 210 . These characteristics identify the frequency of each characteristic within the contextual set of business listings received via the trusted source 202 and the untrusted source 204 , respectively.
- the set of trusted characteristics 208 and the set of untrusted characteristics 210 are used by the characteristic synthesis module 212 to identify a set of differential characteristics 214 .
- the characteristic synthesis module 212 identifies discrepancies between the frequency values identified in the set of trusted characteristics 208 and the untrusted characteristics 210 . For example, a particular term (e.g., “cheap”) may appear more often in the set of untrusted characteristics 210 than in the set of trusted characteristics 208 , or the average title length may be longer in the set of untrusted characteristics 210 than in the set of trusted characteristics 208 .
- the characteristic synthesis module 212 identifies these discrepancies using statistical analysis methods. Particular characteristics that are present in the set of untrusted characteristics 210 but absent in the set of trusted characteristics 208 may be flagged as suspicious, or indicative of a spam business listing. Characteristics that are present in the set of trusted characteristics 208 but absent in the set of untrusted characteristics 210 may be flagged as trustworthy, or indicative of a legitimate business listing.
- the set of characteristics that are frequently present within one set of characteristics but not the other are identified as a set of differential characteristics 214 .
- the differential characteristics 214 may be used by a spam detection module 216 to identify other listings as spam listings or true listings.
- the trusted source 202 and the untrusted source 204 may continue to provide business listings for use in the system, and the spam detection module 216 identifies listings that contain characteristics identified within the set of differential characteristics 214 .
- the spam detection module 216 may score listings based on the presence or absence of these characteristics, and identify a listing as spam based upon the score. Methods for identifying spam listings in this manner are described further below (see FIGS. 4-7 ).
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram depicting an example of a business listing server 300 , such as the business listing server 104 or the business listing server 201 .
- the business listing server 300 may include a memory 304 in communication with a processor 302 .
- the memory 304 may store information that is accessible by the processor 302 , including instructions 306 that may be executed by the processor 302 , and data 308 .
- the memory 304 may be of any type of memory operative to store information accessible by the processor 302 , including a computer-readable medium, or other medium that stores data that may be read with the aid of an electronic device, such as a hard-drive, memory card, read-only memory (“ROM”), random access memory (“RAM”), digital versatile disc (“DVD”) or other optical disks, as well as other write-capable and read-only memories.

As described above, the contextual analysis module 310 identifies the frequency with which particular characteristics manifest in business listings of a particular context as supplied by trusted and untrusted data sources, such as the business listings 316 .
- the contextual analysis module 310 generates a set of trusted characteristics 318 which identify the frequency of particular characteristics for a particular context received from a trusted data source, and a set of untrusted characteristics 320 which identify the frequency of particular characteristics for the particular context received from an untrusted data source.
- the instructions 306 may further comprise a characteristic synthesis module 312 .
- the characteristic synthesis module 312 compares the frequency of particular characteristics identified within the set of trusted characteristics 318 and the set of untrusted characteristics 320 .
- the characteristic synthesis module 312 identifies discrepancies in the frequency of characteristics between the set of trusted characteristics 318 and the set of untrusted characteristics 320 as differential characteristics 322 .
- This set of differential characteristics 322 may include each characteristic for which a discrepancy is identified, whether the characteristic is associated with legitimate listings or spam listings, and a correlation value (e.g, how strongly the particular characteristic correlates to either spam listings or legitimate listings).
- the instructions 306 may further comprise a spam detection module 314 .
- the spam detection module 314 utilizes the differential characteristics 322 to identify listings as spam listings or legitimate listings based on the characteristics of those listings.
- aspects of the disclosure may also provide similar functionality in a single module, or multiple modules.
- the contextual analysis module 310 may be integrated with the characteristic synthesis module 312 to generate the set of differential characteristics 322 directly from listings provided by the data sources, or the modules may be integrated into a listing hosting module for providing business listings in response to search queries.
- aspects of the instructions 306 may be implemented as software executing on the processor 302 or by various hardware interfaces, such as ASICs, field-programmable gate arrays (“FPGAs”), etc.
- the data 308 may be retrieved, stored or modified by the processor 302 in accordance with the instructions 306 .
- the data may be stored in computer registers, in a relational database as a table having a plurality of different fields and listings, Extensible Markup Language (“XML”) documents or flat files.
- XML Extensible Markup Language
- the data may also be formatted in any computer readable format such as, but not limited to, binary values or Unicode.
- image data may be stored as bitmaps comprised of grids of pixels that are stored in accordance with formats that are compressed or uncompressed, lossless (e.g., BMP) or lossy (e.g., JPEG), and bitmap or vector-based (e.g., SVG), as well as computer instructions for drawing graphics.
- the data may comprise any information sufficient to identify the relevant information, such as numbers, descriptive text, proprietary codes, references to data stored in other areas of the same memory or different memories (including other network locations) or information that is used by a function to calculate the relevant data.
- Portions of the data 308 may comprise one or more business listings 316 , the set of trusted characteristics 318 , the set of untrusted characteristics 320 , and the set of differential characteristics 322 , as described above.
- the business listings 316 comprise a set of business listings as described above. These business listings 316 represent data describing one or more businesses.
- the business listings 316 may store information about the business, such as the business's title, the business's phone number, the description about the business, the business's postal address, the URL for the business' website, the business's hours of operation, or other such business information.
- the business listings may be indexed by a geographic location. For example, the business listings 316 may be searchable by the location of a user to identify businesses in proximity to the user.
- FIG. 3 functionally illustrates the processor 302 and memory 304 as being within the same block, the processor 302 and memory 304 may actually comprise multiple processors and memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. Accordingly, references to a processor, computer or memory will be understood to include references to a collection of processors, computers or memories that may or may not operate in parallel.
- the business listing server 300 may be implemented with additional, different, or fewer components.
- the processor 302 and any other logic or component may be implemented with a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete analog or digital circuitry, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic.
- ASIC application specific integrated circuit
- Logic such as the instructions 306 may be combined or split among multiple programs, distributed across several memories and processors, and may be implemented in or as a function library, such as a dynamic link library (DLL) or other shared library.
- the DLL may store code that implements functionality for a specific module as noted above.
- the DLL may itself provide all or some of the functionality of the system.
- information may be sent via a tangible medium such as an optical disk or portable drive.
- information may be transmitted in a non-electronic format and manually entered into the system.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram depicting an example of a method 400 for identifying suspicious characteristics for a business listing context in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 400 identifies characteristics that distinguish business listings from a trusted source that is unlikely to contain spam listings), from an untrusted source that is likely to contain spam listings. Because the primary difference in the two sets of listings is the fact that one set of listings contains spam, characteristics that distinguish the two sets of listings are likely to correlate directly with spam listings. Once these differential characteristics are determined, they may be used to identify whether a particular listing is a spam listing.
- Different listing contexts e.g., types of businesses
- the terms “flower,” “rose,” and “bouquet,” are more frequently present in the context of florists than for investment banks.
- narrowing the contextual analysis to a particular business listing context results in a set of differential characteristics that are more likely to account for these different vocabularies, and thus produce a set of differential characteristics that results in a greater likelihood of accurate spam detection.
- the term “tickets” might not be associated with spam in the context of a travel agent, but might be in the context of attorneys/legal services (e.g., “Law Offices of X, Y, and Z, We'll Fix Your Traffic Tickets!”).
- the term “bouquet” might be associated with spam in the context of a florist, but not in the context of a wine merchant.
- the term “AAA” might be associated with spam in the context of a locksmith, but not in the context of an automobile club.
- a business listing may be identified as belonging to a particular context by the type of business, the location, or other factors.
- the business listing server 102 may determine a context for a business based upon a type selected by a user. Businesses may also be organized into sub-contexts. For example, a local bank branch and a large investment bank headquarters might both be included in a broad “financial services” context, but in separate sub-contexts, such as “retail banking” and “investment banking”, respectively. These sub-contexts may also be analyzed in a similar manner as broader contexts, and the same methods for detection of spam may apply.
- the trusted listings in the particular context are analyzed to create a set of trusted characteristics.
- the set of trusted characteristics includes a listing of the characteristics identified among the trusted listings and the frequency with which each characteristic appears.
- a set of business listings received via an untrusted source are identified within the same context as those identified from the trusted source at stage 402 .
- a set of untrusted characteristics are created by analysis of the untrusted listings at stage 408 .
- the set of untrusted characteristics includes a listing of the characteristics identified among the untrusted listings and a frequency value for each.
- frequency differentials for characteristics between the trusted and untrusted characteristics are identified. For example, a particular term may appear 25 times in the trusted characteristics, and 100 times in the set of untrusted characteristics, resulting in a ratio of 4 (e.g., the term is four times as likely to be present in listings from the untrusted source than the trusted source), or the average title length among the trusted characteristics may be 4 words, while the average title length among the untrusted characteristics may be 8 words, resulting in a ratio of 2 (e.g., the title length is twice as long on average in listings from the untrusted source as from the trusted source).
- the frequency characteristics may be normalized by the number of samples in each set.
- the characteristic frequency of 25 as identified within the trusted listings may be divided by the number of trusted listings, and the characteristic frequency of 100 as identified within the untrusted listings may be divided by the number of untrusted listings, and the ratio calculated using the normalized values.
- aspects of the method may also include other methods of statistical analysis, such as identification of a number of standard deviations for each characteristic, normalization based on the number of analyzed listings in each set of characteristics, normalized based on the number of total listings in the context, and the like.
- differential characteristics statistically significant differentials between the frequency values are identified as differential characteristics.
- a particular characteristic may be identified a differential characteristic in response to a determination that the differential for the characteristic between the two sets is greater than a threshold value, such as the characteristic appearing in the untrusted characteristics at least 20%, 40%, or 60% more often than in the trusted characteristics, or that a characteristic appears in the untrusted characteristics greater than a particular number of standard deviations over the trusted characteristics.
- the differential characteristics may be used to identify whether a particular listing is likely to be a spam listing (see FIG. 7 ).
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram depicting an example of a method 500 for determining a probability of spam based upon a calculated spam score in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- Spam detection algorithms may return a “score” for each listing. The higher the score, the more likely that the listing is spam. These algorithms typically generate such a score using a variety of criteria. For example, one method of calculating a spam detection score might be: titlescore*lengthfactor+phonepenalty+specialpenalties
- titlescore is a numerical value based on the number of times suspicious terms appear in the listing title
- lengthfactor is a numerical penalty for based on the length of the title
- phonepenalty is a numerical penalty for based on the length of the title
- specialpenalties represent numeric penalties associated with the presence of a particular phone number, and certain special key words, respectively.
- the use of such a method for calculating a spam score results in a numerical value, where a higher value is associated with an increased likelihood that a listing is spam. However, this number in and of itself does not provide a direct way to identify the probability that a listing is spam.
- the range depends on the context, and scores from one context are not commensurate with the likelihood of spam from another context. For example, typical stores for a “hotel” context might be in the range of 0 to 130,000, while for a “taxi” context might range from 0 to 49,000.
- the method 500 thus provides a uniform scoring system to determine a probability for each context.
- a score is determined for a sample of listings in a particular context. For example, the above-described score algorithm might be applied to all of the listings associated with a particular context. Each of the sample listings is thus associated with a “raw” score, such as the 0 to 130,000 value described above with respect to the “hotel” context.
- the score space (e.g., each listing and its associated score) is divided into a set of “buckets.”
- Each bucket is associated with a range of scores, and each listing is associated with the bucket that applies to its score. For example, if bucket 1 is associated with score range 0 to 10,000, bucket 2 with 10,001 to 20,000, and bucket 3 with 20,001 to 30,000, a listing with a score of 5,000 would be associated with bucket 1.
- the average score of each bucket is determined by adding together the score values for the bucket, and dividing by the number of listings associated with the bucket.
- the ratio of spam listings to the total number of listings for each bucket is determined. This ratio may be identified by user examination of each listing in the bucket, or by various other spam detection methods.
- a closed form function is identified using the average score of each bucket and the ratio of the number of spam listings in the bucket to the total number of listings in the bucket.
- This function may be identified by performing a curve-fitting operation to identify the function that fits the (average, ratio) data points the best for all of the buckets.
- the most appropriate class of function is a sigmoid curve, due to the fact that sigmoid curves are smooth and monotonically strictly increasing (e.g., as the score increases, the value of the function increases).
- Such curves can also be scaled so that their values are bounded by 0 and 1 (e.g., probability values).
- one possible curve family is defined by the following form suitable for logistic regression:
- a and b are values that define the sigmoid curve.
- One method of determining these values is by the function:
- the values (x,y) in Eq. 2 range over the (average, ratio) data points derived from the buckets at stages 506 and 508 .
- a function minimizer may be run to find the values of a and b that give a minimal value to f(a,b).
- the resulting values of a and b identify a function ⁇ a,b (x) that maps a particular spam score to the probability of being a spam listing for the particular context.
- the probability that a particular listing is a spam listing in a particular context may be determined by mapping the spam score along the curve identified at stage 510 , where the x input value is the spam score and the y output value is the probability that the listing is spam for the particular context.
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram depicting an example of a method 600 for determining a probability threshold for identification of spam in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- different contexts may also require different cutoff thresholds for identifying a listing as spam. For example, for a particular context, any listing with a computed spam probability greater than 0.85 turns out to be a spam listing. In such a case, specifying a cutoff value of 0.99 would miss many spam listings. However, lowering the cutoff too far increases the risk of false positives. Since different contexts have different likelihoods of false positives, it is appropriate to identify a specific cutoff for each context.
- the method 600 begins with a determination of spam scores for a sample of listings in the particular context at stage 602 .
- the listings are ranked in order of their associated spam score.
- Different cutoff thresholds are identified between the listings. For example, a cutoff threshold may be identified as the midpoint between each adjacent listing, such that two adjacent listings with spam scores of 50 and 100, respectively, would create a potential cutoff threshold of 75.
- each possible cutoff value is evaluated based on the potential for false positives.
- One method of calculating the validity of each cutoff value is represented by the following function:
- the optimal cutoff is determined. Maximizing the value of F( ) by picking the cutoff with the greatest value of F from among the choices, gives an estimate of the best cutoff.
- the cutoff may be determined from a set of ⁇ cutoff from maximizing F, cutoff giving a probability of spam greater than about 0.9, cutoff giving precision greater than about 0.95 ⁇ , by choosing the greatest of the three values. The latter two values (probability greater than about 0.9, precision greater than about 0.95) provide “safety conditions” to ensure that a cutoff value with a high number of false positives is not chosen due to a low maximum value of F due to a large recall value.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram depicting an example of a method 700 for identifying whether a business listing is spam in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 700 utilizes the differential characteristics (see FIG. 4 ), the probability for the particular context based on a spam score (see FIG. 5 ), and a context-specific threshold derived for the particular context (see FIG. 6 ), to determine whether a particular listing should be identified as a spam listing.
- the method 700 may be applied to listings as they are newly received from the data sources, or listings already stored on the business listing server may periodically be evaluated.
- a context is identified for a business listing that is to be evaluated for spam.
- the context may be identified by a particular type of business as specified in the listing, or it may be determined by the business listing server based on other characteristics of the business listing.
- the context of the business determines the differential characteristics, the probability conversion, and the context-specific threshold that are used to evaluate the business listing as spam or not.
- the business listing is evaluated using context-specific differential characteristics. As described above (see FIG. 4 ), certain characteristics within a particular context tend to indicate that a listing is a spam listing. These characteristics may be previously defined in an “off-line” processing manner, such that the evaluation of the business listing may be conducted in an efficient manner.
- a spam score for the listing is assigned at stage 706 .
- the spam score reflects the presence or absence of various differential characteristics within the business listing.
- the probability that the listing is spam is determined by using a function to identify the position of the spam score on a context-specific curve (see FIG. 5 ).
- the function maps the spam score to a particular probability value associated with the context in which the business listing is evaluated.
- the probability is compared to a context-specific threshold.
- the context-specific threshold represents a cutoff value above which it is highly likely that the given business listing is a spam listing. This threshold is derived from a precision value and a recall value for various possible cutoff values (see FIG. 6 ).
- the listing is reported as spam at stage 714 . Otherwise, the listing is identified as not spam at stage 712 .
- the method 700 ends after determining whether the listing is spam, though it may be repeated or performed in parallel on multiple listings, all listings in a particular context, or a subset of all listings in a particular context.
- stages of the illustrated methods described above are not intended to be limiting.
- the functionality of the methods may exist in a fewer or greater number of stages than what is shown and, even with the depicted methods, the particular order of events may be different from what is shown in the figures and include additional stages or omit stages as shown.
- aspects of the disclosure advantageously provide for an efficient way to identify business listing characteristics that are indicative of spam, and then use those characteristics to detect spam listings.
- detection accuracy is greatly approved.
- Performing differential characteristic identification in an off-line manner advantageously improves the efficiency of spam detection operations, and context-specific identification of listing spam probability and identification cutoff thresholds improves detection accuracy and eliminates potential false positive reports.
