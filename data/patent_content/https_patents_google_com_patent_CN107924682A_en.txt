Fig. 2 is turned to, which is the block diagram that diagram is used to train the example system 200 of neutral net 206.Complete Fig. 2 figures
During the training stage shown, trained neutral net 206 perhaps can handle the data of the language of characterization speaker, and generate
The speaker of the distinguishing characteristics of the sound of the instruction speaker of words person represents.Then, generate speaker's during registration phase
Speaker models or during Qualify Phase verify speaker identity when, the speaker represent can be by speaker verification
Model uses.
Generally, Fig. 2 illustrate can according to later perform speaker verification task client terminal device at occur
Registration and Qualify Phase parallel form train neutral net 206.With training neutral net 206 to come from limited quantity
Speaker training language be categorized into each respective classes in speaker certain methods it is different, be not to determine given words
The specific speaker of language and train the neutral net 206 in Fig. 2.On the contrary, training neutral net 206 is represented with generating speaker,
This speak represent be it is unique and available for determine given language speaker whether speaker's phase with another language set
Together, without by any language in language and specific speaker's identities match.In this manner it is achieved that optimize during the training period
Loss function is the same functions that speaker verification model utilizes during Qualify Phase.In other words, during verification, by base
Represented in the speaker of verification language compared with the speaker models of the user registered.If speaker represents and speaker's mould
Type is similar enough, then the identity of the speaker of authentication language.The method described in fig. 2 is during the training period using similar
Technology.Represented namely based on the speaker of one or more registration language to generate simulation speaker models 214, and be also
Simplation verification language 202 generates speaker and represents 208.The weighted value and other parameters of neutral net 206 are adjusted during the training period
It is categorized as with minimizing by simplation verification language 202 by language 204a to 204n is identical or different speaks from simulation registration
The mistake occurred when person says.
Fig. 2 depict based on training data sample (including the data of characterization simplation verification language 202 and characterization one or
The data of multiple simulation registration language 204a to 204n) the forward direction of individualized training iteration pass through.In fact, pass through many iteration
Neutral net 206 is trained with many different training data samples.For each iteration, processing can be based on and be used for accordingly repeatedly
The result of the corresponding training data sample in generation adjusts neutral net 206.Fig. 4 A and Fig. 4 B being described further below are depicted
The example technique of simplation verification language 202 and simulation registration language 204a to 204n can be selected by it.The mould of specific sample
It is usually all the language said by identical trained speaker to intend registration language 204a to 204n.Although simulation registration language 204a is extremely
The speaker of 204n can be different in the different training data samples for different trained iteration, but for giving
In the given training sample of training iteration, register all registration language in language 204a to 204n and usually said by identical training
Words person says.Simplation verification language 202 may be via the training identical with the speaker of simulation registration language 204a to 204n
Speaker says, or may be said via the training speaker different from the speaker of simulation registration language 204a to 204n
Go out.In simplation verification language 202 and simulation registration both language 204a to 204n it is identical training data for speaker
Sample, can be " matching " sample by the sample labeling.In simplation verification language 202 and language 204a is registered for speaker extremely
It is different training data samples in 204n, can is " non-matching " sample by the sample labeling.Label can represent to train sample
This true classification, and can be before training pretreatment stage in determine.In some embodiments, will can be based on
The estimation classification to training sample of the output of neutral net 206 is compared with the true classification of the label instruction by training sample
To determine whether to adjust neutral net 206.
In some embodiments, the data in training sample may not be simplation verification and registration language 202,204a
To the original audio signal of 204n.On the contrary, language 202,204a to 204n may it is processed and be converted into for by
The appropriate format that neutral net 206 is handled.For example, the data in training sample can characterize simplation verification and registration is talked about
Each feature of language 202,204a to 204n, rather than original audio signal is in itself.In some embodiments, training sample is represented
The data of each in simulation language 202,204a to 204n in this can include be used for corresponding language one or more
A logarithmic filtering device group.In some embodiments, each language can be segmented into multiple frames of language in time, and
It can be the single logarithmic filtering device group of each frame generation of language.For example, it can use, for example, 40 logarithmic filtering device groups
To represent each frame of language.
In some embodiments, can be by neutral net 206 come the once processing characterization mould (that is, in once-through)
Intend the data of each in the data and characterization simulation registration language 204a to 204n of verification language 202.Therefore, even if will use
Multiple frames by corresponding logarithmic filtering device set expression are segmented into the training data of given language, can also be whole by characterization
The data of all frames of language are input in neutral net 206 (for example, as each 80 with 40 logarithmic filtering device groups
80 × 40 feature vectors of frame) to be handled in once-through neutral net.This with by for each frame of language
Data are individually input in neutral net 206 to be contrasted to carry out individually processing to frame.In other embodiments, can be with
The data of characterization language 202, the single frame of 204a to 204n are provided as input to neutral net 206, rather than training
Neutral net 206 characterizes the overall number of each language 202,204a to 204n to be handled in once-through neutral net 206
According to.
In some embodiments, it can verify and register come preprocess analog according to one or more kinds of supplementary technologies and talk about
Language 202,204a to 204n.For example, the structure of neutral net 206 may need train language all have regular length (for example,
The audio of 0.8 second).Therefore, at least some in language 202,204a to 204n can be that longer language is cut into unification
Length, and/or some shorter language are filled to make the result of longer editing.However, in other embodiments, nerve
Network 206 perhaps can handle the language of variable-length, in this case, language 202,204a to 204n in training data
It may not be cut or be filled into regular length.Language 202,204a to 204n audio may also be balanced, and
Noise may have been with the addition of or noise is eliminated into 204n from training language 202,204a to ensure that neutral net is instructed
Practice into steadily performing in the presence of noise.
Data due to characterizing multiple simulation registration language 204a to 204n are used to generate simulation registration language 204a extremely
The simulation speaker models 214 of the specific trained speaker of 204n, therefore, the partial simulation in dotted line frame 215 of system 200
The registration phase of speaker verification process.Characterization is simulated into registration language 204a to 204n at the input layer of neutral net 206
In the corresponding data of each individually enter in neutral net 206.Neutral net 206 passes through one or more hidden layer
To handle data, and generate corresponding speaker for each in simulation registration language 204a to 204n and represent 210a extremely
210n.For example, as shown in Figure 2, speaker's table is generated based on simulation registration language 1 (204a) by neutral net 206
Show 1 (210a).Equally, 2 (210b) are represented to generate speaker based on simulation registration language 2 (204b) by neutral net 206.Cause
This, each in language 204a to 204n is registered for simulation, can be represented by neutral net 206 to generate speaker.
In some embodiments, by serially handling each in simulation registration language 204a to 204n via neutral net 206
210a to 210n is represented to generate speaker.In some embodiments, registered for simulation every in language 204a to 204n
One, the data that 204a to 204n can be characterized by using each example parallel processing of neutral net 206 generate at the same time
Speaker represents 210a to 210n.Simulation registration language 204a corresponding words into 204n are such as based on by neutral net 206
What language determined, speaker represents that 210a to 210n typically each includes the difference feature for representing the sound of simulation registration training speaker
Value class set.In some embodiments, speaker represents that 210a to 210n can indicate last of neutral net 206
The weighted value or other parameters of hidden layer.In some embodiments, when neutral net 206 is configured without softmax
During output layer, speaker represents that 210a to 210n can be the final output of neutral net 206.
As shown in the frame 212 of Fig. 2, in order to generate simulation speaker models 214, speaker's expression can be calculated
The average of 210a to 210n.Therefore, simulation speaker models 214 can define expression simulation registration language 204a to 204n's
The class set of the value of the difference feature of the sound of training speaker.The average of 210a values 210n is represented by calculating multiple speakers
It to determine simulation speaker models 214, can become the voice of the speaker in different simulation registration language 204a to 204n
Change smooth.Therefore, simulation speaker models 214 can be that the single speaker of ratio of the sound of speaker represents 210a to 210n
In any one more reliable expression, which represents that 210a to 210n can individually be reflected to cover half and intend stepping on
Remember the speciality of language 204a to 204n.
In some embodiments, the simulation registration language in each training data sample for each trained iteration
The sum of 204a to 204n can change.For example, the first training sample for the first training iteration can include 9 moulds
Intend registration language 204a to 204n.Registered however, the second training sample for the second training iteration can only include 4 simulations
Language 204a to 204n.In other embodiments, can be fixed in each training data sample of each trained iteration
Simulation registration language 204a to 204n sum.For example, neutral net 206 can be trained by series of iterations, at this
In series of iterations, the training data set for each iteration includes 5 simulation registration language 204a to 204n altogether.One
In a little embodiments, trained iteration can be performed using the training sample for only including single simulation registration language 204a to 204n
In one, some or all.
The phase that speaker represents 210a to 210n is generated according to the data that registration language 204a to 204n is simulated from characterization
Same mode, can represent 208 from the data generation speaker of characterization simplation verification language 202.Can be by characterization simplation verification words
The data (for example, logarithmic filtering device class value of the feature of characterization verification language 202) of language 202 are provided to the defeated of neutral net 206
Enter layer.Then neutral net 206 handles input by one or more hidden layer of network.The output of neutral net 206
It is that speaker represents 208, which represents that the area of the sound of the speaker of simplation verification language 202 is said in 208 definition instructions
The class set of the value of other feature.
In order to further make the Qualify Phase during the training of neutral net 206 parallel, for example, can be by verifying
Speaker verification model during period will be talked about according to by the same way occurred on client terminal device based on simplation verification
The speaker of language 202 represents 208 compared with simulation speaker models 214.In some embodiments, can be by taking
(1) define simulation speaker represent 208 value class set primary vector and (2) define the values of simulation speaker models 214
The COS distance of the secondary vector of class set compares (as shown in block 216) to perform.Then can be to distance applications logic
Return 218 and whether the training speaker of simplation verification language 202 is said with saying simulation registration language 204a to 204n with estimation
Training speaker it is identical or different.For matching speaker's classification, this is represented with first box 220a in fig. 2, and
For non-matching speaker's classification, represented with second frame 220b.In some embodiments, it can apply and be different from logic
Whether the sorting technique for returning 218 registers the training speaker of language 202 with saying simulation registration language on saying simulation
The training speaker of 204a to 204n is identical or different is determined.For example, in some alternative solutions, hinge (hinge)
Layer or softmax layers can be used for classifying.In two class model shown in figure 2, softmax and logistic regression technique
Same or similar majorized function can be used.
As represented as frame 222, the speaker that may then based on simplation verification language 202 represents that 208 speak with simulation
The comparative result of person's model 214 adjusts the weighted value of neutral net 206 or other parameters.If for example, by training sample
Labeled as truly with non-matching speaker, by training sample be wrongly classified as with matching speaker, then can adjust automatically
Whole neutral net 206 is to correct mistake.More generally, speaker's sample can be matched to maximize with optimization neural network 206
The score that similarity score or optimization are exported by logistic regression, and can be with optimization neural network 206 to minimize non-
The score that similarity score or optimization with speaker's sample are exported by logistic regression.In some embodiments, to nerve
The adjustment of network 206 can occur in response to the result of each training sample for each trained iteration, or can be with base
Result more only in training iteration adjusts neutral net 206.In some embodiments, neutral net can be adjusted
206 represent that the distance between 208 and simulation speaker models 214 is (that is, maximum with the speaker maximized in non-matching speaker
Change difference), while minimize the distance between speaker's expression 208 of matching speaker and simulation speaker models 214
(that is, minimizing difference).Note that in some embodiments, may be without training sample be classified during the training stage
To belong to the hard decision of matching speaker's classification 220a or non-matching speaker's classification 220b.On the contrary, can according to optimization by
The score or optimize the mode of one or more other measurement to adjust neutral net 206 that logistic regression layer 218 exports.
Referring now to Fig. 3, Fig. 3 is to show that training can be used for the instantiation procedure of the neutral net of speaker verification model
300 flow chart.In some embodiments, can be by computing system described herein (such as, the computing system from Fig. 1
120 and the computing system 200 from Fig. 2) carry out implementation procedure 300.
Process 300 is since the stage 302, in the stage 302, selects the first training data set (that is, the first training sample
This).The data that the first training data set can include characterization simplation verification language are stepped on one or more simulation is characterized
Remember the data of language.Since the language in gathering in training according to the registration for making speaker verification during t raining period and is tested
Card stage pipeline or the registration of " simulation " speaker verification and the mode of Qualify Phase are used for training process, and therefore, they are
" simulation ".However, these language are typically the actual fragment of the speech said by training speaker of record in itself.Training is said
Words person is not usually the identical speaker that language is provided during the actual enrollment of speaker verification process and Qualify Phase.Below
Fig. 4 A and Fig. 4 B further described is depicted for selecting simplation verification and registering the example technique of language.
Can be indicated whether according to the training data set (that is, the sample of selection) of selection matching speaker voice or
The sample of non-matching speaker marks the training data set of selection (that is, the sample of selection).If simplation verification language
Speaker is identical with the speaker of simulation registration language, then by training data set labeled as matching speaker's sample.If mould
The speaker for intending verification language is different from the speaker of simulation registration language, then training data set is spoken labeled as non-matching
Person's sample.In some embodiments, can be determined later in training process 300 using label to training dataset cooperation
It is whether accurate for matching or the estimation of non-matching sample classification.
In some embodiments, the training data set of selection can not include simplation verification and register the original of language
Audio signal, but the data of the feature including characterizing language.For example, can be determined by the frame of the regular length for language
Logarithmic filtering device group set is characterized in each language represented in training data set.Then can be by each frame of language
Logarithmic filtering device group connects to the single set for the input value for being provided as input to neutral net and characterizing whole language.
In the stage 304 and 306 of process 300, for each in the language that is characterized in the first training data set
Language determines that speaker represents.Speaker represents that may each be indicator represents corresponding speaker to say the training of corresponding language
The class set of the value of the distinguishing characteristics of the sound of speaker.For example, first speaker's table can be generated based on simplation verification language
Show, and each that can be registered based on simulation in language is represented to generate corresponding second speaker.In order to generate speaker
Represent, the data for characterizing language are provided to the input layer for the neutral net being trained to.Then, neutral net pass through network one
A or multiple hidden layers handle input data.Speaker's expression is exactly the output of neutral net.In some embodiments,
It is not to export the output at softmax layers of output layer.The end layer for providing output can be full connection linear layer.At some
In embodiment, speaker represents that the value or neutral net generated at last hidden layer of neutral net can be included in
Last hidden layer activation, rather than the output of sofmax output layers.In some embodiments, can be by nerve net
Network is configured to do not have softmax output layers.
In the stage 308, combination is represented to create simulation speaker models with the corresponding speaker of simulation registration language.
Simulation speaker models can be the average value that the speaker of simulation registration language represents.By calculating being averaged for speaker's expression
Value, it may be determined that the reliable model of the sound of characterization training speaker.For example, speaker can be made to say in simulation registration language
Each mode change smoothness so that using with the speaker of simplation verification language represent compared with it is sane
Baseline.In some embodiments, process 300 can only select the subset that the speaker of simulation registration language represents to generate
It is combined when simulating speaker models.For example, it may be determined that in simulation registration language or corresponding simulation registration language
The quality of each is measured.Then, process 300 can only select to meet those speakers of threshold quality score represent or
Its corresponding language of person meets that those speakers of threshold quality score are represented to be included in for generating simulation speaker models
Represent in set.
In the stage 310, the speaker of simplation verification language is represented to compare with simulation speaker models.In some realities
Apply in mode, be categorized as representing matching speaker by data sample or do not indicate that matching speaker using binary classifier.
In some embodiments, compare can include determining that simplation verification language speaker represent with simulation speaker models it
Between degree of similarity.For example, degree of similarity can be the vector and simulation speaker models of the value represented in speaker
COS distance between the vector of value.Then degree of similarity can be used for that the classification of the first training data set will be estimated as
Match speaker's sample or non-matching speaker's sample.For example, if similarity measurement is sufficiently high (for example, meeting threshold value phase
Like degree score), then training data set can be mapped into matching speaker's classification using logistic regression.On the other hand, such as
Fruit similarity measurement is too low (for example, being unsatisfactory for threshold similarity score), then can be using logistic regression come by training dataset
Conjunction maps to non-matching speaker's classification.
Next, in the stage 312, can be represented based on the speaker in simplation verification language in the stage 310 with
The result of the comparison between speaker models is simulated to adjust one or more parameter of neutral net.If for example, will instruction
To practice data markers be non-matching speaker's sample, then can adjust the weight or neutral net of each node in hidden layer
Other parameters represent and simulate the distance (reduction similarity score) between speaker models to increase in speaker.In addition, such as
Training data labeled as matching speaker's sample, then can be adjusted weight or the other parameters of neutral net to reduce by fruit
Speaker represents the distance between simulation speaker models (increase similarity score).Typically, since training process 300 is every
A iteration is intended to simulate corresponding registration phase and corresponding Qualify Phase, so, neutral net can be adjusted with speaker verification
Period optimizes the loss function identical with the loss function applied during actual enrollment and Qualify Phase.One benefit of this method
Place is to train neutral net preferably to generate the identity that can be used for speaker verification model and more accurately verify speaker
Speaker represents.For example, in some embodiments, the actual verification phase for the language not accounted for when when training neutral net
Between do not take additional post-processing step.It is therefore contemplated that these technologies are for training neutral net " end-to-end " method.
Finally, in the stage 314, next training data set is selected for another iteration of training neutral net.Again,
The training data set selected in this stage can include the data of characterization simplation verification language and characterize one or more
The data of simulation registration language.Process 300 then can be with duplication stages 304 to 312, and continue selection and be used to add trained change
The training data set in generation is until reaching limitation.In some embodiments, limitation may be due to making all available training datas
Expire and cause.In some embodiments, process 300 can continue, until reaching target performance level.For example, some
After training iteration, the untapped data retention set test neutral net during training process 300 can be directed to.Training can
To continue, until being at least up to target performance level to the test instruction neutral net for retaining set.
Referring now to Fig. 4 A and Fig. 4 B, which is to show to be used to select training data set to say for training
Words person verifies the schematic diagram of the example technique of the neutral net of model.In some embodiments, described for Fig. 4 A and Fig. 4 B
Technology may insure the diversity of the training language selected in many trained iteration, this can cause to be better carried out giving
The neutral net of the training language of quantity.
In some embodiments, multiple groups of 410a can will be collected as with all or part in training language
To 410n.This group of 410a to 410n can be further arranged into the language pond 408 of the class set including training language group.One
In a little embodiments, training language can be grouped according to speaker.For example, group 410a includes all being said by first
Multiple language that words person says, and organize multiple language that 410n includes all being said by another speaker.Therefore, 410a is organized extremely
Each group in 410n can be corresponding from different speakers.Group 410a to 410n can train words comprising identical quantity
Language, or the quantity of training language can change in different groups in group 410a to 410n.
For each trained iteration, language pond 408 can be accessed, and can be that will be used as input in corresponding training iteration
The training data samples selection particular utterance of middle application.For example, Fig. 4 A are shown as input sample 402 from for training iteration
Language pond 408 in a randomly selected training data set.It can be selected from the group 410a in language pond 408 into 410n
First group of language corresponding with the first speaker simulates speaker models for use in generation.Can be at random or according to other sides
Formula selects group.From the group (for example, group 410a in Fig. 4 A) of selection, the subset of language of the first speaker is selected as defeated
Enter the simulation registration language 406 in sample 402.The subset generally includes multiple language, and can include with from a training
Iterate to identical or varying number the language of another trained iteration.The group for carrying out oneself selection can be randomly choosed (for example, group
Language 410a), so that generating the difference of the first speaker using the various combination of language in different trained iteration
Simulate speaker models.
It is also an option that language 404 is used as simplation verification language.Whether matched with registration language 406 according to training iteration
Either non-matching example language 404 can be the language of the first speaker or different speakers.Matching and non-matching example
All it is used to train.Therefore, for some training iteration, language 404 is the language of the first speaker, for example, in group 410a
Language.As shown in Figure 4 A, for other trained iteration, language 404 is second speakers different from the first speaker
Language, so that input sample 402 does not indicate that the matching between simplation verification language 404 and simulation registration language 406.
In the example of Fig. 4 A, selection (for example, random selection) particular utterance is as simulation from second group of language 410n
Verify language 404.In some embodiments, can be randomly choosed from the group 410a in language pond 408 into 410n or root
Second group of language (language 404 is selected from second group of language) is selected according to the pattern of change selection group 410a to 410n.
In other embodiment, it can be randomly choosed to determine whether apply from speaker's phase with simulation registration language
Another language of same speaker is as simplation verification language.Therefore, perhaps deviation random selection, so that simplation verification is talked about
It with the probability of the language of the identical speaker of speaker of simulation registration language 406 is 50 percent that language 404, which will be,.If with
Machine selection the result is that input sample 402 will be matching speaker's sample, then can from selection simulate registration language 406 if
Simplation verification language 404 is selected in the identical language group 410 of language group.It is but if randomly selected the result is that input sample 402
It will be non-matching speaker's sample, then can be selected from the different language group 410 of the language group that registration language 406 is simulated from selection
Simplation verification speech 404 is selected, the language group 410 and different speakers are corresponding.
In general, the selection technique indicated by Fig. 4 A can allow the language by the various combination from speaker to apply not
In same training iteration.For example, in the first training iteration, simulation registration language may be said via the first speaker, and
And simplation verification language may also be said via the first speaker.In the second training iteration, simulation registration language may be
Said via the second speaker, and simplation verification language may be said via the 3rd speaker.Then, change in the 3rd training
Dai Zhong, simulation registration language may be said via the first speaker, and simplation verification language may speak via second
Person says.In some embodiments, following selection algorithm can be used, the selection algorithm does not randomly choose language group 410a extremely
410n, but according in simplation verification and register create between the speaker of language different displacements in input sample 402 or
Person maximizes the mode of displacement quantity in input sample 402 deterministically to select language group 410a to 410n.As letter
Single example, can be nine if three groups of language A, B and C from three different training speakers can be used in language pond 408
