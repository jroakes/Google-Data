Definitions
- An image retrieval system is a computer system for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a repository of digital images.
- Many image retrieval systems add metadata, e.g., captioning, keywords, or descriptions, to the images so that retrieval can be performed utilizing the metadata.
- This type of search is called an image meta search. It allows a user to look for images using keywords or search phrases.
- a user can receive a set of images that can reference image resources, e.g., thumbnail images, and can be sorted by relevancy.
- a user can perform an image search by searching for image content using an input query.
- the relevant images are presented to a user and the user can browse the relevant images for a desired image.
- An image presented can include a static, graphic representative of some content, for example, photographs, drawings, computer generated graphics, advertisements, web content, book content or a collection of image frames, for example, a movie or a slideshow.
- An interactive computer environment allows a user of a client to browse sets of images for a desired, target image.
- a user of a client provides an image search query to a system.
- the system analyzes the image search query and
- the analysis can be performed by a related-query engine.
- the initial image search query and the plurality of related image queries are sent to an image search engine. Panels of images are obtained from the image search
- the panels can include a number of images associated with respective search queries. Specifically, the panels can include tiled images associated with respective search queries. These panels are used to provide an image space.
- the center of the image space can be a panel representing image results for the initial search query and can be surrounded by panels representing image results for the plurality of search queries related to the initial search query.
- a user of a client can browse the image space provided to a client display by panning in all directions and zooming in and out of view. As the user of the client pans the display in a specific direction more and more related query panels are created by the related-query engine in conjunction with the image search engine.
- the client display can pan out indefinitely or until an end of related query searches is reached. If the user of the client finds a relevant panel, the client display can zoom into the panel and the user can view the related query and browse all images associated with this query. If a target image is found, the user of the client can click on the displayed image and be provided with a landing page. If no target image is found, the client display can zoom out and a search can continue.
- the methods comprise the steps of receiving an initial image query.
- a plurality of search queries related to the initial search query are determined.
- Image results for the initial search query and the plurality of related search queries are obtained.
- a panel of images representing a number of images from the initial search query and panels of images representing a number of images from the plurality of related search queries are generated. These panels are used to provide an image space.
- the image space can be centered on the panel representing the resultant images related to the initial search query and can be surrounded by panels representing the resultant images related to the plurality of related search queries.
- the system is capable of receiving at least one input to browse the image space and modify the image space responsive to the at least one input.
- the image space can be modified by panning the image space in an x-y direction or zooming into and out in the z-direction.
- the particular panel can be expanded to show all images associated with an image query related to that panel.
- the related queries engine can produce more related search queries by additively weighing adjacent queries.
- a related queries engine can account for viewed panels so they are not shown again.
- the related queries engine can also create a back edge for the initial search query in order to reduce a possibility of dead ends.
- the related queries engine can split keywords of a query into at least two sections and perform a related query search on at least one of the sections.
- the system can also receive at least one input indicating a target image was found and provide a landing page associated with the target image.
- a system comprises one or more processors and one or more computer-readable storage mediums containing instructions configured to cause the one or more processors to perform operations.
- the operations can include receiving an initial image query.
- a plurality of search queries related to the initial search query can be determined.
- Image results for the initial search query and the related search queries are obtained.
- a panel of images representing a number of images from the image search engine resulting from the initial search query, and panels of images representing a number of images from the image search engine resulting from the plurality of related search queries are generated. These panels are used by the system to provide an image space. The image space can be centered on the panel
- a computer-program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage medium can include instructions configured to cause a data processing apparatus to receive an initial image query.

- This interactive computer environment and system is more efficient and reliable since it reduces the time necessary to find a desired image. It also utilizes less resources, while providing greater flexibility, when searching for an image.
- Figure 1 is a flow chart showing an example process for providing image search results
- Figure 2 is a flow chart showing an example process for modifying an image space
- Figures 4-8 are pictorial representations of an example method for obtaining related search queries;
- Figures 9-13 are example representations of image spaces used in accordance with the disclosed technology;
- Figure 14 is a block diagram of an example of a search system used with the disclosed technology.
- Figure 15 is a block diagram of an example of a system used with the disclosed technology.
- An interactive computer environment and system that can be used as an exploration tool for viewing and navigating search queries and related search queries results.
- the system allows a user of a client to visually explore a variety of search results related to a query by efficiently exploring image data sets and related image data sets. Search results are laid out such that each individual search result set is viewed as a separate entity when viewed in a close view.
- the user of the client can zoom out and explore related queries as though they exist in an infinite plane in every direction, and zoom back into individual results to interact with them, as needed.
- the image space can be defined as a visual representation of image resources and can be presented to a user of a client on a display or a similar device, as will be described more fully below.
- images are searched, however, the system is capable of applying the disclosed technology to any data where searches can be applied including video, text documents, audio, meta-data and others.
- FIG. 1 is a flow diagram of an example of a method for providing image search results.
- Image search results generally include versions of image resources, e.g., thumbnails, that are determined to be responsive to a submitted search query. These representations of the image resources typically are presented rather than the actual image resources themselves, although it is possible to present the actual image resources.
- image in the specification can refer to either an image resource or a representation of the image resource.
- the method of Figure 1 can be described with respect to a system, e.g., a search system as shown in Figure 14, including one or more computing devices, that performs the methods.
- the system receives an initial image search query.
- the image search query can be a search query for image content responsive to the query.
- the system can receive a query that describes a particular image or type of image using text.
- the image search query can provide information about one or more images associated with a topic, a website, a webpage, an offline database, an online database, a repository, a transaction, a document, a photograph, a drawing, or other content.
- the image search query can also include one or more query terms identifying requested image content.
- These query terms can identify (1 ) one or more search strings, e.g., 'puppies for sale,' 'German shepherd puppies,' 'puppies and kittens,' (2) image features, e.g., color, texture, dimension, (3) file type, e.g., bitmap, jpeg, tiff, or (4) a combination of the above or others.
- image features e.g., color, texture, dimension,
- file type e.g., bitmap, jpeg, tiff, or (4) a combination of the above or others.
- Step S3 the analysis of Step 2 determines related image search queries.
- the received initial image search query and the determined related image queries are sent to an image search engine.
- the received image search query and the determined plurality of related image queries are sent to an image search engine at the same time or close to the same time but these queries can be sent to the image search engine individually and at different time intervals.
- the image search engine will perform an image search for each query separately and obtain search results (Step S4).
- the image search results identify images that are responsive to the individual queries.
- the image search results can identify corresponding image resources relevant to the image queries.
- the image search engine can index and store meta data of an image set and, when an image query is performed, the image search engine uses the index to match the query with the stored data.
- the results are presented in order of relevancy through the use of a ranking engine that ranks image search results responsive to a received query according to one or more criteria. The ranking may be performed using a ranking engine as described in Figure 14.
- the resultant images for each query search can be grouped in sets corresponding to similarities and intersections, e.g., visual, non-visual, or both, among the images.
- This can be implemented in various ways, including using a script, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), or both, in a web browser program.
- HTML Hypertext Markup Language
- implementation can be such that it is independent of specific platforms or browser software. Other implementations are also possible.
- tiles of tiled images representing the individual search results are generated (Step S5).
- Tiled images are an example of a display option but other display options are available, e.g., a circular pattern of images can be provided.
- the panels can include a number of images associated with a respective search query. That is, the panel can show a specified number of the highest ranked images for the query or the panel can contain a specified number of representative images for each search result grouping, (e.g., see Figures 10- 12).
- a center of the image space can be the panel representing the results from the initial search query and this center panel can be surrounded by the panels representing the search results for the related-search queries.
- This image space format can be presented in other fashions and formats using the same underlying techniques.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example of a method for modifying the image space.
- the system can receive inputs for manipulating the image space (Step S7). Based on these received inputs, the system modifies the image space by providing additional related search query results (Step S8). This modified image space is provided to a client side (Step S9).
- the inputs can allow the image space to: zoom out, zoom in, and pan left, right, up, down, or any combination of these.
- the zooming and panning can be performed (in part) so that when zooming out, a first zoom level is shown where fewer images are displayed in each image panel but more image panels can be shown and when zooming in, a second zoom level where more images are displayed in each image panel but fewer image panels can be shown.
- the image space upon zoom out, can display multiple image panels on a single display, (2) upon zoom in, the image space can zoom in until a single query showing all image search results for the query are shown, and (3) upon panning, the image space will show panels that were not in view but are related to the adjacent panels in view, as will be described more fully below.
- Such modifications can be performed by the device at which the images are displayed, on its own, using code sent by a server device in one communication session, or through ongoing interactions with a server system.
- These inputs can be received by the system until the system receives an input signifying that a target image is found (Step S10). Once, the system receives such target input, the system will provide a landing page for viewing the target image in a non-search capacity. (Step S1 1 ).
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example of a method for allowing a client to create an image space on a display and a user of the client to manipulate the image space.
- a user of a client provides a search query to the system.
- the system will provide an image space to the client side.
- this image space is received by the client side.
- the image space will be presented to the client in Step C3.
- the presenting can be performed by a device at which the images are displayed, or a server device can present the client interface by sending code to a receiving device that renders the code to cause the display of the client interface being presented.
- Step C4 if the image space being presented contains the target image, the user of the client can provide the system with an input signifying the target image was found (Step C5). If the target image was not found, the user of the client can browse the image space by providing inputs to the system (Step C6), e.g., panning the image space or zooming in and out of the image space.
- zooming can be performed by the use of a single-finger or multi-finger gesture and panning can be performed with a drag gesture.
- the mouse scroll wheel, assigned zoom keys, or both can be used to control the zoom input and panning can be controlled using a mouse drag, using a keyboard (e.g., through use of the arrow keys), or both.
- Other inputs can also be programmed to perform other operations in the client interface, e.g., input signifying a target image was found.
- Images displayed in the client interface can be rescaled in accordance with a scaling factor governed by the input to zoom in and the input to zoom out.
- a scaling factor value can be retained in memory, where the scaling factor value is directly modified in response to the zoom input, and the scaling factor can be used to adjust the sizes of the images displayed in the client interface.
- the displayed images can be made larger until they are replaced by more images from a different zoom level.
- the displayed images can be made smaller until are replaced by fewer images from a different zoom level.
- the client will receive a modified image space (Step C7) and this image space will be presented to the user of the client on a display (Step C8).
- the modified client interface can continue to show more and more related query panels being created as the user of the client pans out indefinitely or until an end of related query searches is reached, e.g., the related query engine utilized all queries within its repository. If the user of the client finds a relevant panel, the client display can be zoomed into the panel and the user of the client can view the related query and browse all images associated with this query.
- Step C9 the user of the client can touch-click or mouse-click or otherwise designate the image (Step C5) and be provided with a landing page. If the target image is not found (Step C9), the user of the client can continue to provide browsing inputs to the system until the target input is found.
- An additional feature allows a user of a client to move forward and back between zoomed-in panels if the user of the client wants to browse through their past search results.
- the related-query engine builds a dynamic client interface by implementing an algorithm that establishes the related query terms and their arrangement within the client interface.
- the initial search query is 'puppies
- ' 'puppies' can become the center of the image space as shown in Figure 4.
- 'Puppies' will be sent to the related search engine.
- One type of algorithm used in the related-query engine can produce the related query terms based on previous image searches submitted to a search system, e.g., "puppies", and previous search refinements that were utilized to return more relevant or more accurate results, e.g., refine "puppies” to "great dane puppies.”
- the algorithm analyzes the search query and, in this example, returns four of the highest weighted search terms in relation to 'puppies.'
- the algorithm returned 'puppies for sale,' 'dogs and puppies,' 'puppies wallpaper,' and 'cute puppies' as these were the most common search refinements for an initial query of 'puppies.
- the system can use these related query results to fill in the cardinal directions of the image space (up, down, left right) with respect to the initial search term, as shown in Figure 5.
- the algorithm expands the related queries based on things that relate to all nearby queries of an empty space.
- the search engine will fill in the empty space within the image space, e.g., the corners of the image space, using an additive calculation that uses the nearby search queries to tabulate the highest-weighted, related-search query for the additive result of the nearby queries.
- Figure 6. For example, to fill the top left corner, the related search engine grouped together in an additive result, 'cute puppies, 'puppies' and 'puppies wallpaper. The algorithm used the highest-weighted search query that connected these groups together. In this example, the related search engine returned a search query of 'puppies and kittens wallpaper.' This method was followed for the remaining corners.
- the algorithm keeps tabulating new related queries as the client display pans the image space and the algorithm keeps filling in the related search queries by following the strongest weighted query for an additive result.
- the client display is panned right and the related search engine produced results for three more nodes on the left side.
- the client display is panned down and the top nodes were filled with more related search results.
- the algorithm compensates using various procedures so that the algorithm can continually provide related search terms in the event the algorithm runs into one of the above problems.
- the algorithm accounts for queries that have been viewed so that any viewed query will not be used more than once. In other words, any query that appeared in the client's visual field will not be repeated.
- the algorithm can have a reflective feature that creates a back edge for specific queries. For example, if a query transitions from 'raven' -> 'raven bird' -> 'raven bird head' -> 'raven bird face' -> dead end. The engine will create a back edge from raven bird. The back edge being "raven” in this example but may be any descriptor from the previous query. This back edge is weighed less, but is still useful for exploration when dead ends turn up.
- the algorithm when using the related search engine, the algorithm, using a designated memory, can account for the current query and other nearby queries. So, if the initial query is 'bird' and a nearby item is 'cat', the algorithm can search for queries related to both 'bird' and 'cat' and weigh the results additively. This way, if something is related to both, the algorithm can use that query, but if the algorithm does not find a query related to both, the algorithm can still use 'bird' or 'cat' alone. Furthermore, if the algorithm cannot find a related search query when using the nearby queries, the system can investigate queries a further distance away than the adjacent panels.
- the algorithm can split the string into keywords and search those keywords individually, e.g., 'Tokyo at night' can be split into queries related to 'Tokyo' or 'night'. If that fails or in addition to that, the system can investigate substrings of the queries or the algorithm can break up the query in subcomponents that are weighed individually. In some instances the algorithm can use a single letter to signify a query. These fallbacks are scored less than full matches but are useful when running into dead ends.
- FIG. 9-13 show an example of zoom levels for an interactive client interface.
- zoom level 1 includes images returned in response to the initial query.
- Each of the images in level 1 is ranked in accordance with the image search engine described above.
- FIG. 1 1 the image space was panned to the right and related search queries were filled in with related search queries I, J, and K.
- These search queries are additive results of adjacent search queries, meaning related search query I is a related search query for search query E+D, related search query J is a related search query for search query E+D+H, related search query K is a related search query for search query D+H.
- Figure 3 shows the highest ranked search results for query N, in this example, 60 images were shown but an exhaustive list of all related images or anything else can be shown.
- the user of the client decided image 25 was the target image and this image was chosen. Once an image is chosen the client display can be transported to a landing page where the image can be viewed alone or as part of a webpage or some other web-based or offline function.
- the system starts with a single query, when new spaces become visible on screen, the system is consulted to figure out the optimal query to put in that space.
- the nearby queries are used as seeds, and the radius is grown if nothing relevant is found for adjacent cells. Using this method, it is possible to explore indefinitely, until such time as one reaches the end of the nodes available (> 1 M in this case) or you have exhausted all available queries.
- This system allows a client to quickly explore very far, and get a rich variety of data, but also allows a client to stay in a single area controlled to some degree by the speed of navigation, since going fast means you're following a string of queries, whereas going slowly creates more of an enlarged-circle effect, with more localization.
- the search engine 110 then ranks the responsive images using a ranking engine 1 16 that applies a query-specific scoring model 1 18 to the features for each image.
- the ranking engine 1 16 can receive the features for the responsive images 120 from the image index 114. Alternatively, the ranking engine 1 16 can receive the responsive images themselves and extract the features for each image.
- the ranking engine 1 16 can receive the responsive images, for example, from an image cache maintained by the search system 102, or from the original source of the image.
- W is a vector storing the weights for the query-specific scoring model 118
- X is a vector of feature values for an image responsive to the query 104.
