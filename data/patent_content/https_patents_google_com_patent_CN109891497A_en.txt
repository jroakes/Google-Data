With reference to Figure 1B, because proximity indicator indicates about 8 feet of user's potential range user equipment, user is set
It is standby can be with relatively high volume output audio signal.For example, user equipment is the maximum sound of user equipment (B) using its volume
3/4ths horizontal audio signal of amount exports received message " not forget to take home in groceries ".
Due to several, the automatically and dynamically method of above-mentioned control TTS output is advantageous.For example, when user is close
When user equipment and when user is far from user equipment, output phase will be undesirable with the audio signal of volume.In addition to ring
Except the attribute of border, by considering the distance of user, user can be to avoid whenever position change of the user relative to user equipment
It must be directed towards the mobile inconvenience for moving the volume only for listening to message or adjusting user equipment of user equipment.
With reference to Fig. 2A, user equipment is received from user and is inquired.The inquiry is said in a low voice by user.Although the inquiry of diagram is
" you can remind what I have on my backlog inventory ", but in general, any inquiry can be submitted.
When receiving inquiry, user equipment can determine that the application for responding user's inquiry has been configured for
TTS output.Then, user equipment can activate microphone and sensor to determine user and environment attribute.
User equipment can obtain the sample of user speech from the microphone of actuating.Speech samples can be the inquiry of user
All size part.Speech samples are handled to determine one or more phonetic features, which can
To include but is not limited to pitch, tone, frequency and the amplitude of audio signal corresponding with the voice of user.
Speech samples can also be classified the user personality of the possibility mood to determine such as user or style of giving a lecture.Example
Such as, speech samples can be classified as indicate that user may happy, excited, sad or anxiety.Speech samples classification can also refer to
Show to the unique voice signature of user, the user pronunciation of such as certain words, such as " I " or " prompting ".Indicate that voice is special
The data of classification of seeking peace can be used as user property and be added to the user profiles being stored in customer data base, and in some feelings
It can be used for speech recognition purpose under condition.
Then, the database of the multiple audio output templates of user equipment access, and select and determine from multiple template
User property have highest similarity audio output template.In some cases, if suitable audio cannot be selected defeated
Template out, then user equipment can create based on identified user property new template or and server communication to create base
In the new template of identified user property.
Audio output template is for generating and the template of output audio signal.Template may include various parameters, such as
Pitch, tone, frequency band, amplitude, user styles and user emotion.These parameters can be provided according to identified user property
Value, so as to generate the audio output template having with user speech like attribute.
In fig. 2, it is based on phonetic feature and classification, user equipment determines that user may speak in a low voice (whisper), and
Select voice output template corresponding with audio signal of speaking in a low voice.Voice output template corresponding with audio signal of speaking in a low voice can be with
Including audio signal characteristic, such as low decibel output, amount of bass and pitch corresponding with speaking in a low voice, tone and frequency.
User equipment can obtain data from any suitable source to respond user's inquiry.In the scene shown in, user
Equipment may search for the backlog of user or remind list to respond user's inquiry.The information can by with the clothes in network
The communication of business device or retrieval are stored in the data in storage equipment to obtain.Storage equipment is desirably integrated into user equipment or is attached
To user equipment.
Obtain response inquiry data after, user equipment generate include data obtained and with selected sound
The consistent audio signal of frequency output template, so that audio signal can have and the attributes match of user or similar characteristic.Such as
Shown in Fig. 2A, user equipment output audio signal is do list (B) in user to notify user to take groceries home
On.User equipment output audio signal, as user device responsive just speaks in a low voice in the inquiry of user and replys user.User equipment
Volume be arranged on relatively low level, for example, a quarter of max volume level, with consistent with volume of speaking in a low voice.
In the scene shown in Fig. 2 B, user can excitedly scream and ask user equipment who won most happiness with user
The match of joyous team.Determine that user property, user equipment can obtain sound by using the process described above with reference to Fig. 2A
The audio signal of output response user using the data of the inquiry at family and in a manner of the attribute for imitating user.For example, by user
The audio signal of equipment output can have relatively high volume output, for example, 3/4ths of max volume level, and can
To have tone and pitch similar to excited people.Audio signal includes winning for informing the user the team 2-1 of the user
The information that must be won.
The input inquiry for imitating user provides several advantages.For example, user, which is likely to be at user, cannot speak up simultaneously
And in the environment that must be spoken in a low voice.In this environment, user may wish to that louder volume is avoided to respond to avoid potential embarrassment
Or make around user other people are inconvenient.Therefore, as use dynamic TTS Supply Method as a result, user can be by connecing
Amount of bass response is received to avoid this potential awkward scene, and user need not modify the audio setting of user equipment.In addition,
If user interacts with the user equipment of the mood of reflection user, user experience can be enhanced.For example, excited user will not
The dull or boring response to inquiry must be received.
Fig. 3 depicts the scene of the safety and privacy feature of implementing TTS Supply Method.In Fig. 3, user is driving for vehicle
The person of sailing, and multiple passengers sit in the car together with user.Vehicle includes vehicle control module, and the vehicle control module is from vehicle

Number or by display equipment show message.
It include speech recognition and environment measuring feature in the safety and privacy feature being integrated into TTS Supply Method.Vehicle
The sample, processing speech samples and storage that control module receives the voice of user are used for the data of speech recognition purpose.Example
Such as, vehicle control module can handle the speech samples of user to detect pitch, tone, frequency and the pronunciation of user, and by this
A little phonetic features are stored in user profiles as user property.When user equipment receives follow audio instruction, Yong Hushe
It is standby to be connect by the way that the phonetic feature associated with the user of the phonetic feature of audio instructions and storage is compared to determination
Whether the audio instructions of receipts are to be issued by user.
If the phonetic feature of follow audio instruction is matched with the phonetic feature associated with the user of storage, vehicle control
Molding block can determine that follow audio instruction may be the instruction of user.Then, vehicle control module can handle audio instructions
And run corresponding operation.For example, vehicle control module can be passed to loudspeaker if audio instructions are volumes to be increased
Control signal is passed to increase volume.
If the phonetic feature of follow audio instruction and the phonetic feature associated with the user of storage mismatch, vehicle
Control module determines that follow audio instruction may not be the instruction of user.For example, as shown in figure 3, the passenger in vehicle can lead to
Order vehicle control module " last message is read for me " (A) is crossed to attempt that request vehicle control module reads driver
People's message.Vehicle control module handles received order and determines the phonetic feature of order and the language associated with the user of storage
Sound feature mismatches.
In some embodiments, if the phonetic feature of received order and the voice associated with the user of storage are special
Sign mismatches, then the unmatched audio signal of voice of the voice and user in instruction order can be generated in vehicle control module,
And user can be requested to be confirmed whether execute the instruction in received order.For example, as shown, vehicle control module
Can be generated message " that sounds like different people, you want that me is allowed to read your last message? ", and by aobvious in vehicle
Show that the loudspeaker in equipment or vehicle exports the message.Then, user can be responded by confirming or refusing.
In some embodiments, if the voice associated with the user of the phonetic feature of follow audio instruction and storage
Feature mismatches, then vehicle control module, which can not be taken, further acts and can ignore received order.
TTS Supply Method may include additional security feature.Such as, in some embodiments, if received language
Sound order is not recognized as the order of user, then TTS Supply Method can not run certain features, such as imitates received voice
The tone and pitch of order.This feature will avoid various undesirable scenes, for example, other users scream only to user equipment
In order to make user equipment with big volume output audio signal.
Fig. 4 depicts the flow chart for showing the method for providing dynamic TTS output.This method can be by showing in Fig. 5
