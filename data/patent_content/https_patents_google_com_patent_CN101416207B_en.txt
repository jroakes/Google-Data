The timetable view of chat messages
Fig. 5 A and 5B are the flow charts according to the process of the timetable view that is used for the demonstration chat messages of some embodiment.If file, the chat messages of chat sessions can be shown as various records (transcript).Can show record with the timetable form, display message in a viewing area wherein, the timestamp of display message in the second viewing area, and message aimed at its timestamp separately.
In process flow 500, by a plurality of chat messages in the first client chat sessions and a plurality of chat messages (502) from the first client transmission chat sessions.User in the first client can send to the second client with one or more chat messages of chat sessions.The first client also can be from one or more chat messages of the same chat sessions of the second client.Can be by message system with message archive, and first (or second) client can ask to show the message of having filed.
When the first client-requested shows the message of having filed of chat sessions, in the first viewing area of window, show receive and the chat messages (504) that sends.In the second viewing area, show the timestamp (506) of at least one subset that is used for message.In certain embodiments, the second viewing area is contiguous the first viewing area, but not overlapping with the first viewing area.Do not need to be all the chat messages displaying time stamps in the chat sessions.In certain embodiments, the chronomere of shown timestamp be hour and minute, but do not have second.In such a case, can show a timestamp for the message that in same minute, occurs.In other embodiments, show single timestamp for the message that in same two minutes sections, occurs or for the message that in same five-minute period section, occurs.Be identified between the continuous meassage in the session time interval (or interruption) (508) greater than the predefine amount.Can come the recognition time interval by the timestamp that compares message.For the time interval of having identified, in window, show the Drawing Object (510) at interval instruction time.The example of the Drawing Object that can be shown is the straight line across the first and second viewing areas.In certain embodiments, Drawing Object is also included within the indication of the time that passs during each time interval.
The alternate embodiment of the process of the timetable view that is used for the demonstration chat messages has been shown in Fig. 5 B.In process flow 520, by a plurality of chat messages in the first client chat sessions and a plurality of chat messages (502) from the first client transmission chat sessions.Show chat messages (504) in the first viewing area.The timestamp (506) that shows at least one subset that is used for chat messages in the second viewing area.
Determine time interval threshold value (522).Time interval threshold value is based on the right time tolerance (time interval) of each continuous meassage in the chat sessions.In the chat sessions of x message, continuous meassage between have altogether x-1 time interval.Determine time interval threshold value based on these time intervals.
The example formula of time interval threshold value can be:
T＝Mα，
Wherein T is time interval threshold value, and α is predefined constant.In certain embodiments, α equals 4.
In certain embodiments, M is the arithmetic mean of x-1 time tolerance in the chat sessions.For example, be 1,4,10,27 and 37 minute if chat sessions has 6 message and time tolerance, then M is 15.8 minutes, it can be rounded to 16 minutes in certain embodiments.Among other the embodiment, M is the intermediate value (median) of x-1 time tolerance in the chat sessions at some.For example, be 1,4,10,27 and 37 minute if chat sessions has 6 message and time tolerance, M is 10 minutes so.
Be identified between the continuous meassage in the dialogue not only greater than the predefine amount but also greater than time interval (or interruption) (524) of T.In certain embodiments, the predefine amount is 5 minutes.The predefine amount is used for potential " significantly " time interval and very of short duration and small time interval are distinguished, and T will " significantly " time interval and " non-equally significantly " time interval distinguish.At this, " significantly " time interval is than mean value or intermediate value large interval time interval of factor-alpha at least.As in frame 508, can come the recognition time interval by the timestamp that compares message.For the time interval of identifying, in window, show the Drawing Object (510) at interval instruction time.
The timetable view has improved the readability of chat record by timestamp and message are separated.In addition, the timetable view is by dispensing some timestamps from show, and by shown timestamp is limited in from the regional different zone that shows therein chat messages in reduced the information confusion in the chat record.As in the timetable of event, wherein will in same year (if year is the base unit in the timetable), event be associated with same year, the message that will occur in (if minute be base unit in the chat record timetable, or when the basic time unit in the chat record timetable is N minute in same N minutes section) at same minute is associated with same timestamp.And by considering mean value or the meta numerical value time interval, " significantly " that the demonstration that is used for the Drawing Object in the time interval can be limited to chat sessions is interrupted.
Figure 9 illustrates the example of the timetable view of chat messages.The window 900 that shows the record of chat sessions comprises for the first viewing area 904 of display message and is used for showing the second viewing area 902 of the timestamp of chat messages.Message is aimed at its timestamp separately.Timestamp with hour and minute show, omitted second.Timestamp viewing area 902 shows the independent timestamp that is less than all message in the message viewing area 904: if minute other message has the timestamp (namely fall within same basic time unit in) identical with another message more early, then will divide the timestamp of other message to omit from show.In the example shown in Fig. 9, exist with two message of the timestamp of 1:01PM with two message of the timestamp of 1:04PM.Show chat session breaks 906-A and 906-B with intermittent line, it is corresponding to the time period that does not have messaging activity with duration longer than the time of predefine amount.In the example shown in Figure 9, its " time of predefine amount " that also can be called as threshold value break time is 5 minutes.Chat session breaks 906-A, 906-B also indicate the time quantum of passing between the rest periods.For example, be interrupted in messaging activity 30 minutes of 906-A indication and be interrupted, and be interrupted the 906-B indication in messaging activity 6 minutes interruption.
The control of the file of chat messages
Fig. 6 is the flow chart according to the process of the file that is used for the restriction chat messages of some embodiment.Process flow 600 has been described the process that participating user in chat sessions can be controlled the file of the particular message in the chat sessions.
Exchange first group of chat messages (602) in the chat sessions between first user and the second user.First user in the first client sends chat messages to the second user in the second client, and vice versa.The first client also receives the chat messages that stems from the second client, and vice versa.Send a message to recipient's client via message system; Sender's client sends a message to message system, and message system arrives recipient's client with message delivery.
Message system is with the first group of chat messages file (604) in chat sessions.At least one copy of each message in first group is stored in the storage vault.In certain embodiments, two copies of each message in first group are stored in the storage vault, each is used for first user and the second user's account.At some among other the embodiment, a copy of each message is stored in the storage vault, but this copy all is associated with first user and the second user's account.Chat messages can be used as the separate document that comprises personal messages and is stored or is stored in the document that comprises from all message of chat sessions.
Message system receives the order (606) that stops the chat sessions file.Can send this order by first user or the second user.More generally, can send the order that stops to file by any participating user in a plurality of participating users in the chat sessions.In certain embodiments, when any participating user command messages system in the chat sessions stopped chat sessions being filed, for all participating users of chat sessions, the subsequently message of chat sessions was not filed.In alternate embodiment, if participating user command messages system stops chat sessions being filed, then only for the participating user that sends the instruction that stops to file, the subsequently message of chat sessions do not filed (namely not to the user's of the request of sending subsequently message archive, but continuing message archive (unless those users have also sent the request that stops to file) to other users).
Exchange second group of chat messages (608) in the session between the first and second users.According to the order that stopping of receiving filed to chat sessions, message system is not to second group of message archive.As mentioned above, in certain embodiments, be not that the second user is to second group of message archive for first user neither yet.In above-mentioned alternate embodiment, not to the user's of the request of sending in second group message archive, but continue message archive to other users in second group, unless those users have also sent the request that stops to file.
Yet, should be appreciated that the order that stops to file only affects the message after order.It can be not influential to the message before order.Thereby the message of having been filed before order is still filed and can be for check in the future.
Message system receives and recovers the order (610) that (or beginning) files to chat sessions.Order as stopping chat sessions being filed can send this order by first user or the second user.In certain embodiments, order is applicable to all participating users in the chat sessions; Recover to file for all participants of chat sessions, for the user who has stopped filing by the order that before stopped to file.Thereby, in two people's chat sessions, the order that any participant can send the order that stops to file or recover to file in any given moment, and order is applicable to both sides participant., only recover to file for the chat sessions participant who sends the order that recovers file among other the embodiment at some.Do not affect and stopped other chat sessions participant of filing by the order that stops to file.
Exchange the 3rd group of chat messages (612) in the session between the first and second users.According to the order that recovers to file, message system is to the 3rd group of message archive (614).As the order that stops to file, the order that recovers to file only affects the message after order; The message of not filed before order is not stored in the storage vault again.For the subsequently message in the chat sessions, the first or second user can be switched (toggle) file as required, is similar to above-mentioned switching (stopping/recovering the order of file).
Thereby by the file of control chat sessions, or more specifically, by the file of the particular message in the control chat sessions, the user who participates in chat sessions can make the part of chat sessions " break away from record " as required.
In the above-described embodiments, chat sessions effectively begins to file.Among other the embodiment, chat sessions can be closed beginning with file at some, and in order to activate file, wishes that the user that chat sessions is filed must send the order that begins to file.
Figure 10 shows the figure to the chat window of the control of the file of chat messages of having according to some embodiment.Can provide to the participant in the chat sessions allow or the restriction chat sessions in the option of file of chat messages.In certain embodiments, can in chat window 1000, be provided for controlling the switching 1004 of the file of the message in the session.Switch 1004 (in Figure 10, being illustrated as check box) and permit a user to will the file unlatching or close of subsequently message., can switch in another position that is arranged in the chat window, such as options menu 1002 filing among other the embodiment at some.
If user's deexcitation is filed, then not to the message archive after deexcitation until activated file.In certain embodiments, will in message display surface 1006, show be used for that deexcitation of caution user is filed and will be not to the message of subsequently message archive.If the user has activated file, then to the message archive after activating until the deexcitation file.In certain embodiments, will show in message display surface 1006 that being used for the caution user has activated and file and will be to the message of subsequently message archive.
In certain embodiments, the default setting that files when beginning new chat sessions is effective for filing.Thereby if the user wishes to make any message in the dialogue " to avoid record ", it needs deexcitation to file; The user must select to withdraw from file.Among other the embodiment, being defaulted as files closes at some; Want the user that chat messages is filed to select to enter file by sending the order that activates file.
Although the description of above-described embodiment is in the environment of two users' chat sessions, the disclosed embodiments also can be applicable to have the chat sessions more than two participants, such as chatroom and multi-user's chat.Thereby in certain embodiments, any participant in chatroom or multi-user's chat sessions can send the order that stops or recovering to file at any time, and this order can be applicable to all participants in chatroom or the multi-user's chat sessions.
Has automatically the contact list search of finishing (autocomplete)
Fig. 7 A and 7B are the flow charts according to the process that is used for the searching for contact persons tabulation of some embodiment.Process flow 700 has been described the process that wherein can carry out contact list search query and just not carry out search about All Contacts's information field about contact person's title.In addition, when the inputted search character string, with in real time or near real-time mode display of search results, be similar to automatically and finish; Extra character is typed in the inquiry string can changes shown Search Results.
The subset (702) that shows user's contacts list.Can in the window of chat application, show contacts list.In certain embodiments, the subset of shown contacts list can be that the most proximad the user has sent the contact person of message.At some among other the embodiment, the shown contact person contact person of maximum message that has been user and its sending and receiving.Alternatively, each contact person in score value and user's the contacts list can be associated, and the contact person with highest score can be chosen as contact person's to be shown subset.Also show contact list search box (704), the user can key in inquiry in this contact list search box.Can not need from the contact person of contact list search and match query the user to start search (for example, do not need to click or other behavior starts search).
The reception user is typed into the inquiry string (706) in the search box.Each has first group of contact person (708) of at least one contact information field that satisfies inquiry string to identify it.The contact person's who in whole contact person's tabulation and just shows in frame 702 subset is carried out identification (using the inquiry string search).In certain embodiments, if character string is the substring that is included in the word in the contact information field, then contact information field satisfies inquiry string.For example, word " Johannes ", " Mikeljohn " and " Mike@johnson.com " satisfy inquiry string " joh ".In chat application window, show the first group of contact person (710) with the associated person information that satisfies inquiry string.Among other the embodiment, if the beginning of any predefined son field of character string and contact information field or contact information field is complementary, then contact information field satisfies inquiry string at some.For example, word " Johannes ", " Mike Johnson " and " Mike@johnson.com " satisfy inquiry string " joh ", because in each of these examples, find character string " joh " in the beginning of the predefined son field of word or word.
Reception is to the extra character (712) of inquiry string.Be typed into extra character in the search box and append to inquiry string.Inquiry string and extra character form new inquiry string.Each has second group of contact person (714) of at least one contact information field that satisfies new inquiry string to identify it.The contact person's who in whole contact person's tabulation and just shows in frame 702 subset is carried out identification (using the inquiry string search).Such as above-mentioned institute note, in certain embodiments, if new character string is the substring that is included in the word in the contact information field, then contact information field satisfies new inquiry string.For example, word " Mikeljohn " satisfies inquiry string " John ", and still " Johannes " do not satisfy.Alternatively, such as above-mentioned institute note, if the beginning of any predefined son field of character string and contact information field or contact information field is complementary, then contact information field satisfies inquiry string.Regardless of the rule that inquiry string and specific contact information field are complementary, the second group of contact person who satisfies new search string can be different from the first group of contact person who satisfies original search string.In window, show the second group of contact person (716) who satisfies new inquiry string.
