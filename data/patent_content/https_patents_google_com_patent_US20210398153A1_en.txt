Abstract
Description
- Digital maps are widely used to provide information related to geographical regions of interest, including information about roads, traffic, buildings, landmarks, commercial information, shopping guidance, retail or grocery stores and the like. Interactive maps often allow a user, for example, to access the digital map of a selected region of interest to search for activities or attributes around surrounding locations. However, over recent years, brick and mortar stores have become increasingly dynamic in terms of layout, styles or ownership. Frequent change of layout, ownership or styles of these dynamic stores can result in inaccurate information appearing in the digital maps. Some digital maps are not configured to reflect instant changes of these dynamic stores. Such inaccurate information in the digital map often creates difficulty for retail or business owners that are looking for a physical space for their business to find proper locations or properties. Such inaccurate information in the digital map contributes to inconsistencies and incongruities in the content of the digital map. These inconsistencies and incongruities may cause technical malfunctions in the map application and/or interfere with the provision of an effective human-computer interaction. Such inaccurate information can also fail to inform customers searching for a particular type of business in a particular location. Furthermore, such inaccurate information is problematic for service/property providers, who want to publish the most updated available properties/spaces with dynamically changing layouts, styles, ownership or sub-divided features to retail or business owners.

FIG. 1 depicts a detailed block diagram of anexample computing device 100. Thecomputing device 100 may be any device that can perform a computational operation. Suitable examples of thecomputing device 100 include desktop computers, laptop computers, PDA, personal computer, tablets, portable devices, such as smart phones, mobile phones, wearable devices and the like. In one example, thecomputing device 100 utilized herein is a smart phone. However, thecomputing device 100 described herein is not limited in this regard. - In one example, the
computing device 100 has multiple components embedded therein. Each component may be in direct or indirect communication to each other. In the example depicted inFIG. 1 , thecomputing device 100 includes one ormore controllers 116 configured to be in electrical communication with a user interface 132, amemory 114, aGPS receiver circuitry 118, atransmitter circuitry 106 and areceiver circuitry 108. The one ormore controller 116 can be any suitable processors, such as a microprocessor. Alternatively, thecontroller 116 can be dedicated components such as an application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) or other hardware-based processor. Although not necessary, one or more ofcomputing devices 100 may include specialized hardware components to perform specific computing processes, such as dynamic platform execution, advertisement display and program, geographic coordination reading, street image recognition, GPS related searches and positioning, geographic location encoding, etc. - An
antenna 102 may be disposed in thecomputing device 100 configured to receive and transmit Radio Frequency (RF) signals, WiFi signals, bluetooth signals, GPS signals or any suitable electrical signals. A receive/transmit (Rx/Tx)switch 104 selectively couples theantenna 102 to thetransmitter circuitry 106 andreceiver circuitry 108 as needed. Thereceiver circuitry 108 demodulates and decodes the electrical signals received from anetwork 110 to derive information therefrom. Thenetwork 110 may be further communicated with adatabase server 112 so as to provide information requested or inquired by thecomputing device 100. Thenetwork 110 provides connectivity between thecomputing device 100 and thedatabase server 112. Thenetwork 110 may utilize standard communications protocols, such as internet, Ethernet, WiFi, satellite communications, HTTP and protocols that are proprietary to one or more companies, and various combinations of the foregoing. For example, thenetwork 110 may be wired or wireless local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), cellular communication network as needed. Thedatabase server 112 may also be a computing device which also includes at least one processor, a receiver/transmitter, an interconnection interface and a memory that may store, send and/or generate information, data, software applications, map data, content, or interactive applications to thecomputing device 100. Thus, during operation, thedatabase server 112 may execute operations including receiving requests from thecomputing device 100, such as a device that a user is interacting with, through thenetwork 110. Subsequently, thedatabase server 112 may then process, respond and provide the requested content, interaction, dynamic request, map data, or information through thenetwork 110 to thecomputing device 100. - In one example, the
receiver circuitry 108 is coupled to thecontroller 116 via anelectrical connection 160. Thereceiver circuitry 108 provides the decoded electrical signals information to thecontroller 116. Thecontroller 116 also provides information to thetransmitter circuitry 106 for encoding and modulating information into electrical signals. Accordingly, thecontroller 116 is coupled to thetransmitter circuitry 106 via anelectrical connection 162. Thetransmitter circuitry 106 communicates the electrical signals to theantenna 102 for transmission to thedatabase server 112 through thenetwork 100. - In one example when the
computing device 100 includes a GPS-enabled implementation, anantenna 120 is coupled toGPS receiver circuitry 118 for receiving GPS signals. TheGPS receiver circuitry 118 demodulates and decodes the GPS signals to extract GPS location information therefrom. The GPS location information indicates the location of thecomputing device 100. TheGPS receiver circuitry 118 provides the decoded GPS location information to thecontroller 116. As such, theGPS receiver circuitry 118 is coupled to thecontroller 116 via anelectrical connection 164. It is noted that the present disclosure is not limited to GPS based methods for determining a location of thecomputing device 100. Other methods for determining a location of the computing device can be used herein as needed. It is noted that when a GPS receiver circuitry is not utilized or present in thecomputing device 100, the receive/transmit (Rx/Tx)switch 104 along with the atransmitter circuitry 106 and thereceiver circuitry 108 may also function similar to the GPS receiver circuitry to provide the geographic information/location of thecomputing device 100 as needed. - In one example, the
controller 116 stores the decoded electrical signal information and the decoded GPS location information in thememory 114 of thecomputing device 100. Accordingly, thememory 114 is connected to and accessible by thecontroller 116 through anelectrical connection 166. Thememory 114 of thecomputing device 100 may store information accessible by the one or more of thecontrollers 116 or processors, such as includinginstructions 122 that can be executed by the one ormore controller 116. In one example, thememory 114 is a computer-readable storage medium comprising theinstructions 112, which are executable computer instructions, for performing operations or commands input to thecomputing device 100. Thememory 114 can also includeapplications 126 and dynamic platform settings 130, which are settings of operations and communications among different servers or modules and so on, that can be retrieved, manipulated, processed, executed, interacted or stored by thecontroller 116. In one example, thememory 114 may be a volatile memory and/or a non-volatile memory or any non-transitory type capable of storing information accessible by the controller/processor, such as a hard-drive, memory card, RAM, DVD, CD-ROM, a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, write-capable and read-only memories. Thememory 114 can also have stored therein ofsoftware applications 126, for example, a map application, an advertising application that in communication with the map application, for implementing the methods of embodiments of the present disclosure including the dynamic platform settings 130 that may be utilized in thecomputing device 100. - Various implementations may be utilized to provide geographic location information and dynamic platform configurations to be written into
memory 114. For example, a user may directly provide the location information or commercial presentation preference by direct input to a user interface 132 on thecomputing device 100. Similarly, other methods of establishing the position or configurations of thecomputing device 100 may be employed. Thecomputing device 100 may be or may not be GPS-enabled or even include communication features such as provided byantenna switch 104, although theexample computing device 100 depicted inFIG. 1 would include these features. - In one example, the
software applications 126 stored in thememory 114 may include, but are not limited to, software applications operative to perform the various methods, features and functions described herein. Furthermore, the dynamic platform settings 130 may also be configured or stored in thememory 114 that allow the user to repetitively use these settings for a user customized preference when interacting with adynamic platform module 124 in thecontroller 116. For example, a user may formulate his/her customized commercial information or service presentation information to be saved in thememory 114. Accordingly, such information may be saved for repetitive uses when the service presentation is needed. It is noted that the dynamic platform settings 130 in thememory 114 may be in electrical communication with thedynamic platform module 124 configured in thecontroller 116, or referred as a processor, so as to enable the operation of the dynamic platform settings 130 being performed in thedynamic platform module 124 by thecontroller 116 when needed. - As depicted in
FIG. 1 , one or more sets ofinstructions 122 may be saved, completely or at least partially, within thecontroller 116 during execution thereof by thecomputing device 100. Alternatively, one or more of the instructions may be stored in theapplications 126 or other modules in thememory 114. In this regard, thememory 114 and thecontroller 116 can constitute machine-readable media. The term “machine-readable media”, as used here, refers to a single non-transient medium or multiple non-transient media that store the one or more sets ofinstructions 122. The term “machine-readable media”, as used here, also refers to any medium configured to store, encode or carry the set ofinstructions 122 for execution by thecomputing device 100 and that cause thecomputing device 100 to perform one or more of the methodologies of the present disclosure. - The
dynamic platform module 124 is configured in thecontroller 116 that allows commercial activity/service to be operated in thecomputing device 100. In one example, thedynamic platform module 124 may provide a platform that allows multi-directional communications in thesoftware applications 126, user input and/or from thedatabase servers 112. In one example, thedatabase servers 112 include at least amap server 204 and acontent presenting server 202 in communication with adatacenter 214, which will be described in greater detail with reference toFIG. 2 . Thedatacenter 214 may include amemory 165, similar to thememory 144, configured to store data and information, such as the digital map with street view, two-dimensional view, three-dimensional view, or the like. At least oneprocessor 167, similar to thecontroller 116, may be utilized in thedatabase servers 112 configured to execute command and instructions from thedatacenter 214 and/or thememory 165. - The
dynamic platform module 124 provides a platform that allows multiple parties or participants to provide, utilize, publish, list, submit, use, alter commercial services or other information in a selected geographic region in the digital map generated by the map application. The participants may input, request or accept requests or demands to or from thedynamic platform module 124 through a user interface 132, or through thedatabase server 112 via thenetwork 110. Thedynamic platform module 124 enables efficient and instant communications about the changes and demands of commercial services or other information at a selected geographic region. Furthermore, custom preferences, options, settings or the like among different participants may also be instantly posted or listed in the commercial services or on the digital map through thedynamic platform module 124 so that an user can receive notifications or updates of the activities of a physical storefronts more instantly and accurately. - As illustrated in
FIG. 1 , components of thedynamic platform module 124 may be executed on thecomputing device 100. In some implementations, one or more components of thedynamic platform module 124 may be executed on thedatabase server 112. - The
controller 116 is also connected to the user interface 132. The user interface 132 includesinput devices 134,output devices 136, and software routines or other user interface (not shown inFIG. 1 ) configured to allow a user to interact with andcontrol applications 126 and theinstruction 122 installed on thecomputing device 100. In one example, theapplications 126 may, for example, provide for the use of other positioning technologies in addition to or instead of GPS, such as, but not limited to other satellite-based positioning systems or other techniques such as IP geolocation, or the like. Such input andoutput devices display screen 150, aspeaker 152, akeypad 142, amicrophone 144, atouch screen 140, ahaptic output 154 and so on. It is noted that thedisplay screen 150 and thetouch screen 140 as described herein may referred to the same object to provide multiple functionalities. For example, thedisplay screen 150 may not only display content but also provides a touch-activated interface, referred to as atouch screen 140, that allows the user to input command and to actively interact therewith. The input andoutput devices -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example of communications of adynamic platform 200 according to aspects of the disclosure. Aservice provider 206, a business owner 208, amap manager 210 or aproperty developer 212 may access thedatabase server 112 via thenetwork 110. It is noted that, in one example, theservice provider 206 described herein may provide buildings or physical stores for the business owner 208 to conduct commercial activities. In another example, theservice provider 206 described herein may provide services, such as on-demand services include adjusting its physical store upfront, themes, styles, or layouts, in response to the request from the business owner 208. - In one example, the
database server 112 may include at least amap server 204, acontent presenting server 202, and adatacenter 214. Themap server 204, thecontent presenting server 202, and thedatacenter 214 are in electrical communication through internet or intranet as needed. A client 208, such as a customer, a consumer, an end user and the like, may access and interact with thedatabase server 112 through one or more of the computing devices 100 (shown as 100 a, 100 b, 100 c, 100 d inFIG. 2 ). Thecomputing device 100 that may be utilized to be in communication with thedata base server 112 may be adesktop computer 100 a, alaptop 100 b, aportable device 100 c, such as the example depicted inFIG. 1 , or atablet 100 d, or other suitable devices that may perform computational operations. It is noted thatservice provider 206, the business owners 208, themap managers 210 and thedevelopers 212, or other entities may access thedata base server 112 using any kind of thecomputing devices 100 shown or not shown inFIG. 2 . In one example, themap server 204 and thecontent presenting server 202 in thedatabase servers 112 are in communication with thedatacenter 214. Theprocessor 167 may be utilized in thedatabase servers 112 configured to execute command and instructions from thedatacenter 214 and/or thememory 165. - In one example, the
service provider 206 may upload, post, submit, or request a business content, such as an advertisement or other commercial information, via an interaction with thecontent presenting server 202. Theservice provider 206 may connect to thecontent presenting server 202 through thenetwork 110. Theservice provider 206 may first register in thedynamic platform 200 as a “service provider,” a “property provider,” an “advertiser,” or the like, to allow posting or submitting contents in thedynamic platform 200. It is noted that thecontent presenting server 202 referred herein could be any types of the servers as needed. In one example, the contents input in thecontent presenting server 202 may be advertising content, business content, service content, product content, or other content items. Such content input may be in the form of graphical presentations, text, images, audio, video, or combinations of one of more of any of forgoing, etc. The contents may also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. The contents can be formatted by amap server 204 for presentation in a digital map. The contents can be stored in thedatacenter 214 where both thecontent presenting server 202 and themap server 204 may retrieve the contents as needed. In one embodiment, theservice provider 206 may be property owners, landlords, real estate agents, intermediate agents, property developers, space owners, interior designers or the like that have a physical storefront, such as a brick-and-mortar store or restaurant, for rent or lease. - In some examples, the
developers 212, such as real estate property development agencies or companies, andmap managers 210, such as map service providers, may access themap server 204 and update the data, such as physical structures, buildings, inventories and the like, in themap server 204 as needed. Generally, thedevelopers 212 and themap managers 210 often have the most up-to-date geographic changes, data, floorplans, zoning information in a local area. Thus, thedevelopers 212 and themap managers 210 may be authorized by thedynamic platform 200 to access themap server 204 to update the existing data with the updated information in themap server 204. The update information of the most up-to-date geographic information may then be output in the digital map. Such updated geographic information and changes in a local area may then be saved in thedatacenter 214 as needed. Consequently, theservice provider 206 may then upload or post proper contents on the digital map for presentation with the most up-to-date geographic information via thecontent presenting server 202 to avoid unnecessary information errors due to the outdated information inadvertently listed on the digital map. In some examples, theservice provider 206 may also be authorized to make such change. Themap server 204 integrates the contents or presentation into the digital map by placing the information indicator from thecontent presenting server 202 on the digital map. - In some examples, the contents may include information regarding sub-divisions of a physical store or a property based on different ownership, styles, vacancies, or interior layouts of the physical store or the property. For example, when a physical store that has certain floors available for lease but certain floors still occupied, the contents may be formatted by the
content presenting server 202 in a manner that allows themap server 204 to specify and present the particular floors for rent/lease in the digital map. In some examples wherein the interior layout of a physical store that allows multiple leases to multiple tenants respectively, the content may also be formatted by thecontent presenting server 202 to lease a particular room, a particular style, or a particular interior region of the physical store as needed. - Business owners 208, such as vendors, tenants, retail owners, independent sellers, or the like who need a physical storefront or a certain service for business, may then review the presentation of the content in the digital map. The business owners 208 may then access the
content presenting server 202 and submit offers for lease or rent of the spaces or properties that best fit the business owner's business request. Theservice providers 206 may then determine to accept or reject the offers. When an offer from the business owner 208 is accepted by theservice provider 206, the business owners 208 may then utilize the physical storefront or the services from theservice providers 206 for business, tentatively or permanently, and promote their business by placing a business presentation, a commercial content, commercial update or promotion in the digital map via themap server 204. Such business presentation, commercial content or promotion depicted in the digital map may then be reviewed and browsed by theclient 218 who has certain interest or demand for purchasing. In some examples, the business presentation or promotion may be promoted or placed in the digital map by themap managers 210 with or without the request by the business owners 208. - By utilizing the
dynamic platform 200, an efficient communication among theservice providers 206,developers 212,map managers 210, the business owners 208 and theclient 218, such as customers or consumers, may be obtained so that the actual status of the physical stores may be instantly and dynamically presented in the digital map. Furthermore, thedynamic platform 200 may also allow theservice providers 206 to adjust their services or products considering the requests from the business owners 208. In some examples, the business owners 208 may send a request to theservice provider 206 for change of its product line, services, or physical upfront appearance, themes, styles, or the like. Theservice provider 206 may then interact with the business owners 208 through thedynamic platform 200 to accommodate the request or need from the business owners 208 to provide on-demand stores. Themap server 204 and thecontent presenting server 202 may format and accommodate such changes and populates the changes in the digital map. - Similarly, the business owners 208 may also flexibly adjust their product lines or services based on the queries or market trends from the
clients 218 interacted with thedynamic platform 200. For example, when a physical building is available for rent, theservice providers 206, who has the ownership or right of management, may then place a business content on the digital map. Subsequently, the business owners 208 may discover the physical building for business based on the business content presented and decide to rent the physical building. After the ownership or occupancy of the physical building is transferred, the business owner 208 may then promote the new business of the local area in the digital map. Accordingly, theclient 218, such as customers or consumers, may also explore the most up-to-date information in the digital map about the dynamic stores or short-term stores opened nearby that fits their purchasing demands. It is noted that the communications among these participants are multi-directional, which means that theservice providers 206 may dynamically or flexibly adjust their products or services to fit the business owners' commercial request and the business owners 208 may also flexibly and dynamically change their product lines or service types based on the request from theclients 218 through thedynamic platform 200 as needed. - In some examples, the
map managers 210 may also provide computational data, such as statistics, regional/local trending queries, local searches, geographic searches, local directions, navigation data, direction requests, seasonal data, customs, demands, shut-down information, or the like, at a local area to the business owners 208. In one example, the computational data includes user's navigation data, searches or direction requests collected from the selected geographic location in the map. Accordingly, the business owners 208 may base on the trending demand at the local area to open a temporary store that adapts to consumer current demands in the local area. Furthermore, themap managers 210 may also connect the business owners 208 to theservice provider 206 who offer on-demand stores/spaces that allow the business owners 208 to have a short-term business plan at the local area for seasonal or flash sales that fit local consumer trends and demand. Thus, thedynamic platform 200 provides multi-directional communications among different parties to enable a quick, instant and efficient communication so as to provide a seamlessly interactive business service or on-demand services that reflects the real market situation in a local area that may satisfy the multiple parties with different business purposes. - In some examples, the business owners 208 may also be also to search or input queries in the digital map based on a specific type of business. For example, when a busines owner desires to search a space for a particular business type with certain business requirements/criteria, the
map manager 210, who maintains and populates information in the digital map, may provide suggestion to the business owner 208 with suitable suggestions that fit the business requirements/criteria input from the business owner 208. For example, when the business owner 208 looks for a space for a music studio that requires several small compartments in a building with sound insulation walls, such query may be input in the digital map. After a computational operation, the digital map may then provide relevant spaces or suggestions, within a desired geographic region set by the business owner 208, to the business owner 208 for his/her consideration for business opportunities. -
FIG. 3A and 3B depict different examples of adigital map 350 zoomed in at a geographic region of interest with different formats of business contents depicted in themaps 350 in map view respectively. In the example depicted inFIG. 3A , the structures, buildings, infrastructures may be depicted in a three-dimensional view. Abusiness content 307 may be then shown on abuilding 340, such as a physical store, to indicate a space is available in thebuilding 340 for lease or rent. In the example depicted inFIG. 3B , alternatively, the structures, buildings, infrastructures may be depicted in a two-dimensional view. A business content, shown as 302 a, 302 b, may then be placed in thedigital map 350 to indicate spaces or stores for lease or rent. Thebusiness contents service providers 206 in thecontent presentation server 202 and themap server 204 may then format thebusiness contents digital map 350 that allows the business owners 208 to explore and interact with thedynamic platform 200. -
FIG. 4 depict yet another example of thedigital map 350 that is depicted in a street view. Similarly, the business content 450 may be shown on abuilding 440, such as a physical store, to indicate a space available in thebuilding 440 for lease or rent. It is noted that thebusiness content service provider 206 through thedynamic platform 200. In one example, the business content 450 may be further tapped, clicked, or executed to provide acontext menu 460. Thecontext menu 460 includes a list of multiple tabs, such as a zoom-in-view tab 402, avirtual view tab 404, a historic uses/historic stores tab 406, a square footage tab 408, aninterior layout tab 410, alisting price tab 412, a suggested use tab 414, a search nearby tab 416, aninput criteria tab 418 and abid tab 420. It is noted that thetabs context menu 460 are only examples and/or frequently used queries that the business owners 208 often utilize. Additional tabs with different query commands or functions may be added to thecontext menu 460 as needed. - The user may select one or more of the
tabs context menu 460 and interact with themap server 204 and thecontent presentation server 202 to perform the requested functions, which may result in the retrieval of data or additional information from online recourses for display of the additional information. - In one example, the zoom-in
view tab 402 may provide additional detailed information, such as dimensions, building appearance, nearby buildings, building styles, or the like, of thebuilding 440. Thevirtual view tab 404 may provide virtual tour, such as a simulation including a sequence of videos or images, of thestructure 440. The virtual tour may utilize multimedia elements, such as sound effects, music, narration, or text to provide the viewer a visual description of thestructure 440. In some examples, the virtual tour may include a previously recorded film by the photographer moving continuously from a point to another at a walking pace throughout thesubject structure 440. - The historic uses tab 406 may list the recent and past uses of the
building 440 for a time period, such as for the past six months or twelve months. The historic uses of thestructure 440 may help the business owners obtain a background knowledge of the popular activities or commercial information active in the recent times in the target geographic area. - Furthermore, some details of the
building 440, such as the square footage, may be obtained by tapping the square footage tab 408. Additional information, such as year of built, tax information or other associated real estate information, may be integrated or put under the square footage tab 408 or other separate tabs as needed. - The
interior layout tab 410 may be selected to obtain further information regarding the interior layout and/or floorplan of thebuilding 440. For example, when theinterior layout tab 410 is selected, the interior layout or called thefloorplan 500 of thebuilding 440 is populated in the display screen, as shown inFIG. 5 . The interior layout provides information regarding the numbers, styles, designs, color theme, dimensions or other information regarding the rooms comparted inside thebuilding 440. In the situation wherein only certain spaces, such as certain rooms, are available for rent or lease, the interior layout provided from theinterior layout tab 410 may help the business owners 208 inspect, review, and evaluate the available spaces within thebuilding 440 prior to placing a bid for the space and/or the room. - The
listing price tab 412 may provide the information regarding the price listed for the space, the rooms inside thebuilding 440, or thewhole building 440. - The suggested use tab 414 may provide computational data, statistic data, trending queries, local demands, consumer trends, seasonal data, local cultural traits, recent openings or shut-down of commercial activities, or other signals of the local area to the business owners 208. Such signals may help the business owners 208 to make informed business decisions that fit the local market trend. The signals or computational data may be collected so as to provide local market information to the user to business decisions. Just a few examples of such business decisions include when to open a particular type of store or offer a particular product line or revise menu offerings, what types of products or businesses are needed or desired in particular neighborhoods, a status of nearby businesses, etc. For example, when a business owner searches for and plans to open a sport shop in a local area, the suggested use tab 414 may provide information to the business owner 208 that, by statistic, a spring opening in time for summer is a good option for sport related stores while the fall season in time for holidays might be a better option for jewelry stores. In another example, when the map application receives a number of searches about clothing stores in the area at certain seasons, it may indicate the demand or interest for clothing stores in the selected geographic area at a particular timeline of the year. The suggested use tab 414 may provide such information to the business owners 208 for their consideration. In yet another example, when a large book shop closes its business in an area, nearby book retailers may be provided with the opportunity to carry and sell the books or products for clearance from the large book shop as needed. Other related computations, statistics, or calculations may also be employed to provide relevant local market information or indication to the business owners 208 for business decision making
- The search nearby tab 416 may further provide the business owners 208 an option to search for relevant business activities in the area that may likely enhance or promote, diminish or discourage the business opportunities. For example, a hot chocolate drink shop may be suggested to open during a winter hockey season located nearby ice rinks or pond rinks so as to have a relatively high probability of business success. The neighborhood features, lack of hot drink shops in winter hockey season, may be provided to the business owners 208 for consideration as needed.
- Furthermore, an
input criteria tab 418 may be further provided in thecontext menu 460 that allows the business owners 208 to formulate their queries. Theinput criteria tab 418 may further provide a drop-downlist 502, as shown inFIG. 6 , that, when selected, allows the business owners 208 to input queries that fit their own business interest. It is noted that the criteria shown in the drop-downlist 502 is only for example purposes. Additional or different search tabs may be included in the drop-downlist 502 as needed. - In one example, the
tabs list 502 ofFIG. 6 , may include product features, lease term, interest/demand at the area, seasonal requirements, similar product in the area, price range, neighborhood features, previous and further planned use, target customers or peak hours for business and the like. Thetabs list 502 may be programmed in a model that utilizes a machine learning technique. The machine learning technique may help the model learn and evolve from the search results, computational data or statistic data received or input from the big data from thedatacenter 214. The machine leaning technique helps build a learned ranking model to help the business owners 208 make business decision that fits the market trend, thus improving the business likelihood of being successful. Such learned ranking model may integrate the information as obtained, such as product features, business natures, neighborhood features, online searches in the area, related store features, previous stores, planned stores or the like, and output a recommendation score or ranking 512 to the business owners to suggest how suitable this location is for the certain type of the business that the business owners are looking for. For example, arecommendation score 512 greater than a predetermined threshold may be considered encouragement for the business owner 208 to move forward with the decision and place a bid, utilizing thebid tab 420, as depicted inFIG. 4 , to rent and lease the space for business. When the bid is placed and the offer is accepted, theservice provider 206 may determine to accept or turn down the offer. When accepted, the transaction may be completed by both parties in thedynamic platform 200. Thus, the business content 450 shown in the digital map may be altered and adjusted to commercial promotions or notifications. In contrast, arecommendation score 512 less than the predetermined threshold may be considered discouragement for the business owner 208, suggesting the business owner 208 to seek other opportunities for business. Thus, another search is suggested to find another space, another opening time, another product types or other different factors/features to increase the likelihood of success of the business. In some examples, theservice provider 206 may adjust its service types, layouts, or property characteristics to fit the requirements from the business owner 208. - Furthermore, as the dynamic platform is built based on the constant communication between the
map server 204 and thecontent presentation server 202, the business owner 208 may also receive suggestions about the lack of certain business in the area based on the navigation data, searches or direction requests from the users, such as the local consumers. For example, the navigation data, searches or direction requests from themap server 204 indicates that consumers in the area often travel a long distance for a pharmacy store in winter months, this may suggest a business opportunity for opening a short-term pharmacy store during the particular winter months for the local seasonal demand. Thus, by collecting the computational data of local market based on the navigation data from users, a more accurate location market information may be obtained. - Thus, the
context menu 460 and the drop-downlist 502 may generally provide the business owners 208 with the dynamic information in the local area. In one example, as described above, the local market information comprises neighborhood features, statistic data, trending queries, local supply and demands consumer trend, market trend, seasonal data, local cultural traits, recent openings or shut-down of commercial activities, and past and future uses of the stores or other related information as needed. -
FIG. 7A-7D illustrate examples of commercial notifications orupdates 750 populated in thedigital map 350. As discussed above, when the offer is accepted and the transaction is completed via thedynamic platform 200, the business content 450 posted on thebuilding 440 fromFIG. 4 may then be adjusted and replaced with a commercial notifications orupdates 750, as shown inFIG. 7A . The commercial notifications orupdates 750 may be edited, published, posted, released, or listed by the business owner 208 of the winning bid of the business content 450. The business owner 208 may decide to post the commercial notifications orupdates 750 in different formats so as to attract theusers 218, such as consumers or customers, to visit thebuilding 440 for commercial activities. In some examples, themap managers 210, upon notifying by thedynamic platform 200 about the completed transaction, may assist publishing the commercial notifications orupdates 750 in thedigital map 350 to notify theclients 218, such as consumers or customers, for the new business activity in thebuilding 440 where the transaction is completed and the ownership of thebuilding 440 is tentatively or permanently transferred. In some examples, the commercial notifications orupdates 750 may be automatically populated and the information in the digital map is automatically updated by thedynamic platform 200 once the transaction is completed. - In some examples, the commercial notifications or
updates 750 may also include different types of the services, such as change of the items, menus, or themes in a restaurant or store upfronts, updated in the selected geographic region. For example, when a menu in a restaurant is updated, the updated menu may be posted, published or listed in the digital map, such as posting as the commercial notifications orupdates 750 depicted inFIG. 7A so that the clients can easily be notified or reminded regarding the change in service of the restaurant or the business in the selected geographic location in the digital map. - In some examples, the commercial notifications or
updates 750 may be selected to further provide additional information, such as merchandise types, business features, price range, product or service information, discount information, historical uses of the building or the like, so as to allow theclients 218 to understand the past, present, or even future business activities in thebuilding 440. In this example, the commercial notifications orupdates 750 servers as product or service introduction that allows the consumers or customers to understand the nature of the business. -
FIG. 7B depicts another format of the commercial notifications orupdates 720 that the business owner 208 or themap manager 210 may populate in thedigital map 350. In this example, the commercial notifications orupdates 720 serves as notification and/or commercial updates that include a textual description of “Grand Opening in May” for business promotion so that the users' attention may be easily captured when thedigital map 350 is launched at thecomputing device 100 carried by theusers 218. In some examples, a graphic expression may be utilized in the commercial notifications orupdates 720 as needed to capture the visual attention of theusers 218 and then further urge the purchasing motive of theusers 218. -
FIG. 7C depicts yet another format of the commercial notifications orupdates 735 appeared in thedigital map 350 based on the location of theclient 218 who is in close proximity to the business activities. For example, when theclient 218 launches the map application and thedigital map 350 is populated on the display screen of thecomputing device 100, an automatic detection of the location of theclient 218 carrying thecomputing device 100 may be performed so as to set amarker 725 in thedigital map 350, indicating location of theclient 218. After the location of theclient 218 is detected and themarker 725 is set, active commercial notifications orupdates 735 within a predetermined range, such as 5 mile radius from themarker 725 or the like, may be automatically populated so as to help the business owner 208 to promote the businesses active in the local area. In the example depicted inFIG. 7C , a future business activity is depicted in the commercial notifications orupdates 735, shown as “A New Sport Store Opening Near You In Two Days”, so as to notify theclient 218 about the time line of a near future event to be occurred in the neighborhood. -
FIG. 7D depicts still another format of the commercial notifications orupdates 736 appeared in thedigital map 350 based on the location of theclient 218 who is in close proximity to the business activities. Instead of a future event of the commercial notifications orupdates 735, the commercial notifications orupdates 736 provides a currently active business event, such as “A Donut Flash Store Open Only Until End Of The Week” depicted inFIG. 7D , in the nearby area in close proximity to theclient 218. Thus, when theclient 218 interacts with thedigital map 350, the commercial notifications orupdates 736 may be instantly populated in the digital map 315 so as to notify theclient 218 about the current business activity and/or sale in the neighborhood. Thus, theclient 218 may determine whether to involve with the active business based on his/her personal preference or need. -
