Definitions
- the present invention relates to a locating method and a device for carrying it out and, in particular, an efficient control of at least one accurate locating method and at least one energy-saving locating method on a radio-based terminal (e.g. mobile phone) for carrying out proactive, location-based services.
- a radio-based terminal e.g. mobile phone
- LBS's Location-based services
- proactive LBS's automatically initiate service actions when predefined spatial events occur, such as when a user is approaching a point of interest (PoI).
- Examples of proactive LBS's are the following services:
- the update zone may be defined as a circle with a predetermined centre and radius or as a polygon.
- terminal-based methods such as GPS, assisted GPS, the future European satellite system Galileo or the Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD) method, which is part of the GSM standard.
- E-OTD Enhanced Observed Time Difference
- U-TDoA Uplink Time Difference of Arrival
- WLAN and GSM fingerprinting which can run in network-supported or terminal-based mode, in which the terminal takes signal strength measurements from the surrounding base stations and constantly transmits the measurements to a network server, so that the position can be determined.
- the known locating methods have the following disadvantage in relation to the identification of update zones.
- the locating method In order to achieve the high temporal resolution required, the locating method must be operated almost continuously. In some cases this results in high (technical) costs.
- the continuous position calculation leads to high power consumption by the terminal.
- signals In the case of network-based and network-supported methods, signals must again be transmitted constantly from the terminal, which puts a strain on the limited air interface and leads to significant scalability problems. Moreover, the frequent transmissions likewise lead to high energy consumption.
- the invention relates to a method for locating a first mobile terminal within a radio network. Said method comprises the following steps: a first locating process is carried out to determine an initial position of the first terminal; the first locating process is deactivated; a second locating process is carried out to at least approximately determine the current position of the first terminal relative to the initial position; and the first locating process is activated and carried out again to determine a new initial position of the first terminal when the current position reaches a minimum distance from the initial position.
- the present invention controls an accurate, resource-intensive locating process (the first locating process) such as GPS, for example, for the identification of update zones.
- the first locating process is used as little as possible during this, in order to conserve the terminal's energy and hardware resources. Nevertheless, the update zones continue to be observed with high temporal and spatial resolution.
- the invention comprises, in particular, the assessment of the relative distance along the air line between the current position of the terminal (i.e. of a user) and the last position determined by the first locating process. Location determination by the first locating process is avoided if the update zone has definitely not yet been reached or left or there is a definite probability of this.
- the present method can advantageously use the signals from surrounding base stations to dynamically control the deployment of the first locating process.
- the present method differs from other (“inaccurate”) methods of position determination based on radio signals from surrounding base stations, in that there is only a relative distance assessment and no absolute position determination. The costly incorporation of network topology data or the a priori measurement of fingerprints is thereby avoided.
- the present method can be implemented irrespective of equipment. This means that it can easily be integrated into existing terminals with location determination (e.g. GPS units).
- the present method can also be advantageously used to determine cliques of mobile terminals within a plurality of mobile terminals.
- a method for determining cliques of mobile terminals in a radio network encompassing a plurality of mobile terminals comprises steps for determining one or more independent numbers of terminals, wherein the pairs of terminals of each of the independent numbers are located at a distance from each other that is greater than a predetermined threshold value; and for determining at least one clique of terminals, pairs of which are located at a shorter distance from each other than a predetermined threshold value, each independent number containing a maximum of one terminal of the clique.
- This method according to the invention is characterised in that cliques can be determined in a simple, energy-efficient manner, which means that existing resources are conserved and communication between the terminals and an overriding server, which is usually available to provide click-based LBS's, can be reduced.
- FIGS. 1-9 Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1-9 .
- Described below is a series of processes according to exemplary embodiments of the invention, with the help of which it is possible to identify when update zones are entered and left with sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution. This involves selective use of the locating processes described above, so that energy and other resources are conserved.
- FIG. 1 This shows an update zone U, which is set by a service, the user of a terminal or by the network.
- the update zone U is assigned to a service, for which it is relevant whether the user leaves or enters the update zone U.
- the terminal's current position is established using an available “accurate” first locating process (GPS for example).
- GPS for example
- the current position can be used to calculate a distance r2, which the user must cover to leave or enter the update zone U.
- the invention is based on the first locating process being left until it can be guaranteed that the user has covered no more than distance r1 from the time of the last location determination by the first locating process, wherein r1 ⁇ r2.
- the distance r1 does not denote the distance actually covered, but the length of the air line between the current position and the last position determined using the first locating process. Only when this is no longer guaranteed is the first locating process reactivated and the process repeated.
- the distance r1 is determined with the aid of a second locating process.
- the second locating process is more energy-saving than the first. In other words, an energy-saving locating process is alternated with an accurate locating process.
- different second (i.e. energy-saving) locating processes are used. Once the user's precise position has been determined using the first locating process, the second locating processes are carried out until none of the second locating processes can determine a distance r1 where r1 ⁇ r2, i.e. until it can no longer be guaranteed that the user has entered or left the update zone. If this eventuality arises, an accurate location determination is carried out using the first locating process and the procedure is repeated.
- dead reckoning directly estimates the user's (absolute) position, based, for example, on the measured speed and direction and also an initial point.
- methods of limiting the relative deviation from the last position are preferred and described below.
- This locating process is based on a maximum speed vmax configurable by the user or by a service or determined from the present context or the user's movement history.
- the speed, acceleration, phases and/or frequency drift of the user's terminal are determined in relation to one of the base stations using the signals from surrounding base stations. Such techniques are known per se and are not therefore described in greater detail.
- distance r1 is obtained by integration or summation.
- the identifiers of surrounding base stations are monitored by the user's terminal, in order to determine the distance r1:
- the terminal's maximum range d is known for its radio technology, the terminal cannot have moved by more than 2d, as long as it is receiving the same base station identifier.
- the monitoring of surrounding WLAN access points is offered accordingly. These only have a limited range. If the terminal receives signals from the same access point in two different positions, it can be concluded that the distance covered r1 is relatively small.
- This method is also suitable for GSM-based terminals.
- land-based GSM cells measure up to 35 km, here too knowledge of the approximate cell size may be sufficient, if the user only moves over a limited area (e.g. within a city), for example.
- This approach is defined by known proximity sensing approaches (e.g. cell ID, which is a known method of location determination in GSM) in that no absolute positions are determined using the cell identifier, but only relative deviations from the position last determined. This results in an independence from network topology information, such as the positions of the base stations, for example, which are usually only available to the network operator.
- known proximity sensing approaches e.g. cell ID, which is a known method of location determination in GSM
- the signal strength (received signal strength (RSS)), signal quality (signal to noise ratio (SNR)) and/or the bit rate of the signal from the base station are taken into account. If these are above predetermined threshold values, it can be concluded that the terminal is close to the base station. If the values also remain constantly high over several measurements, this provides further confirmation. The user's maximum movement radius, and therefore distance r1, can thereby be more accurately determined.
- RSS received signal strength
- SNR signal to noise ratio
- the signals from several base stations are taken into account.
- a relative path distance is determined based on the difference between two signal strengths from several base stations. No special background information is needed for this (e.g. a priori measurement of fingerprints), which makes the approach far simpler.
- Two signal strength vectors determined at different times can be compared, for example, using their Euclidean or Manhattan distance, the number of identical base stations or the Spearman rank order coefficient, which produces a correlation of the tuples of the same base stations classified according to signal strength. Based on these metrics, a maximum path distance between the measuring points can once again be inferred.
- a GPS-based locating process is used as the first locating process and a GSM-based locating process as the second locating process.
- This exemplary embodiment benefits from the fact that the user moves in a semi-static manner most of the time. For example, the user may often move at his or her place of work or at home; however, the user's movements are usually restricted locally, i.e. starting from a fixed central point, the user does not move outside a given radius. For this reason, pure movement recognition is only suitable for the second locating process under certain conditions.
- the present exemplary embodiment is therefore based on identifying when this radius is left, so that the first GPS-based locating process can then be activated.
- the present exemplary embodiment is based on analysing the signals from surrounding GSM base stations, which are logged by the user's terminal, in order to identify the need for a handover. This does not therefore result in additional energy consumption.
- the terminal's current GSM measurements are compared with those at the time of the last GPS localisation. If this comparison can be used to exclude the possibility that the user has covered more than the above distance r2, the GPS locating method remains inactive.
- CBS Common Base Station
- BCCH Broadcast Control Channel
- BSC Base Station Controller
- There is a multiplicity of methods for comparing two measurements such as, for example, determining joint base stations with consecutive measurements, determining the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient between two consecutive measurements or the distance between received signal strengths (e.g. the Manhattan and Euclidean distance). These are described, for example, by J. Krumm and K. Hinckley in “The Nearme Wireless Proximity Server”, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp), 2004, 283-300:
- eCBS expanded CBS indicator
- Step 1 Creation of a Weighted Base Station Indicator wBS
- the strength of the signal received ci(j) illustrates the importance of the base station i within BS(j).
- the signal strength cannot be used as an absolute measurement.
- Slow fading noise results from reflection and absorption along the signal path between the base station and the mobile radio terminal.
- Rapid fading noise results from reflective objects in the immediate proximity of the terminal.
- the proportion of each signal strength value in relation to the total output available, the effect of fading noise can be reduced.
- weighting coefficients are used:
- wBS (j) ⁇ ( v 1 (j) ,bs 1 (j) ),( v 2 (j) ,bs 2 (j) ), . . . ,( v N (j) ,bs N (j) ) ⁇ .
- Step 2 Creation of an Expanded Base Station Indicator eBS
- the wBS indicator should balance fading effects that can occur within a single measurement. However, this does not take account of jumping channels (radio cells that appear in one measurement, but in the following one). In order to mitigate the influence of this effect on the indicator, consecutive measurements are weighted (weighted moving average).
- the sudden appearance of line of sight (LOS) components makes the measurement M (j) fluctuate. If the LOS radio cell is already present, this has too much weight. On the other hand, if it is not yet present, the remotest cell is forced out of the measurement.
- LOS line of sight
- the weightings are calculated as follows:
- Step 3 Calculation of the Number of Joint Base Stations eCBS
- the number of joint base stations eCBS is determined. In order to depict the eCBS number at this distance, the following basic methods can be used in accordance with embodiments of the present invention:
- Map using the hyperbolic tangent This function represents a good map model, as the form of this function is similar to the form of the data. The calculation is more expensive, compared with linear mapping, but the result is more accurate as a result.
- the values q1-q4 may, for example, be determined by means of regression analysis.
- a value p can be determined, which illustrates the probability of trueDist(p i ,p j ) ⁇ dist trigger .
- dist observe dist trigger ⁇ qnorm( p )
- the first locating process is activated in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, in order to achieve the desired probability p.
- map functions f described above need not be carried out with each GSM measurement, but only when eCBS thres is being redetermined.
- the terminal does not calculate the map itself and only needs to compare the comparison between the current value of eCBS and eCBS thres .
- the map functions are independent of the terminal's hardware parameters, the tables can be calculated and made available independently of the terminal. In other words, the tables can be created for different regions, radio network topographies and/or network operators.
- the tables can be prestored on the terminal or called up by the terminal (if needed).
- This exemplary embodiment of the present invention relates to the automatic identification of cliques for the realisation and improvement of proactive multi-person Location-Based Community Services (LBCS's).
- LBCS's Location-Based Community Services
- a clique in a non-directional graph G denotes a number of vertices V, in which all elements are connected in pairs by an edge. V is therefore a fully interconnected subgraph of G.
- the order of a clique corresponds to the number of vertices contained.
- the problem of identifying cliques is defined as follows: A number S of the order s of mobile target persons is given. It should then be automatically identified when a clique C n of the order 2 ⁇ n ⁇ s has formed and its composition should be determined.
- the users' terminals could convey the locally measured location information to a location server either periodically or using a fixed update distance.
- the reported positions are constantly compared at the server end and checked for clique formation.
- One disadvantage of this approach is the excessive communication, which is higher, the greater the required spatial and temporal accuracy of the clique recognition is intended to be. At the same time, this results in a high calculating load for the location server.
- a method is created in which the number of communications exchanged between the terminal and the server is reduced.
- the strain on the air interface should be relieved by this, possible monetary costs for the user for using mobile carrier services such as GPRS or UMTS reduced and the terminal's energy consumption resulting from the transmission of communications reduced.
- the calculating load on the part of the location server should be reduced, which increases its scalability in relation to terminals that can be used simultaneously.
- One method according to an embodiment of the invention is, in contrast to a structural approach, based on proving the non-existence of a clique for as long as the clique does not exist. Based on knowledge acquired from graph theory, this sort of proof is achieved by partitioning the target objects from S into independent sets. An independent set is a subset of S, elements of which are not found in pairs at close range to one another. In order to monitor the validity of the independent sets and check identified cliques for disintegration, close-range and separation identification are used, as described below.
- the process for identifying cliques is therefore characterised by the fact that no completely new, specialised protocol for tracking target objects has been designed. Instead, close-range and separation identification is dynamically used on pairs of target objects. Only a few of the possible pairs from S need be simultaneously observed, which sharply reduces the required communications cost.
- the method is preferably carried out on a central server, to which the users' terminals are connected.
- One clique identification strategy in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is based on close-range and separation identification.
- Close-range identification describes the ability of an LBCS to automatically recognise when the spatial distance of a pair within a group of mobile target objects (users) falls below a predefined close-range distance.
- separation identification denotes the ability to identify that a predefined separation distance between two objects has been exceeded.
- a dynamic, alternating control of a first, accurate locating process e.g. GPS
- a second, energy-saving locating process e.g. GSM-based
- the limit at which the spatial distance of a pair of target objects falls below a predefined close-range distance or exceeds a predefined separation distance thereby corresponds to the limit of the update zone described above.
- the first locating process is only activated and carried out when it is no longer guaranteed using the second locating process that a pair of target objects falls below or exceeds the close-range or separation distance.
- a graph-based approach that models target individuals as nodes is preferably selected for clique identification.
- An edge between two nodes means that the spatial distance dist(t i , t j ) between the corresponding target persons t i and t j is smaller than a predefined clique distance d c >0.
- a clique C n is a quantity of n in pairs by an edge of connected nodes. This involves a boundary line tolerance b c >0 associated with the clique identification being introduced: If d c ⁇ dist(t i , t j ) ⁇ d c +b c , then t i and t j may be viewed jointly, although they do not have to be. The two target individuals can therefore be allowed as potential candidates for a clique, but this need not be the case.
- This embodiment differs from existing graph algorithms, in that the edges of the graph are not entirely known. Instead of this, proving the existence of an edge requires a separation identification being carried out between the target individuals. If the non-existence of an edge is shown, a corresponding close-range identification must be underway. Both operations generate costs and should be carried out as infrequently as possible as a result.
- the present embodiment is based on demonstrably identifying all possible cliques, but at the same time reducing the number of observed pairs of nodes as far as possible. It has emerged that this often only requires a small number of edges to be monitored through close-range identification.
- FIG. 3 shows a state transition diagram. According to this, observation of a pair always begins in the “unknown” state. Only the “long” state can be reached from this and this is achieved by initiating close-range identification (1). The long state is either exited, if the close-range identification is explicitly retained (2), which brings about a return to “unknown”, or if the pair is identified as being at close range (3). In this case, a transition is made to the “provisional” state. The provisional state is left when the positions of the target individuals are explicitly queried at a later time and once again compared. If they are both then still found in the close range (5), the separation identification is initiated and the state switches over to “short”. Otherwise (4), there is a return to “unknown”. The only way of exiting the “short” state is a corresponding separation event (6). It leads once again to a restart in the “unknown” state.
- One embodiment of the invention is based on proving the non-existence of a clique, as long, as this has not been created. According to the following findings from graph theory, this sort of proof is possible, even if only a small part of all possible pair relationships are actively observed.
- An independent set is a subset I ⁇ S of variable i, 1 ⁇ i ⁇ s of nodes, which are not connected in pairs to an edge. It is therefore known that the target individuals from I are not located in pairs within the close-range distance. Consequently, all possible pairs of an independent set are in the “long” observational state; in other words, close-range identification is activated.
- chromatic number” or also the “node colouration index” ⁇ (G) of a graph G corresponds to the smallest number of colours needed to colour the nodes of G, such that no two nodes connected by an edge are the same colour.
- ⁇ (G) also equals the minimum number of independent sets into which the nodes of G can be divided. The latter is crucial for the desired proof. The statement can easily be seen, in that precisely those nodes with the same colouring are grouped in an independent set.
- the clique number ⁇ (G) of a graph G determines the order of the largest clique in G. It is a fact that the chromatic number of a graph is always greater than or equal to the clique number, ⁇ (G) ⁇ (G); this is easy to reproduce. It is evident that no two nodes of the same independent set are contained in the same clique. Consequently, even the largest clique of a graph can only be made up of a maximum of one node per independent set. Since the minimum number of independent sets is equal to the chromatic number ⁇ (G), then ⁇ (G) ⁇ (G).
- the algorithm of this embodiment is based on these findings.
- the quantity number of all target objects S is divided into n ⁇ 1 independent sets. If this is possible, it must follow that n ⁇ 1 ⁇ (G) ⁇ (G), which excludes cliques of the order n.
- the conditions of all independent sets are constantly monitored. If a set is made up of only one target individual, no observations need be carried out. Otherwise, the close-range identification (“long” state) must be active for all pairs of target individuals within the set.
- the existence of this sort of clique may be excluded if the five target objects can be divided into three independent sets, as happens in FIG. 4 .
- there are two sets which each consist of a pair of objects (t i , t j ) and (t k ,t l ), and are consequently found in the “long” observational state. It should be emphasised at this point that the clique identification for s n only requires a close-range identification to be underway.
- the algorithm for clique identification manages four quantities of pair observations: S c contains observations in the “short” state, L c those in the “long” state, U c those that are “unknown” and P c the “provisional” observations.
- the algorithm basically pushes the observations back and forth between these numbers using the state transitions from FIG. 3 .
- a number X c which contains all current independent sets, is managed.
- the number Y c contains all current cliques that are smaller than n.
- elements of the independent sets contained in X c are observed in pairs in the “long” state.
- the pair observations within the cliques from Y c may be either “short” or “provisional”, while use of the “provisional” state is aimed at largely avoiding the cost-intensive separation identification.
- X c is always reorganised when new proof based on independent sets is calculated. This is normally the case when an observation is ended in the “long” state on account of a close-range event. As a result of the reorganisation of the independent sets, new “long” observations emerge, which are moved from U c to L c . Moreover, existing “long” observations, which are no longer needed by any of the new independent sets are discontinued, in other words, transferred from L c to U c . A detailed description can be found below.
- the numbers S c , L c and P c are empty, and U c contains all possible pairs from S.
- Y c contains s cliques, each of which consists of an individual target object.
- X c contains s independent sets, each of which contains a target object.
- Initial proof of the non-existence of a clique C n based on independent sets is calculated.
- the close-range identification is activated for one or more pairs of target objects, which transfers the corresponding state observations from U c to L c .
- X c now contains n ⁇ 1 independent sets. The non-existence of the searched-for clique is thereby guaranteed until one of the new “long” observations triggers a close-range event.
- the processing of close-range events is costlier: If following establishment of the close range between the target objects t i and t j an independent set I of the order i exists, which hitherto contains the pair, I is divided into two independent sets: a trivial set, which is made up of either t i or t j —the target object selected is determined on the basis of a chance function—and also an independent set of the order i ⁇ 1, which contains the remaining objects from I.
- the result is that the total number of independent sets in X c is increased by one and, as a consequence, the non-existence of a clique of the order n is no longer guaranteed.
- the non-existence of the clique is demonstrated when the objects can divided into two independent sets, corresponding to a 2-colouration of the graph.
- the graph contains an odd cycle, as can be seen from the brief observations drawn in, this sort of colouration is impossible.
- steps (2) and (3) of the process described above attempts are made in each case to reduce the number of independent sets covering the nodes from S to n ⁇ 1.
- two functions are presented below, which can be repeatedly used on the sets contained in X c : “mergers” and “distributions”. Both functions are aimed at keeping the fluctuation between quantities U c and L c as small as possible. As a result, observations already being carried out should be changed as little as possible, in order to keep down the associated expenditure and computational complexity. Mergers are more efficient than distributions in this case, which is why they are always tried out first. A distribution is only tried if no possible merger can be found. Only when distributions are not possible in step (3) of the basic procedure, is the full intermeshing (4) used.
- a merger receives all existing long observations of the independents sets from X c and is therefore highly efficient.
- Two independent sets I a and I b for which it is true that all pairs (I a ⁇ I b ) are included in U c ⁇ L c , are in this case selected from X c . These pairs are then transferred into the long observation state L c . This causes I a and I b to merge into a single independent set, which reduces the total number of independent sets by one.
- FIG. 8 One example is shown in FIG. 8 .
- (t i , t j , t m ) is partitioned into (t i ) and (t j , t m ) and three independent sets remain on the playing field (2).
- Distribution is attempted when no two independent sets suitable for merging can be found in X c . In this case, there is therefore at least one “short” or “provisional” observation between all combinations of independent sets. Distributions cause greater expenditure than mergers, since in this case “long” observations are deliberately discontinued. The observations are therefore explicitly moved into the “unknown” state.
- An independent set I a can be distributed if there is another independent set I b from X c for each of its elements t a , so that no element t b ⁇ I b is found in a “short” or “floating” observation of t a . If this condition does not apply, each element of I a can be absorbed by another set and I a disappears. This in turn leads to the total number of sets being reduced by one.
- FIG. 9 One example of a distribution is shown in FIG. 9 .
- the independent set (t i , t j , t m ) decomposes again into two parts (t j ) and (t i , t m ), on account of a close-range event between t i and t j (1).
- no merger is possible this time, since “short” or “floating” observations (2) exist between each of the remaining three sets.
- the only possible set of candidates (t l , t k ) is therefore distributed: t l is absorbed by (t j ) and t k by (t i , t m ) (3). The non-existence of a 3-clique is thereby guaranteed again.
- substrategies is possible according to embodiments of the invention. These relate both to mergers and also distributions. As already mentioned, situations often arise in which more than one pair of independent sets are suitable for a merger or more than one set for a distribution. In deciding which pair or set is selected, two to some extent conflicting goals are possible: One possible objective would be to keep the total number of “long” observations, which are used to show n ⁇ 1 independent sets, as small as possible. The substrategy associated with this, which is referred to below as “minimum observations”, therefore preferably generates small independent sets, as the number of “long” observations rises quadratically with the order of a set.
- the first combination is selected, since it only requires an additional long observation, compared with four new observations in the second case.
- the substrategy with minimum observations always chooses the greatest independent set from among possible candidates, since the greatest number of “long” observations is thereby disintegrated.
- the alternative substrategy which is referred to as “minimum node”, tries, however, to reduce the total number of observed target individuals. It is assumed here to be advantageous if a target individual is not observed (which is the case with one-element independent sets) or if a small number of target individuals are subjected to a smaller number of “long” observations. The disadvantage that other target individuals must be monitored more intensively in return should thereby be counterbalanced.
- the substrategy therefore tries to generate as many one-element independent sets as possible. Mergers that include such sets are therefore avoided wherever possible. In the case of distributions, large absorbing sets are preferably chosen and small sets partitioned.

bsa (j) is the radio cell ID of the base station a, and ca (j) is the assigned signal strength, at which the control channel BCCH (Broadcast Control Channel) is received at time tj. In the case of GSM, it is customary for the measurement to be limited to the N=7 strongest base stations, as this corresponds to the number of base stations contained in the measurement report, which a mobile phone transmits to the BSC (Base Station Controller) in dedicated mode, i.e. during a call. There is a multiplicity of methods for comparing two measurements, such as, for example, determining joint base stations with consecutive measurements, determining the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient between two consecutive measurements or the distance between received signal strengths (e.g. the Manhattan and Euclidean distance). These are described, for example, by J. Krumm and K. Hinckley in “The Nearme Wireless Proximity Server”, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp), 2004, 283-300:
-
- CBS=length (BS(j)∩BS(k))
- The value of this indicator can easily be calculated. However, this only depicts N+1 discrete values (n∩ε {0, . . . N}). Moreover, this cannot distinguish between close and more remote antennae.
-
- This indicator illustrates how accurately the sequences of joint base stations BS(j) and BS(k) correspond to one another (the sequences usually correspond to falling signal strengths). Although this already represents an improvement compared with (i) on account of the implicit consideration given to signal strengths, it nevertheless has the disadvantage that changes in rank between close and remote antennae are treated proportionally.
-
- dist (C(j),C(k))
- Common “dist” functions are the Manhattan distance and the Euclidean distance. They both have a higher resolution than (i), but are also more sensitive to influences during signal propagation (e.g. fast fading noise or sudden line of sight effects). Moreover, it is only possible to compare signal strengths from joint base stations.
wBS (j)={(v 1 (j) ,bs 1 (j)),(v 2 (j) ,bs 2 (j)), . . . ,(v N (j) ,bs N (j))}. (3)

in which L≧N. The expanded base station set

where δ(i,j)=1 at i=j, and otherwise 0. Consequently, the average weighting across all Nw measurements is calculated for each ebsi (j).
- 1. Map derived from information on the radio network topology (e.g. base station positions, antenna alignment, etc.), combined with models for signal propagation. The map based on this may be supplied to the terminal in advance or as needed (e.g. stored on it).
- 2. Acquisition of the map by the terminal, for example, using a Bayessian decision system or local regression analysis.
- 3. Use of a parametric model through parameterisation of the terminal using empirical and area-dependent scale values, particularly by:
ƒlinear:dist(p i ,p j)=q 1 +q 2 ·eCBS(M e (i) ,M e (j)) (7)
err(p i , p j):=trueDist(p i ,p j)−dist(p i , p j),
with a standard deviation σ, the following further distance can be determined:
distobserve=disttrigger−σ·qnorm(p)
eCBS thres :=f −1(distobserve)

- The “long” state denotes a close-range identification taking place between a pair of target individuals. In this case, the close-range distance dp is compared to the clique distance dc. The boundary line tolerance of the close-range identification bp may be set at any value between 0 and the boundary line tolerance bc associated with the clique identification. The distance of the pair is therefore undoubtedly greater than or equal to dc. This guarantees the non-existence of an edge between corresponding nodes in the graph.
- The “short” state means that two target individuals are monitored for separation. In this case, the separation distance ds is compared to dc+bp. The boundary line tolerance of the close-range identification bs is set at bc−bp. In this way, possible blurring intervals in close-range and separation identification are disjoint. Ping pong effects, which would arise if objects could be observed as close and separate at the same time, are thereby avoided. The distance between two objects, which are in the short observational state relative to each other, is therefore undoubtedly smaller than or equal to ds+bs=dc+bp+bc−bp=dc+bc. The existence of a corresponding edge can therefore be assumed.
- If no information on the spatial relationship between two target individuals is known, the pair is in the “unknown” state. For simplicity's sake, this state is not depicted graphically in the figures.
- A pair of target individuals, which is not actively observed, but has nevertheless recently triggered a close-range event, is in the “provisional” state. The purpose of this state is to distinguish pairs, which are presumably in the close range, from others without active separation identification. This should be delayed for as long as possible, in order to avoid unnecessary costs.
-
- 1. The cliques in Yc are reorganised and a check is made to see whether the edge identified by the close-range event leads to a clique of the order n. If this is the case, a check is made to see whether the clique has pair observations in Pc. If necessary, polling is used to check whether the corresponding pairs still satisfy the close-range condition. If the clique is then still obtained, it can be reported to the requesting application. The clique members are then deleted from the list of observed target objects and the procedure is reset.
- 2. If no clique of the order n can be identified in the first step, a check is made to see whether proof of non-existence is possible through the production of n−1 independent sets (see below), by only using those observations that are currently in Uc[Lc. Therefore, there should be no explicit close-range checks that could potentially release observations from Pc to Uc in this step. Corresponding polling is therefore avoided at this point, as it is relatively expensive. So if the production of n−1 independent sets at this point is possible, the corresponding long observations are initialised and the event processing routine can reset.
- 3. Otherwise, the positions of all target objects that are part of at least one “provisional” pair observation are polled and compared with one another. Depending on the state transitions from
FIG. 3 , all pairs from Pc, which are then still in the close range, are transferred to Sc and actively observed in relation to separation. By contrast, all pairs tested from Pc, which have separated from one another in the meantime, are transferred to Uc. As a result, Uc now possibly contains more free pairs than before. Another attempt is therefore made to create n−1 independent sets with the help of the pairs contained in Uc∪Lc. If this works, the routine is terminated. - 4. As already mentioned, proof based on n−1 independent sets is successful in most cases, which means that this step does not normally need to be carried out. In rare cases, proof is not possible, however, because even after the polling and comparison of the positions of the pairs from Pc there are too few candidates in Uc, from which a selection can be made for the long observations required.
