Definitions
- This specification generally relates to systems and methods for sharing digital content using a computer-implemented social networking service.
- Another variant of Internet based communication forums are the web- based "social network” applications, in which a number of users are able to find each other's' accounts and voluntarily become “friends” or “followers” of each other's posted messages. Users generally post brief messages about their status, mood, activities, and such, and their friends and followers can read and optionally reply to those messages. As such, friends may stay abreast of each other's' activities as a tool for maintaining their social bonds.
- Some social networks provide tools for sharing information into or out of the social network.
- some social networking websites provide a button that can be incorporated into third party web pages. When a user presses the button, information is passed back to the social networking website to indicate who pressed the button and on which web page the button was located. In such examples, the user's social networking peers can be notified about the user's activity on the third party web page.
- innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include the actions of displaying, within a web page of a plurality of web pages, a graphical representation of a content sharing interface of a first social networking service, the content sharing interface comprising a content input area to which user input can be received, receiving first user input to the content input area, in response to the first user input, expanding the content sharing interface within the web page to include an expanded content input area and a distribution interface, the expanded content input area displaying a graphical representation of digital content that is to be distributed, receiving second user input to the distribution interface, the second user input indicating one or more contacts to which the digital content is to be distributed, in response to receiving the second user input, displaying one or more icons within the distribution interface, each icon of the one or more icons being a graphical representation of the one or more contacts, receiving third user input to the content sharing interface, the third user input including a user instruction to distribute the digital content, and in response to the third user input, transmitting a post data

- FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for enforcing policies.
- implementations of the present disclosure are directed to content sharing interfaces that can be used to define a distribution of digital content.
- a sharing user can include a user of a computing device that shares digital content with other users over a network (e.g., the Internet).
- a receiving user can include a user that receives digital content shared by a sharing user.
- Receiving users can be associated with a sharing user in one or more contexts.
- the receiving users and the sharing user can be contacts of one another within a social networking service.
- the receiving users can be users that are contacts of the sharing user within an email service.
- Content sharing interfaces are provided in association with various forms of digital content (e.g., uniform resource indicators (URIs), hyperlinks, maps, images, videos, files, social network posts, online articles, blogs). Users can interact with a content sharing interface to indicate that they wish to post the content associated with the interface, or a comment about the content, to contacts within a social networking service and/or contacts external to the social networking service.
- URIs uniform resource indicators
- hyperlinks maps, images, videos, files, social network posts, online articles, blogs
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example network architecture 100.
- the network architecture 100 includes a number of client devices 102-1 10 communicably connected to a server system 1 12 by a network 1 14.
- the server system 1 12 includes one or more processing devices 1 16 and one or more data stores 1 18.
- the processing devices 1 16 execute computer instructions (e.g., social network computer program code) stored in the data stores 1 18 to perform functions (e.g., of a social network server).
- the client devices 102-1 10 can execute web browser applications that can be used to access the social networking service.
- the client devices 102-1 10 can execute software applications that are specific to the social network (e.g., social networking "apps" running on smartphones).
- the users 120a-120e can participate in the social networking service provided by the server device 1 12 by posting information, such as text comments (e.g., updates, announcements, replies), digital images, videos, search results, a link to other digital content (e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL) linking to a digital video and/or digital images) and/or other appropriate digital content.
- information can be posted on a user's behalf by systems and/or services external to the social network or the server system 1 12.
- the user 120a may post a review of a movie to a movie review website, and with proper permissions that website may cross-post the review to the social network on the user's 120a behalf.
- a software application executing on a mobile device may use global positioning system (GPS) capabilities to determine the user's location and automatically update the social network with the user's location (e.g., "At Home”, “At Work”, “In Brownsdale, MN”).
- GPS global positioning system
- Users 120a-120e interacting with the client devices 102-1 10 can also use the social network provided by the server system 1 12 to define social circles to organize and categorize the relationships to other users. Such relationships can be defined using social circles.
- a social networking service enables a user to group contacts into one or more social circles, which can be based on categories of relationships of a user to other users. The relationship can be implicit or explicit. For example, and within the context of a social networking service, a user can assign contacts to one or more social circles to better control the distribution and visibility of social networking posts and/or other digital content.
- a social circle is provided as a data set defining a collection of contacts that are associated with a user of a computer-implemented social networking service.
- a social circle can be described from the perspective of an individual that is the center of a particular collection of socially interconnected people, or from the aggregate perspective of a collection of socially interconnected people.
- a social circle can have narrowly defined boundaries, all of the members of the social circle may be familiar with one another, and permission may be required for a member to join a social circle.
- a user of the social networking service define a social circle, and the social circle, as a data set defining a collection of contacts, may reflect a real-life social circle of the user.
- Users of a social networking service may wish to share information with social networking peers. However, users may also wish to have control over distribution of such information among their social networking peers. For example, some users may have concerns about their privacy when posting information. Such users may wish to keep posts about their personal activities restricted from their professional social circles. For example, a user can post pictures of his softball team to his "friends" and "softball team” social circles, but not to a "co-workers" social circle. Other users may wish to target the information they post so it reaches substantially only selected subsets of their contacts. For example, a user may wish to post family announcements substantially only to a "family" social circle, or may wish to post political comments substantially only to a "politics" social circle.
- the client devices 102-1 10 can be computing devices such as laptop or desktop computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants, portable media players, tablet computers, or other appropriate computing devices that can be used to communicate with an electronic social network.
- the server system 1 12 can include a single computing device such as a computer server.
- the server system 1 12 can represent more than one computing device working together to perform the actions of a server computer (e.g., cloud computing).
- the network 1 14 can be a public communication network (e.g., the Internet, cellular data network, dialup modems over a telephone network) or a private communications network (e.g., private LAN, leased lines).
- FIGs. 2A-2D depict an example content sharing interface 200 in
- the content sharing interface 200 can be presented to a user of a social networking service within the social networking service (e.g., the content sharing interface 200 is displayed within a web page of a website of the social networking service), and/or external to the social networking service (e.g., the content sharing interface 200 is displayed within a web page of a website that is not directly associated with the social networking service).
- the content sharing interface 200 enables users to post digital content for distribution of the digital content to a defined set of recipients.
- a post can be generated by the user and can include an underlying post data set.
- the post data set can include data associated with the digital content and the identified recipients.
- the post data set can include the digital content, timestamp data (e.g., a timestamp indicating the time that the post was generated), distribution data (e.g., contacts, one or more social circles, etc.), and identification (ID) data (e.g., an ID assigned to the post data set upon generation of the post).
- the distribution data is processed to provide an access control list (ACL) that specifies the distribution of the digital content (e.g., which contacts within or without the social networking service are granted access to the digital content).
- ACL access control list
- a distribution hub can be provided as a backend service (e.g., provided by the server system 1 12 of FIG. 1 ).
- a backend service e.g., provided by the server system 1 12 of FIG. 1 .
- an ACL service can be executed to provide the distribution hub and to enforce visibility of distributed digital content.
- the ACL service can be provided as one or more computer program applications that can be executed by one or more server systems.
- the ACL service can generate the ACL and can determine end points, to which the post data set is to be distributed based on the ACL.
- the contacts that are authorized to access or otherwise receive the digital content are determined based on the ACL.
- the ID of the post data set can be written to a per user/view index at the ACL service. When fetching posts to distribute to a particular user, the user/view index is accessed and the IDs of the various posts that the user is authorized to view are determined.
- the post data sets are retrieved from a data store (e.g., data store 1 18 of FIG. 1 ) and are transmitted for display on a client computing device associated with the particular user.
- a data store e.g., data store 1 18 of FIG. 1
- a distribution for digital content can be defined based on one or more social circles.
- a distribution can include a list of one or more contacts, to which digital content is to be distributed using the social networking service.
- a distribution includes one sub-distribution (e.g., one social circle is identified for distribution of the digital content).
- a distribution includes a plurality of sub- distributions.
- a sub-distribution can include a contact that is not a member of a particular social circle and/or is not a user of the underlying social networking service.
- the content sharing interface 200 includes distribution interface 202 that is associated with digital content providing in a content area 204.
- distribution interface 202 that is associated with digital content providing in a content area 204.
- the digital content can be a uniform resource indicator (URI), a web page, a subsection of a web page, a media playback interface, a hyperlink, a social network post (e.g., text), an online map, a location on an online map, a digital image, a digital video, search results and/or any other appropriate item or information that can be represented in an electronic user interface (Ul).
- URI uniform resource indicator
- Ul electronic user interface
- the distribution interface 202 includes a contact input area 206.
- the user can type or otherwise select identifiers to input into the contact input area 206.
- the identifiers identify other users, categories of users and/or social circles to define distribution of the digital content (e.g., through a social network service).
- the identifiers can include contact identifiers, social circle identifiers, email addresses, or any other appropriate identifier than can be used to identify one or more persons with whom content can be shared.
- the identifiers provided in the contact input area 206 are used to generate an ACL that defines distribution of the digital content provided in the content area 204.
- an example identifier icon 208 is provided in the distribution interface 202.
- the identifier icon 208 is a visual representation of one or more users that digital content is to be shared with.
- a user has tentatively indicated that digital content within the content area 204 is to be shared with members of a "friends" social circle.
- identifier icons provide a tentative distribution for the digital content.
- the user can activate (e.g., click on) a delete control 210 to remove the identifier icon 208 from the contact input area 206.
- a menu 213 can be presented in response to user input.
- the user can select (e.g., click on) the contact input area 206 and the menu 213 is displayed in response to the selection.
- the user can input text into the contact input area 206 and the menu 213 is displayed in response to the input.
- the user can select (e.g., click on) an add control 214 and the menu 213 and the menu 213 is displayed in response to the selection.
- the menu 213 includes multiple regions.
- a menu region 220 displays a collection of social circles 222 that the user can select from.
- the social circles can include social circles that the user has defined using a social networking service.
- the collection of social circles 222 may include a subset of the user's most commonly targeted social circles and/or a subset of the user's most populated social circles.
- a user control 224 can be selected to display additional social circles that are managed by the user. By selecting (e.g., clicking on) a social circle from the listed social circles, a corresponding identifier icon 208 can be displayed in the contact input area 206.
- a menu region 230 presents a collection non-circle specific contact groups that the user can select to distribute the content to. For example, by selecting "My circles,” the user can choose to share the digital content with anyone who is in any of the user's social circles. By selecting “Extended Circles,” the user can choose to share the digital content with anyone in the user's extended network (e.g., friends of friends, other users who share a public social circle with the user). By selecting "Anyone,” the user can choose to share the digital content with anyone (e.g., the general public) over the Internet. By making a selection (e.g., clicking on) from the menu region 230, a corresponding identifier icon 208 can be displayed in the contact input area 206.
- a corresponding identifier icon 208 can be displayed in the contact input area 206.
- the menu region 230 can include one or more domains, to which the user can share digital content.
- a domain "Domain" is provided.
- An example domain can include a domain of an Internet-based service provider (e.g., Google Inc.).
- One or more domains can be identified in the distribution interface, and the digital content can be shared with all users that interact with the specified domain(s).
- a menu region 240 presents a collection of the user's most recently used distribution lists.
- the menu region 240 may not be displayed. For example, new users may have never used the content sharing interface 200 previously, and therefore may have no previously used distribution lists to choose from. As the user uses the content sharing interface 200, the number of items displayed in the menu region 240 can expand up to a predetermined number of most recently used distribution lists.

- the user can activate (e.g., click on) a delete control 624, 626 of the respective identifier icons 620, 622 to remove the identifier icons 620, 622 from the distribution interface 614.
- a distribution for digital content provided in the content input area 612 can be defined by the social circles and/or contacts identified in the distribution interface 614.
- a distribution is defined by a Friends social circle (graphically represented by the friends circle icon 620) and a Family social circle (graphically represented by the family circle icon 622).
- the distribution includes all of the contacts that are members of the Friends social circle and all of the contacts that are members of the Family social circle.
- the Friends social circle and the Family social circle can each be considered sub- distributions that define the overall distribution.
- an email sharing control 630 can be provided. When activated (e.g., clicked on), the email sharing control 630 provides the user with a way to control whether or not the content will be shared with people who are not currently using the social networking service.
- the email sharing control 682 can function as a toggle control that the user can click once to indicate that email should be used, and another click can indicate that email should not be used.

- an auto-complete component provides auto- complete functionality that enables the user to type in part of the name of a social circle and/or individual contact to specify to which social circles and/or individual contacts the post content is to be distributed.
- the auto- complete functionality can be based on a contact ranking.
- contacts and/or social circles can include an associated ranking score. Contacts having a higher ranking score are ranked higher than contacts having a lower ranking score.
- auto-complete functionality can identify one or more contacts and/or one or more social circles based on text input into a distribution interface of a content sharing interface, discussed in further detail below. The one or more contacts and/or one or more social circles can be listed in rank order based on the ranking scores.
- the text input can include the letter "f and the auto-complete functionality can identify the contacts “Farley” and “Frank” as contacts of the user, to which digital content can be distributed.
- the contact "Farley” can have a ranking score that is lower than a ranking score of the contact "Frank.”
- the contacts can be displayed to the user for selection in rank order based on the ranking score.
- the contact “Frank” can be listed higher on a list of contacts displayed to the user than the contact "Farley.” In this manner, although the contact “Farley” could be listed first on an alphabetical basis, the contact “Frank” is instead listed first based on the ranking scores.
- the text input can include the letter "f and the auto-complete functionality can identify the social circles “Family” and "Friends" as social circles defined by the user, to which digital content can be distributed.
- the social circle “Family” can have a ranking score that is lower than a ranking score of the social circle "Friends.”
- the social circles can be displayed to the user for selection in rank order based on the ranking score.
- the social circle “Friends” can be listed higher on a list of contacts displayed to the user than the social circle “Family.” In this manner, although the social circle “Family” could be listed first on an alphabetical basis, the social circle “Friends” is instead listed first based on the ranking scores.
- the ranking scores can be based on a popularity of contacts and/or social circles. For example, a contact that the user often shares digital content with may have a ranking score that is higher than a ranking score of a contact that the user rarely shares digital content with. Continuing with the example provided above, the contact "Frank” may receive digital content from the user more often than the contact "Farley.” As another example, a social circle that is more often used to define distribution of digital content may have a higher ranking score than a ranking score of a social circle that is less often used to define distribution of digital content. Continuing with the example provided above, the social circle "Friends" may be used more often to define distribution of digital content by the user than the social circle "Family" (i.e., the user distributes content to the Friends social circle than the Family social circle).
- the ranking scores can be based on a social vicinity of the user to the respective contacts. For example, a ranking score of a contact that is a direct contact of the user may be higher than a ranking score of a contact that is an indirect contact of the user.
- the contact "Frank” can be a direct contact of the user (e.g., a friend) while the contact "Farley” is an indirect contact of the user (e.g., a friend of a friend).
- the ranking scores can be based on a frequency of interaction via emails between the user and each respective contact.
- the user can directly email each contact using an email service and a ranking score can be generated for each contact based on the email interaction.
- the ranking score can be determined based on a number of emails sent from the user to a particular contact.
- the ranking score can be determined based on a number of emails sent from the user to a particular contact over a particular time period. In this manner, frequency of email contact (i.e., number of emails per time period) is considered in the ranking score.
- the ranking score can be determined based on the number of emails sent from the user to the particular contact and the number of emails sent from the particular contact to the user.
- each ranking score can be provided by an email service to the social networking service.
- the contact "Frank” can be in frequent email communication with the user, while the contact “Farley” is in less frequent email communication with the user.
- a ranking score corresponding to Frank and a ranking score corresponding to Farley can be provided to the underlying social networking service from an email service.
- text input to a content sharing interface can include the letter "f and the auto-complete functionality can identify the contacts "Farley” and "Frank” as contacts of the user, to which digital content can be distributed.
- the contacts can be displayed to the user for selection in rank order based on the ranking score. Consequently, and continuing with the instant example, the contact "Frank” can be listed higher on a list of contacts displayed to the user than the contact "Farley.”
- a character can be provided to the server as it is input by the user and the server can process the character, and any previously provided characters, to provide output for presentation to the user.
- auto- complete functionality discussed herein can include character data being transmitted to the server as it is input by the user to the content sharing interface.
- the server can generate output including one or more contact names and/or social circles that correspond to the input character data for presentation back to the user in a list of contact names and/or social circles, from which the user can select a particular contact and/or social circle.
- a user can provide user input to a text region of a content sharing interface.
- the user input can include one or more trigger characters, each trigger character extending the distribution (i.e., the resulting ACL) of the user-provided digital content.
- a trigger character can indicate that characters immediately following the trigger character define a contact, to which the digital content of the particular post should be distributed to. In some implementations, this is in addition to contacts and/or social circles identified in an associated distribution interface.
- a trigger character can include the "@" character and/or the "+” character. The trigger character is immediately followed by a contact name. The trigger character and the contact name of a particular contact indicate, within the text of the particular post, that the post is to be distributed to the particular contact in addition to any other contacts and/or social circles that are input using an associated distribution interface.
- a user can input the text "@Frank" (or "+Frank") in a text region (e.g., content input area 305 of the content sharing interface 300) as part of a textual post.
- a text region e.g., content input area 305 of the content sharing interface 300
- the user can input the text "@Frank and I are headed to Joe's Tavern to watch the playoffs" within a text region of a content sharing interface.
- the user can indicate that the textual post is to be distributed to a social circle (e.g., a Friends social circle) using a distribution interface associated with the content sharing interface (e.g., the distribution interface 340 of the content sharing interface 300).
- an ACL is generated for the textual post, as discussed herein, and includes contacts of the user that are members of the social circle, as well as the contact Frank (who may or may not be a member of the social circle). Accordingly, the presence of the text "@Frank" in the text region results in distribution of the textual post to the contact Frank, even though the contact Frank might not be identified as part of the distribution defined using the distribution interface.

- the user can input the text "@Frank and I are headed to Joe's Tavern to watch the playoffs.”
- the post is distributed to the contact Frank, as well as any contacts and/or social circles defined using the distribution interface.
- the contact Frank, and/or any other contacts that the post is distributed to the post can be displayed as "Frank and I are headed to Joe's Tavern to watch the playoffs" with the "@" trigger character absent.
- the contact name following the trigger character can be converted to hypertext and can provide a link to the contact's profile within the social networking service.
- the user can input the text "@Frank and I are headed to Joe's Tavern to watch the playoffs.”
- the post is distributed to the contact Frank, as well as any contacts and/or social circles defined using the distribution interface.
- the contact Frank, and/or any other contacts that the post is distributed to the post can be displayed as "Frank and I are headed to Joe's Tavern to watch the playoffs" with the "@" trigger character absent and the text "Frank” having a hyperlink associated therewith.
- Action on the hyperlink e.g., clicking on
- text following a trigger character within a text region can be provided using auto-complete functionality discussed herein.
- the user can initially type "@F" and, in response, a list of contact names can be presented to the user to select from to complete the contact name input.
- a list of contact names can be presented to the user to select from to complete the contact name input.
- the contact names provided in the list of contact names can be in ranked order based on respective ranking scores.
- a server can analyze the submitted text and recognize the presence of a trigger character within the text. In response, the server can analyze the text immediately following the trigger character to identify a contact of the user that submitted the text and can add the contact to the ACL for distribution of the post.
- a character can be provided to the server as it is input by the user and the server can process the character, and any previously provided characters, to provide output for presentation to the user.
- auto- complete functionality discussed herein can include character data being transmitted to the server as it is input by the user to the content sharing interface.
- the server can generate output including one or more contact names and/or social circles that correspond to the input character data for presentation back to the user in a list of contact names and/or social circles, from which the user can select a particular contact and/or social circle.
- the presence of a trigger character within the text region can trigger auto-complete functionality for selection of a contact name and/or social circle to immediately follow the trigger character.

For example, a desktop computer with a 21 inch display and 1280x768 resolution can display more of a map than a web-enabled handheld device having a 3 inch display and 240x240 resolution. Accordingly, the map space 810 that is selected for presentation to different user devices can be different when the display region 815 and resolution of each user device is different.
- user preferences can affect the display region 815 available to present map spaces.
- User devices can have user preference settings that define the display region 815 and resolution. For example, a user device displaying a web page on a 21 inch display device can have a limited display region 815, if the application window containing the display region 815 is resized to occupy less than the entire display. Similarly, if the user device is displaying multiple windows within the 21 inch display or otherwise is not maximizing the window displaying the web page, the display region 815 may be limited.
- the user device can also be configured by the user to operate at a lower resolution than the maximum available resolution, resulting in less information being displayed.
- the display region 815 can vary according to publisher
- each web page allocated for displaying the map space 810 may vary according to the display region defined in the design specifications and allocated by the publishers.
- a publisher that publishes web pages dedicated to displaying maps may allocate a large portion of the web page as the display region 815, as shown in FIG. 8, while utilizing a small portion of the display for other information such as hyperlinks to other web pages.
- An example of a publisher that will allocate a large portion of the web page to displaying maps is a map service.
- a publisher that publishes general content web pages my be more inclined to allocate a much smaller portion of the web page as the display region 815 since the map space 810 is only a portion of the information that the publisher is presenting.
- the user can activate the share button 805 to share the particular map shown within the display region 815.
- the share button 805 by clicking on the share button 805, the user can share a URL 825 that links to the mapping service and provides instructions to display the map.
- the URL 825 may not accurately convey the central point of the map space 810 that is currently shown within the display region 815 and/or at the selected zoom level 820.
- the map that is displayed within the display region may be the result of one or more pan and/or zoom operations invoked by the user.
- activation of the share button 805 can cause an identification of the map area 810 (e.g., the URL 825) as well as metadata that describes the display region 815 and the zoom level 820 to be shared with other users as content.
- a resulting post data set can include the URL and the metadata.
- the mapping service can be called and the metadata can be provided to the mapping service (e.g., through one or more application program interfaces (APIs)) to display the map to the receiving user exactly (e.g., with the same pan and zoom operations) as the sharing user viewed the map, when originally sharing the map.
