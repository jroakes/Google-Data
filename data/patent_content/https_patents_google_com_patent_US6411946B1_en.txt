Definitions
- the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for using neural computing techniques, also known as neural networks, to optimize route selection in a computer communication network.
- the invention is particularly suitable for use with ATM networks, but can be used in other networks with Quality of Service requirements, such as IP and the OSI family of protocols.
- ARIMA Automatic Integrated Moving Average
- Computer networks continue to carry increasing amounts of data traffic for various purposes. For example, the popularity of the Internet for educational, business and entertainment purposes is rapidly increasing. Moreover, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks have also become increasingly popular for use by corporations, the government, universities and the like. Furthermore, integration of networks that carry audio, video and other data is occurring.
- the ATM protocol is designed to provide a high-speed, low-delay multiplexing and switching network that supports any type of user traffic, such as voice, data, or video applications.
- ATM is an underlying technology for B-ISDN, which can offer video on demand, live television from multiple sources, full motion multimedia electronic mail, digital music, LAN interconnection, high-speed data transport for science and industry, and other services via an optical fiber telephone line.
- ATM is a connection-oriented protocol
- the virtual circuit defines the travel path for the data, e.g., which switches and transmission links are to be traversed.
- User traffic is segmented into small, fixed-length cells of 53 bytes each with cell headers that identify the virtual circuit. During transmission, high-speed switches read the cell header to relay the traffic to the next designated destination.
- CAC Connection Admission Control
- QoS parameters relate to cell error ratio, severely-errored cell block ratio, cell loss ratio, cell mis-insertion rate, cell transfer delay, mean cell transfer delay, and cell delay variation, for example.
- an appropriate routing technique must be used to select an optimum virtual circuit and manage network traffic.
- Conventional routing techniques include nonadaptive algorithms (e.g., static routing) that do not base their routing decisions on real-time measurements or estimates of the current traffic and topology.
- the optimal route can therefore be computed in advance, off-line, and downloaded to the appropriate routers.
- Static techniques includes shortest path routing, flooding, and flow-based routing.
- Dynamic routing techniques include distance vector routing and link state routing.
- the shortest path routing technique for selecting a virtual circuit With the shortest path routing technique for selecting a virtual circuit, the shortest physical path between the source machine and the destination machine is selected. The routing decision is generally made once when a virtual circuit is being set up, and maintained for the remainder of the session. However, using shortest path routing on a per-request basis often leads to sub-optimal or even highly congested network solutions, and is not considered a good design practice.
- the links with varying amounts of bandwidth can support a multitude of services using both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint routing mechanisms.
- Each of these services when multiplexed over a common stream, needs optimal allocation of network resources based on global information across the entire network.
- the routing strategy can be planned in a number of different ways to maximize revenue generation.
- the present invention is concerned with finding an optimal routing solution that ensures minimum cost of routing with maximum bandwidth usage, while maintaining the QoS parameters within the user-specified threshold values.
- the route discovery engine of the present invention constantly changes its decision based on the current traffic profile across all the links in the network.
- the engine uses a priori knowledge of the traffic pattern so that the decisions can be made in a real-time system without any significant delay.
- the present invention is concerned with addressing the above issues by adapting an artificial neural network-based learning and prediction strategy to provide optimal routing selection and traffic management in a communication network.
- the Backpropagation Algorithm is a known neural network learning technique that looks for the minimum of an error function in weight space using the method of gradient descent. The combination of weights which minimizes the error function is considered to be a solution of the learning problem.
- ordinary backpropagation networks are unable to learn temporal and context sensitive patterns.
- a neural network-based prediction scheme employing a variant of the backpropagation network that makes use of only output measurements of a network to provide optimal routing selection and traffic management in a communication network.

- Selection of the particular link(s) in the optimal communication path may be achieved by applying a shortest-path algorithm at the route discovery engine to the input parameters, e.g., the respective predicted traffic profiles, topology information, and service request data.
- the neural network is preferably an autoregressive backpropagation network, in which case the method includes the further steps of determining respective feedback weights and feedforward weights for at least particular ones of the nodes; iteratively updating the respective feedback and feedforward weights to minimize an output error of the neural network; and selecting particular links for communicating data according to the respective updated feedforward and feedback weights.
- the links may be selected at a user-to-network interface or network-to-network interface.
- the method may include the further steps of providing a plurality of candidate routes comprising the links for communicating data in the communication network; providing a set of “n” network parameters (c 1 , . . . , c n ) for each of the candidate routes; calculating a cost function for each of the candidate routes according to a weighted sum of the network parameters thereof; and selecting one of the candidate routes according to the associated cost function for communicating data in the communication network.

- network is used herein to refer to any network, internet, subnet or the like.
- the present invention employs an Autoregressive Backpropagation Network to surpass the commonly used static mapping methods. This is essentially a topological variation of the backpropagation network, where additional autoregressive memory to individual neurons helps to encode state information internally in a recursive manner.
- the output of the ARBP network is in the form of a predicted traffic profile, to which Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is applied to determine an optimal route for a given connection request.
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm refer to A. S. Tanenbaum, Computer Networks, 3 rd ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc., (1996), sec. 5.2.2.
- the objective function being optimized is a linear function of several network parameters such as cost and delay, subject to feasibility constraints.
- the choice of the optimal route algorithm is not critical. Dijkstra's algorithm is chosen for its efficiency and its relative simplicity.
- Lagrange's Multiplier method or the Penalty function method are not as computationally efficient as Dijkstra's algorithm
- FIG. 1 illustrates a system architecture in accordance with the present invention.
- the system architecture is provided as a process flow and may be implemented using known computer circuitry and coding techniques.
- the essential elements of the traffic management system are shown.
- the elements should be implemented at both the UNI (to work in conjunction with nodal CAC algorithm and UPC constraints) and NNI (to work in conjunction with network CAC algorithm and QoS constraints).
- the architecture of FIG. 1 is repeated in stages for each additional node.
- the core of the architecture is the route discovery engine 110 that takes service requests from a service request function 120 and through a priority handler 130 .
- a service request may be a request to establish a connection between two machines, for example.
- the priority handler 130 is a two-tier pre-processor that sends the loss/delay sensitive traffic to a high priority buffer and loss/delay tolerant traffic to a low priority buffer. This guarantees multiple QoS on a shared media to support diverse applications.
- constraints other than the shortest path to consider such as the bandwidth already consumed in different links, available link and switch capacities, cell processing time, cost of routing, and so on. These values change continuously with the traffic profile across the network.

- a monitoring facility 170 monitors the traffic of a network 190 to provide a traffic history to the ARBP network 160 .
- the ARBP network may be implemented using a computer, or by using dedicated hardware such as a Digital Signal Processing (DSP)/Application-Specific integrated Circuit (ASIC).
- DSP Digital Signal Processing
- ASIC Application-Specific integrated Circuit

- the route discovery engine 110 updates the initial set of values provided by the network operator during run-time based on the predicted traffic profile from the neural network 160 .
- the neural network 160 is an ARBP network that receives the time of day, and day of week, notified exceptions and logical exceptions.
- Notified exceptions are user-designated parameters that may account for periods of unusual network activity. For example, during holidays or other times, network activity may be unusually high or low.
- Logical exceptions are user-designated parameters that may indicate problems with the network, such as nodes or links that are under repair. In this case, traffic must be routed around the problem area.
- the route discovery engine provides information regarding the optimal virtual circuit for transmitting data to a routing table update function 180 .
- the routing table update function 180 includes a transmitter that transmits the appropriate data to the different nodes (e.g., routers) in the network 190 , and to the subsequent stage for the next node.
- each router has a table with one entry per open virtual circuit passing through it.
- Each packet traveling in the network has a virtual circuit number field in its header. When a cell or packet arrives at a router, the router knows which line it arrived on, and what the virtual circuit number is, and can therefore forward the cell or packet on the correct output line (e.g., link).

- ⁇ (t) is an n-dimensional vector.
- the traffic in links 1, . . . , 10, respectively is ⁇ 1 (t), . . . , ⁇ 10 (t).
- the traffic may designate the number of ATM cells or bits present on the link at the time t, for example.
- the inputs of the network consist of ⁇ (t ⁇ ) (delayed values of ⁇ (t), computed off-line), x 1 ⁇ R n (time of day, assuming discrete values between 1 and 23 in increments of 1), x 2 ⁇ R n (day of week, assuming discrete values between one and seven in increments of one), and x 3 ,x 4 ⁇ R n (notified and logical exceptions respectively, assuming discrete values between user defined [min, max] interval to shape the traffic profile in a desired manner).
- the network is trained using generalized delta rules.
- the additional adaptive feedforward weights enhance the capacity of the network to perform dynamic mapping.
- Several measures are taken to improve the speed of convergence and to avoid the problem of getting stuck in a local minimum on the error surface.
- an adaptive learning rate is also employed. Essentially, this provides a trade-off between a large learning rate (which results in rapid learning at the beginning followed by subsequent oscillatory behavior) and a small learning rate (which results in stable behavior at the cost of longer training time) in a continuous fashion.

- a node provides data transfer between networks
- a node provides data transfer between a user, e.g., a host computer, and a network.
- the set of links E for the network 300 is:
- each node in a network will have one or more input links for receiving data, and one or more output links for transmitting data. Moreover, some of the links may be used for receiving or transmitting data, but not both receiving and transmitting at the same time. For example, for data transmitted from node V 1 , e 1 is an input link for node V 2 , and e 4 is an input link for node V 3 . For data transmitted from node V 2 , e 2 and e 3 are output links, and for V 3 , e 2 and e 5 are potential output links.
- input nodes and output nodes may be defined. For example, for data to be transmitted from node V 2 to V 4 , V 1 and V 3 are possible input nodes to V 2 . If V 1 is an input node to V 2 , V 3 and V 4 are possible output nodes from V 2 . If V 3 is an input node to V 2 , V 4 is the possible output node from V 2 .
- each link e 1 , . . . , e 6 in the network 300 is considered to be a “hop”.

- This construction generalizes easily to accommodate other choices of network parameters.
- a “cost” function ⁇ is defined to map a vector of network parameters to a value in R ⁇ . Any such measure must depend on the particulars of a connection request, because a route that fails to meet all the feasibility requirements is unacceptable.
- the feasibility requirements may include the QoS, cost, minimum bandwidth and so forth.
- ⁇ is defined in terms of a number of limits C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C 8 associated with a connection request.

- the code is written in MATLABTM.
- FIG. 4 ( a ) illustrates an error between actual and predicted traffic in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 4 ( b ) illustrates a histogram of a cost function ratio in accordance with the present invention.
- ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ (t) and ⁇ (t) are vectors with length twenty, so E(t) is taken as the sum of the differences between the actual traffic on a node i, ⁇ i (t), and the predicted traffic for the node, ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ i (t).
- E(t) may have units of bits/sec. or cells/sec., for example. Time, in seconds, is shown on the x-axis 420 . As demonstrated through the results, e.g., trace 430 , the ARBP network of the present invention was able to predict the traffic profile with a reasonably good accuracy.
- ⁇ opt represents the value of the cost function using all the constraints of the optimization
- ⁇ min represents the value of the cost function using only the last constraint for least path consideration.
- the y-axis 440 indicates the number of instances, or simulation trials, while the x-axis 450 indicates a cost function ratio.
- the multi-variable constrained optimization method outperformed the conventional least-path searching algorithm in the majority of the instances, e.g., where the cost function ratio is less than one.
- the present invention discloses an Autoregressive Backpropagation Network-based strategy for traffic prediction and route discovery in computer networks, such as ATM networks.
- This approach was motivated by difficulties in finding an optimal routing solution to ensure minimum cost of routing with maximum bandwidth usage, while maintaining the QoS parameters within a specific range.
- the responses of the trained network and the route discovery engine have demonstrated conformity to the expected performance level.
- the prediction mechanism and the optimization strategy developed in this context is fairly generic, and can be extended to other types of networks supporting multimedia traffic with a wide range of QoS specifications.
- the invention allows the development of multimedia applications in broadband networks that are delay sensitive and have strict requirements for QoS. From a network operator perspective, the invention maximizes revenue generation by ensuring minimum cost of routing with maximum bandwidth usage, and by maintaining the QoS parameters within the user-specified threshold values.
- the invention is suitable for use in communicating data to one or more decoders in a subscriber network.
- the traffic prediction of the invention using an ARBP network can be applied to different technical fields, including Predictive Capacity Management to enable an access network to periodically negotiate the amount of bandwidth it will require over a particular route some time in advance, and network planning and upgrading.
