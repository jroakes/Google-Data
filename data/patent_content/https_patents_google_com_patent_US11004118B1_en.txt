An advertisement or an “ad” refers to any form of communication in which one or more products, services, ideas, messages, people, organizations or other items are identified and promoted (or otherwise communicated). Ads are not limited to commercial promotions or other communications. An ad may be a public service announcement or any other type of notice, such as a public notice published in printed or electronic press or a broadcast. An ad may be referred to as sponsored content.
Ads may be communicated via various mediums and in various forms. In some examples, ads may be communicated through an interactive medium, such as the Internet, and may include graphical ads (e.g., banner ads), textual ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, or any form of electronically delivered advertisement. Ads may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. Ads could also be communicated through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, radio channels, television channels, print media, and other media.
The term “ad” can refer to both a single “creative” and an “ad group.” A creative refers to any entity that represents one ad impression. An ad impression refers to any form of presentation of an ad such that it is viewable/receivable by a user. In some examples, an ad impression may occur when an ad is displayed on a display device of a user access device. An ad group refers, for example, to an entity that represents a group of creatives that share a common characteristic, such as having the same ad selection and recommendation criteria. Ad groups can be used to create an ad campaign.
The advertisers 102 may provide (or be otherwise associated with) products and/or services related to ads. The advertisers 102 may include or be associated with, for example, retailers, wholesalers, warehouses, manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, educational establishments, financial establishments, technology providers, energy providers, utility providers, or any other product or service providers or distributors.
The advertisers 102 may directly or indirectly generate, maintain, and/or track ads, which may be related to products or services offered by or otherwise associated with the advertisers. The advertisers 102 may include or maintain one or more data processing systems 112, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to the network 110. The advertisers 102 may include or maintain one or more processes that run on one or more data processing systems.
The publishers 104 may include any entities that generate, maintain, provide, present and/or otherwise process content in the environment 100. “Publishers,” in particular, include authors of content, wherein authors may be individual persons, or, in the case of works made for hire, the proprietor(s) who hired the individual(s) responsible for creating the online content. The term “content” refers to various types of web-based, software application-based and/or otherwise presented information, including articles, discussion threads, reports, analyses, financial statements, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds (e.g., RSS feeds), television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, printed publications, or any other form of information that may be presented to a user using a computing device such as one of user access devices 108.
In some implementations, the publishers 104 may include content providers with an Internet presence, such as online publication and news providers (e.g., online newspapers, online magazines, television websites, etc.), online service providers (e.g., financial service providers, health service providers, etc.), and the like. The publishers 104 can include software application providers, television broadcasters, radio broadcasters, satellite broadcasters, and other content providers. One or more of the publishers 104 may represent a content network that is associated with the AMS 106.
The publishers 104 may receive requests from the user access devices 108 (or other elements in the environment 100) and provide or present content to the requesting devices. The publishers may provide or present content via various mediums and in various forms, including web based and non-web based mediums and forms. The publishers 104 may generate and/or maintain such content and/or retrieve the content from other network resources.
In addition to content, the publishers 104 may be configured to integrate or combine retrieved content with additional sets of content, for example ads, that are related or relevant to the retrieved content for display to users 150, 152, and 154. As discussed further below, these relevant ads may be provided from the AMS 106 and may be combined with content for display to users 150, 152, and 154. In some examples, the publishers 104 may retrieve content for display on a particular user access device 108 and then forward the content to the user access device 108 along with code that causes one or more ads from the AMS 106 to be displayed to the user 150, 152, or 154. In other examples, the publishers 104 may retrieve content, retrieve one or more relevant ads (e.g., from the AMS 106 or the advertisers 102), and then integrate the ads and the article to form a content page for display to the user 150, 152, or 154.
As noted above, one or more of the publishers 104 may represent a content network. In such an implementation, the advertisers 102 may be able to present ads to users through this content network.
The publishers 104 may include or maintain one or more data processing systems 114, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to the network 110. They may include or maintain one or more processes that run on data processing systems. In some examples, the publishers 104 may include one or more content repositories 124 for storing content and other information.
The AMS 106 manages ads and provides various services to the advertisers 102, the publishers 104, and the user access devices 108. The AMS 106 may store ads in an ad repository 126 and facilitate the distribution or selective provision and recommendation of ads through the environment 100 to the user access devices 108. In some configurations, the AMS 106 may include or access functionality associated with the AdWords™, AdSense™, and/or AdMob™ systems provided by Google Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.).
The AMS 106 may include one or more data processing systems 116, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to the network 110. It can also include one or more processes, such as server processes. In some examples, the AMS 106 may include an ad serving system 120 and one or more backend processing systems 118. The ad serving system 120 may include one or more data processing systems 116 and may perform functionality associated with delivering ads to publishers or user access devices 108. The backend processing systems 118 may include one or more data processing systems 116 and may perform functionality associated with identifying relevant ads to deliver, processing various rules, performing filtering processes, generating reports, maintaining accounts and usage information, and other backend system processing. The AMS 106 can use the backend processing systems 118 and the ad serving system 120 to selectively recommend and provide relevant ads from the advertisers 102 through the publishers 104 to the user access devices 108.
The AMS 106 may include or access one or more crawling, indexing and searching modules (not shown). These modules may browse accessible resources (e.g., the World Wide Web, publisher content, data feeds, etc.) to identify, index and store information. The modules may browse information and create copies of the browsed information for subsequent processing. The modules may also check links, validate code, harvest information, and/or perform other maintenance or other tasks.
Searching modules may search information from various resources, such as the World Wide Web, publisher content, intranets, newsgroups, databases, and/or directories. The search modules may employ one or more known search or other processes to search data. In some implementations, the search modules may index crawled content and/or content received from data feeds to build one or more search indices. The search indices may be used to facilitate rapid retrieval of information relevant to a search query.
The AMS 106 may include one or more interface or frontend modules for providing the various features to advertisers, publishers, and user access devices. For example, the AMS 106 may provide one or more publisher front-end interfaces (PFEs) for allowing publishers to interact with the AMS 106. The AMS 106 may also provide one or more advertiser front-end interfaces (AFEs) for allowing advertisers to interact with the AMS 106. In some examples, the front-end interfaces may be configured as web applications that provide users with network access to features available in the AMS 106.
The AMS 106 provides various advertising management features to the advertisers 102. In some examples, the AMS 106 may include features for advertisers similar to those in the AdWords™ system provided by Google Inc. The AMS 106 advertising features may allow users to set up user accounts, set account preferences, create ads, select keywords for ads, create campaigns or initiatives for multiple products or businesses, view reports associated with accounts, analyze costs and return on investment, selectively identify customers in different regions, selectively recommend and provide ads to particular publishers, analyze financial information, analyze ad performance, estimate ad traffic, access keyword tools, add graphics and animations to ads, etc.
The AMS 106 may allow the advertisers 102 to create ads and input keywords for which those ads will appear. In some examples, the AMS 106 may provide ads to user access devices or publishers when keywords associated with those ads are included in a user request or requested content. The AMS 106 may also allow the advertisers 102 to set bids for ads. A bid may represent the maximum amount an advertiser is willing to pay for each ad impression, user click-through of an ad or other interaction with an ad. A click-through can include any action a user takes to select an ad. The advertisers 102 may also choose a currency and monthly budget.
The AMS 106 may also allow the advertisers 102 to view information about ad impressions, which may be maintained by the AMS 106. The AMS 106 may be configured to determine and maintain the number of ad impressions relative to a particular website or keyword. The AMS 106 may also determine and maintain the number of click-throughs for an ad as well as the ratio of click-throughs to impressions.
The AMS 106 may also allow the advertisers 102 to select and/or create conversion types for ads. A “conversion” may occur when a user consummates a transaction related to a given ad. A conversion could be defined to occur when a user clicks on an ad, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. In another example, a conversion could be defined as the display of an ad to a user and a corresponding purchase on the advertiser's web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days). The AMS 106 may store conversion data and other information in a conversion data repository 136.
The AMS 106 may allow the advertisers 102 to input description information associated with ads. This information could be used to assist the publishers 104 in determining ads to publish. The advertisers 102 may additionally input a cost/value associated with selected conversion types, such as a five dollar credit to the publishers 104 for each product or service purchased.
The AMS 106 may provide various features to the publishers 104. In some examples, the AMS 106 may include features for publishers similar to those in the AdSense™ system provided by Google Inc. The AMS 106 may deliver ads (associated with the advertisers 102) to the user access devices 108 when users access content from the publishers 104. The AMS 106 can be configured to deliver ads that are relevant to publisher sites, site content, and publisher audiences.
In some examples, the AMS 106 may crawl content provided by the publishers 104 and deliver ads that are relevant to publisher sites, site content and publisher audiences based on the crawled content. The AMS 106 may also selectively recommend and/or provide ads based on user information and behavior, such as particular search queries performed on a search engine website, or a designation of an ad for subsequent review, as described herein, etc. The AMS 106 may store user-related information in a general database 146. In some examples, the AMS 106 can add search services (e.g., a Google™ search box) to a publisher site and deliver ads configured to provide appropriate and relevant content relative to search results generated by requests from visitors of the publisher site. A combination of these and other approaches can be used to deliver relevant ads.
The AMS 106 may allow the publishers 104 to search and select specific products and services as well as associated ads to be displayed with content provided by the publishers 104. For example, the publishers 104 may search through ads in the ad repository 126 and select certain ads for display with their content.
The AMS 106 may be configured to selectively recommend and provide ads created by the advertisers 102 to the user access devices 108 directly or through the publishers 104. The AMS 106 may selectively recommend and provide ads to a particular publisher 104 (as described in further detail herein) or a requesting user access device 108 when a user requests search results or loads content from the publisher 104.
In some implementations, the AMS 106 may manage and process financial transactions among and between elements in the environment 100. For example, the AMS 106 may credit accounts associated with the publishers 104 and debit accounts of the advertisers 102. These and other transactions may be based on conversion data, impressions information and/or click-through rates received and maintained by the AMS 106.
“Computing devices”, for example user access devices 108, may include any devices capable of receiving information from the network 110. The user access devices 108 could include general computing components and/or embedded systems optimized with specific components for performing specific tasks.

The network 110 may include one or more telecommunications networks, such as computer networks, telephone or other communications networks, the Internet, etc. The network 110 may include a shared, public, or private data network encompassing a wide area (e.g., WAN) or local area (e.g., LAN). In some implementations, the network 110 may facilitate data exchange by way of packet switching using the Internet Protocol (IP). The network 110 may facilitate wired and/or wireless connectivity and communication.
For purposes of explanation only, certain aspects of this disclosure are described with reference to the discrete elements illustrated in FIG. 1 . The number, identity and arrangement of elements in the environment 100 are not limited to what is shown. For example, the environment 100 can include any number of geographically-dispersed advertisers 102, publishers 104 and/or user access devices 108, which may be discrete, integrated modules or distributed systems. Similarly, the environment 100 is not limited to a single AMS 106 and may include any number of integrated or distributed AMS systems or elements.
Furthermore, additional and/or different elements not shown may be contained in or coupled to the elements shown in FIG. 1 , and/or certain illustrated elements may be absent. In some examples, the functions provided by the illustrated elements could be performed by less than the illustrated number of components or even by a single element. The illustrated elements could be implemented as individual processes running on separate machines or a single process running on a single machine.
As described herein, computing device 200 facilitates the presentation of content from one or more publishers, along with one or more sets of sponsored content, for example ads, to a user. Computing device 200 may perform these and other operations in response to processor 204 executing software instructions contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 206. A computer-readable medium may be defined as a physical or logical memory device and/or carrier wave. The software instructions may be read into memory 206 from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device 210, or from another device via communication interface 216. The software instructions contained in memory 206 may cause processor 204 to perform processes described herein. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the subject matter herein. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the subject matter disclosed herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
In some examples, ad 310 may also include additional ad creative content 350. Ad creative content 350 may be supplemental text to ad creative text 340, graphics associated with ad 310, animation associated with ad 310, or any other creative content that may be provided by advertiser 102 and served by AMS 106 to user access device 108. Advertiser 102 is capable of communicating with AMS 106 through data processing system 112 by use of network 110.
Ad merchant site 360 is an online merchant site associated with ad 310 and corresponding to the URL that user 152 may navigate to by clicking ad hyperlink 320. Ad merchant site 360 may present goods, services, information, or other resources that may be appealing to user 152. Ad merchant site 360 may include an online store or an online service where user 152 can purchase goods or services. Ad merchant site 360 also includes ad information 370. Ad information 370 represents any information that is available on ad merchant site 360. Ad information 370 may be, without limitation, text-based, graphical, video, interactive, or combinations thereof.
In operation, advertiser 102 transmits ad 310 to AMS 106 over network 110. Advertiser 102 transmits ad 310 using data processing system 112. AMS 106 receives ad 310 at data processing system 116 which stores ad 310 into main memory 206. In other examples, ad 310 may be stored in at least one of main memory 206, ROM 208, and storage device 210. Data processing system 116 runs identification processes stored on at least one of main memory 206, ROM 208, or storage device 210 on stored ad 310. Identification processes are executed on processor 204.
A first identification process uses at least one of regular expression patterns and natural language processing methods to identify an offer (also referred to herein as a candidate offer) included within ad 310. Regular expression patterns refer to methods of matching strings of text including characters or words from a sample set of text. A candidate offer refers to potential offers that may exist in ad 310, display information 315, or components thereof. In this example, regular expression patterns may be applied to ad 310 to identify ads 310 that may contain offers such as candidate offers. Accordingly, regular expression patterns may attempt to match on terms that refer to offers. For example, regular expression patterns may be applied to ads 310 to attempt to identify or match ads 310 that contain ad creative text 340 or ad creative content 350 with strings including “sale”, “discount”, or “limited.” Matching ads 310 will be identified as online candidate advertisements containing candidate offers. In this example, regular expression patterns are primarily applied to ad creative text 340 or ad creative content 350. In other examples, regular expression patterns may be applied to any part of display information 315.
Natural language processing describes methods and algorithms designed to allow computers to determine objective meaning from human created content. In this example, natural language processing may be applied to ad 310 to identify ads 310 that may contain offers. Natural language processing may use heuristic methods to allow data processing system 116 to learn from prior reviews and distinguish ads 310 that contain offers from ads that do not. Ads 310 that are detected as potentially containing offers using natural language processing methods will be identified as online candidate advertisements containing candidate offers.
A second identification process uses at least one of regular expression patterns and natural language processing methods to ignore a candidate offer included within ad 310. In other words, this second identification process uses regular expression patterns and natural language processing to filter out ads 310 that are identified as online candidate advertisements using the first identification process but should be screened out regardless. Ads 310 identified by this second identification process may be ignored because they are associated with poor quality offers or false positive offers. For example, regular expression patterns may be applied to ads 310 to attempt to identify or match ads 310 that contain creative text 340 or ad creative content 350 with strings indicating that a promotion ended before ad 310 is served. Matching ads 310 will be unlisted as online candidate advertisements containing candidate offers. In this example, regular expression patterns are primarily applied to ad creative text 340 or ad creative content 350. In other examples, regular expression patterns may be applied to any part of display information 315.
In other examples, validation process 355 involves an automated process where candidate ads 310 are received by data processing system 116 and processor 204 initiates an automated validation process stored on at least one of main memory 206, ROM 208, and storage device 210. The automated validation process involves data processing system 116 first requesting and receiving ad information 370 from ad merchant site 360 using ad hyperlink 320. The automated validation process then compares received ad information 370 to ad 310 and, more specifically, to ad creative text 340 and to ad creative content 350. The automated validation process may make comparisons using regular expression patterns, described above, or any other language or information analysis method suitable for comparing information presented on ad merchant site 360 to data contained in ad 310 and display information 315.
In some examples, ad 310 may include extended advertisement information. This information may include data of a kind that is not present in other ads 310 or ad displays 315. For example, some advertisers may include specific location or contact information with ads 310. Such extended advertisement information may be included as ad creative content 350 or in other forms. In such cases, if such ads 310 are determined to contain validated offers, display information 315 associated with ad 310 may be enhanced by making this extended advertisement information more notable when providing ad 310. Such enhancement may include, without limitation, improving the user-interface to display extended advertisement information prominently and placing the extended advertisement information prominently in display information 315.
Once enhancement process 380 has been performed, AMS 106 can present ad 310 to user access device 108 and user 152. Because of the use of the processes described, some ads 310 will be received with enhanced display information and some will not.
In operation, ad 310 is received by AMS 106 at data processing system 116. Data processing system 116 runs processes (described in FIG. 3 ) to identify ads 310 that may contain candidate offers using processor 204. Ads 310 that may contain candidate offers (i.e., online candidate advertisements) are submitted to validation process 355 (shown in FIG. 3 ). Ads 310 that are validated by validation process 355 enter enhancement process 380 where they receive enhanced ad display 410 including display information enhancement 420. Display information enhancement 420 may include, adding additional text to display information 315, adding additional graphics to display information 315, or adding additional user-interface features to display information 315. Display information enhancement 420 may also include highlighting extended advertisement information. AMS 106 then presents these ads with enhanced ad display 410 to user access device 108.
Online ads with enhanced display information 550 and online ads without enhanced display information 560 both contain an ad hyperlink 320, an ad website address 330, and ad creative text 340. However, only online ads with enhanced display information 550 contain display information enhancement 420.
In operation, software application 510 is used by user 152 (shown in FIG. 1 ) on user access device 108. User access device 108 transmits search query 530 over network 110 to a search engine (not shown) which identifies responsive content created by publishers 104 (shown in FIG. 1 ) and responsive ads 310 created by advertisers 102 and served on AMS 106. Responsive content and responsive ads are content and ads 310 that are determined by the search engine to be relevant to search query 530. Software application 510 receives, over network 110, a response from the search engine to present search results 520.
In this example, software application 510 is an internet browser. In other examples, software application 510 displays responsive content created by publishers 104 and ads created by advertisers 102 without using a search engine. In these other examples, software application 510 may display responsive content through the use of, without limitation, web-based email, social networks, online applications, or desktop applications with internet connectivity. In these other examples, search query 530 may not be used. Instead, responsive ads and responsive content may not be determined based upon search query 530, but instead on other information presently displayed on software application 510.
