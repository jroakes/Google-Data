- Example 500 depicts dynamic online content 420 displayed on mobile computing device display 320 of mobile computing device 310 .
- dynamic online content 420 includes online creative elements 430 , and user interaction element 450 .
- Activation overlay layer 510 is presented “on top” of dynamic online content.
- layer refers to a virtual concept in user interface (“UI”) design. UI design involving layers may display a first graphical or visual element on a display at a different apparent depth than at least a second graphical or visual element.
- UI user interface
- a layer appearing closer to a user i.e., an “upper” layer
- a layer appearing removed from a user i.e., a “lower” layer
- an upper layer may be transparent and therefore invisible to the user but still inhibit or alter interaction with lower layers.
- the presence of layers may be apparent to a viewer due to a transparency in an upper layer which allows a user to view the upper layer and at least portions of the lower layer.
- the presence of layers may be apparent to a viewer due to an upper layer incompletely covering a lower layer. In such cases, portions of the lower layer which are not covered may be visible to the user. It may be valuable to indicate to a user that layers are present to convey the fact that the user is viewing an activation overlay layer 510 .
- the presence of layers may only be apparent to a viewer at the conclusion of viewing an upper layer.
- the upper layer may be removed using an animation which indicates that it is being replaced by a lower layer. This animation may appear to indicate that an upper layer is fading out of the screen and exposing a lower layer conveying the concept that the lower layer was always present below the upper layer.
- Other animations or graphical methods may be used to convey the concept of layers.
- the upper layer, activation overlay layer 510 is at least partially transparent.
- a user such as user 154 (shown in FIG. 1 ) may notice the presence of content including dynamic online content 420 below activation overlay layer 510 .
- Activation overlay layer 510 additionally only occupies a horizontal band over dynamic online content 420 , further indicating the presence of dynamic online content 420 below activation overlay layer 510 .
- activation overlay layer 510 When activation overlay layer 510 is first delivered, it fades into the view after a predetermined duration after dynamic online content 420 is delivered. Fading in also may occur for a predetermined duration. In other words, dynamic online content 420 first appears and is “covered” by activation overlay layer 510 . Additionally, when overlay layer 510 is removed it fades out and completely reveals the lower layer, dynamic online content 420 . In other embodiments, other displays and animations may be used to indicate the presence of layers.
- Activation overlay layer 510 includes an activation feature 520 .
- Activation feature 520 is configured to receive haptic input including user 154 touching or gesturing activation feature 520 . Providing input such as haptic activation input 530 to activation feature 520 will cause activation overlay layer 510 and dynamic online content 420 to be displayed completely.
- activation feature 520 includes a graphical icon indicating the location to provide haptic activation input 530 . The graphical icon further shows user 154 that activation overlay layer 510 is enabled. Making user 154 aware that activation overlay layer 510 is enabled may be important to ensuring user 154 provides an appropriate haptic input.
- activation feature 520 may include textual elements, graphical elements, video elements, animation elements, or alternately activation feature 520 may not be visibly apparent.
- Activation overlay 510 is also configured to receive a haptic ignore input 540 . Receiving haptic ignore input 540 from user 154 will cause activation overlay layer 510 and dynamic online content 420 to be removed from display and a requested publication to be delivered.
- activation overlay layer 510 is delivered simultaneously with or shortly after dynamic online content 420 .
- Activation overlay 510 may appear with an animation such as a fade-in.
- Activation overlay layer 510 may prevent user 154 from interacting with dynamic online content 420 even though user 154 can see portions of dynamic online content due to the partial transparency of overlay layer 510 . Therefore, until user 154 enters haptic activation input 530 at activation feature 520 , user 154 will not be able to interact with dynamic online content 420 . This may be valuable to ensure that user 154 is only interacting with content such as dynamic content 420 intentionally. Alternately, if user 154 does not wish to interact with dynamic online content 420 , user 154 may enter haptic ignore input 540 and cause activation overlay layer 510 and dynamic online content 420 to be removed from display and a requested publication to be delivered.
- activation overlay layer 510 when activation overlay layer 510 is displayed, it is apparent that activation overlay layer 510 is present based upon graphical display because activation overlay layer 510 is partially transparent and incompletely covers dynamic online content 420 .
- activation overlay layer 510 may be made apparent by any method including, without limitation, graphical indications, sonic indications, and haptic indications.
- FIG. 5A is example mobile computing device 310 displaying dynamic online content 420 along with an alternative overlay layer, specifically a tap overlay layer 510 A, using computing device 200 (shown in FIG. 2 ) in advertising environment 100 (shown in FIG. 1 ).
- dynamic online content 420 includes online creative elements 430 , and user interaction element 450 .
- dynamic online content 420 is covered tap overlay layer 510 A forming an upper layer over dynamic online content 420 .
- tap overlay layer 510 A is entirely transparent and therefore not visible to a user such as user 154 (shown in FIG. 1 ). Instead, tap overlay layer 510 A is capable of distinguishing between haptic inputs to determine whether to allow user 154 to interact with dynamic online content 420 or to advance to a requested publication.
- Tap overlay layer 510 A is configured to receive haptic activation input 550 and haptic ignore input 560 . Like haptic ignore input 540 (shown in FIG. 5 ), providing haptic ignore input 560 will cause tap overlay layer 510 A and dynamic online content 420 to be removed and cause mobile computing device 310 to display a publication requested by user 154 . In the example embodiment, haptic ignore input 560 is triggered when user 154 provides haptic input including a swipe. In other embodiments, haptic ignore input 560 may be any haptic input or combination of haptic inputs which may be received by mobile computing device display 320 .
- Tap overlay layer 510 A also includes haptic activation input 550 .
- Haptic activation input 550 is configured to receive haptic input including user 154 taps. Like haptic activation input 530 (shown in FIG. 5 ), providing haptic activation input 550 will cause tap overlay layer 510 A to be removed and cause dynamic online content 420 to be displayed completely allowing user 154 to interact with dynamic online content. Additionally, providing haptic activation input 550 will cause tap overlay layer 510 A to “pass” haptic input to dynamic online content 420 .
- haptic activation input 550 includes haptic input which would otherwise cause interaction with dynamic online content 420 (e.g., touching the location of user interaction element 450 ), such haptic input will be received by dynamic online content 420 and cause an interaction.
- haptic activation input 550 includes user 154 providing haptic input including a haptic tap.
- haptic activation input 550 may be any haptic input or combination of haptic inputs which may be received by mobile computing device display 320 .
- tap overlay layer 510 A is unaccompanied by text or graphical indications. This may be of use if user 154 is familiar with a standard method of interacting with interface layer 510 A. In alternative embodiments, tap overlay layer 510 A may be accompanied by indications including text and graphics.

FIG. 4 is examplemobile computing device 310 displaying dynamic online content using computing device 200 (shown inFIG. 2 in) advertising environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ). In example 400,mobile computing device 310 displays dynamiconline content 420 inmobile application 330 on mobilecomputing device display 320. In the example embodiment, dynamiconline content 420 is an advertisement for an automobile. Further, in the example embodiment, dynamiconline content 420 is served tomobile computing device 310 after a user such as user 154 (shown inFIG. 1 ) requests an online publication usingmobile application 330. In the example embodiment, although dynamiconline content 420 is different fromonline publication content 350, both may be served usingmobile application 330. - In the example embodiment, dynamic
online content 420 is an interactive advertisement with graphic and animation features. In alternative embodiments, dynamiconline content 420 may be, without limitation, an online advertisement, text, animation, video, or any other content which may be served and displayed usingmobile application 330. - Dynamic
online content 420 includes onlinecreative elements 430. Onlinecreative elements 430 represents all creative elements included in dynamiconline content 420. Onlinecreative elements 430 may be graphical, animation, textual, sonic, haptic, or any other category of creative capable of being displayed onmobile application 330. Onlinecreative elements 430 may additionally be a combination of multiple types of elements. In the example embodiment, onlinecreative element 430 is a car which is animated and produces the sound of an engine. - Dynamic
online content 420 also includesuser interaction elements 450.User interaction elements 450 represent any elements of dynamiconline content 420 which may allowuser 154 to interact. In the example embodiment,user interaction element 450 is a steering wheel. Ifuser 154 provides haptic input (i.e., uses mobilecomputing device display 320 to touch and swipe)user interaction element 450, dynamiconline content 420 and, more specifically, onlinecreative elements 430 will respond. For example, ifuser 154 provides haptic input to turn the steering wheel inuser interaction element 450, the car representing onlinecreative elements 430 will turn in the same direction as the steering wheel. As used herein, “dismiss function,” refers to an approach used in displaying dynamiconline content 420 which allows input received byuser 154 to result in removal of dynamiconline content 420. In the example embodiment, dynamiconline content 420 may be configured to receive haptic input which will cause dynamiconline content 420 to be removed. In some embodiments, graphical or textual indicators may be displayed on dynamiconline content 420 to indicate that the dismiss function is available. - In operation, dynamic
online content 420 is served tomobile computing device 310 whenuser 154 navigates from web content such as online publication content 350 (shown inFIG. 3 ) to further web content.User 154 may navigate usingnavigation elements 360, entering a new online publication resource 340 (both shown inFIG. 3 ), entering a search, or clicking on a link withinonline publication content 350 or elsewhere. Dynamiconline content 420 is served by ad serving system 120 (shown inFIG. 1 ) using a process described in detail below. - In at least some examples, dynamic
online content 420 may be capable of recording user interactions withuser interaction elements 450. Such information may be of interest to the publisher or creator of dynamiconline content 420 as it may indicate the user response to particular dynamiconline content 420. Once dynamiconline content 420 is served tomobile computing device 310,user 154 may elect to view dynamiconline content 420, interact with dynamiconline content 420 usinguser interaction elements 450, or dismiss dynamiconline content 420 and navigate to a requested publication. -
FIG. 5 is examplemobile computing device 310 displaying dynamiconline content 420 along with an overlay layer, specifically anactivation overlay layer 510, using computing device 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ) in advertising environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ). Example 500 depicts dynamiconline content 420 displayed on mobilecomputing device display 320 ofmobile computing device 310. As inFIG. 4 , dynamiconline content 420 includes onlinecreative elements 430, anduser interaction element 450.Activation overlay layer 510 is presented “on top” of dynamic online content. As used herein, “layer” refers to a virtual concept in user interface (“UI”) design. UI design involving layers may display a first graphical or visual element on a display at a different apparent depth than at least a second graphical or visual element. As indicated in example 500, a layer appearing closer to a user (i.e., an “upper” layer) may be displayed “over” a layer appearing removed from a user (i.e., a “lower” layer) wherein the upper layer is entirely viewable by a user while a lower layer may be partially or completely obscured. In some examples, an upper layer may be transparent and therefore invisible to the user but still inhibit or alter interaction with lower layers. - In some cases, the presence of layers may be apparent to a viewer due to a transparency in an upper layer which allows a user to view the upper layer and at least portions of the lower layer. In other cases, the presence of layers may be apparent to a viewer due to an upper layer incompletely covering a lower layer. In such cases, portions of the lower layer which are not covered may be visible to the user. It may be valuable to indicate to a user that layers are present to convey the fact that the user is viewing an
activation overlay layer 510. - In other cases, the presence of layers may only be apparent to a viewer at the conclusion of viewing an upper layer. When the upper layer is removed by a user dismissal, timed removal, or other removal, the upper layer may be removed using an animation which indicates that it is being replaced by a lower layer. This animation may appear to indicate that an upper layer is fading out of the screen and exposing a lower layer conveying the concept that the lower layer was always present below the upper layer. Other animations or graphical methods may be used to convey the concept of layers.
- In the example embodiment, the upper layer,
activation overlay layer 510, is at least partially transparent. A user such as user 154 (shown inFIG. 1 ) may notice the presence of content including dynamiconline content 420 belowactivation overlay layer 510.Activation overlay layer 510 additionally only occupies a horizontal band over dynamiconline content 420, further indicating the presence of dynamiconline content 420 belowactivation overlay layer 510. - When
activation overlay layer 510 is first delivered, it fades into the view after a predetermined duration after dynamiconline content 420 is delivered. Fading in also may occur for a predetermined duration. In other words, dynamiconline content 420 first appears and is “covered” byactivation overlay layer 510. Additionally, whenoverlay layer 510 is removed it fades out and completely reveals the lower layer, dynamiconline content 420. In other embodiments, other displays and animations may be used to indicate the presence of layers. -
Activation overlay layer 510 includes anactivation feature 520.Activation feature 520 is configured to receive hapticinput including user 154 touching or gesturingactivation feature 520. Providing input such ashaptic activation input 530 toactivation feature 520 will causeactivation overlay layer 510 and dynamiconline content 420 to be displayed completely. In the example embodiment,activation feature 520 includes a graphical icon indicating the location to providehaptic activation input 530. The graphical icon further showsuser 154 thatactivation overlay layer 510 is enabled. Makinguser 154 aware thatactivation overlay layer 510 is enabled may be important to ensuringuser 154 provides an appropriate haptic input. In alternative embodiments,activation feature 520 may include textual elements, graphical elements, video elements, animation elements, or alternatelyactivation feature 520 may not be visibly apparent. -
Activation overlay 510 is also configured to receive a haptic ignoreinput 540. Receiving haptic ignoreinput 540 fromuser 154 will causeactivation overlay layer 510 and dynamiconline content 420 to be removed from display and a requested publication to be delivered. - In operation,
activation overlay layer 510 is delivered simultaneously with or shortly after dynamiconline content 420.Activation overlay 510 may appear with an animation such as a fade-in.Activation overlay layer 510 may preventuser 154 from interacting with dynamiconline content 420 even thoughuser 154 can see portions of dynamic online content due to the partial transparency ofoverlay layer 510. Therefore, untiluser 154 entershaptic activation input 530 atactivation feature 520,user 154 will not be able to interact with dynamiconline content 420. This may be valuable to ensure thatuser 154 is only interacting with content such asdynamic content 420 intentionally. Alternately, ifuser 154 does not wish to interact with dynamiconline content 420,user 154 may enter haptic ignoreinput 540 and causeactivation overlay layer 510 and dynamiconline content 420 to be removed from display and a requested publication to be delivered. - In the example embodiment, when
activation overlay layer 510 is displayed, it is apparent thatactivation overlay layer 510 is present based upon graphical display becauseactivation overlay layer 510 is partially transparent and incompletely covers dynamiconline content 420. In other embodiments,activation overlay layer 510 may be made apparent by any method including, without limitation, graphical indications, sonic indications, and haptic indications. -
FIG. 5A is examplemobile computing device 310 displaying dynamiconline content 420 along with an alternative overlay layer, specifically atap overlay layer 510A, using computing device 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ) in advertising environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ). As inFIG. 5 , dynamiconline content 420 includes onlinecreative elements 430, anduser interaction element 450. Additionally, as inFIG. 5 , dynamiconline content 420 is coveredtap overlay layer 510A forming an upper layer over dynamiconline content 420. However,tap overlay layer 510A is entirely transparent and therefore not visible to a user such as user 154 (shown inFIG. 1 ). Instead, tapoverlay layer 510A is capable of distinguishing between haptic inputs to determine whether to allowuser 154 to interact with dynamiconline content 420 or to advance to a requested publication. -
Tap overlay layer 510A is configured to receivehaptic activation input 550 and haptic ignoreinput 560. Like haptic ignore input 540 (shown inFIG. 5 ), providing haptic ignoreinput 560 will causetap overlay layer 510A and dynamiconline content 420 to be removed and causemobile computing device 310 to display a publication requested byuser 154. In the example embodiment, haptic ignoreinput 560 is triggered whenuser 154 provides haptic input including a swipe. In other embodiments, haptic ignoreinput 560 may be any haptic input or combination of haptic inputs which may be received by mobilecomputing device display 320. -
Tap overlay layer 510A also includeshaptic activation input 550.Haptic activation input 550 is configured to receive hapticinput including user 154 taps. Like haptic activation input 530 (shown inFIG. 5 ), providinghaptic activation input 550 will causetap overlay layer 510A to be removed and cause dynamiconline content 420 to be displayed completely allowinguser 154 to interact with dynamic online content. Additionally, providinghaptic activation input 550 will causetap overlay layer 510A to “pass” haptic input to dynamiconline content 420. Therefore, ifhaptic activation input 550 includes haptic input which would otherwise cause interaction with dynamic online content 420 (e.g., touching the location of user interaction element 450), such haptic input will be received by dynamiconline content 420 and cause an interaction. - In the example embodiment,
haptic activation input 550 includesuser 154 providing haptic input including a haptic tap. In other embodiments,haptic activation input 550 may be any haptic input or combination of haptic inputs which may be received by mobilecomputing device display 320. - In the example embodiment,
tap overlay layer 510A is unaccompanied by text or graphical indications. This may be of use ifuser 154 is familiar with a standard method of interacting withinterface layer 510A. In alternative embodiments,tap overlay layer 510A may be accompanied by indications including text and graphics. -
FIG. 6 is a lateral view of examplemobile computing device 310 displaying dynamiconline content 420 with an overlay layer, specificallyactivation overlay layer 510, using computing device 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ) in advertising environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ). As indicated inview 600,activation overlay layer 510 is displayed on firstvisual layer 610 which is displayed “above” secondvisual layer 620. Secondvisual layer 620 includes dynamiconline content 420, onlinecreative elements 430, anduser interaction element 450. Accordingly, all haptic input received from a user such as user 154 (shown inFIG. 1 ) viewing the content ofview 600 will be received by firstvisual layer 610 and therefore byactivation overlay layer 510. -
FIG. 6A is a lateral view of examplemobile computing device 310 displaying dynamiconline content 420 with an overlay layer, specifically tapoverlay layer 510A, using computing device 200 (shown inFIG. 2 ) in advertising environment 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ). As indicated inview 600A,tap overlay layer 510A is displayed on firstvisual layer 610A which is displayed “above” secondvisual layer 620A. Secondvisual layer 620A includes dynamiconline content 420, onlinecreative elements 430, anduser interaction element 450. Accordingly, all haptic input received from a user such as user 154 (shown inFIG. 1 ) viewing the content ofview 600A will be received by firstvisual layer 610A and therefore bytap overlay layer 510A. - Unlike
