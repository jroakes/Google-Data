Definitions
- This specification generally relates to providing customized autocomplete data.
- Entering user input using computing devices is a common activity, and text is a common form of user input. Entering text and other input to computing devices can be time consuming. In addition, erroneous keystrokes on a physical or virtual keyboard may need to be corrected, further complicating the entry of input.
- a computing device can present autocomplete suggestions that are customized for a user of the computing device.
- the computing device can use customized autocomplete data, stored in an autocomplete cache of the computing device, to generate the customized autocomplete suggestions.
- the data in the cache can be periodically refreshed with updates that are specific to a particular user or a group of users.
- Different autocomplete cache updates can be provided to computing devices associated with different users, resulting in the presentation of different autocomplete suggestions to the different users.
- the data in a customized autocomplete cache update can be generated using search queries submitted by other users.
- a customized update for a first user can be generated based on the usage of words and phrases in search queries submitted by other users that have attributes in common with the first user.
- users that have similar interests or other similarities are likely to enter similar words and phrases. Therefore, in many instances, a first user is likely to user words and phrases that similar users have already used.
- profile data for a particular first user can be compared with profile data for other users that submitted various search queries. Search queries submitted by users determined to be similar to the first user can be selected, and used to generate the data for an autocomplete cache update for the first user.
- One innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification is embodied in methods that include the actions of: obtaining first profile data for a first user that is associated with a computing device; obtaining second profile data for second users that submitted search queries, the second users being different from the first user; determining, based on the first profile data and the second profile data, similarity scores that are each indicative of a degree of similarity between the first user and at least one of the second users; selecting a proper subset of the search queries based on the similarity scores; generating an update for an autocomplete cache of the computing device associated with the first user using the selected subset of the search queries; and providing the update to the computing device associated with the first user.
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- a system of one or more computers can be so configured by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be so configured by virtue having instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- selecting the proper subset of the search queries based on the similarity scores includes selecting a particular search query based on one of the similarity scores that is indicative of a degree of similarity between the first user and one of the second users that submitted the particular search query. Selecting the proper subset of the search queries based on the similarity scores includes: determining whether each of the similarity scores exceeds a threshold similarity score and selecting the search queries for which it is determined that the similarity score that is indicative of a degree of similarity between the first user and the second user that submitted the search query exceeds the threshold similarity score.
- Selecting the proper subset of the search queries based on the similarity scores includes: selecting a proper subset of the second users, the subset of the second users comprising second users for which a corresponding similarity score exceeds a threshold similarity score, and selecting the search queries submitted by the second users in the proper subset of the second users as the subset of the search queries.
- Obtaining first profile data for the first user of a computing device includes obtaining information that indicates a first context of the computing device, obtaining second profile data for the second users includes obtaining information that indicates second contexts in which the respective search queries were submitted, and determining the similarity scores includes determining similarity scores that are each indicative of a degree of similarity between the first context and the respective second contexts.
- Obtaining the first profile data for the first user includes obtaining current profile data for the first user, and obtaining second profile data for the second users includes obtaining profile data corresponding to times when the search queries were submitted.
- Obtaining the first profile data for the first user includes obtaining information indicating a first geographical location
- obtaining the second profile data for the second users includes obtaining information that indicates second geographical locations from which the respective search queries were submitted, and determining the similarity scores includes determining the similarity scores based on distances between the first geographical location and the respective second geographical locations.
- Obtaining information indicating the first geographical location includes receiving information indicating a current location of the computing device.
- Obtaining the first profile data for the first user includes obtaining information that indicates a user type for the first user, and obtaining the second profile data for the second users includes obtaining information that indicates user types for the second users.
- Determining the similarity scores includes: determining whether the user type for first user matches the user types for the respective second users, and determining the similarity scores based on whether the user type for the first user matches the user type for the respective second users.
- Obtaining the first profile data for the first user includes obtaining first demographic information for first user, obtaining the second profile data for the second users includes obtaining second demographic information for the respective second users, and determining the similarity scores includes determining the similarity scores based on commonalities between the first demographic information and the second demographic information.
- Obtaining the first profile data for the first user includes obtaining a first search query history for the first user, obtaining the second profile data for the second users includes obtaining second search query histories for the second users, and determining the similarity scores includes determining the similarity scores based on commonalities between the first search query history and the respective second search query histories.
- Autocomplete suggestions can be improved. Autocomplete suggestions can be customized for the interests, attributes, and behavior of a particular user or a group of users. Using an autocomplete cache, personalized autocomplete suggestions can be generated when a network connection is unavailable. Using the autocomplete cache, personalized autocomplete suggestions can be presented in a manner that limits network latencies. The autocomplete cache can be updated to reflect current topics and trends in word usage, especially topics and trends among users with similarities to a particular user.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram that illustrates an example of an environment in which customized autocomplete data are provided.
- FIG. 2 illustrates examples of data that can be used to generate customized autocomplete data.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram that illustrates an example of an environment in which customized autocomplete data are provided.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram that illustrates an example of a process for providing customized autocomplete data.
- Customized autocomplete data can be provided as a customized update to an autocomplete cache of a computing device.
- Many computing devices use a cache or local memory to store data that is used to produce autocomplete suggestions. Updates to the autocomplete cache that are personalized for a particular user or a group of similar users can improve the likelihood that the computing device presents autocomplete suggestions that are useful (e.g., autocomplete suggestions that users select or accept).
- the sports fan can receive an autocomplete cache update based on search queries that other users that have been identified as sports fans (“other sports fans”) have submitted, and the shopper can receive an autocomplete cache update based on search queries submitted by other users that have been identified as shoppers (“other shoppers”).
- a computing device for the sports fan uses its updated cache to present words and phrases used by other sports fans as autocomplete suggestions.
- a computing device for the shopper uses its updated cache to present words and phrases used by other shoppers as autocomplete suggestions.
- a system can generate a customized autocomplete cache update for a particular user using search queries submitted by other users. From a collection of search queries submitted by different users, the system can select a subset of search queries based on similarities between the particular user and the users that submitted the search queries. For example, the subset of the search queries can include search queries submitted by users that have attributes in common with the particular user (e.g., users that have interests, demographic characteristics, or geographical locations that are the same as or are similar to those of the particular user). When at least a threshold level of similarity exists between a second user and the particular user, search queries submitted by the second user can be included in the subset. When the level of similarity between a second user and the particular user is less than the threshold level, search queries submitted by the second user can be excluded from the subset.
- the system can use the selected subset of search queries as a custom source of word usage data. For example, the system can generate a customized update based on word usage in the subset of search queries that have been submitted by users that have been determined to be similar to the particular user. Because the users that submitted the search queries in the subset have commonalities with the particular user, the autocomplete suggestions provided using the customized data can be more useful to the particular user than autocomplete suggestions generated using generic autocomplete data.
- the system can obtain first profile data for the first user.
- the system can obtain second profile data for second users that submitted search queries.
- the second users can be different from the first user.
- the system can determine based on the first profile data and the second profile data, similarity scores that are each indicative of a degree of similarity between the first user and at least one of the second users.
- the system can select a proper subset of the search queries based on the similarity scores, and generate an update for an autocomplete cache of a computing device associated with the first user using the selected subset of search queries.
- the system can then provide the update to the computing device associated with the first user.

- a word includes a single term.
- a phrase includes a set of one or more words, which may be arranged in a particular sequence.
- the computing device 104 uses data stored as a local autocomplete cache 105 to determine which autocomplete suggestions to present.
- the autocomplete cache 105 is stored on a data storage device of the computing device 104 , for example, a memory device housed within or physically connected to the computing device 104 .
- the autocomplete cache 105 can indicate words, phrases, and/or portions of words, as well as corresponding usage statistics.
- the data in the autocomplete cache 105 can identify (e.g., list or otherwise specify) words and phrases, and can provide measures that affect a likelihood that the words and phrases will be selected as autocomplete suggestions.
- the measures can include usage scores or rankings of the words and phrases relative to each other.
- the likelihood that the user 102 will enter a word or phrase can be estimated based on the relative frequencies with which the word or phrase is used in a source set of text.
- a word or phrase that is common in the source set can be more likely to be entered by the user 102 than, for example, a word or phrase that is less common in the source set.
- the usage statistics for the source set can be used to determine measures that affect the selection of autocomplete suggestions.
- the server system 106 For purposes of example, assume that in states (A) to (H) the server system 106 generates an autocomplete cache update 160 that is customized for the user 102 . As described below, the server system 106 obtains profile data for multiple users 190 , determines similarity scores 126 a - 126 d , and selects search queries 122 a - 122 d based on the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d . The server system 106 then uses the selected search queries to generate the autocomplete cache update 160 for the user 102 . The server system 106 provides the update 160 to the computing device 104 , which uses the updated autocomplete cache 105 to present autocomplete suggestions 170 a - 170 c to the user 102 .
- the server system 106 can generate and send autocomplete cache updates in response to or independent of interaction with the computing device 104 .
- updates are pushed to the computing device 104 , asynchronously to any communications or actions from the computing device 104 .
- Updates can be sent periodically, for example, weekly, daily, or multiple times a day.
- updates can be sent in response to a communication from the computing device 104 , whether the communication is a request for a cache update or an interaction for another purpose.
- the server system 104 can provide an autocomplete cache update to the computing device 104 in response to receiving a search query or other information from the computing device 104 .

- any personal, historical, behavioral, or other data may be stored on an opt-in basis.
- Stored data can be anonymized by various approaches. For example, user profile data, search history data, and location data can by anonymized for privacy protection, so that the data, if compromised, cannot be associated with a particular user or user identifier.
- Various anonymization processes such as hashing, encryption, and obfuscation techniques may be used to ensure that user privacy is protected.
- the user identifier 112 can uniquely identify the user 102 or the computing device 104 .
- the user identifier 112 can be, for example, an identifier for a user account of the user 102 , a value stored in a cookie on the computing device 104 , a device identifier for the computing device 104 , an IP address of the computing device 104 , or another identifier that corresponds to the user 102 .

- the geographical location 120 is a prior location of the user 102 , for example, a geographical location determined based on a prior interaction with the server system 106 or another server system.
- the computing device 104 or the server system 106 can determine the geographical location 120 based on, for example, an IP address for the computing device 104 , information about the location of a wireless access point or a cellular network cell site to which the computing device 104 is connected, or using other techniques.
- the geographical location 120 can be a default location or a previous location for the computing device 104 , for example, a home location, a work location, a last known location, or a frequent location of the computing device 104 .
- the server system 106 obtains search query data 116 .
- the search query data 116 includes information about a set of search queries 122 a - 122 d submitted by one or more of users 190 , for example, users different from the user 102 .
- the search query data 116 can include search query histories for each of the users 190 .
- Each search query 122 a - 122 d can include, for example, text that one or more of the users 190 submitted to an Internet search engine.
- the search query data 116 can indicate the content of the search queries 122 a - 122 d (e.g., the text of each search query 122 a - 122 d ) and a user identifier 124 a - 124 d for the user 190 that submitted the search query 122 a - 122 d .
- the search query data 116 can also indicate one or more of, for example, a date or time a search query was submitted, a geographical location where the search query was submitted, and other context information related to the search query.
- Information about the search queries 122 a - 122 d can be stored in an index, table, database, or any other appropriate data structure or format.
- the server system 106 accesses search queries 122 a - 122 d that include “stadium directions,” “pre-order,” “ticket price,” and “show times.”
- the search queries 122 a - 122 d were submitted by different users 190 , as indicated by the different user identifiers 124 a - 124 d.
- the server system 106 obtains profile data for the users 190 that submitted the search queries 122 a - 122 d .
- the server system 106 can access information about the particular user 190 associated with each user identifier 124 a - 124 d .
- the profile data for the users 190 can be of the same type or of a similar type to the profile data obtained for the user 102 (e.g., information about user interests and a geographical location).
- the profile data can include attributes of or historical or behavioral information about the users 190 that submitted the search queries 122 a . Examples of profile data include geographical locations, demographic information, search query histories, web browsing histories, and user interests.
- the server system 106 determines user interests for each of the users 190 using stored user profile data 114 .
- the server system 106 also determines geographical locations associated with the users 190 .
- the geographical locations can be geographical locations from which the respective search queries 122 a - 122 d were submitted, as indicated by the search query data 116 .
- the server system 106 obtains current profile information for the users 190 .
- the profile data can be information about the current user interests of the users 190 .
- the server system obtains historical profile data corresponding to times when the search queries 122 a - 122 d were submitted. Because the user interests, geographical locations, and other profile data can change over time, the profile data obtained can indicate the information or context when a particular query was submitted. As a result, the profile data obtained can indicate the user interests of a user 190 when the query was submitted, the geographical location from which the query was submitted, and so on.
- the server system 106 assigns similarity scores 126 a - 126 d based on the profile data for the user 102 and the profile data for the users 190 .
- the server system 106 can include a scoring module 130 that assigns the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d .
- the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d can indicate degrees of similarity between the user 102 and the respective users 190 that submitted the search queries 122 a - 122 d .
- the similarity score 126 a for the search query 122 a is indicative of similarity between profile data for the user 102 and profile data for the user 190 that submitted the search query 122 a (who is associated the user identifier 124 a ).
- the similarity score 126 b for the search query 122 b is indicative of similarity between profile data associated with the user identifier 112 and profile data for the user 190 that submitted the search query 122 b (who is associated with the user identifier 124 b ), and so on.
- FIG. 2 illustrates examples of data that can be used to generate customized autocomplete data.
- a table 200 illustrates data that can be used by the scoring module 130 to generate the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d .
- the scoring module 130 assesses similarities between the user 102 and each of the users 190 for one or more criteria.
- the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d can thus be based on similarities between a single attribute of the users 102 , 190 or multiple attributes.
- the scoring module 130 can assign sub-scores for the different criteria and then combine the sub-scores to generate the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d , which can indicate the overall levels of similarity between the user 102 and the users 190 across multiple criteria.
- a single similarity score indicates similarity between the user 102 and a particular user 190 .
- the server system 106 can determine whether to select multiple search queries that were submitted by the particular user 190 based on the single similarity score for the particular user 190 .
- Current profile data for the users 190 and current profile data for the user 102 can be used to determine the similarity scores.
- multiple similarity scores are determined for each user 190 .
- Different similarity scores can be determined for different search queries.
- a query-specific similarity score can be determined that takes into account the environment, circumstances, or context particular to the submission of that search query.
- the query-specific similarity scores can indicate different degrees of similarity between the user 190 and the user 102 .
- a query-specific similarity score can be determined using profile data corresponding to the time the search query was submitted, for example, the geographical location of the user 190 when the search query was submitted, or the interests of the user 190 at the time the query was submitted.
- the scoring module 130 determines the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d based on geographical locations and user interests.
- the scores are illustrated as numerical values, and higher values indicate greater degrees of similarity.
- Similarity scores can be expressed using other measures in addition to or as an alternative to numerical values, for example, as binary values, strings, associations in an index or database, and other forms of data.
- a similarity score can be a binary value representing a determination whether a user that submitted one or more search queries has at least a minimum level of similarity with the user 102 .
- the profile data obtained in state (C) includes a geographical location 210 a - 210 d and user interests 220 a - 220 c corresponding to each user 190 , as indicated by the different user identifiers 124 a - 124 d .
- the information can be linked to the particular context in which the search query 122 a - 122 d was entered, or can be general information about the user 190 that submitted the search query 122 a - 122 d .
- the geographical locations 210 a - 210 d can be geographical locations from which the corresponding the search query 122 a - 122 d was submitted.
- the geographical locations 210 a - 210 d can be home locations, work locations, or other locations that are associated with the corresponding users 190 but do not necessarily describe the specific context in which the search query 122 a - 122 d was submitted.
- the scoring module 130 determines location scores 215 a - 215 d that indicate degrees of similarity between the geographical locations 210 a - 210 d and the geographical location 120 . To assign the location scores 215 a - 215 d , the scoring module 130 compares the geographical locations 210 a - 210 d with the geographical location 120 d . As an example, the current geographical location 120 of the user 102 can be compared with locations where the search queries 122 a - 122 d were submitted. As another example, a home location of the user 102 can be compared with home locations of the users 190 .
- the scoring module 130 can determine distances between the geographical locations 210 a - 210 d and the geographical location 120 . In some implementations, the smaller the distance between locations, the more similar the locations are considered to be. For example, the geographical locations 210 a , 210 d are the same as the geographical location 120 , and thus are assigned location scores 215 a , 215 d that indicate a higher degree of similarity than the location scores 215 b , 215 c , which correspond to geographical locations 210 b , 210 c that are farther from the geographical location 120 .
- the scoring module 130 also determines interest scores 225 a - 225 d that indicate degrees of similarity between the interests 220 a - 220 d and the interests 117 of the user 102 .
- the scoring module 130 compares the interests 220 a - 220 d with the interests 117 of the user 102 .
- the interest scores 225 a - 225 d are assigned such that matching interests result in interest scores 225 a - 225 d that indicate higher similarity than interests that do not match.
- Two of the interests 220 a (“sports”), 220 c (“movies”) are listed as interests 117 of the user 102 , and so corresponding search queries 122 a , 122 c are assigned interest scores 225 a , 225 c that indicate higher similarity than interests that do not match the interests 117 .
- Multiple shared interests can result in a score that indicates a higher degree of similarity than for a single shared interest.
- the scoring module 130 assigns the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d by adding the location score 215 a - 215 d and the interest score 225 a - 225 d corresponding to each search query 122 a - 122 d .
- Other methods of combining scores can be used, including, for example, weighting the influence of the scores for different criteria with different weighting values.
- users can be classified into a plurality of predetermined types, and the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d can indicate whether the users 190 are of the same user type as the user 102 .
- the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d can reflect similarities in demographic information (e.g., age, sex, language(s) used, profession, etc.) between the users 190 and the user 102 .
- the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d can indicate commonalities among the search query history of the user 102 and the search query histories of the users 190 .
- the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d can be based on an extent to which the respective users 190 have previously used the same words or phrases, or similar words or phrases, as the user 102 in search queries.
- the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d can be based on commonalities in browsing histories, for example, a degree to which the users 190 have navigated the same web pages or domains, or to web pages or domains associated with similar content or topics, as those navigated to by the user 102 .
- scores are assigned to sets of search queries rather than individual search queries.
- the server system 106 can assign a similarity score to a particular second user 190 that indicates a degree of similarity between the particular second user 190 and the user 102 .
- the server system 106 can use the similarity score for the user 190 as the similarity score for several of or all of the queries submitted by the particular second user 190 .
- the server system 106 selects a subset 142 of the search queries 122 a - 122 d based on the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d .
- the server system 106 can select a proper subset of the search queries 122 a - 122 d (e.g., such that fewer than all of the search queries 122 a - 122 d are selected).
- the subset 142 can be selected to include the search queries 122 a - 122 d associated with similarity scores that indicate the highest degrees of similarity.
- the subset 142 can include the search queries 122 a - 122 d that were submitted by users 190 determined to be most similar to the user 102 .
- the subset 142 is selected to include search queries 122 a - 122 d for which the associated similarity score 126 a - 126 d satisfies a threshold.
- the query selector 140 uses a threshold value of 0.5. Search queries assigned a similarity score with a value of 0.5 or higher are selected, and search queries with similarity scores below 0.5 are not selected. As a result, each of the search queries in the subset 142 was submitted by a user 190 that has at least a minimum level of similarity with the user 102 .
- the subset 142 is selected to include the N search queries 122 a - 122 d , where N is an integer, and thus a particular number of search queries 122 a - 122 d is selected.
- the search queries 122 a - 122 d can be ranked according to the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d , and a highest-ranking set of the search queries 122 a - 122 d can be selected.
- processing can also be performed to select the subset 142 .
- the set of search queries 122 a - 122 d or the subset 142 can be filtered to include only queries in languages used by the user 102 .
- the server system 106 In state (F), the server system 106 generates the autocomplete cache update 160 using the search queries 122 a , 122 c , 122 d in the subset 142 .
- the server system 106 can include an update generator 150 that generates autocomplete data for the update 160 .
- the update generator 150 assesses the usage of words and phrases in the subset 142 and generates the update 160 based on that usage.
- usage data can also include information about non-usage of a word or phrase.
- the search queries in the subset 142 include words and phrases that the user 102 may be likely to use. For example, users in nearby geographical locations may be likely to use the same words and phrases. When the user 102 is in New York, the user 102 may be likely to use words and phrases that other users 190 used while in New York. Users that have common interests may also use the same words and phrases.
- the update generator 150 can use the subset 142 as a data set that models expected usage by the user 102 .
- the update 160 is generated so that, when the autocomplete cache 105 is updated with the update 160 , the computing device 104 is more likely to present words and phrases in the subset 142 as autocomplete suggestions than with the prior content of the autocomplete cache 105 .
- the update generator 150 can identify each word and phrase that occurs in the subset 142 .
- the update generator 150 can also assign a usage score to the identified words and phrases based on a number of occurrences in the subset 142 .
- the usage scores can indicate, for example, the relative frequencies that each of the identified words and phrases occur in the subset.
- the usage score can be a normalized value, for example, a number of occurrences divided by the number of search queries in the subset 142 .
- Other statistics can also be used to determine the usage scores.
- the usage scores can indicate a relative ranking of words and phrases based on usage statistics.
- the update 160 can identify some or all of the identified words and phrases and can indicate corresponding usage scores. For example, the update 160 can identify new words and phrases that were not previously identified by the autocomplete cache 105 . The update 160 can additionally or alternatively identify new usage scores for words and phrases already identified by the autocomplete cache 105 .
- the search queries 122 a , 122 c , 122 d in the subset 142 have a greater weight or influence in generating the update 160 than, for example, search queries that are not included in the subset 142 .
- the occurrence of a word or phrase in the subset 142 can have a greater effect, or a different effect, on the data in the update 160 than the occurrence of the same word or phrase in a search query that is not included in the subset 142 .
- usage scores or other measures that affect the likelihood that a word or phrase is presented as an autocomplete suggestion can be increased more when a word or phrase occurs in the subset 142 than when the word or phrase that occurs only in a search query that is not included in the subset 142 .
- the server system 106 uses only search queries in the subset 142 to generate the update 160 , and ignores search queries that are not included in the subset 142 .
- the update 160 is an incremental update to the autocomplete cache 105 , avoiding repetition of data already present in the autocomplete cache 105 .
- the update generator 150 can store data about what is known to be or is expected to be in the autocomplete cache 105 .
- the update generator 150 can generate the update 160 such that it specifies changes from the current state of the autocomplete cache 105 .
- the update 160 can replace the entire autocomplete cache 105 .
- the update generator 150 can combine customized autocomplete data determined using the subset 142 with other autocomplete data, which may not be customized for the user 102 .
- words and phrases that are popular or are commonly used in the set of search queries 122 a - 122 d as a whole can also be indicated in the update 160 , in addition to customized entries based on the subset 142 .
- the update 160 can provide customized autocomplete data that supplements a standard set of non-customized autocomplete data that is maintained in the autocomplete cache 105 .
- the autocomplete cache update 160 is unique to a single user 102 .
- multiple users having similar attributes can receive the same update. For example, users that are located in a particular geographical area and have the same interests can receive the same autocomplete cache update.
- the update 160 can also be generated based on text entered by the user 102 , for example, search queries or other text submitted by the user 102 using different computing devices.
- the update generator 150 can obtain information about text entered on one or more computing devices that are associated with the user identifier 112 , including the computing device 104 and computing devices different from the computing device 104 .
- the update 160 can increase a likelihood that words and phrases that the user 102 has previously entered using any of multiple devices will subsequently be presented as autocomplete suggestions.
- the update 160 can also be provided to multiple computing devices associated with the user identifier 112 .
- the server system 106 sends the update 160 to the computing device 104 .
- the update 160 is sent to a computing device that is associated with the user 102 .
- a computing device can be associated with a user when, for example, a user account for the user is active on the computing device, or the computing device stores or provides the user identifier.
- a cookie stored on a computing device or an IP address of a computing device can be an identifier for the user 102 .
- the computing device 104 applies the update 160 , which alters the content of the autocomplete cache 105 .
- the update 160 can alter the set of words or phrases that the autocomplete cache 105 identifies as potential autocomplete suggestions or portions thereof. For example, words or phrases that occur in the subset 142 can be added or can replace other words and phrases. As another example, words or phrases that do not occur in the subset 142 , or occur infrequently in the subset 142 , can be removed.
- the update 160 can alter measures that affect the likelihood that different words and phrases are presented as autocomplete suggestions. As an example, the usage scores can be increased or decreased based on the usage in the subset 142 .
- the computing device 104 uses the updated autocomplete cache 105 to present autocomplete suggestions 170 a - 170 c .
- the autocomplete suggestions 170 a - 170 c can be presented on a user interface 162 of the computing device 104 in response to a user input or action.
- the user 102 enters an input 163 , “s,” into a text field 164 .
- the computing device 104 uses information in the updated autocomplete cache 105 to select the autocomplete suggestions 170 a - 170 c for presentation. For example, from words and phrases and corresponding usage data identified by the autocomplete cache 105 , the computing device 104 determines that “stadium,” “stadium directions,” and “show times” are likely completions for the user input 163 . The computing device 104 selects these as autocomplete suggestions 170 a - 170 c and displays them on the user interface 162 .
- the displayed autocomplete suggestions 170 a - 170 c include words and phrases used by users 190 that were determined to be similar to the user 102 .
- the autocomplete update 160 is an update for a general-purpose autocomplete cache of the computing device 104 .
- the updated autocomplete cache can be used to provide autocomplete suggestions for search queries or text other than search queries.
- the autocomplete cache 105 can be used to provide autocomplete suggestions for, for example, non-query fields of applications and web pages, text documents, and other non-query text, in addition to or instead of being used to produce autocomplete suggestions for search queries.
- the autocomplete cache 105 is a special-purpose autocomplete cache that is used to generate autocomplete suggestions for a particular context or use.
- the autocomplete cache 105 can be used primarily for, or only for, generating autocomplete suggestions for search queries.
- the computing device 104 can use the autocomplete cache 105 , which is updated based on search queries of other users 190 , to present autocomplete suggestions in response to determining that an input field is designated for receiving a search query.
- the computing device 104 can determine that an input field is designated for receiving a search query based on, for example, metadata or other content of a web page. For example, the computing device 104 may determine that a selected input field is an HTML5 search box and therefore is designated for receiving a query.
- the computing device 104 can include autocomplete cache data for each of multiple different input contexts, and the server system 106 can provide different autocomplete cache updates for the different input contexts.
- the autocomplete cache 105 may include different sets of usage scores corresponding to the different input contexts.
- each update is based on search queries submitted over a particular period of time, for example, during the previous month, week, or day, or hour. Updates can be based on search queries that were recently submitted by other users 190 , permitting the update to reflect developing usage trends. Multiple intraday updates can be provided, permitting the autocomplete cache 105 to be dynamically updated according to the most recent search queries submitted. Also, as the location, context, and profile data for the user 102 change, new updates can be provided to allow autocomplete suggestions that are more relevant to the new circumstances of the user 102 .
- FIG. 3 is a diagram that illustrates an example of an environment 300 in which customized autocomplete data are provided.
- the environment 300 includes a server system 310 that provides autocomplete cache updates 322 , 324 to two different computing devices 303 , 305 .
- Each computing device 303 , 305 is associated with a different user 302 , 304 and receives different autocomplete cache update 322 , 324 (e.g., an update with different autocomplete data).
- the server system 310 generates the updates 322 , 324 using information about the search query histories 306 , 307 of the users 302 , 304 .
- the server system 310 compares the search query histories 306 , 307 with search query histories of users that submitted various search queries 315 a - 315 d.
- the server system 310 assigns similarity scores 330 that indicate degrees of similarity between the search query history 306 and the search query histories of the respective users that submitted the queries 315 a - 315 d . For example, the server system 310 determines that search query history corresponding to the user identifier “ 241 ” and the search query 315 a includes the word “coaching,” which is included in the search query history 306 for the user 302 .
- the server system 310 assigns a similarity score 332 for the search query 315 a , indicating a relatively high degree of similarity between the user 302 and the user that submitted the search query 315 a (e.g., the user corresponding to the user identifier “ 241 ”).
- the server system 310 also assigns similarity scores 334 that indicate degrees of similarity between the search query history 307 and the search query histories of the respective users that submitted the queries 315 a - 315 d . Because the search query histories 306 , 307 of the users 302 , 304 have differing degrees of similarity with the search query histories of the users that submitted the search queries 315 a - 315 d , the similarity scores 332 , 334 are different for the different users 302 , 304 .
- the server system 310 selects subsets 342 , 344 of the search queries 315 a - 315 d with which to generate the autocomplete cache updates 322 , 324 . For example, search queries 315 a - 315 d associated with similarity scores that exceed a threshold similarity score of “0.5” are selected. Because the similarity scores 332 , 334 are different for the different users 302 , 304 , the subsets 342 , 344 contain different search queries. Accordingly, the updates 322 , 324 are generated to include different autocomplete data. For example, the updates 322 , 324 can identify different words or phrases. In addition, or as an alternative, the updates 322 , 324 can identify different usage scores, rankings, or other measures that affect whether particular words and phrases are displayed as autocomplete suggestions.
- the computing devices 303 , 305 After the computing devices 303 , 305 apply the corresponding updates 322 , 324 , the computing devices 303 , 305 have different data in their autocomplete caches. As a result, in at least some instances, the computing devices 303 , 305 can present different autocomplete suggestions to the users 302 , 304 in response to the same user inputs.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram that illustrates an example of a process 400 for providing customized autocomplete data.
- the process 400 may be performed, for example, by the server system 106 or the server system 310 .
- First profile data for a first user is obtained ( 402 ).
- profile data 115 is obtained for the user 102 .
- the profile data can describe attributes or behavior of the first user.
- the profile data can indicate a geographical location, demographic information, a search query history, a web browsing history, a user type, or other information related to the first user.
- Second profile data is obtained for second users that submitted search queries ( 404 ).
- the second users are different from the first user.
- Profile data can be obtained for each of the second users.
- profile data for the users 190 includes geographical locations 210 a - 210 d and user interests 220 a - 220 d .
- the profile data can describe attributes or behavior of the second users.
- the profile data can indicate a geographical location, demographic information, a search query history, a web browsing history, a user type, or other information related to the respective second users.
- Similarity scores are determined ( 406 ). Each similarity score is indicative of a degree of similarity between the first user and at least one of the second users. For example, with respect to FIG. 1 , similarity scores 126 a - 126 d are determined. Each similarity score can indicate a degree of similarity between the profile data for the first user and the profile data for one of the second users. In this manner, the similarity scores can be determined based on commonalities among attributes of the first user and attributes of the respective second users. In general, the more commonalities that are present between the first user and a particular second user, the higher the degree of similarity indicated by a similarity score corresponding to that particular second user.
- a proper subset of the search queries is selected based on the similarity scores ( 408 ).
- Search queries can be selected based on the similarity score for the second user that submitted the search query.
- the subset 142 is selected based on the similarity scores 126 a - 126 d .
- a particular search query can be selected based on one of the similarity scores that is indicative of a degree of similarity between the first user and one of the second users that submitted the particular search query.
- a search query submitted by a particular second user can be selected when the similarity score for that second user exceeds a threshold similarity score.
- the search queries can be ranked based on the similarity scores for the users that submitted the search queries, and a highest-ranking subset of the search queries can be selected.
- the subset is selected to include the search queries with similarity scores that indicate the highest degrees of similarity between the first user and another user.
- selecting a proper subset of the search queries includes selecting a proper subset of the second users for which the similarity score exceeds a threshold similarity score.
- the search queries submitted by the selected second users can be selected as the subset of the search queries.
- similarity scores are determined for each search query.
- multiple similarity scores can be determined for a particular second user.
- the respective similarity scores can be indicative of degrees of similarity between a first context of the computing device associated with the first user and second contexts in which the search queries were submitted by the second users.
- a similarity score for a search query can be indicative of similarity between a location of a computing device when the search query was submitted and the current location of the computing device associated with the first user.
- similarity scores can be determined using current profile data for the first user and historical profile data for second users corresponding to times when the search queries were submitted. For example, a similarity score determined for a search query can be indicative of similarity between current user interests of the first user and user interests for the second user that submitted the search query when that second user submitted the search query.
- An update is generated for an autocomplete cache of a computing device associated with the first user ( 410 ).
- the update is generated using the selected subset of search queries.
- the update 160 is generated.
- the autocomplete cache can be a local autocomplete cache, for example, data stored in a data storage device that is physically housed in the computing device.
- the autocomplete data in the update can be generated based on usage of words in the search queries in the subset, for example, a frequency of occurrence or a relative position of words or phrases in the search queries.
- the autocomplete data in the update can identify one or more character sequences that occur in search queries in the subset.
- the autocomplete data in the update can indicate a frequency with which one or more character sequences occur in the search queries in the subset.
- the search queries in the subset have a greater influence in generating the update than search queries that are not included in the subset. Usage statistics for words and phrases in the search queries in the subset can be weighted more heavily than search queries not included in the subset.
- the update can be generated such that, after the autocomplete cache of the computing device is updated with the update, at least some words and phrases that occur in the search queries in the subset are more likely to be presented by the computing device as autocomplete suggestions than words and phrases not occurring in the search queries in the subset.
- the update can increase a likelihood that at least some words and phrases that occur in the search queries in the subset are presented as autocomplete suggestions relative to, for example, a likelihood that those words and phrases would be presented using the autocomplete cache prior to the update.
- words or phrases that occur in the search queries of the subset more commonly than in the overall set of search queries can be more likely to be presented as autocomplete suggestions by the computing device associated with the first user than to be presented by computing devices that are associated with other users and receive different updates.
- the update can be generated such that, after the update is applied, words and phrases that do not occur in the search queries of the subset are not presented as autocomplete suggestions by the computing device, or are less likely to be presented than before the update is applied.
- words or phrases that occur in the search queries of the subset less commonly than in the overall set of search queries can be less likely to be presented as autocomplete suggestions by the computing device associated with the first user than to be presented on computing devices receiving different updates.
- the update is provided to the computing device associated with the first user ( 412 ).
- the update 160 is provided to the computing device 104 that is associated with the user 102 .
- the update can be provided as part of a series of periodic updates to the autocomplete cache. New autocomplete data can be provided in daily updates or in multiple intraday updates.
- the update can be provided to a second computing device that is associated with the first user and is different from the first computing device. For example, the update can be provided to multiple computing devices associated with an identifier for the first user.
- a communication from the computing device is received, and the update is generated for and/or provided to the computing device in response to receiving the communication.
- the communication from the computing device can be a request for an update to the autocomplete cache of the computing device.
- the communication can be, for example, a request for autocomplete suggestions for a user input, a request for a resource, or a request to execute a search query.
- the update is provided to the computing device independent of communications from the computing device. For example, updates can be provided whether or not the computing device initiates a communication, and regardless of the timing of any communications.
- the profile data for the first user indicates a first geographical location.
- the first geographical location can indicate a current location of the computing device associated with the first user.
- the profile data for the second users can indicate second geographical locations from which the respective search queries were submitted.
- the second geographical locations can be locations of computing devices when the search queries were submitted using the computing devices.
- the similarity scores can be determined based on distances between the first geographical location and the respective second geographical locations. For example, similarity scores can be determined for each of the search queries, and the similarity score for each search query can be based on the distance between the first geographical location and the second geographical location from which the search query was submitted. The value of each similarity score can be determined such that, the smaller the distance, the greater the degree of similarity indicated by the similarity score.
- the profile data for the first user indicates a user type for the first user.
- the profile data for the second users indicates user types for the respective second users.
- To determine the similarity scores it can be determined whether the user type for the first user matches the user types for the second users.
- the similarity scores can be determined based on whether the user type for the first user matches the user type for the respective second users.
- the profile data for the first user includes demographic information about the first user.
- the profile data for the second users includes demographic information about respective second users.
- the similarity scores can be determined based on commonalities between the first demographic information and the second demographic information.
- the profile data for the first user includes a first search query history for the first user.
- the profile data for the second users can include second search query histories for the respective second users.
- the similarity scores can be determined based on commonalities between the first search query history and the respective second search query histories. For example, the greater the number of words and phrases that occur in both the first search query history and a second search query history, the greater the degree of similarity indicated by the corresponding similarity score.
- a particular search query can be selected based on the similarity score that is determined based on commonalities between the first search query history and the second search query history for the second user that submitted the particular search query.
- web browsing histories for the first user and the second users can be obtained, and similarity scores can be determined based on commonalities between the web browsing histories.
- the process 400 can be used to provide the autocomplete update with autocomplete data that is customized for the first user.
- the process 400 can also be performed to generate and provide a different update for a different user, for example, a third user.
- a different similarity scores are determined, based on profile data for the third user and the profile data for the second users.
- a different subset of search queries is selected, and the autocomplete update for the third user is generated to include different autocomplete data.
- a computing device associated with the third user can present autocomplete suggestions for a user input (e.g., one or more characters). Because the computing devices for first user and the third user receive different updates, the autocomplete suggestions presented by the computing devices can be different in response to a particular user input (e.g., different autocomplete suggestions can be presented if both users were to enter identical input terms).
