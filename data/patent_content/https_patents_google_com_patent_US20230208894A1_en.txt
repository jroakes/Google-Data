DETAILED DESCRIPTION
-
Aspects of the present disclosure relate to integrating a video feed with a shared document during a conference call discussion. A conference platform can enable video or audio-based conference call discussions between multiple participants via respective client devices that are connected over a network and share each other's audio data (e.g., voice of a user recorded via a microphone of a client device) and/or video data (e.g., a video captured by a camera of a client device) during a conference call. In some instances, a conference platform can enable a significant number of client devices (e.g., up to one hundred or more client devices) to be connected via the conference call.
-
It can be overwhelming for a participant of a live conference call (e.g., a video conference call) to engage other participants of the conference call using a shared document (e.g., a slide presentation document, a word processing document, a webpage document, etc.). For example, a presenter of a conference call can prepare a document including content that the presenter plans to discuss during the conference call. Existing conference platforms enable the presenter to share the document displayed via a GUI of a client device associated with the presenter with the other participants of the call via a conference platform GUI on respective client devices while the presenter discusses content included in the shared document. However, such conference platforms do not effectively display the content of the shared document while simultaneously displaying an image depicting the presenter via the conference platform GUI on the client devices associated with the other participants. For example, some existing conference platforms may not provide the image depicting the conference call presenter with the document shared via the conference platform GUI, which prevents the presenter from effectively engaging with the participants via a video feature of the conference platform. As a result, the attention of the conference call participants is not captured for long (or at all) and the presentation of the shared document during the conference call can come across as being impersonal or mechanical. Other existing conference platforms may display the content of the shared document via a first portion of the conference platform GUI and an image depicting the presenter via a second portion of the conference platform GUI. However, given that the image of the presenter is displayed in a separate portion of the conference platform GUI than the content of the shared document, participants may not be able to simultaneously focus on or concurrently observe the visual cues or gestures provided by the presenter while consuming the content provided by the shared document.
-
In some instances, multiple presenters can be associated with a document that is shared with participants of the conference call via the conference platform GUI. For example, two or more presenters can be associated with a shared document, where a first presenter is to discuss content included in a first portion of the shared document (e.g., a first slide of a slide presentation document, etc.), a second presenter is to discuss content included in a second portion of the shared document (e.g., a second slide of the slide presentation document, etc.), and so forth. Conventional systems do not enable presenters of a shared document to seamlessly transition a discussion between multiple different presenters. For example, when an electronic document is shared via a conventional conference platform, the electronic document can be presented via a first portion of the conference platform GUI and a video feed associated with one or more participants of the conference call (e.g., including the presenters) can be presented via a second portion of the conference call. The size of the first portion of the conference platform GUI can be significantly larger than the size of video feeds presented via the second portion of the conference platform GUI (e.g., and the size of the video feeds can be significantly small). Given that the size of the video feeds presented via the second portion of the conference platform GUI is small, a participant of the conference call discussion may not easily identify the video feed of a presenter of the shared document. The participant may also not easily detect when the presentation or discussion relating to the shared document transitions from a first presenter to a second presenter. For these additional reasons, conventional conference platforms do not enable conference call presenters to effectively engage with participants of the conference call discussion and do not enable the clear and effective transition between presenters.
-
Aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by providing techniques for integrating a video feed associated with one or more conference call presenters with a document shared via a conference platform GUI on client devices associated with participants of the conference call. A conference platform can provide a GUI that enables presentation of electronic documents to participants of a video conference call. A client device associated with a presenter of a conference call can transmit a request to the conference platform to initiate a document sharing operation to share an electronic document (e.g., a slide presentation document, etc.) displayed via a GUI for the client device with participants of the conference call via GUIs on client devices associated with participants of the conference call. A first portion of the electronic document (e.g., a first slide, a first portion of a first slide, etc.) can include a first video feed integration object. The first video feed integration object can indicate a first region of the first portion of an electronic document that is to include a video feed generated by a first client device of a first participant of the conference call (e.g., the presenter or another participant of the conference call). In some embodiments, a second portion of the electronic document (e.g., a second slide, a second portion of a second slide, etc.) can include a second video feed integration object. The second video feed integration object can indicate a second region of the second portion of the electronic document that is to include a video feed generated by a second client device of a second participant of the conference call (e.g., another presenter of the conference call, etc.).
-
In some embodiments, the first video feed integration object and/or the second video feed integration object can be associated with an identifier for a particular user and/or a particular client device connected to the conference platform. For example, a creator and/or editor of the electronic document can provide an indication (e.g., via the conference platform GUI or another GUI, such as an collaborative document platform GUI) that the first region indicated by the first video feed integration object is to include the video feed generated by the first client device during presentation of the first portion of the electronic document and/or that the second region indicated by the second video feed integration object is to include the video feed generated by the second client device during presentation of the second portion of the electronic document. In other or similar embodiments, the first video feed integration object and/or the second video feed integration object may not be associated with an identifier for a particular user and/or a particular client device. Instead, the creator and/or editor of the electronic document can provide an indication that first video feed integration object and/or the second video feed integration object is to provide the video feed associated with a client device that satisfies particular criteria (e.g., an audio recording component of the client device is unmuted, a camera component of the client device is activated, etc.) during presentation of the first portion and/or the second portion of the electronic device. Accordingly, the conference platform can identify the first client device and/or the second client device for obtaining and presenting video feed by determining that the first client device and/or the second client device satisfy the particular criteria during the presentation of the first portion and/or the second portion of the electronic document.
-
In response to receiving the request to initiate the document sharing operation, the conference platform can identify the electronic document and can provide the first portion and/or the second portion of the electronic document for presentation via the conference platform GUI. When the first portion of the electronic document is presented via the conference platform GUI (e.g., during a first time period), the conference platform can obtain the video feed generated by the first client device (e.g., during the first time period) and include the obtained video feed in the first region indicated by the first video feed integration object. The video feed can depict the first participant of the conference call during presentation of the first portion of the electronic document. Accordingly, the video feed depicting the first participant can be integrated with the first portion of the shared electronic document. Similarly, when the second portion of the electronic document is presented via the conference platform GUI (e.g., during a second time period), the conference platform can obtain the video feed generated by the second client device (e.g., during the second time period) and include the obtained video feed in the second region indicated by the second video feed integration object. The video feed can depict the second participant during presentation of the second portion of the electronic document. Accordingly, the video feed depicting the second participant can be integrated with the second portion of the shared electronic document. Examples of the video feed(s) associated with a first client device and/or a second client device are depicted in FIGS. 4B-4C and FIGS. 6A-6B, which are described in further detail herein.
-
Aspects of the present disclosure provide techniques to integrate video feeds of one or more presenters of a conference call discussion with a shared document during the conference call discussion. Aspects of the present disclosure enable a creator and/or editor of an electronic document to indicate which regions of an electronic document should include video feeds associated with respective presenters of a conference call discussion. The creator and/or editor can further specify, for the indicated regions, a particular presenter and/or a particular client device (e.g., that satisfies one or more criteria during the presentation) such that the conference platform can obtain the video feeds depicting such presenters and/or generated by such client devices and include the obtained video feeds in the indicated regions of the shared document during the conference call discussion. When the electronic document is shared with participants of the conference call discussion via a conference platform GUI, the conference platform can include the video feeds of the particular presenters and/or generated by the particular client devices in the indicted regions. Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure provide mechanisms to present a video feed of a conference call presenter in a specified region of an electronic document shared during a conference call discussion. An electronic document creator and/or editor can more effectively plan for a conference call discussion by indicating particular regions of an electronic document that should include a video feed for a respective conference call presenter. The conference call presenter is able to effectively engage with the participants of the conference call discussion, as the video feed of the presenter is integrated with the content of the electronic document, instead of in a separate portion of the conference platform GUI. Additionally, conference call participants are able to consume the content included in the document as well as the image depicting the presenter. As such, conference call discussions can be conducted effectively and efficiently. As conference call discussions are conducted effectively and efficiently, a conference platform, accordingly, can consume a fewer amount of computing resources (e.g., processing cycles, memory space, etc.) and such resources can be made available to other processes associated with the conference platform or other systems.
-
FIG. 1 illustrates an example system architecture 100, in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure. The system architecture 100 (also referred to as “system” herein) includes client devices 102A-N, a data store 110, a conference platform 120, and a collaborative document platform 130 each connected to a network 108. In implementations, network 108 can include a public network (e.g., the Internet), a private network (e.g., a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN)), a wired network (e.g., Ethernet network), a wireless network (e.g., an 802.11 network or a Wi-Fi network), a cellular network (e.g., a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network), routers, hubs, switches, server computers, and/or a combination thereof.
-
In some implementations, data store 110 is a persistent storage that is capable of storing data as well as data structures to tag, organize, and index the data. A data item can include audio data and/or image data, in accordance with embodiments described herein. In other or similar embodiments, a data item can correspond to a document displayed via a graphical user interface (GUI) on a client device 102, in accordance with embodiments described herein. Data store 110 can be hosted by one or more storage devices, such as main memory, magnetic or optical storage based disks, tapes or hard drives, NAS, SAN, and so forth. In some implementations, data store 110 can be a network-attached file server, while in other embodiments data store 110 can be some other type of persistent storage such as an object-oriented database, a relational database, and so forth, that may be hosted by conference platform 120 and/or collaborative document platform 130 or one or more different machines coupled to the conference platform 120 and/or collaborative document platform 130 via network 108.
-
Conference platform 120 can enable users of client devices 102A-N to connect with each other via a conference call, such as a video conference call or an audio conference call. A conference call refers to an audio-based call and/or a video-based call in which participants of the call can connect with multiple additional participants. Conference platform 120 can allow a user to join and participate in a video conference call and/or an audio conference call with other users of the platform. Although embodiments of the present disclosure refer to multiple participants (e.g., 3 or more) connecting via a conference call, it should be noted that embodiments of the present disclosure can be implemented with any number of participants connecting via the conference call (e.g., 2 or more). Further details regarding conference platform 120 are provided below.
-
The client devices 102A-N can each include computing devices such as personal computers (PCs), laptops, mobile phones, smart phones, tablet computers, netbook computers, network-connected televisions, etc. In some implementations, client devices 102A-N may also be referred to as “user devices.” Each client device 102A-N can include a web browser and/or a client application (e.g., a mobile application or a desktop application). In some implementations, the web browser and/or the client application can display a graphical user interface (GUI) provided by conference platform 120 for users to access conference platform 120. For example, a user can join and participate in a video conference call or an audio conference call via a GUI provided by conference platform 120 and presented by the web browser or client application. In other or similar implementations, the web browser and/or the client application can display a GUI provided by collaborative document platform 130 for users to access collaborative document platform 130. For example, a user can access (e.g., create, edit, view, etc.) a collaborative document via the GUI provided by collaborative document platform 130 and presented by the web browser or client application.
-
Each client device 102A-N can include one or more audiovisual components that can generate audio and/or image data to be streamed to conference platform 120. In some implementations, an audiovisual component can include a device (e.g., a camera) that is configured to capture images and generate image data associated with the captured images. For example, a camera for a client device 102 can capture images of a participant of a conference call in a surrounding environment (e.g., a background) during the conference call. In additional or alternative implementations, an audiovisual component can include a device (e.g., a microphone) to capture an audio signal representing speech of a user and generate audio data (e.g., an audio file) based on the captured audio signal. The audiovisual component can include another device (e.g., a speaker) to output audio data to a user associated with a particular client device 102A-N.
-
Electronic document platform 130 can enable a user of client devices 102A-N to create, edit (e.g., collaboratively with other users), access, or share with other users an electronic document (e.g., stored at data store 110). In some embodiments, electronic document platform 130 can allow a user to create or edit a file (e.g., an electronic document file, etc.) via a user interface of a content viewer. In some embodiments, each client device 102A-N can include a content viewer. A content viewer can be an application that provides a user interface for users to view, create, or edit content of a file, such as an electronic document file. In one example, the content viewer can be a web browser that can access, retrieve, and/or navigate files served by a web server. In another example, the content viewer can be a standalone application (e.g., a mobile application, etc.) that allows users to view, edit, and/or create digital content items. In some embodiments, the content viewer can be provided by electronic document platform 130. In some embodiments, one or more files that are created or otherwise accessible via the content viewer can be stored at data store 110.
-
As illustrated in FIG. 1 , electronic document platform 130 can include a document management component 132, in some embodiments. Document management component 132 can be configured to manage access to a particular document by a user of electronic document platform 130. For example, a client device 102 can provide a request to electronic document platform 130 for a particular file corresponding to an electronic document. Document management component 132 can identify the file (e.g., stored in data store 110) and can determine whether a user associated with the client device is authorized to access the requested file. Responsive to determining that the user is authorized to access the requested file, document management component 132 can provide access to the file to the client device 102. The client device 102 can provide the user with access to the file via the GUI of the content viewer, as described above.
-
As indicated above, a user can create and/or edit an electronic document via a GUI of a content viewer of a client device associated with the user. In some embodiments, the electronic document can be or can correspond to a slide presentation document, a word document, a spreadsheet document, and so forth. Electronic document platform 130 can include a document editing component 134, which is configured to enable a user to create and/or edit an electronic document. For example, a client device 102 associated with a user of electronic document platform 130 can transmit a request to electronic document platform 130 to create a slide presentation document based on a slide presentation document template associated with electronic document platform 130. Electronic document platform 130 can generate a file associated with the slide presentation document based on the slide presentation document template and can provide the user with access to the slide presentation document via the content viewer GUI. In another example, a client device 102 associated with a user of electronic document platform 130 can transmit a request to access an electronic document (e.g., a slide presentation document) via the content viewer GUI. Document management component 132 can obtain the file associated with the requested electronic document, as described above, and document editing component 134 can provide the user with access to the electronic document via the content viewer GUI. The user can edit one or more portions of the electronic document via the content viewer GUI and the document editing component 132 can update the file associated with the electronic document to include the edits to the one or more portions.
-
In some embodiments, the user can provide, via the content viewer GUI, an indication of a region of the electronic document that is to include a video feed of a presenter of a conference call discussion (e.g., facilitated by conference platform 120) during a time at which the electronic document is shared with participants of the conference call discussion (e.g., via a conference platform GUI). The user can provide the indication of the region of the electronic document by adding, via the content viewer GUI, a video feed integration object to one or more regions of the electronic document. A region that includes a video feed integration object can indicate a region of the electronic document that is to include a video feed of a presenter, as described above. In some embodiments, the user can add multiple video feed integration objects to distinct portions of the electronic document. The user can also, in some embodiments, provide an indication of a particular user of the conference platform 120 that is to be depicted in the video feed that is included in the region indicated by a respective video feed integration object. In other or similar embodiments, the user can provide an indication of a particular client device 102 connected to the conference platform 120 that is to generate the video feed that is included in the region indicated by the video feed integration object. Further details regarding adding video feed integration objects to portions of an electronic document are provided herein with respect to FIGS. 3A-3C, FIGS. 5A-5B, and FIG. 7 .
-
In some embodiments, conference platform 120 can include a conference management component 122. Conference management component 122 can be configured to manage a conference call between multiple users of conference platform 120. In some embodiments, conference management component 122 can provide a GUI to each client device 102 (referred to as a conference platform GUI herein) to enable users to watch and listen to each other during a conference call. In some embodiments, conference management component 122 can also enable users to share documents (e.g., a slide presentation document, a word processing document, a webpage document, etc.) displayed via a GUI on an associated client device with other users. For example, during a conference call, conference management component 122 can receive a request to share a document displayed via a GUI on a first client device associated with a first participant of the conference call with other participants of the conference call. Conference management platform 122 can modify the conference platform GUI at the client devices 102 associated with the other conference call participants to display at least a portion of the shared document, in some embodiments.
-
Conference platform 120 can also include a video feed integration engine 124, in some embodiments. Video feed integration engine 124 can be configured to detect whether one or more portions of a document shared with participants of the conference call via the conference platform GUI includes a video feed integration object. In response to determining that the one or more portions of the shared document includes a video feed integration object, video feed integration engine 124 can determine a client device that is to generate the video feed to be integrated into the region of the shared document that includes the video feed integration object. The client device 102 can be associated with a particular participant of the conference call discussion or can satisfy one or more video feed integration criteria. An audiovisual component of the determined client device 102 can generate the video feed and the client device 102 can transmit the generated video feed to the conference platform 120, as described above. Responsive to receiving the video feed, video feed integration engine 124 can provide the video feed in the region indicated by the video feed integration object in the shared document. Further details regarding video feed integration engine 124 and video feed integration objects are provided herein.
-
In some implementations, conference platform 120 and/or electronic document platform 130 can operate on one or more computing devices (such as a rackmount server, a router computer, a server computer, a personal computer, a mainframe computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, etc.), data stores (e.g., hard disks, memories, databases), networks, software components, and/or hardware components that may be used to enable a user to connect with other users via a conference call. In some implementations, the functions of conference platform 120 and/or electronic document platform 130 can be provided by a more than one machine. For example, in some implementations, the functions of conference management component 122 and/or video feed integration engine 124 may be provided by two or more separate server machines. In another example, the functions of document management component 132 and/or document editing component 134 may be provided by two or more separate server machines. Conference platform 120 and/or electronic document platform 130 may also include a website (e.g., a webpage) or application back-end software that may be used to enable a user to connect with other users via the conference call. It should be noted that in some other implementations, the functions of conference platform 120 and/or electronic document platform 130 can be provided by a fewer number of machines. For example, in some implementations conference platform 120 and/or electronic document platform 130 can be integrated into a single machine.
-
In general, functions described in implementations as being performed by conference platform 120 and/or electronic document platform 130 can also be performed on the client devices 102A-N in other implementations, if appropriate. In addition, the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. Conference platform 120 and/or electronic document platform 130 can also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through appropriate application programming interfaces, and thus is not limited to use in websites.
-
Although implementations of the disclosure are discussed in terms of conference platform 120 and users of conference platform 120 participating in a video and/or audio conference call, implementations can also be generally applied to any type of telephone call or conference call between users. Implementations of the disclosure are not limited to conference platforms that provide conference call tools to users. In addition, although implementations of the disclosure are discussed in terms of electronic document platform 130 and users of electronic document platform 130 accessing an electronic document, implementations can also be generally applied to any type of documents or files. Implementations of the disclosure are not limited to electronic document platforms that provide document creation, editing, and/or viewing tools to users.
-
In implementations of the disclosure, a “user” can be represented as a single individual. However, other implementations of the disclosure encompass a “user” being an entity controlled by a set of users and/or an automated source. For example, a set of individual users federated as a community in a social network can be considered a “user.” In another example, an automated consumer can be an automated ingestion pipeline, such as a topic channel, of the conference platform 120 and/or electronic document platform 130.
-
Further to the descriptions above, a user may be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs, or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions, or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), and if the user is sent content or communications from a server. In addition, certain data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity can be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location can be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user can have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.

Document editing component 134 can be configured to enable a user to create and/or edit an electronic document 210. It should be noted that although FIG. 1 illustrates client device 102A connected to electronic document platform 130, any of client device(s) 102 described with respect to FIG. 1 can be connected to electronic document platform 130 and can be provided with access to electronic document 210, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.
-
In some embodiments, client device 102A can transmit a request to electronic document platform 130 (e.g., via network 108) to access electronic document 210, as described above. In other or similar embodiments, client device 102A can transmit a request to create and/or edit electronic document 210, as described above. Client device 102A can transmit the request(s) in response to detecting an interaction with one or more GUI elements of the content viewer GUI by a user associated with client device 102A, in some embodiments. Responsive to receiving the request(s), document management component 132 and/or document editing component 134 can provide the user with access to the requested electronic document 210 via the content viewer GUI. FIG. 3A illustrates an example content viewer GUI 300, in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. GUI 300 can include a first portion 310 and a second portion 312, in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the first portion 310 can include one or more GUI elements 314 that provide a user with a preview of one or more portions of electronic document 210. For example, electronic document 210 can be a slide presentation document, in some embodiments, first portion 310 can include one or more GUI elements 314 (e.g., thumbnails, etc.) that each include a preview of one or more slides of the slide presentation document. A user can select (e.g., click on, etc.) a particular GUI element 314 to access a respective portion of electronic document 210 via the second portion 312 of GUI 300. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, a particular GUI element 314 included in the first portion 310 of GUI 300 is highlighted, indicating that a user has selected the particular GUI element 314. Accordingly, the user can access the portion of electronic document 210 that is associated with the selected GUI element 314 via the second portion 312 of GUI 300 (e.g., illustrated in FIG. 3A as portion 316).
-
It should be noted that although embodiments described with respect to FIG. 3A, and other figures of the present disclosure, are directed to a slide presentation document, embodiments of the present disclosure can be directed to any type of electronic document.

During a time at which portion 516 is shared via GUI 600, the microphones of client devices 102 associated with Participant B and Participant N can be muted. Accordingly, integration component 222 can determine that no client devices 102 connected to conference platform 120 satisfy the criteria and, accordingly, no video feed(s) are included in the regions of portion 516 indicated by video feed integration objects 530 and/or 532. As illustrated in FIG. 6A, the text provided via text box object 526 (e.g. “Question and Answer Session”) is included in a first region 614 of the first portion 610 of GUI 600. The video feed associated with Participant A is include in a second region 616 of the first portion of 610 of GUI 600 (i.e., a region that is indicated by video feed integration object 528). No video feeds are included in a third region 618 and/or a fourth region 620 of the first portion 610 of GUI 600.

Integration component 222 can update GUI 600 to include the video feeds of one or more participants in the third region 618 and/or the fourth region 620 in response to detecting that the video feed integration criteria associated with the video feed integration objects 530 and/or 532 are satisfied. For example, a microphone associated with client device(s) 102 associated with Participant B and/or Participant N can be activated (e.g., unmuted). Accordingly, integration component 222 can determine that the client device(s) 102 satisfy the video feed integration criteria and can include the video feeds generated by the respective client device(s) in third region 618 and/or the fourth region 620. As illustrated in FIG. 6B, the video feed associated with Participant B can be included in third region 618 after integration component 222 detects that a microphone associated with the client device 102 of Participant B is activated (e.g., unmuted). Additionally or alternatively, the video feed associated with Participant N can be included in fourth region 620 after integration component 222 detects that a microphone associated with client device 102 of Participant N is activated (e.g., unmuted). As illustrated in FIG. 6B, conference management component 122 can update the second portion 612 of GUI 600 to remove the video feeds associated with Participant B and/or Participant N (e.g., in response to integration component 222 including the video feeds in regions 618 and/or 620 of portion 610).
