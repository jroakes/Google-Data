- the image data structure is a tree structure, such as a tree produced through Hierarchical K-means clustering of the descriptors. This type of tree-based data structure represents the semantic structure of all the images 121 . Images having similar global descriptors are grouped closer together within the structure. Thus, if the set of received images 121 includes different scenes of buildings, mountains and waterfronts, the images having scenes of different buildings will be grouped together in the image data structure because they will have similar descriptors. The same will be true of the images having scenes of different waterfronts and the images having scenes of different mountains. Other embodiments can organize the images into other data structures.

- FIG. 4 is a high-level block diagram illustrating modules within the patch identification module 117 according to one embodiment. Some embodiments of patch identification module 117 have different and/or additional modules than the ones described here. Similarly, the functions can be distributed among the modules in a different manner than is described here. Certain modules and functions can be incorporated into other modules of the patch identification module 117 or image processing server 101 .
- the patch identification module 117 has the same or similar function to corresponding modules of the search processing module 113 show in FIG. 3 .
- like names have been used to refer to like modules with the same or similar functionality.
- the patch identification module 117 also includes: a global descriptor module 405 ; a patch creation module 407 ; and a patch descriptor module 412 .
- An original image receipt module 401 receives the original image 126 and saves it to the data storage module 110 .
- the global descriptor module 405 generates a global descriptor for the original image 126 .
- the global descriptor for the original image 126 is generated in the same manner as the global descriptors for the set of received images 121 .

- the patch descriptor module 412 creates a patch descriptor for the identified patch in the original image 126 .
- the descriptor type used for the patch in the original image 126 is the same as was used for the set of patches in the received images 121 .
- the search module 437 receives the global descriptor and the patch descriptor for the original image 126 and uses the descriptors to search for similar images 123 and patches from the set of received images 121 .
- the search module 437 searches the image data structure to identify a set of related images 123 that have global descriptors similar to that of the original image 126 using a tree-based Nearest Neighbor Search (“NNS”) technique, including any variant and/or derivative thereof.
- NSS Nearest Neighbor Search
- the search module 437 identifies the set of related images 123 by searching the image data structure for global descriptors that are similar to the global descriptor for the original image 126 .
- the search module 437 can search the image data structure for global descriptors that are within a predetermined amount of similarity with the global descriptor of the original image.
- the amounts of similarity can be measured by determining the distances between global descriptors for the received images 121 and the original image descriptor. Distance can be measured using Euclidian distance, Manhattan distance and/or any variant thereof.
- the search module 437 can quickly traverse the nodes of the image data structure tree to identify nodes for global descriptors similar to that of the original image 126 , and then identify descriptors at those nodes that are within a predetermined distance from the original image descriptor.
- the received images corresponding to the descriptors within the threshold form the set of related images 123 .
- the search module 437 then identifies a set of patches within the related images 123 that are similar to the patch in the original image 126 for which enhancement is desired. To this end, the search module 437 searches the patch data structures for the related images 123 using the patch descriptor for the original image 126 . This search can be performed using NNS and/or other techniques. The result of this search is a set of one or more patches from the related images 123 that are visually similar to the patch in the original image 126 . The search module 437 then outputs the set of similar patches. The desired number of patches in the output set may be specified as input to the search module 437 , and may designate either a number of patches for each related image 123 , or a total number of patches across all the related images 123 .
- the search module 437 stores the output set of patches to the data storage module 110 .
- One or more of these patches can then be used to enhance the original image 126 by replacing the patch in the original image with a higher-quality patch for the output set of patches.
- the image processing server 101 segments the received images 121 using a texture-based segmentation algorithm. Different segments can have different textures.
- the global descriptor module 306 generates global descriptors for the segments.
- the global descriptor can be, for example, a feature vector describing the texture contained within the segment.
- the image data structure module 311 then organizes the global descriptors into a tree-based data structure such as the tree based on Hierarchical K-means clustering described above.
- the image processing server 101 then segments the original image 126 into segments using the same texture-based segmentation algorithm used for the received images 121 . Instead of identifying a set of related images 123 , the search module 437 identifies, from the segments of the received images 121 , one or more sets of related segments that are visually similar to the segments from the original image 126 . To find the related segments, the image processing server 101 generates global descriptors for the segments from the original image 126 and then compares these segments to the tree-based structure for the received images 121 to identify one or more sets of related segments from the received images 121 .
- the search module 437 uses an NNS-based search technique to identify a set of segments from the received images 121 that are visually similar to a particular segment from the original image 126 . Segments from the received images 121 having global descriptors within a predetermined distance of the global descriptor for the segment from the original image 126 form a set of related segments. This process is repeated for each of the segments from the original image 126 to form one or more sets of related segments. In one embodiment, the sets of related segments are then stored to the data storage module 110 .
- the patch creation module 407 identifies a patch in the non-segmented version of the original image 126 and the patch descriptor module 412 generates a patch descriptor for this patch, as previously described.
- the search module 437 identifies a set of similar patches for the non-segmented version of the original image 126 by searching the patch data structures for a subset of the received images 121 .
- the search module 437 searches the patch data structures for all the received images 121 having a segment in the set of related segments.
- the search module 437 searches the patch data structures for all the received images 121 having a threshold number of segments in the set of related segments. The threshold can be specified by a human user of the image processing server 101 . This search can be performed using NNS and/or other techniques.
- the set of patches are then stored to the data storage module 110 .
- the search module 437 identifies a set of replacement texture segments that are similar to a portion of the original image 126 for which image enhancement is desired.
- a portion of the original image 126 is a subset of pixels from the original image 126 , including, e.g., a patch or a segment from the original image 126 .
- the patch creation module 407 and patch descriptor module 412 can be modified to identify different portions of the original image 126 for which enhancement is desired and generate descriptors for these portions (“portion descriptors”).
- the search module 437 identifies, from among the set of related segments, one or more texture segments that are within a predetermined distance of a descriptor for a portion of the original image 126 that is to be enhanced.
- the texture segments within the predetermined distance threshold are identified by the search module 437 as forming the set of replacement texture segments.
- the set of replacement texture segments is stored to the data storage module 110 .
- the image processing server 101 ranks the received images 121 based on the sets of related segments and the search module 437 identifies a set of replacement patches or a set of replacement texture segments based in part on these rankings For example, the image processing server 101 assigns segment similarity scores to the segments forming the sets of related segments.
- the segment similarity score for a related segment is based on the distance between the descriptor for the related segment and the original image segment that was previously identified as similar to the related segment.
- the segment similarity score is inversely proportional to the distance separating the descriptors for that related segment and that segment's matching original image segment. Thus, smaller distances between these descriptors correspond to a higher segment similarity score.
- the image processing server 101 then assigns an image similarity score to each of the received images 121 .
- the image similarity score is assigned by determining which received images 121 have segments in the sets of related segments and then comparing among these images 121 to determine, for each of the received images 121 , an image similarity score that is weighted against the other received images 121 .
- the image similarity score for a particular received image 121 is assigned based on a mathematical combination of the segment similarity scores for all the related segments originating from that received image 121 .
- a mathematical combination of the segment similarity scores can be the sum or the product of the segment similarity scores for all the related segments originating from that received image 121 .
- the image processing server 101 determines which of the related segments originated from a particular received image 121 , multiplies all the segment similarity scores for these segments and assigns an image similarity score to the image 121 that is equal to the product of these scores.
- individual related segments are not assigned segment similarity scores and the image processing server 101 assigns image similarity scores to the received images 121 based on a count of the related segments originating from the received images 121 .
- the image processing server 101 determines which of the related segments originated from a particular received image 121 , counts the number of segments originating from that image 121 and assigns an image similarity score to the image 121 that is equal to (or otherwise based on) the counted number of segments.
- the image processing server 101 then ranks the received images 121 based on their respective image similarity scores. In one embodiment, the image processing server 101 ranks each of the received images 121 by decreasing image similarity score.
- the search module 437 searches the patch data structures of higher ranking received images 121 first when identifying a set of replacement patches. Similarly, the search module 437 searches higher ranking received images 121 first if identifying a set of replacement texture segments. Thus, the rankings make it more likely that the set of replacement patches or set of replacement texture segments will come from those received images having higher image similarity scores relative to the other received images. Alternatively, the search module 437 can be configured to identify a set of replacement patches or texture segments from received images 121 having a minimum predetermined image similarity ranking or a minimum predetermined image similarity score. In one embodiment, the rankings, segment and/or image similarity scores, identified sets of replacement patches and/or sets of replacement texture segments are saved to the storage module 110 .
