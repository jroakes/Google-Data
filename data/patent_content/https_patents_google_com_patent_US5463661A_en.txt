Definitions
- the present invention relates to modems, in general, and more particularly to a modem for selecting a carrier frequency, a symbol rate, a transmit preemphasis filter and transmitted power level from a predetermined plurality of carrier frequencies, symbol rates, transmit preemphasis filter and transmitted power level.
- a data communication network digital data among other data, may be-communicated at a data signaling rate from one modem to another modem through a communication media, which may be a leased line of the network or a dial up connection of a general switched telephone network (GSTN), for example.
- GSTN general switched telephone network
- modems operate at a fixed carrier frequency and a fixed symbol rate and attempt to optimize the data signaling rate based on the conditions of the communication media over which they are communicating.
- V 0.34 In order to accomplish an optimum data signaling rate, contemporary modems, International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunications Standardization Sector(ITU-T) Recommendation V 0.34, utilize a startup learning procedure before commencing communication during which the modems perform certain predefined start up procedures which include a line probing sequence, for example, to establish the media characteristics over which communication will take place.
- the current state of the art ITU-T standard for two wire full duplex modems is V 0.34 .
- An example of a modem employing the V 0.34 standard today includes the Motorola Codex Model 3260 Fast.
- Two wire modems for operating in a full duplex mode generally employ an echo canceller to cancel from the received signal any near end and far end echoes resulting from its concurrent signal transmissions.
- an echo canceller to cancel from the received signal any near end and far end echoes resulting from its concurrent signal transmissions.
- Normally modems do not measure the nonlinearities of the echo signals and, for this reason, cannot provide adequate estimates for preemphasis and transmit power level selection purposes. This measurement is vital for modern modems that are transmitting and receiving at data signaling rates up to 33,600 bits per second.
- Virtually all known echo cancellers are linear models. This means that any significant non-linearity remains largely uncancelled.
- the receiver can only resolve non-linear distortion levels to approximately the ⁇ -law or A-law companding quantizing noise limits of the PCM Codec (37-39)dB and therefore has no ability to measure the potential improvement in the remote modem's performance if the transmit level was dropped further.
- the receiver can not measure the distortion improvement of the remote end when the remote transmitter lowers the transmit power by one additional dB that would result in a non-linear distortion level improvement from 65 dB to 70 dB.
- the ability to resolve small but still significant differences in -performance will be crucial to all V 0.34 modems and the future proposed ITU-T Recommendation V 0.34 bis modems operating at data signaling rates greater than or equal to 28.8 kbit/s.
- V 0.34 recommendation there is a provision for the transmitter to allow for a power drop as requested by the receiver, with additional capability for the transmitter to drop power within the receiver recommended tolerance. There is also the provision in the V 0.34 recommendation for selecting the transmitter preemphasis filter.
- the present invention provides a selection of transmitter preemphasis filters and the transmitter output power that minimizes the effects of non-linearity in the network.

- Transmitter preemphasis up to now has only been treated as a receiver equalization technique and not a echo canceller dynamic range extension technique. It is well understood that Transmitter (TX) preemphasis is selected by the receiver to assist in the linear equalization of the receiver, but what has been mostly ignored is that TX preemphasis in and of itself is a form of TX power control but more importantly, it reduces the power in the lower portion of the spectrum in which frequency dependent non-linearity primarily occurs.
- TX preemphasis can also be used to minimize the effects of non-linearity in the network.
- These nonlinearities are primarily caused by transformers. Since a transformer is non-linear at low frequencies (transformer linearity always improves as the frequency increases), lowering the power in the lower portion of the spectrum while raising it in the higher portion of the spectrum will dramatically improve the transformer linearity. This improvement in transformer linearity will have the net result of improving the residual non-linearity in the Near End Echo and thus increase the bit rate of the modem.
- FIGS. 1-2 are block diagrams of a network connection representation illustrating an exemplary data communications network model in which two modems denoted as A and B, of the two wire variety, are communicating through a general switched telephone network (GSTN).

- a call modem a call mode
- an answer modem an answer mode
- a common start up procedure which includes line probing the telephone line connection communication media between the call and answer modems to learn the channel characteristics and the echo characteristics.
- the call and the answer modems proceed to interwork with each other as recommended by phase 1 1002,1102 with a CM/JM exchange as shown in FIG. 8, as specified by the ITU-T V 0.34 modem recommendation.
- the call and the answer modems transmit 75 ms of silence (as shown in functional block 1004, 1104).
- the call modem After the transmission of silence, the call modem then proceeds to send Info0c 802 followed by Tone B 804, 1006 as shown in FIG. 5, FIG. 10 using the INFO x generator 24 and then commences transmitting a Tone B as shown in flowchart block 1006.
- the controller 20 selects and enables the tone generator 26 to generate a tone at 1200 Hz and controls the switch SW1 to pass the generated tone to the transmitter/modulator 34 which transmits the tone overpath 36 through the hybrid 38 and out over the two wire line 40 to the answer modem.
- the controller 20 of the call modem initializes the module 58 for the reception of a information sequence INFO0a. At this time, both modems may be set at a predetermined symbol timing, for example, the symbol timing of 2400 Hz.
- the answer modem similarly governs the transmission of the information sequence Info0a using block 24 and the 2400 Hz tone using block 26 and initializes its module 62 to receive and detect Info0c according to block 1104.
- the answer modem Upon reception of Info0c as detected by the module 62 in accordance with block 1106 the answer modem initializes itself to detect Tone B a 1200 Hz tone from the call modem while continuing to receive Info0c in accordance with block 1108.
- the call modem Upon detection of INFO0a block 1008 the call modem then looks for Tone A, a 2400 Hz tone using block 58 in block 1010. and then upon detection of Tone A the call modem initializes to detect the first phase reversal of Tone A in Block 1012 (Tone A *) . Upon detection of Tone A * in block 1014 the call modem sends a phase reversal of Tone B (Tone B*) for 10 ms, Concurrently therewith, the controller 20 of the call modem starts the counter 74 to measure the round trip delay RTDEc (block 1016).
- the call modem initializes the detect module 58 to detect the phase reversed Tone A and controls the transmitter 34 to transmit all zeroes. Then looks for the phase reversal Tone A in the decisional block 1018.
- the answer modem After receiving Tone B block 1110, the answer modem starts to send Tone A using block 26 as shown in block 1112 in the flow diagram. After at least 50 ms of Tone A has been transmitted, the answer modem transmits a Tone A phase reversal. Simultaneously, the answer modem initializes its detect module 58 in block 1114 to detect the phase reversal Tone B.
- the answer modem looks for the phase reversal Tone B in the decisional block 1116 and when it receives and detects the Tone B* by the module 58, it executes the flowchart block 1118 which causes the controller 20 to wait for at least 40 +/-1 ms, and then control the tone generator 26 and transmitter 34 to transmit a phase reversal Tone A* (Tone A) for 10 ms. Thereafter, in the block 1120, the controller 20 of the answer modem initializes the echo and received signal analyzer 80 to compute the channel characteristics estimation resulting from received echo signals of the first line probe signal L1 Simultaneously, the answer modem transmits line probe signal (L1) using block 28 and setting gain 29 to +6 dB over nominal transmit level.
- the counter 74 is stopped by the receiver module 60 according to the instructions of block 1020 and the echo and received signal analyzer 80 thereof is initialized to compute an estimation of channel characteristics from a received signal (L1).
- the resultant digital count of the counter 74 is representative of the round trip delay or range between the two modems and is stored in the memory 22 by the controller 20 for later use in controlling the echo canceller 50.
- both the call modem and answer modem are initialized to estimate channel, noise characteristics, and as per the current invention the nonlinear distortion characteristics of the echo signal and received signal which is accomplished by one modem transmitting a known line probe signal, such as a chirp signal and, at the same time, receiving the echo signal therefrom, while the other modem at the remote end receives the chirp signal.
- the controller 20 of the answer modem controls the chirp generator 28, switch SW1 and transmitter 34 to transmit a line probing chirp signal which is a periodic signal comprised of a series of tones spaced at 150 Hz apart within a frequency band of 150 Hz-3750 Hz. Within this frequency band, 4 nulls are transmitted in place of the tones where one measures the nonlinear distortion, if any, introduced by the channel of the communication media.
- the line probing chirp signal is first transmitted at a high power level L1 (+6 dB over the nominal) for 160 MS 1122 and repeatedly transmitted at the nominal transmit level L2 for up to a maximum of 500 ms 1124 by the answer modem during which time it is receiving echo signals which are conducted to the echo and received signal analyzer 80 and analyzed for estimating echo characteristics including the nonlinear distortion characteristics of the communication media.
- the non-linearity of the near end echo is measured.
- the amount of non-linearity specifically in the 4 empty bins (900 Hz,1200 Hz, 1800 Hz and 2400 Hz) of the Line probe is critical, particularly in determining the relative distortion levels in the 4 empty bins.
- the transmitter measures the non-linearity of both the modem transformer and the network transformer during both L1 and L2 Line Probes.
- the residual non-linearity in the 4 empty bins in the Line Probe 900 Hz, 1200 Hz, 1800 Hz and 2400 Hz during L1 block 1120 is measured.
- the levels present in each of these bins are stored in memory 22 to be compared with the measurement obtained in the measurement of L2 described later.
- the difference in non-linearity level that exists between the different bins is used to determine the amount of TX preemphasis needed.
- L2 block 1124 is measured in the same 4 bins and a determination in accordance with a predetermined scheme is made whether or not the overall residual echo (non-linearity) requires further TX power control.
- the final determination in performance of the receiver is made by the local transmitter.
- the instructions of block 1020 cause the controller 20 of the call modem to activate the echo and received signal analyzer 80 to perform and analyze the received line probing chirp signal from the answer modem for estimating the signal characteristics of the communication media.
- Each receiving modem estimates its respective media characteristics of the broad band signal by performing the spectral analysis on the first line probing segment L1 (block 1022) for 160 ms and the proceeds perform averaging of the received spectrum for less than 500ms (block 1024). Averaging over the period of time by the echo and received signal analyzer, provides the noise rejection, which cancels out a majority of computation induced noise, leaving behind only the received signal or echo signal linearly and nonlinearly distorted by the channel.
- the functional block diagram schematic of FIG. 7 shows a series of modules suitable for embodying an echo and received signal analyzer for performing the estimation of signal or echo characteristics of the communication media.
- the incoming tones of the line probing chirp signal or echo signal thereof, as the case may be, are gathered in the block 130 and saved in a temporary memory buffer according to the functional block 132. Since the channel may introduce a frequency offset which could make the received signal non-periodic, a frequency offset correction is accomplished, using the frequency offset of block 134 and mixer 136, prior to computing the Fourier transform thereof.
- a 64 point FFT processing algorithm 138 is used, in the present embodiment to process the L1 segment, for computing the received signal to noise ratio over a predetermined frequency spectrum or a received signal to echo ratio over the same predetermined frequency spectrum. For this computation, 128 time samples or points are gated through the gate 140 at a time as governed by the time window signal 142 to the FFT 138. A power signal spectrum is computed for multiple periods over the 160 ms interval by the FFT processor 138 and stored in an accumulator 144. A timing offset correction TOFF and a frequency offset correction ROT are introduced to each result out spectrum. The individual spectrums are then averaged to yield an overall resultant spectrums to either reduce or eliminate random noise.
- the resultant average power spectrum is squared to yield a squared spectrum which is subtracted from the original spectrum to yield a channel noise spectrum.
- the output of the block 144 provides both a signal power spectrum and a noise power spectrum to a combiner block 146.
- the nonlinear distortion introduced by the channel is also measured in block 148 by averaging the energy at the null points of the signal spectrum which were introduced by the line probing signal as explained above.
- a block 150 is used to hunt for an optimum carrier frequency based on the resultant spectra.
- the FFT processor Since the goal of the FFT processor is to maximize the data bit rate for a particular channel according to the estimated characteristics thereof, the number of bits per symbol that can be transmitted through the channel and received by the modem receiver for a given BER is calculated.
- a 2-tap DFE model is constructed and based on the channel noise spectrum, the noise at the output of the DFE model, for unit signal is also calculated.
- the DFE model (linear) noise, the nonlinear noise and the signal level of the various spectrums are weighted and combined in block 146 to obtain the total noise at the input of the receivers decoder.
- the signal to noise ratios are established in blocks 152 and 154.
- the total noise including distortion above the received and echo signals are computed and scaled to unity.
- the bits/symbol is then computed from a Fourier series approximation of the decoders signal to noise ratio. Resulting from block 158 is an optimum carrier frequency symbol rate, and data bit rate within the desired data bit rate range provided from the controller 20.
- the resultant information is packed in a particular format for providing it to the other modem as will be fully understood from the description herebelow.
- a final decision algorithm selects between the selected and received parameters of carrier frequency, symbol rate, tentative transmitter preemphasis and tentative power level for the answer modem and the actual transmit preemphasis and the actual power level that will be requested by the call modem.
- the controller 20 of the answer modem initializes the module 58 for the detection of the Tone B.
- the answer modem then proceeds to post-process the results of the L1 and L2 echo analysis and performs the NLD (non-linear distortion) measurements, determines the tentative TX preemphasis and the transmitter power level based on the echo measurements 1126. It then waits for the detection of Tone B from the call modem (instruction block 1128).
- NLD non-linear distortion
- the answer modem Upon detection of Tone B from the call modem, the answer modem completes the instructions of block 1130 by disabling the chirp generator 28 and controls the tone generator 26, switch SW1 and transmitter 34 to commence transmission of the Tone A for 50 ms. and continues to transmit Tone A phase reversal for 10 ms .
- the answer modem initializes its phase reversal detector to detect Tone B phase reversal using module 58.
- the controller 20 in response to the instructions of block 1026 transmits Tone B and initializes the module 58 for the detection of Tone A (block 1026) and then post-processes L1 and L2 receiver results, performs NLD estimation, determines the preemphasis index and the transmitter power level based on the receiver analysis (block 1028).
- Tone A the call modem then initializes block 58 to detect Tone A phase reversal in block 1032. During this time, the call modem continues transmission of Tone B.
- the controller 20 of the call modem Upon detection of the Tone A phase reversal by the module 58, in instructional block 1034 the controller 20 of the call modem terminates the transmission of Tone B and transmits Tone B phase reversal for 10 ms and initializes the echo and received signal analyzer for performing echo analysis according to instruction block 1036 by controlling the tone generator 26, switch SW1 and transmitter 34.
- Tone B phase reversal by the answer modem causes the receiver 60 thereof to stop the counter 74, and the controller 20 to initialize the echo and received signal analyzer 80 thereof to perform a channel estimation based on the received line probing chirp signal (block 1134).
- the controller 20 of the call modem initializes its echo and received signal analyzer to perform an estimation of channel characteristics based on received echo signal or signals.
- this channel estimation line probing procedure takes approximately 160 ms for processing L1 and ⁇ 500 ms + one round trip delay to process L2 .
- the same post processing (1140, 1042) is done as described supra in blocks 1028 and 1126 except the context of the signals is reversed (1044, 1046, 1048).
- the selected carrier frequency, symbol rate, transmitter preemphasis, transmitter power level and data bit rate of each of the call and answer modems are provided to their respective controller 20 which in turn selects and enables the respective Info x generator 24 to generate the learned information in packets or frames to the other modem via switch SW1 and transmitter 34 as recommended by ITU-T recommendation V 0.34.
- a 600 symbol DPSK modulation scheme is used to exchange the communication parameter information between the call and answer modems.
- a carrier frequency of 1200 Hz is used for DPSK transmission as recommended by ITU-T V 0.34 recommendation.
- the answer modem After post-processing the received signal-based results, the answer modem transmits Tone A and initializes its receiver block 62 to receive the INFO 1c information (block 1142) Concurrently, the call modem waits to detect Tone A, and after the detection of Tone A (block 1044), the modem waits for the duration of one round trip delay and transmits INFO 1c .
- the instructions of block 1146 are then executed, instructing the controller 20 to cease transmitting Tone A and start to transmit the INFO 1a 902.
- the final decision of the transmitter preemphasis filter selection and the transmitter power level is determined by combining the results obtained in block 1126 with the request from the call modem sent in INFO 1c .
- the answer modem ceases to transmit INFO 1a and goes to an idle state for approximately 20 predetermined periods (20T) and then changes its carrier frequency and symbol rate, transmitter preemphasis and transmitter power level to the one recommended by the preceding procedure (block 1148).
- the call modem After the reception of InfO 1a the call modem makes the final decision of the transmitter preemphasis filter selection and the transmitter power level by combining the results obtained in block 1042 with the request from the answer modem sent in INFO 1a and goes to an idle state for approximately 20T and then changes its carrier frequency and symbol rate, transmitter preemphasis filter and transmitter power level to the one recommended by the preceding procedure (block 1050).
- the modems then proceed to execute the next steps 1052, 1150 respectively.
- the next portion of the start up procedure (see FIG. 9) is a training sequence for training the receiver and echo canceller of each of the call and answer modems.
- This training sequence is considered well-known and is outlined in the ITU-T V 0.34 specifications and not considered in any way a part of the present invention, except that the training sequences are performed based on the recommended carrier frequency and symbol rate transmit preemphasis filter and at the recommended transmitter power level learned from the preceding portion of the start up procedure described in connection with FIG. 8. Thus, this procedure will not be described here.
- the procedure is primarily that currently being used in the modem 3260 fast marketed by Motorola, Inc./Codex Corporation. Portions of the procedure are also described in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,569 issued Jan. 22, 1991 and assigned to the same assignee as the present application.
