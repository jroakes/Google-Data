Definitions
- Some computing devices may provide a graphical keyboard as part of a graphical user interface (“GUI”) for composing text using a presence-sensitive display (e.g., a touchscreen).
- GUI graphical user interface
- the graphical keyboard may enable a user of the computing device to enter text (e.g., to compose an e-mail, a text message, a document, etc.).
- a presence-sensitive display of a computing device may present a graphical (or “soft”) keyboard that enables the user to enter data by indicating (e.g., by tapping or swiping across) keys displayed at the presence-sensitive display.
- some computing devices may provide word suggestions or spelling and grammar corrections in a suggestion region of the graphical keyboard that is separate from the area of the display in which the graphical keys of the keyboard are displayed.
- a given set of word suggestions may not be useful or relevant. If a given one of the suggested words is in fact useful or relevant, a user may be required to cease typing at the keys of the graphical keyboard, review the suggested words, and then provide additional input at the suggestion region to select the given the suggested word. This sequence of steps thereby results in a degree of inefficiency during user entry of text via a presence-sensitive display.
- a method includes outputting, by a computing device, for display, a graphical keyboard including a plurality of keys, determining, by the computing device, at least one candidate word that includes the first character, and determining, by the computing device, a score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being entered by one or more subsequent selections of one or more of the plurality of keys.
- the plurality of keys includes a first key that is associated with a first character.
- the method further includes, responsive to determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies a threshold, determining, by the computing device, based on a spelling of the at least one candidate word, a second character of the at least one candidate word and outputting, by the computing device, for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character.
- the second character immediately follows the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word.
- a device in another example, includes a presence-sensitive display, at least one processor, and a memory.
- the graphical keyboard includes a plurality of keys.
- the plurality of keys include a first key that is associated with a first character.
- the memory stores instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to output, for display at the presence-sensitive display, a graphical keyboard, determine at least one candidate word that includes the first character, and determine a score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being entered by one or more subsequent selections of one or more of the plurality of keys.
- the memory stores instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, further cause the at least one processor to, responsive to determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies a threshold, determine, based on a spelling of the at least one candidate word, a second character of the at least one candidate word, and output, for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character.
- the second character immediately follows the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word.
- a computer-readable storage medium is encoded with instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor of a computing device to output, for display, a graphical keyboard, determine at least one candidate word that includes the first character, and determine a score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being entered by one or more subsequent selections of one or more of the plurality of keys.
- the instructions when executed, further cause the at least one processor to, responsive to determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies a threshold, determine, based on a spelling of the at least one candidate word, a second character of the at least one candidate word, and output, for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character.
- the second character immediately follows the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word.
- FIGS. 1A-1C are conceptual diagrams illustrating an example computing device that may be used to predict next letters and display them within keys of a graphical keyboard, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating further details of one example of a computing device as shown in FIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 3 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example computing device that outputs graphical content for display at a remote device, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- FIGS. 4A-4B are conceptual diagrams illustrating further details of a first example of a computing device shown in FIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- FIGS. 5A-5B are conceptual diagrams illustrating further details of a second example of a computing device shown in FIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- FIGS. 6A-6B are conceptual diagrams illustrating further details of a third example of a computing device shown in FIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations of an example computing device configured to predict next letters and display them within keys of a graphical keyboard, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.
- this disclosure is directed to techniques for enabling a computing device to display, within a single key of a graphical keyboard, two or more next letters that the device predicts will be selected from a subsequent input at the graphical keyboard.
- the computing device may display selectable parts of suggested words (e.g., two or more letters) within the keys that the user is already providing input. For instance, an example computing device may display within a first key of a graphical keyboard, a letter that is typically associated with the first key, along with a next letter that is typically associated with a different key that is predicted to be selected after selecting the first key.
- the computing device may determine a selection of both letters being displayed within the first key. For example, to spell the word “That” the computing device may receive a first user input selecting “Th” and a second user input selecting “at” rather than four independent user inputs that spell each letter of the word “that.”
- the computing device may display two or more next letters of one or more suggested words within individual keys of the graphical keyboard.
- an example computing device may provide more useful and relevant suggestions to a user because the computing device is more likely to correctly predict one or more next letters that are likely to be selected, rather than predicting all the letters of an entire suggested word.
- a user need not provide input at a separate region of the keyboard that is distinct from the graphical keys, thereby enabling quicker word entry, using fewer inputs.
- techniques of this disclosure may reduce the time a user spends to enter a desired word, which may improve the user experience of a computing device.
- FIGS. 1A-C are conceptual diagrams illustrating an example computing device that may be used to predict next letters and display them within keys of a graphical keyboard, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.

- keyboard module 122 may determine a second character of the at least one candidate word. In some examples, keyboard module 122 may determine the second character of the at least one candidate word based on a spelling of the at least one candidate word. For instance, in response to determining that the candidate word is “that”, keyboard module 122 may determine the first letter to be “t” and the second character to be “h”. More specifically, keyboard module 122 may determine the second character to be the character that immediately follows the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word.
- keyboard module 122 may output, for display within key 126 , a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character.
- keyboard module 122 may send information to UI module 120 that causes PSD 112 to display key 126 as having graphical indication 128 of the first character as the letter ‘t’ and as also having graphical indication 130 of the second character as the letter ‘h.’
- keyboard module 122 may receive an indication of a selection of key 126 .
- keyboard module 122 may receive information from UI module 120 indicating a user has provided user input 140 at or near a location of PSD 112 at which key 126 is displayed.
- keyboard module 122 may determine whether user input 140 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character, for instance, the first character followed by the second character. In the example of FIG.
- keyboard module 122 may determine whether user input 140 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’) or a combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) based on a quantity of taps (e.g., different touch down and touch up events) associated with user input 140 , a swipe direction associated with user input 140 , an amount of pressure associated with user input 140 , or another characteristic or parameter associated with a selection of key 126 .
- a quantity of taps e.g., different touch down and touch up events
- keyboard module 122 may cause UI module 120 to output, for display, the first character (e.g., the letter ‘t’) alone and refrain from outputting the second character (e.g., the letter ‘h’) to PSD 112 .
- first character e.g., the letter ‘t’
- second character e.g., the letter ‘h’
- keyboard module 122 may cause UI module 120 to output, for display, the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) to PSD 112 .
- PSD 112 displays the combination including the first character and the second character as text in edit region 116 C.
- Keyboard module 122 may repeat one or more operations as described above. For example, keyboard module 122 may determine a phrase (e.g., Tha’) based on the previous selection of the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘Th’) as well as the letter associated with key 150 (e.g., ‘a’) and input the phrase into a lexicon and, in response, receive an indication of the word “That.” As shown in FIG.
- a phrase e.g., Tha’
- keyboard module 122 may determine a phrase (e.g., Tha’) based on the previous selection of the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘Th’) as well as the letter associated with key 150 (e.g., ‘a’) and input the phrase into a lexicon and, in response, receive an indication of the word “That.” As shown in FIG.
- keyboard module 122 may cause UI module 120 to display at PSD 112 , and within key 150 , a graphical indication 152 of a character associated with key 150 (e.g., the letter ‘a’) and a graphical indication 154 of a predicted next letter (e.g., the letter ‘t’) that is determined based on the suggested word “that.”
- a graphical indication 152 of a character associated with key 150 e.g., the letter ‘a’
- a graphical indication 154 of a predicted next letter e.g., the letter ‘t’
- keyboard module 122 may cause UI module 120 to output, for display, the combination including the character associated with key 150 and the predicted next letter (e.g., the phrase ‘at) to PSD 112 .
- PSD 112 displays suggested word “that” as text in edit region 116 C.
- an example computing device such as computing device 110 , may provide suggestions that are more useful and relevant since, rather than displaying an entire word, the example computing device displays a portion (e.g., two or more characters) of a suggested word at a time. Moreover, since the example computing device displays of the predicted portion a suggested word within keys of a graphical keyboard, a user of the example computing device may easily find and select predicated letters, rather than requiring the user to navigate away from the keys and wade through a separate suggestion region to search for and select a desired word. In this way, techniques of this disclosure may improve a user experience with the example computing device by reducing the amount of time a user is searching for and selecting predicted letters, as well as reducing the number of user inputs required by a computing device to type a word.
- a portion e.g., two or more characters
- any key of graphical keyboard 116 B may substantially apply to any key of graphical keyboard 116 B.

- keyboard module 222 may display, within the key displayed by keyboard module 222 , a letter that immediately follows the character of the key in the spelling of the candidate word or words that are determined by LM module 224 .
- Keyboard module 222 may determine, based on a user input selecting the key displayed by keyboard module 222 , whether to output just the character of the key displayed by keyboard module 222 , or whether to output the character of the key in addition to the letter that immediately follows the character of the key in the spelling of the candidate word. For example, keyboard module 222 may determine whether to output both the character of the key displayed by keyboard module 222 and the letter that immediately follows the character of the key in the spelling of the candidate word, based on a comparison between an amount of pressure, detected by PSD 212 , applied during the user input and one or more pressure thresholds that are stored by threshold data stores 234 B.
- keyboard module 222 may determine whether to output both the character of the key displayed by keyboard module 222 and the letter that immediately follows the character of the key in the spelling of the candidate word, based on a swipe gesture, detected by PSD 212 , during the user input. Any other combination of the language and spatial information may also be used, including machine learned functions for determining whether a user input corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character. In this way, a computing device that operates in accordance with the described techniques may provide suggestions that are more useful and relevant since the example computing device displays two or more characters of a suggested word at a time, rather than the entire word.

Abstract
A computing device is described that outputs, for display, a graphical keyboard including a set of keys. The set of keys includes a first key that is associated with a first character. The computing device determines a candidate word that includes the first character and determines a score associated with the candidate word that indicates a probability of the candidate word being entered by one or more subsequent selections of one or more of the set of keys. In response to determining that the score associated with the candidate word satisfies a threshold, the computing device determines, based on a spelling of the candidate word, a second character of the candidate word and outputs, for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character.
Description
- Some computing devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablet computers, etc.) may provide a graphical keyboard as part of a graphical user interface (“GUI”) for composing text using a presence-sensitive display (e.g., a touchscreen). The graphical keyboard may enable a user of the computing device to enter text (e.g., to compose an e-mail, a text message, a document, etc.). For instance, a presence-sensitive display of a computing device may present a graphical (or “soft”) keyboard that enables the user to enter data by indicating (e.g., by tapping or swiping across) keys displayed at the presence-sensitive display. To assist a user in providing text entry at a graphical keyboard, some computing devices may provide word suggestions or spelling and grammar corrections in a suggestion region of the graphical keyboard that is separate from the area of the display in which the graphical keys of the keyboard are displayed. In some instances, a given set of word suggestions may not be useful or relevant. If a given one of the suggested words is in fact useful or relevant, a user may be required to cease typing at the keys of the graphical keyboard, review the suggested words, and then provide additional input at the suggestion region to select the given the suggested word. This sequence of steps thereby results in a degree of inefficiency during user entry of text via a presence-sensitive display.
- In one example, a method includes outputting, by a computing device, for display, a graphical keyboard including a plurality of keys, determining, by the computing device, at least one candidate word that includes the first character, and determining, by the computing device, a score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being entered by one or more subsequent selections of one or more of the plurality of keys. The plurality of keys includes a first key that is associated with a first character. The method further includes, responsive to determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies a threshold, determining, by the computing device, based on a spelling of the at least one candidate word, a second character of the at least one candidate word and outputting, by the computing device, for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character. The second character immediately follows the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word.
- In another example, a device includes a presence-sensitive display, at least one processor, and a memory. The graphical keyboard includes a plurality of keys. The plurality of keys include a first key that is associated with a first character. The memory stores instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to output, for display at the presence-sensitive display, a graphical keyboard, determine at least one candidate word that includes the first character, and determine a score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being entered by one or more subsequent selections of one or more of the plurality of keys. The memory stores instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, further cause the at least one processor to, responsive to determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies a threshold, determine, based on a spelling of the at least one candidate word, a second character of the at least one candidate word, and output, for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character. The second character immediately follows the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word.
- In another example, a computer-readable storage medium is encoded with instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor of a computing device to output, for display, a graphical keyboard, determine at least one candidate word that includes the first character, and determine a score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being entered by one or more subsequent selections of one or more of the plurality of keys. The instructions, when executed, further cause the at least one processor to, responsive to determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies a threshold, determine, based on a spelling of the at least one candidate word, a second character of the at least one candidate word, and output, for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character. The second character immediately follows the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word.
- The details of one or more examples of the disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

FIGS. 5A-5B are conceptual diagrams illustrating further details of a second example of a computing device shown inFIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. -
FIGS. 6A-6B are conceptual diagrams illustrating further details of a third example of a computing device shown inFIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. -
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations of an example computing device configured to predict next letters and display them within keys of a graphical keyboard, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. - In general, this disclosure is directed to techniques for enabling a computing device to display, within a single key of a graphical keyboard, two or more next letters that the device predicts will be selected from a subsequent input at the graphical keyboard. In other words, the computing device may display selectable parts of suggested words (e.g., two or more letters) within the keys that the user is already providing input. For instance, an example computing device may display within a first key of a graphical keyboard, a letter that is typically associated with the first key, along with a next letter that is typically associated with a different key that is predicted to be selected after selecting the first key. In response to receiving an indication of a selection of the first key, the computing device may determine a selection of both letters being displayed within the first key. For example, to spell the word “That” the computing device may receive a first user input selecting “Th” and a second user input selecting “at” rather than four independent user inputs that spell each letter of the word “that.”
- Rather than requiring the user to search through, and provide inputs to select whole suggested words that are displayed within a separate suggestion region of the graphical keyboard, the computing device may display two or more next letters of one or more suggested words within individual keys of the graphical keyboard. By displaying parts of suggested words, as opposed to whole suggested words, within the keys of a graphical keyboard, an example computing device may provide more useful and relevant suggestions to a user because the computing device is more likely to correctly predict one or more next letters that are likely to be selected, rather than predicting all the letters of an entire suggested word. In addition, by providing a graphical keyboard with next letter prediction, entirely within the keys of the graphical keyboard, a user need not provide input at a separate region of the keyboard that is distinct from the graphical keys, thereby enabling quicker word entry, using fewer inputs. In this way, techniques of this disclosure may reduce the time a user spends to enter a desired word, which may improve the user experience of a computing device.

FIGS. 1A-C are conceptual diagrams illustrating an example computing device that may be used to predict next letters and display them within keys of a graphical keyboard, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.Computing device 110 may represent a mobile device, such as a smart phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, computerized watch, computerized eyewear, computerized gloves, or any other type of portable computing device. Additional examples ofcomputing device 110 include desktop computers, televisions, personal digital assistants (PDA), portable gaming systems, media players, e-book readers, mobile television platforms, automobile navigation and entertainment systems, vehicle (e.g., automobile, aircraft, or other vehicle) cockpit displays, or any other types of wearable and non-wearable, mobile or non-mobile computing devices that may output a graphical keyboard for display. -
Computing device 110 includes a presence-sensitive display (PSD) 112, user interface (UI)module 120 andkeyboard module 122.Modules computing device 110. One or more processors ofcomputing device 110 may execute instructions that are stored at a memory or other non-transitory storage medium ofcomputing device 110 to perform the operations ofmodules Computing device 110 may executemodules Modules Modules -
PSD 112 ofcomputing device 110 may function as respective input and/or output devices forcomputing device 110. PSD 112 may be implemented using various technologies. For instance, PSD 112 may function as input devices using presence-sensitive input screens, such as resistive touchscreens, surface acoustic wave touchscreens, capacitive touchscreens, projective capacitance touchscreens, pressure sensitive screens, acoustic pulse recognition touchscreens, or another presence-sensitive display technology. PSD 112 may also function as output (e.g., display) devices using any one or more display devices, such as liquid crystal displays (LCD), dot matrix displays, light emitting diode (LED) displays, organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, e-ink, or similar monochrome or color displays capable of outputting visible information to a user ofcomputing device 110. -
PSD 112 may detect input (e.g., touch and non-touch input) from a user ofrespective computing device 110.PSD 112 may detect indications of input by detecting one or more gestures from a user (e.g., the user touching, pointing, and/or swiping at or near one or more locations ofPSD 112 with a finger or a stylus pen).PSD 112 may output information to a user in the form of user interface (e.g., user interface 114), which may be associated with functionality provided bycomputing device 110. Such user interfaces may be associated with computing platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing at or accessible from computing device 110 (e.g., electronic message applications, chat applications, Internet browser applications, mobile or desktop operating systems, social media applications, electronic games, and other types of applications). For example,PSD 112 may presentuser interface 114 which, as shown inFIGS. 1A -IC, may be a graphical user interfaces of a chat application executing atcomputing device 110 and includes various graphical elements displayed at various locations ofPSD 112. - As shown in
FIGS. 1A-C ,user interface 114 is part of a chat user interface, howeveruser interface 114 may be any graphical user interface which includes a graphical keyboard.User interface 114 includesoutput region 116A,graphical keyboard 116B, editregion 116C, andsuggestion region 116D. A user ofcomputing device 110 may provide input atgraphical keyboard 116B to produce textual characters withinedit region 116C that form the content of the electronic messages displayed withinoutput region 116A. The messages displayed withinoutput region 116A form a chat conversation between a user ofcomputing device 110 and a user of a different computing device. -
UI module 120 manages user interactions withPSD 112 and other components ofcomputing device 110. In other words,UI module 120 may act as an intermediary between various components ofcomputing device 110 to make determinations based on user input detected byPSD 112 and generate output atPSD 112 in response to the user input.UI module 120 may receive instructions from an application, service, platform, or other module ofcomputing device 110 to causePSD 112 to output a user interface (e.g., user interface 114).UI module 120 may manage inputs received by computingdevice 110 as a user views and interacts with the user interface presented atPSD 112 and update the user interface in response to receiving additional instructions from the application, service, platform, or other module ofcomputing device 110 that is processing the user input. -
Keyboard module 122 ofcomputing device 110 may perform traditional, graphical keyboard operations used for text-entry, such as: generating a graphical keyboard layout for display atPSD 112, mapping detected inputs atPSD 112 to selections of keys, determining characters based on selected keys, or predicting or autocorrecting words and/or phrases based on the characters determined from selected keys.Keyboard module 122 may be a stand-alone application, service, or module executing atcomputing device 110 and in other examples,keyboard module 122 may be a sub-component thereof. For example,keyboard module 122 may be integrated into a chat or messaging application executing atcomputing device 110 whereas in other examples,keyboard module 122 may be a stand-alone application or subroutine that is invoked by an application or operating platform ofcomputing device 110 any time an application or operating platform requires graphical keyboard input functionality. In some examples,computing device 110 may download and installkeyboard module 122 from an application repository of a service provider (e.g., via the Internet). In other examples,keyboard module 122 may be preloaded during production ofcomputing device 110. -
Graphical keyboard 116B includesgraphical keys 118 and suggested words displayed insuggestion region 116D. Suggested words displayed insuggestion region 116D may be determined by computingdevice 110 based on a history log, lexicon, or the like. Each one ofkeys 118 may typically represent a single character from a character set (e.g., letters of the English alphabet, Arabic numerals, symbols, emoticons, emoji, or the like). As shown inFIG. 1A ,graphical keyboard 116B may include a traditional “QWERTY” keyboard layout. Other examples may contain characters for different languages, different character sets, or different character layouts. In some examples,graphical keyboard 116B may include each letter in an alphabet of a selected language. For instance, as shown,graphical keyboard 116B includes 26 letters for the English language. In some examples, graphical keyboard 116 may include a partial set of letters. As shown,graphical keyboard 116B may include uppercase selector key 124 that changes a case of letters displayed ingraphical keyboard 116B. In some examples,graphical keyboard 116B may include one or more keys that changekeys 118 displayed ingraphical keyboard 116B. For instance,graphical keyboard 116B may include numeric key 125 that when selected may causegraphical keyboard 116B to display numbers rather than letters. -
Keyboard module 122 may output information toUI module 120 that specifies the layout ofgraphical keyboard 116B withinuser interface 114. For example, the information may include instructions that specify locations, sizes, colors, and other characteristics ofkeys 118. Based on the information received fromkeyboard module 122,UI module 120 may causePSD 112 to displaygraphical keyboard 116B as part ofuser interface 114. - At least some of
keys 118 may be associated with individual characters (e.g., a letter, number, punctuation, or other character). A user ofcomputing device 110 may provide input at locations ofPSD 112 at which one or more ofkeys 118 are displayed to input content (e.g., characters, etc.) intoedit region 116C (e.g., for composing messages that are sent and displayed withinoutput region 116A).Keyboard module 122 may receive information fromUI module 120 indicating locations associated with input detected byPSD 112 that are relative to the locations of each of the keys. Using a spatial and/or language model,keyboard module 122 may translate the inputs to selections of keys and characters, words, phrases, or other phrases. - For example,
PSD 112 may detect user inputs as a user ofcomputing device 110 provides user inputs at or near a location ofPSD 112 wherePSD 112 presentskeys 118.UI module 120 may receive, fromPSD 112, an indication of the user input atPSD 112 and output, tokeyboard module 122, information about the user input. Information about the user input may include an indication of one or more touch events (e.g., locations and other information about the input) detected byPSD 112. - Based on the information received
form UI module 120,keyboard module 122 may map detected inputs atPSD 112 to selections ofkeys 118, determine characters based on selectedkeys 118, and predict or autocorrect words and/or phrases determined based on the characters associated with the selectedkeys 118. For example,keyboard module 122 may include a spatial model that may determine, based on the locations ofkeys 118 and the information about the input, the most likely one ormore keys 118 being selected. Responsive to determining the most likely one ormore keys 118 being selected,keyboard module 122 may determine one or more characters, words, and/or phrases. For example, each of the one ormore keys 118 being selected from a user input atPSD 112 may represent either an individual character or a combination including the character associated with the key and a second character of a candidate word.Keyboard module 122 may determine a sequence of characters selected based on the one or moreselected keys 118. In some examples,keyboard module 122 may apply a language model to the sequence of characters to determine one or more the most likely candidate letters, morphemes, words, and/or phrases that a user is trying to input based on the selection ofkeys 118. -
Keyboard module 122 may send the sequence of characters and/or candidate words and phrases toUI module 120 andUI module 120 may causePSD 112 to present the characters and/or candidate words determined from a selection of one ormore keys 118 as text withinedit region 116C. In some examples, when functioning as a traditional keyboard for performing text-entry operations, and in response to receiving a user input at keys 118 (e.g., as a user is typing atgraphical keyboard 116B to enter text withinedit region 116C),keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to display the candidate words as one or more selectable suggestions withinsuggestion region 116D. A user can select an individual suggestion withinsuggestion region 116D rather than type all the individual character keys ofkeys 118. - Rather than simply displaying word suggestions within
edit region 116C orsuggestion region 116D,keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to display predicted next letters that are likely to be selected from future user input within the graphical representations of one or more ofkeys 118. For example,keyboard module 122 may output, for display,graphical keyboard 116B which, as shown inFIG. 1A , includes key 126 that is associated with a first character (e.g., ‘t’) as one ofkeys 118. -
Keyboard module 122 may determine (e.g., from a lexicon) at least one candidate word or words that include the first character associated withkey 126. For example,keyboard module 122 may input the first character into a lexicon and in response, receive an indication of one or more candidate characters, words, or phrases thatkeyboard module 122 identifies from the lexicon as being potential words that include the first character. For instance, responsive to inputting the first character (e.g., ‘t’) that is associated withkey 126 into the lexicon,keyboard module 122 may receive, from the lexicon, an indication of the words “This,” “The,” and “That.” - In response to determining the at least one candidate word that includes the first character,
keyboard module 122 may determine a score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being selected during a subsequent selection of one or more ofkeys 118. For example,keyboard module 122 may assign a language model probability or a similarity coefficient (e.g., a Jaccard similarity coefficient) to the one or more candidate words, received from the lexicon ofcomputing device 110, that include the first character as the next inputted character. In some examples,keyboard module 122 may compute the score of each candidate word using a language model. And in some examples,keyboard module 122 may receive an indication of the score associated with each candidate word from the lexicon. In any case, the score or language model probability assigned to each of the one or more candidate words may indicate a degree of certainty or a degree of likelihood that the candidate word is typically found positioned subsequent to, prior to, and/or within, a sequence of words (e.g., a sentence) generated from text input detected byPSD 112. - In response to determining the score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being selected during a subsequent selection of one or more of
keys 118,keyboard module 122 may determine whether the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies a threshold. The threshold may be a predetermined value selected by a manufacturer ofcomputing device 110, by a designer ofUI module 120, by a designer ofkeyboard module 122, by a user ofcomputing device 110, or selected by another person. In some examples, the threshold may be computed. For instance, the threshold may be computed by computingdevice 110 based on a history log of user interactions withcomputing device 110. - In response to determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word does not satisfy the threshold,
keyboard module 122 may output, for display withinkey 126, a graphical indication of the first character and refrain from outputting a graphical indication of a second character. For instance,keyboard module 122 may send information toUI module 120 that causesPSD 112 to display key 126 as havinggraphical indication 128 of the first character as the letter ‘t’ and to refrain from outputtinggraphical indication 130 of the second character as the letter ‘h.’ - In response to determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies the threshold,
keyboard module 122 may determine a second character of the at least one candidate word. In some examples,keyboard module 122 may determine the second character of the at least one candidate word based on a spelling of the at least one candidate word. For instance, in response to determining that the candidate word is “that”,keyboard module 122 may determine the first letter to be “t” and the second character to be “h”. More specifically,keyboard module 122 may determine the second character to be the character that immediately follows the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word. - In response to determining the second character of the at least one candidate word,
keyboard module 122 may output, for display withinkey 126, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character. In the example ofFIG. 1A ,keyboard module 122 may send information toUI module 120 that causesPSD 112 to display key 126 as havinggraphical indication 128 of the first character as the letter ‘t’ and as also havinggraphical indication 130 of the second character as the letter ‘h.’ - After outputting the
graphical indication 128 of the first character and thegraphical indication 130 of the second character,keyboard module 122 may receive an indication of a selection ofkey 126. For example,keyboard module 122 may receive information fromUI module 120 indicating a user has provided user input 140 at or near a location ofPSD 112 at whichkey 126 is displayed. - In response to receiving an indication of user input 140,
keyboard module 122 may determine whether user input 140 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character, for instance, the first character followed by the second character. In the example ofFIG. 1B ,keyboard module 122 may determine whether user input 140 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’) or a combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) based on a quantity of taps (e.g., different touch down and touch up events) associated with user input 140, a swipe direction associated with user input 140, an amount of pressure associated with user input 140, or another characteristic or parameter associated with a selection ofkey 126. - In response to determining user input 140 does not correspond to a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character,
keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display, the first character (e.g., the letter ‘t’) alone and refrain from outputting the second character (e.g., the letter ‘h’) toPSD 112. - In response to determining user input 140 corresponds to a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character,
keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display, the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) toPSD 112. As shown inFIG. 1B , in response,PSD 112 displays the combination including the first character and the second character as text inedit region 116C. -
Keyboard module 122 may repeat one or more operations as described above. For example,keyboard module 122 may determine a phrase (e.g., Tha’) based on the previous selection of the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘Th’) as well as the letter associated with key 150 (e.g., ‘a’) and input the phrase into a lexicon and, in response, receive an indication of the word “That.” As shown inFIG. 1C ,keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to display atPSD 112, and withinkey 150, agraphical indication 152 of a character associated with key 150 (e.g., the letter ‘a’) and agraphical indication 154 of a predicted next letter (e.g., the letter ‘t’) that is determined based on the suggested word “that.” - In response to
keyboard module 122 determining thatuser input 150 corresponds to the combination including the character associated withkey 150 and the predicted next letter,keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display, the combination including the character associated withkey 150 and the predicted next letter (e.g., the phrase ‘at) toPSD 112. As shown inFIG. 1C , in response,PSD 112 displays suggested word “that” as text inedit region 116C. - By displaying predicted next letters within keys of a graphical keyboard, an example computing device, such as
computing device 110, may provide suggestions that are more useful and relevant since, rather than displaying an entire word, the example computing device displays a portion (e.g., two or more characters) of a suggested word at a time. Moreover, since the example computing device displays of the predicted portion a suggested word within keys of a graphical keyboard, a user of the example computing device may easily find and select predicated letters, rather than requiring the user to navigate away from the keys and wade through a separate suggestion region to search for and select a desired word. In this way, techniques of this disclosure may improve a user experience with the example computing device by reducing the amount of time a user is searching for and selecting predicted letters, as well as reducing the number of user inputs required by a computing device to type a word. - Although the previous examples applied to the A key and the T key, such examples may substantially apply to any key of
graphical keyboard 116B. Further, although the examples shown inFIGS. 1A-C , describe techniques that are applied to a single key at a time (e.g., key 126 inFIG. 1B , key 150 inFIG. 1C ), such examples may be substantially applied simultaneously onmultiple keys 118 ofgraphical keyboard 116B. Additionally, although the previous examples showPSD 112 displaying graphical indications of a predicted next letter in an upper right region of a key, the predicted next letters may be positioned in any suitable region within a key, for instance, in the lower left corner, upper left corner, lower right corner, or another region within a key. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating further details of one example ofcomputing device 110 as shown inFIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure.Computing device 200 ofFIG. 2 is described below within the context ofcomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1A .Computing device 200 ofFIG. 2 in some examples represents an example ofcomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1A .FIG. 2 illustrates only one particular example ofcomputing device 200, and many other examples ofcomputing device 200 may be used in other instances and may include a subset of the components included inexample computing device 200 or may include additional components not shown inFIG. 2 . - As shown in the example of
FIG. 2 ,computing device 200 includes presence-sensitive display 212, one ormore processors 240, one ormore input components 242, one ormore communication units 244, one ormore output components 246, and one ormore storage components 248.

Additionally,storage components 248 are configured to storelexicon data stores 234A andthreshold data stores 234B. Collectively,data stores -
Communication channels 250 may interconnect each of thecomponents communication channels 250 may include a system bus, a network connection, an inter-process communication data structure, or any other method for communicating data. - One or
more input components 242 ofcomputing device 200 may receive input. Examples of input are tactile, audio, image and video input.Input components 242 ofcomputing device 200, in one example, includes a presence-sensitive display, touch-sensitive screen, mouse, keyboard, voice responsive system, a microphone or any other type of device for detecting input from a human or machine. In some examples,input components 242 include one or more sensor components such as one or more location sensors (GPS components, Wi-Fi components, cellular components), one or more temperature sensors, one or more movement sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyros), one or more pressure sensors (e.g., barometer), one or more ambient light sensors, and one or more other sensors (e.g., microphone, a still camera, a video camera, a body camera, eyewear, or other camera device that is operatively coupled tocomputing device 200, infrared proximity sensor, hygrometer, and the like). - One or
more output components 246 ofcomputing device 200 may generate output. Examples of output are tactile, audio, still image and video output.Output components 246 ofcomputing device 200, in one example, includes a presence-sensitive display, sound card, video graphics adapter card, speaker, cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, liquid crystal display (LCD), or any other type of device for generating output to a human or machine. - One or
more communication units 244 ofcomputing device 200 may communicate with external devices via one or more wired and/or wireless networks by transmitting and/or receiving network signals on the one or more networks. For example,communication units 244 may be configured to communicate over a network with a remote computing system for displaying parts of suggested words within the keys of a graphical keyboard.Modules 220 and/or 222 may receive, viacommunication units 244, from the remote computing system, an indication of a character sequence in response to outputting, viacommunication unit 244, for transmission to the remote computing system, an indication of a sequence of touch events. Examples ofcommunication unit 244 include a network interface card (e.g. such as an Ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a GPS receiver, or any other type of device that can send and/or receive information. Other examples ofcommunication units 244 may include short wave radios, cellular data radios, wireless network radios, as well as universal serial bus (USB) controllers. - Presence-
sensitive display 212 ofcomputing device 200 includesdisplay component 202 and presence-sensitive input component 204.Display component 202 may be a screen at which information is displayed by presence-sensitive display 212 and presence-sensitive input component 204 may detect an object at and/ornear display component 202. As one example range, presence-sensitive input component 204 may detect an object, such as a finger or stylus that is within two inches or less ofdisplay component 202. Presence-sensitive input component 204 may determine a location (e.g., an [x, y] coordinate) ofdisplay component 202 at which the object was detected. In another example range, presence-sensitive input component 204 may detect an object six inches or less fromdisplay component 202 and other ranges are also possible. Presence-sensitive input component 204 may determine the location ofdisplay component 202 selected by a user's finger using capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques. In some examples, presence-sensitive input component 204 also provides output to a user using tactile, audio, or video stimuli as described with respect to displaycomponent 202. In the example ofFIG. 2 , presence-sensitive display 212 may present a user interface (such as a graphical user interface for displaying parts of suggested words within the keys of a graphical keyboard as shown inFIGS. 1A-C ). - While illustrated as an internal component of
computing device 200, presence-sensitive display 212 may also represent and an external component that shares a data path withcomputing device 200 for transmitting and/or receiving input and output. For instance, in one example, presence-sensitive display 212 represents a built-in component ofcomputing device 200 located within and physically connected to the external packaging of computing device 200 (e.g., a screen on a mobile phone). In another example, presence-sensitive display 212 represents an external component ofcomputing device 200 located outside and physically separated from the packaging or housing of computing device 200 (e.g., a monitor, a projector, etc. that shares a wired and/or wireless data path with computing device 200). - Presence-
sensitive display 212 ofcomputing device 200 may receive tactile input from a user ofcomputing device 200. Presence-sensitive display 212 may receive indications of the tactile input by detecting one or more tap or non-tap gestures from a user of computing device 200 (e.g., the user touching or pointing to one or more locations of presence-sensitive display 212 with a finger or a stylus pen). Presence-sensitive display 212 may present output to a user. Presence-sensitive display 212 may present the output as a graphical user interface (e.g., edit region of 116C ofFIGS. 1A-C ), which may be associated with functionality provided by various functionality ofcomputing device 200. For example, presence-sensitive display 212 may present various user interfaces of components of a computing platform, operating system, applications, or services executing at or accessible by computing device 200 (e.g., an electronic message application, a navigation application, an Internet browser application, a mobile operating system, etc.). A user may interact with a respective user interface to causecomputing device 200 to perform operations relating to one or more the various functions. For example,UI module 220 may cause presence-sensitive display 212 to present a graphical user interface associated with a text input function ofcomputing device 200. The user ofcomputing device 200 may view output presented as feedback associated with the text input function and provide input to presence-sensitive display 212 to compose additional text using the text input function. - Presence-
sensitive display 212 ofcomputing device 200 may detect two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional gestures as input from a user ofcomputing device 200. For instance, a sensor of presence-sensitive display 212 may detect a user's movement (e.g., moving a hand, an arm, a pen, a stylus, etc.) within a threshold distance of the sensor of presence-sensitive display 212. Presence-sensitive display 212 may determine a two or three dimensional vector representation of the movement and correlate the vector representation to a gesture input (e.g., a hand-wave, a pinch, a clap, a pen stroke, etc.) that has multiple dimensions. In other words, presence-sensitive display 212 can detect a multi-dimension gesture without requiring the user to gesture at or near a screen or surface at which presence-sensitive display 212 outputs information for display. Instead, presence-sensitive display 212 can detect a multi-dimensional gesture performed at or near a sensor which may or may not be located near the screen or surface at which presence-sensitive display 212 outputs information for display. - One or
more processors 240 may implement functionality and/or execute instructions associated withcomputing device 200. Examples ofprocessors 240 include application processors, display controllers, auxiliary processors, one or more sensor hubs, and any other hardware configure to function as a processor, a processing unit, or a processing device.Modules processors 240 to perform various actions, operations, or functions ofcomputing device 200. For example,processors 240 ofcomputing device 200 may retrieve and execute instructions stored bystorage components 248 that causeprocessors 240 to perform theoperations modules processors 240, may causecomputing device 200 to store information withinstorage components 248. - One or
more storage components 248 withincomputing device 200 may store information for processing during operation of computing device 200 (e.g.,computing device 200 may store data accessed bymodules storage component 248 is a temporary memory, meaning that a primary purpose ofstorage component 248 is not long-term storage.Storage components 248 oncomputing device 200 may be configured for short-term storage of information as volatile memory and therefore not retain stored contents if powered off. Examples of volatile memories include random access memories (RAM), dynamic random access memories (DRAM), static random access memories (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memories known in the art. -
Storage components 248, in some examples, also include one or more computer-readable storage media.Storage components 248 in some examples include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums.Storage components 248 may be configured to store larger amounts of information than typically stored by volatile memory.Storage components 248 may further be configured for long-term storage of information as non-volatile memory space and retain information after power on/off cycles. Examples of non-volatile memories include magnetic hard discs, optical discs, floppy discs, flash memories, or forms of electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable (EEPROM) memories.Storage components 248 may store program instructions and/or information (e.g., data) associated withmodules Storage components 248 may include a memory configured to store data or other information associated withmodules -
UI module 220 is analogous to and may include all functionality ofUI module 120 ofcomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1 . In addition,UI module 220 includes text-entry module 226 which performs operations for managing a specific type of user interface thatcomputing device 200 provides at presence-sensitive display 212 for handling textual input from a user.UI module 220 and text-entry module 226 may send information overcommunication channels 250 that causedisplay component 202 of presence-sensitive display 212 to present a graphical keyboard from which a user can provide text input (e.g., a sequence of textual characters) by providing tap and non-tap gestures at presence-sensitive input component 204. -
Keyboard module 222 may include all functionality ofkeyboard module 122 ofcomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1 and may perform similar operations for text-entry.Keyboard module 122 may be a stand-alone application, service (e.g., accessible from a cloud-based remote computing system or server), or module executing atcomputing device 110 and in other examples,keyboard module 122 may be a sub-component thereof. -
Threshold data stores 234B may include one or more distance or spatial based thresholds, probability thresholds, or other values of comparison thatkeyboard module 222 uses to infer whether a selection of a key selects a first character by itself or a combination including the first character and a predicted second character. The thresholds stored atthreshold data stores 234B may be variable thresholds (e.g., based on a function or lookup table) or fixed values (e.g., pre-programmed during production or via an operating platform update). For example,threshold data store 234B may include a first amount of pressure or pressure range and a second amount of pressure or pressure range.Keyboard module 222 may compare a received amount of pressure to each of the first and second thresholds. If the amount of pressure applied satisfies the first threshold (e.g., is within the first pressure range),keyboard module 222 may increase a probability or score of a character sequence that includes only the letter associated with a key. If the amount of pressure applied satisfies the second threshold (e.g., is within the second pressure range),keyboard module 222 may increase the probability or score of the character sequence that includes a combination of the letter associated with a key and a predicted next letter by a second amount that exceeds the first amount. If the amount of pressure applied satisfies neither the first nor the second thresholds (e.g., is outside of the first and second ranges),keyboard module 222 may decrease the probability or score of the character sequence that includes the letter associated with the key. - In another example,
threshold data stores 234B may include a score threshold.Keyboard module 222 may compare a score associated with a candidate word that is determined usingmodules 224 and/ormodules 228 to the score threshold. If the score satisfies (e.g., indicates a score that is more likely than the score threshold),keyboard module 222 may output a character (e.g., a next letter) associated with the candidate word. - In another example,
threshold data stores 234B may include a gesture input timing threshold.Keyboard module 222 may compare a time delay between tap gestures to the gesture input timing threshold. If the time delay between tap gestures satisfies (e.g., is less than),keyboard module 222 may determine that the tap gestures are a single user input. If, however, the time delay between tap gestures does not satisfy (e.g., is greater than),keyboard module 222 may determine that the tap gestures different user inputs. -
SM module 228 may receive a sequence of touch events as input, and output a character or sequence of characters that likely represents the sequence of touch events, along with a degree of certainty or spatial model score indicative of how likely or with what accuracy the sequence of characters define the touch events. In other words,SM module 228 may perform recognition techniques to infer touch events and/or infer touch events as selections or gestures at keys of a graphical keyboard.Keyboard module 222 may use the spatial model score that is output fromSM module 228 in determining a total score for a potential word or words thatmodule 222 outputs in response to text input. -
LM module 224 may receive a sequence of characters as input, and output one or more candidate words or word pairs as character sequences that LMmodule 224 identifies fromlexicon data stores 234A as being potential suggestions for the sequence of characters in a language context (e.g., a sentence in a written language). For example,LM module 224 may assign a language model probability to one or more candidate words or pairs of words located atlexicon data store 234A that include at least some of the same characters as the inputted sequence of characters. The language model probability assigned to each of the one or more candidate words or word pairs indicates a degree of certainty or a degree of likelihood that the candidate word or word pair is typically found positioned subsequent to, prior to, and/or within, a sequence of words (e.g., a sentence) generated from text input detected by presence-sensitive input component 204 prior to and/or subsequent to receiving the current sequence of characters being analyzed byLM module 224. -
Lexicon data stores 234A may include one or more databases (e.g., hash tables, linked lists, sorted arrays, graphs, etc.) that represent dictionaries for one or more written languages. Each dictionary may include a list of words and word combinations within a written language vocabulary (e.g., including grammars, slang, and colloquial word use).LM module 224 ofkeyboard module 222 may perform a lookup inlexicon data stores 234A for a sequence of characters by comparing the portions of the sequence to each of the words inlexicon data stores 234A.LM module 224 may assign a similarity coefficient (e.g., a Jaccard similarity coefficient) to each word inlexicon data stores 234A based on the comparison between the inputted sequence of characters and each word inlexicon data stores 234A, and determine one or more candidate words fromlexicon data store 234A with a greatest similarity coefficient. In other words, the one or more candidate words with the greatest similarity coefficient may at first represent the potential words inlexicon data stores 234A that have spellings that most closely correlate to the spelling of the sequence of characters.LM module 224 may determine one or more candidate words that include parts or all of the characters of the sequence of characters and determine that the one or more candidate words with the highest similarity coefficients represent potential corrected spellings of the sequence of characters. In some examples, the candidate word with the highest similarity coefficient matches a sequence of characters generated from a sequence of touch events. For example, the candidate words for the sequence of characters h-i-t-h-e-r-e may include “hi”, “hit”, “here”, “hi there”, and “hit here”. -
LM module 224 may be an n-gram language model. An n-gram language model may provide a probability distribution for an item xi (letter or word) in a contiguous sequence of items based on the previous items in the sequence (i.e., P(xi|xi−(n−1), . . . , xi−1)) or a probability distribution for the item xi in a contiguous sequence of items based on the subsequent items in the sequence (i.e., P(xi|xi+1, . . . , xi+(n−1))). Similarly, an n-gram language model may provide a probability distribution for an item xi in a contiguous sequence of items based on the previous items in the sequence and the subsequent items in the sequence (i.e., P(xi|xi−(n−1), . . . , xi+(n−1))). For instance, a bigram language model (an n-gram model where n=2), may provide a first probability that the word “there” follows the word “hi” in a sequence (i.e., a sentence) and a different probability that the word “here” follows the word “hit” in a different sentence. A trigram language model (an n-gram model where n=3) may provide a probability that the word “here” succeeds the two words “hey over” in a sequence. - In response to receiving a sequence of characters,
LM module 224 may output the one or more words and word pairs fromlexicon data stores 234A that have the highest similarity coefficients to the sequence and the highest language model scores.Keyboard module 222 may perform further operations to determine which of the highest ranking words or word pairs to output to text-entry module 226 as a character sequence that best represents a sequence of touch events received from text-entry module 226.Keyboard module 222 may combine the language model scores output fromLM module 224 with the spatial model score output fromSM module 228 to derive a total score indicating that the sequence of touch events defined by text input represents each of the highest ranking words or word pairs inlexicon data stores 234A. - To provide suggestions of
keyboard module 222 that are more useful and relevant and to reduce the amount of time a user searches for a key or suggestion to select,modules keyboard module 222 causes to be displayed within a graphical key displayed bykeyboard module 222.Language module 224 may receive, as input, a character of a key displayed bykeyboard module 222, and output a candidate word. The candidate word may represent a character sequence that LMmodule 224 identifies fromlexicon data stores 234A as being a potential suggestion for the inputted character of the key in a language context (e.g., a sentence in a written language). Based onkeyboard module 222 determining that a score, determined bymodules threshold data stores 234B,keyboard module 222 may display, within the key displayed bykeyboard module 222, a letter that immediately follows the character of the key in the spelling of the candidate word or words that are determined byLM module 224. -
Keyboard module 222 may determine, based on a user input selecting the key displayed bykeyboard module 222, whether to output just the character of the key displayed bykeyboard module 222, or whether to output the character of the key in addition to the letter that immediately follows the character of the key in the spelling of the candidate word. For example,keyboard module 222 may determine whether to output both the character of the key displayed bykeyboard module 222 and the letter that immediately follows the character of the key in the spelling of the candidate word, based on a comparison between an amount of pressure, detected byPSD 212, applied during the user input and one or more pressure thresholds that are stored bythreshold data stores 234B. In another example,keyboard module 222 may determine whether to output both the character of the key displayed bykeyboard module 222 and the letter that immediately follows the character of the key in the spelling of the candidate word, based on a swipe gesture, detected byPSD 212, during the user input. Any other combination of the language and spatial information may also be used, including machine learned functions for determining whether a user input corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character. In this way, a computing device that operates in accordance with the described techniques may provide suggestions that are more useful and relevant since the example computing device displays two or more characters of a suggested word at a time, rather than the entire word. -

Graphical content, generally, may include any visual information that may be output for display, such as text, images, a group of moving images, etc. The example shown inFIG. 3 includes acomputing device 300, presence-sensitive display 301,communication unit 310,projector 320,projector screen 322,tablet device 326, andvisual display device 330.

In some examples, presence-sensitive input component 304 may determine one or more user inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) at presence-sensitive display 301 using capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques and send indications of such user input tocomputing device 300 usingcommunication channel 303A. In some examples, presence-sensitive input component 304 may be physically positioned on top ofdisplay component 302 such that, when a user positions an input unit over a graphical element displayed bydisplay component 302, the location at which presence-sensitive input component 304 corresponds to the location ofdisplay component 302 at which the graphical element is displayed. - As shown in

In some examples,projector 320 may determine one or more user inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) at projector screen using optical recognition or other suitable techniques and send indications of such user input using one or more communication units tocomputing device 300. -
Projector screen 322, in some examples, may include a presence-sensitive display 324. Presence-sensitive display 324 may include a subset of functionality or all of the functionality ofUI module 120 as described in this disclosure. In some examples, presence-sensitive display 324 may include additional functionality. Projector screen 322 (e.g., an electronic whiteboard), may receive data fromcomputing device 300 and display the graphical content.

Presence-sensitive displays UI device 120 as described in this disclosure. In some examples, presence-sensitive displays sensitive display 332, for example, may receive data fromcomputing device 300 and display the graphical content. In some examples, presence-sensitive display 332 may determine one or more user inputs (e.g., continuous gestures, multi-touch gestures, single-touch gestures, etc.) at projector screen using capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques and send indications of such user input using one or more communication units tocomputing device 300. - As described above, in some examples,

In this way,computing device 300 may output the graphical content for display at one or more of the remote devices. In some examples, one or more of the remote devices may output the graphical content at a presence-sensitive display that is included in and/or operatively coupled to the respective remote devices. - In some examples,
computing device 300 may not output graphical content at presence-sensitive display 301 that is operatively coupled tocomputing device 300. In other examples,computing device 300 may output graphical content for display at both a presence-sensitive display 301 that is coupled tocomputing device 300 bycommunication channel 303A, and at one or more remote devices. In such examples, the graphical content may be displayed substantially contemporaneously at each respective device. For instance, some delay may be introduced by the communication latency to send the data that includes the graphical content to the remote device. In some examples, graphical content generated by computingdevice 300 and output for display at presence-sensitive display 301 may be different than graphical content display output for display at one or more remote devices. -
Computing device 300 may send and receive data using any suitable communication techniques. For example,computing device 300 may be operatively coupled toexternal network 314 usingnetwork link 312A. Each of the remote devices illustrated inFIG. 3 may be operatively coupled to networkexternal network 314 by one ofrespective network links External network 314 may include network hubs, network switches, network routers, etc., that are operatively inter-coupled thereby providing for the exchange of information betweencomputing device 300 and the remote devices illustrated inFIG. 3 .

FIGS. 4A-4B are conceptual diagrams illustrating further details of a first example ofcomputing device 110 shown inFIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. As shown,PSD 412 may be an example ofPSD 112 ofFIG. 1A . For example,PSD 412 may be included incomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1A andPSD 412 may be used withUI module 120 andkeyboard module 122 as shown inFIG. 1A . As shown,PSD 412 may displayuser interface 414, which may be substantially similar touser interface 114 ofFIG. 1A . For instance,user interface 414 may includeoutput region 416A that is an example ofoutput region 116A ofFIG. 1A ,graphical keyboard 416B that is an example ofgraphical keyboard 116B ofFIG. 1A , editregion 416C that is an example ofedit region 116C ofFIG. 1A , andsuggestion region 416D that is an example ofsuggestion region 116D ofFIG. 1 . - In the example of
FIG. 4A ,PSD 412 receives an indication ofuser input 440 selectingkey 426 ofgraphical keyboard 416B. As shown inFIG. 4A ,user input 440 includes: a first tap gesture at a location ofPSD 412 that is withinkey 426 and substantially over a graphical indication of a first character (e.g., ‘T’), and a second tap gesture at a location ofPSD 412 that is withinkey 426 and substantially over a graphical indication of a second character (e.g., ‘h’). More specifically,PSD 412 may receive an indication ofuser input 440 as a user places a first finger substantially over the graphical indication of the first character (e.g., ‘T’) and a second finger substantially over the graphical indication of the second character (e.g., ‘h’). - Although
FIG. 4A shows the placement of the first finger withinkey 426 as simultaneous with the placement of the second finger withinkey 426, some examples permitPSD 412 to receive an indication of user input as a user provides multiple tap gestures that are not simultaneous. For instance,PSD 412 and/orcomputing device 110 may use a gesture input timing threshold. More specifically,keyboard module 122 ofcomputing device 110 may determine that a first gesture and a second gesture form a single user input when a time difference or delay between the first gesture and the second gesture satisfies (e.g., is less than) the gesture input timing threshold. - In response to receiving an indication of
user input 440,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 440 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character. For example,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 440 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’) or a combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) based on a quantity of taps (e.g., different touch down and touch up events) associated withuser input 440. More specifically, in response tokeyboard module 122 receiving, fromPSD 412, information indicating thatuser input 440 includes the placement of a first finger withinkey 426 as substantially simultaneous (e.g., within a gesture input timing threshold) with the placement of a second finger withinkey 426,keyboard module 122 may determine thatuser input 440 corresponds to the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’). - In the example of
FIG. 4A , in response to determining thatuser input 440 corresponds to a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character,keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display onPSD 412, the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) toPSD 412. As shown inFIG. 4A , in response,PSD 412 displays the combination including the first character and the second character as text inedit region 416C. - In the example of
FIG. 4B , however,PSD 412 receives an indication ofuser input 442 selectingkey 426 ofgraphical keyboard 416B. As shown inFIG. 4B ,user input 442 includes a first tap gesture alone withinkey 426. More specifically, a user may place only a first finger withinkey 426 without providing any other gestures with any additional fingers. - In response to receiving an indication of
user input 442,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 442 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character. For example,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 442 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’) or a combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) based on a quantity of taps associated withuser input 442. More specifically, in response tokeyboard module 122 receiving, fromPSD 412, information indicating thatuser input 442 includes the placement of a first finger alone withinkey 426,keyboard module 122 may determine thatuser input 442 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’). - In the example of
FIG. 4B , in response to determininguser input 442 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’),keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display onPSD 412, the first character alone toPSD 412. As shown inFIG. 4B , in response,PSD 412 displays the first character alone as text inedit region 416C. - Although
FIGS. 4A-4B illustrate a user input having two gestures, any suitable number of gestures may be used. For instance, a user input that includes three taps may indicate a selection of a predicted letter and a user input that includes one or two taps may indicate a selection of a character normally associated with a key, a user input that includes four taps may indicate a selection of a predicted letter and a user input that includes one, two, or three taps may indicate a selection of a character normally associated with a key, and so on. Additionally, althoughFIGS. 4A-4B illustrate the placement of the middle finger and the index finger of the left hand withinkey 426, some examples permit a user to use other combinations of fingers and/or a stylus pen. For instance, a user may apply a tapping gesture using a stylus pen by contacting the stylus pen withPSD 512 instead of using a right index finger of a user's left hand. In another instance, a user may apply a tapping gesture using an index finger of a user's right hand instead of using an index finger of a user's left hand. -
FIGS. 5A-5B are conceptual diagrams illustrating further details of a second example ofcomputing device 110 shown inFIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. As shown,PSD 512 may be an example ofPSD 112 ofFIG. 1A . For example,PSD 512 may be included incomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1A andPSD 512 may be used withUI module 120 andkeyboard module 122 as shown inFIG. 1A . As shown,PSD 512 may displayuser interface 514, which may be substantially similar touser interface 114 ofFIG. 1A . For instance,user interface 514 may includeoutput region 516A that is an example ofoutput region 116A ofFIG. 1A ,graphical keyboard 516B that is an example ofgraphical keyboard 116B ofFIG. 1A , editregion 516C that is an example ofedit region 116C ofFIG. 1A , andsuggestion region 516D that is an example ofsuggestion region 116D ofFIG. 1 . - In the example of
FIG. 5A ,PSD 512 receives an indication ofuser input 540 selectingkey 526 ofgraphical keyboard 516B. As shown inFIG. 5A ,user input 540 includes a swipe gesture withinkey 526 that moves from a graphical indication of a first character (e.g., ‘T’) withinkey 526 and towards a graphical indication of a second character (e.g. ‘h’) withinkey 526. More specifically, a user may place a finger substantially over the graphical indication of the first character (e.g., ‘T’) and may slide, while maintaining contact withPSD 512, the finger towards the graphical indication of a second character (e.g. ‘h’) withinkey 526. - In response to receiving an indication of
user input 540,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 540 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character. For example,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 540 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’) or a combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) based on a swipe direction associated withuser input 540. More specifically, in response tokeyboard module 122 receiving, fromPSD 512, information indicating thatuser input 540 includes a swipe gesture withinkey 526 that moves from a graphical indication of a first character (e.g., ‘T’) withinkey 526 and towards a graphical indication of a second character (e.g. ‘h’) withinkey 526,keyboard module 122 may determine thatuser input 540 corresponds to the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’). - In the example of
FIG. 5A , in response to determining thatuser input 540 corresponds to a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character,keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display onPSD 512, the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) toPSD 512. As shown inFIG. 5A , in response,PSD 512 displays the combination including the first character and the second character as text inedit region 516C. - In the example of
FIG. 5B , however,PSD 512 receives an indication ofuser input 542 selectingkey 526 ofgraphical keyboard 516B. As shown inFIG. 5B ,user input 542 includes a tap gesture withinkey 526 without a swipe gesture. More specifically, a user may place a finger withinkey 526 and move, without applying a swipe gesture, the finger away from PSD 516. - In response to receiving an indication of
user input 542,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 542 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character. For example,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 542 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’) or a combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) based on a swipe direction associated withuser input 540. More specifically, in response tokeyboard module 122 receiving, fromPSD 512, an indication thatuser input 542 includes a tap gesture withinkey 526 without a swipe gesture,keyboard module 122 may determine thatuser input 542 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’). In another example, in response tokeyboard module 122 receiving, fromPSD 512, an indication thatuser input 542 includes a tap gesture withinkey 526 with a swipe gesture that moves from a graphical indication of a first character (e.g., ‘T’) withinkey 526 and away from a graphical indication of a second character (e.g. ‘h’) withinkey 526,keyboard module 122 may determine thatuser input 542 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’). - In the example of
FIG. 5B , in response to determininguser input 542 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’),keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display onPSD 512, the first character alone toPSD 512. As shown inFIG. 5B , in response,PSD 512 displays the first character alone as text inedit region 516C. - Although
FIGS. 5A-5B illustrate the placement of the index finger of the left hand withinkey 526, some examples permit a user to use other combinations of fingers and/or a stylus pen. For instance, a user may apply a swiping gesture using a stylus pen by contacting the stylus pen withPSD 512 instead of using an index finger of a user's left hand. In another instance, a user may apply a swiping gesture using an index finger of a user's right hand instead of using an index finger of a user's left hand. -
FIGS. 6A-6B are conceptual diagrams illustrating further details of a third example ofcomputing device 110 shown inFIG. 1A , in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. As shown,PSD 612 may be an example ofPSD 112 ofFIG. 1A . For example,PSD 612 may be included incomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1A andPSD 612 may be used withUI module 120 andkeyboard module 122 as shown inFIG. 1A . As shown,PSD 612 may display user interface 614, which may be substantially similar touser interface 114 ofFIG. 1A . For instance, user interface 614 may includeoutput region 616A that is an example ofoutput region 116A ofFIG. 1A ,graphical keyboard 616B that is an example ofgraphical keyboard 116B ofFIG. 1A , editregion 616C that is an example ofedit region 116C ofFIG. 1A , andsuggestion region 616D that is an example ofsuggestion region 116D ofFIG. 1 . - In the example of
FIG. 6A ,PSD 612 receives an indication ofuser input 640 selectingkey 626 ofgraphical keyboard 616B. As shown inFIG. 6A ,user input 640 includes a tap gesture applied with a first amount of pressure withinkey 626. More specifically, a user may place a finger substantially over the graphical indication of the first character (e.g., ‘T’) and in doing so, apply the first amount of pressure to thePSD 612, atkey 626. - In response to receiving an indication of
user input 640,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 640 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character. For example,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 640 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’) or a combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) based on an amount of pressure associated withuser input 640. More specifically, in response tokeyboard module 122 receiving, fromPSD 612, an indication thatuser input 640 that includes the first amount of pressure that satisfies (e.g., exceeds, within a range, or the like) a pressure threshold,keyboard module 122 may determine thatuser input 640 corresponds to the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’). The pressure threshold may be a pressure value or a range of pressure values. In some examples, the pressure threshold may be automatically determined by computingdevice 110. In some examples, the pressure threshold may be user selected. - In the example of
FIG. 6A , in response to determining thatuser input 640 corresponds to a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character,keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display onPSD 612, the combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) toPSD 612. As shown inFIG. 6A , in response,PSD 612 displays the combination including the first character and the second character as text inedit region 616C. - In the example of
FIG. 6B , however,PSD 612 receives an indication ofuser input 642 selectingkey 626 ofgraphical keyboard 616B. As shown inFIG. 6B ,user input 642 includes a tap gesture applied with a second amount of pressure withinkey 626. More specifically, a user may place a finger substantially over the graphical indication of the first character (e.g., ‘T’) and apply the second pressure, to thePSD 612, atkey 626 - In response to receiving an indication of
user input 642,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 642 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone or a selection of a combination of the first character and the second character. For example,keyboard module 122 may determine whetheruser input 642 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’) or a combination including the first character and the second character (e.g., the phrase ‘th’) based on an amount of pressure associated withuser input 642. More specifically, in response tokeyboard module 122 receiving, fromPSD 612, an indication thatuser input 640 includes the second amount of pressure that does not satisfy (e.g., does not exceed, outside a range, or the like) the pressure threshold,keyboard module 122 may determine thatuser input 642 corresponds to the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’). - In the example of
FIG. 6B , in response to determininguser input 642 corresponds to a selection of the first character alone (e.g., the letter ‘t’),keyboard module 122 may causeUI module 120 to output, for display onPSD 612, the first character alone toPSD 612. As shown inFIG. 6B , in response,PSD 612 displays the first character alone as text inedit region 616C. - Although
FIGS. 6A-6B illustrate the placement of the index finger of the left hand withinkey 626, some examples permit a user to use other combinations of fingers and/or a stylus pen. For instance, a user may apply an amount of pressure using a stylus pen by contacting the stylus pen withPSD 612 instead of using an index finger of a user's left hand. In another instance, a user may apply an amount of pressure using an index finger of a user's right hand instead of using an index finger of a user's left hand. Additionally, althoughFIGS. 6A-6B illustrate a higher pressure (e.g., first amount of pressure) satisfying a pressure threshold and a lower pressure (e.g., second amount of pressure) not satisfying the pressure threshold, in other examples, a lower pressure may satisfy a pressure threshold and a higher pressure may not satisfy the pressure threshold. -
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating example operations of an example computing device configured to predict next letters and display them within keys of a graphical keyboard, in accordance with one or more techniques of the present disclosure. The process ofFIG. 7 may be performed by one or more processors of a computing device, such ascomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1A . The acts of the process ofFIG. 7 may in some examples, be repeated, omitted, and/or performed in any order. For purposes of illustration only,FIG. 7 is described below within the context ofcomputing device 110 ofFIG. 1A and computing device 210 ofFIG. 2 . - In the example of
FIG. 7 ,computing device 110 outputs (700), for display, a graphical keyboard including a set of keys, the set of keys including a first key that is associated with a first character. For example,PSD 112 ofFIG. 1A may displaygraphical keyboard 116B withkeys 118. In the example,PSD 112 may display key 126 that is associated with the character ‘T’. -
Computing device 110 determines (710) at least one candidate word that includes the first character. For example,keyboard module 122 ofcomputing device 110 may output the character ‘T’ to a language mode module, for instance,LM module 224 ofFIG. 2 , and receive a candidate word (e.g., “That”) that includes the character ‘T’.Computing device 110 determines (720) a score associated with the at least one candidate word that indicates a probability of the at least one candidate word being entered by one or more subsequent selections of one or more of the set of keys. For example, in response tokeyboard module 122 ofcomputing device 110 outputting the character ‘T’ to the language mode module,computing device 110 may receive, from the language mode module the score associated with the at least one candidate word.Computing device 730 determines (730) whether the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies a threshold. For example,computing device 110 may determine whether the score associated with the at least one candidate word indicates a higher probability that the at least one candidate word will be selected than a probability indicated by the threshold. - In response to
computing device 110 determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word satisfies the threshold (“SATISFIES” of 730),computing device 110 determines (740) a second character of the at least one candidate word. For example,computing device 110 may determine that the character immediately following the first character in the spelling of the at least one candidate word is the second character. Computing device outputs (750), for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character and a graphical indication of the second character. For example,PSD 112 displays, withinkey 126, a graphical indication of the first character (e.g., ‘T’) and a graphical indication of the second character (e.g., ‘h’). -
Computing device 110 receives (760) an input selecting the first key. For example,PSD 112 receives user input 140 ofFIG. 1B . In another example,PSD 112 receives user input 142 ofFIG. 1C .Computing device 110 determines (770) whether the input selecting the first key corresponds to the first character or a combination of the first and second characters. For example, in response toPSD 112 receiving user input 140 ofFIG. 1B ,computing device 110 determines that user input 140 selects the combination of the first and second characters. More specifically,keyboard module 122 ofcomputing device 110 may determine that user input 140 selects the combination of the first and second characters based on a quantity of taps associated with user input 140, a swipe direction associated with user input 140, an amount of pressure associated with user input 140, or another characteristic or parameter associated with a selection ofkey 126. - In another example, in response to
PSD 112 receiving user input 142 ofFIG. 1C ,computing device 110 determines that user input 142 selects the first character alone. More specifically,keyboard module 122 ofcomputing device 110 may determine that user input 142 selects the first character alone based on a quantity of taps associated with user input 142, a swipe direction associated with user input 142, an amount of pressure associated with user input 142, or another characteristic or parameter associated with a selection ofkey 126. - In response to
computing device 110 determining that the score associated with the at least one candidate word does not satisfy the threshold (“DOES NOT SATISFY” of 730),computing device 110 outputs (780), for display within the first key, a graphical indication of the first character. For example,computing device 110 outputs, for display onPSD 112, withinkey 126, a graphical indication of the first character (e.g., ‘T’) alone.Computing device 110 refrains (790) from outputting the graphical indication of the second graphical indication. For example,computing device 110 outputs, for display onPSD 112, withinkey 126, a graphical indication of the first character (e.g., ‘T’) without the graphical indication of the second character (e.g., ‘h’). - The following numbered clauses may illustrate one or more aspects of the disclosure:
