The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a particular manner to realize one or more of the following advantages.
The application of quantum computing in quantum chemistry generally focuses on solving difficult problems in a simplified space called the active space. Limiting to the active space enables a reduction in the number of qubits required to solve portions (e.g., the base portion) of difficult chemical problems. However, this reduction is not accurate. While the essential physics of the problem can be captured, important effects, such as electronic tips, that make quantitative accuracy difficult to achieve, are ignored. As a result, the calculation and/or simulation results may be inaccurate.
To capture these additional important effects, additional basis functions are required — during the physical implementation of quantum simulation, these basis functions can translate into additional qubits and increased quantum gate complexity. In most applications, the number of additional basis functions/qubits can be very large. Therefore, determining an accurate solution to such problems can be extremely difficult and costly-particularly when using short-or medium-term quantum computers, e.g., noisy medium-scale quantum (NISQ) devices where the number of qubits is between tens and hundreds.
The present specification introduces quantum simulation techniques that extend beyond the active space without requiring additional qubit or quantum gate complexity. Thus, quantum simulation performed using the presently described techniques reintroduces important physical effects, and improved simulation accuracy may be achieved. These methods have an exponential advantage over classical methods in processing the activity space and the activity space reference. Furthermore, alternative approximations are introduced that can be implemented to improve the efficiency of quantum simulation schemes. These alternative approximations can reduce the number of measurement operations required by the quantum simulation scheme, thereby reducing the amount of quantum computing resources used in quantum simulation.
The presently described technology is particularly suited for quantitative accurate calculations on chemical systems on short or medium-term quantum computers. In the long term, these techniques can also be used to model the competitiveness of fault tolerant methods for quantum systems (e.g., chemical systems). The method is effectively optimized to run on a hybrid quantum classical computing device by determining matrix elements and overlap matrices in an activity space using the quantum computing device and performing pre-computation and/or post-processing using a classical computing device to determine physical characteristics of the system from the matrix elements and the overlap matrices.
The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
This specification describes techniques for simulating quantum systems, such as systems characterized by electronic structure Hamiltonian quantities. In modeling a quantum system, a discretization of space (or basis set) can be chosen to represent the quantum system. The blocks used to partition the space are called basis functions, and many canonical choices of basis are known, such as linear combinations of atomic orbitals and plane waves. Once the basis is selected, the selected basis can be used to represent the hamiltonian characterizing the quantum system. For example, the electronic structure hamiltonian can be written in its canonical form as:
wherein each index i, j, k, l corresponds to a basis function in the selected basis, hijAnd hijklRepresenting standard integrals over the basis functions involved, and step operators
The accuracy with which a quantum system can be modeled depends on the number of basis functions in the selected basis. That is, in general, increasing the number of basis functions improves the accuracy of the simulation. However, using too many basis functions may make the simulation task impractical or may waste resources when using more in-depth processing methods.
One of the earliest methods used in traditional quantum chemistry and adopted by the quantum computing community was active spatial approximation. The physical intuition behind active spatial approximation is that the discretized space can be divided into portions that exhibit strong correlation or entanglement-the active space-and, while important, the low rank contribution that can be well perturbed-the virtual space. However, on classical computers, the size of the fundamental quantum component or activity space is still limited, and to date there has been no virtual contribution on quantum computers.
This specification describes quantum simulation techniques and systems that go beyond the active space approximation without the need for additional qubit or gate complexity. One example technique includes systematically reintroducing contributions of virtual space using quantum subspace extension to improve simulation accuracy. Another example technique uses orbital relaxation (orbital relaxation) to remove the active space approximation and reduce the circuit depth.
Example hardware
Fig. 1 depicts an example system 100 for simulating a quantum system. Example system 100 is an example of a system implemented as classical and quantum computer programs on one or more classical computers and quantum computing devices in one or more locations in which the systems, components, and techniques described in this specification can be implemented.
The system 100 may receive input data, such as input data 106, that specifies a physical system to be modeled or simulated. For example, the received data may represent a material, such as a metal or polymer, a single molecule, or a chemical. The input data may include data representing a Hamiltonian characterizing a physical system to be modeled or simulated, such as an electronic structure Hamiltonian.
The system 100 may generate output data, e.g., output data 108, representing the simulation results of the physical system of interest. The generated output data may be provided for further processing or analysis. For example, where the physical system is a material (e.g., a metal or a polymer), the generated output data may include data representing a simulated ground state of the physical system, which may be used to determine a property of the material, such as its resistance or conductivity. As another example, where the physical system is a chemical, the generated output data may be used to determine a property of the chemical, such as a chemical reaction rate.
The system 100 includes quantum hardware 102 in data communication with a classical processor 104. For convenience, classical processor 104 and quantum computing hardware 102 are shown as separate entities, however in some implementations classical processor 104 may be included in quantum computing hardware 102, e.g., quantum computing hardware 102 may include one or more components for performing classical computing operations.
The quantum hardware 102 includes components for performing quantum computations, such as the quantum simulation process described in this specification. For example, the quantum hardware 102 includes a plurality of qubits 110 and a control device 112 for controlling the qubits 110 and causing an algorithmic operation or a quantum computation to be performed.
The plurality of qubits 110 are physical qubits for performing algorithmic operations or quantum calculations. The specific physical implementations of the qubits 110 included in the quantum computing hardware 102 and how they interact with each other depend on various factors, including the type of quantum computing being performed by the quantum computing hardware 102 (and in turn on the physical system being simulated). For example, in some implementations, a qubit may include a qubit that is physically implemented by an atomic, molecular, or solid-state quantum system. In other implementations, the qubit may comprise a superconducting qubit, such as a Gmon qubit or a semiconductor qubit. In other implementations, ion traps, photonic devices, or superconducting cavities (with which states can be prepared without the need for qubits) can be used. Further examples of physical implementations of qubits include fluxgron qubits, silicon quantum dots or phosphorus impurity qubits.
The type of control device 112 included in the quantum hardware 102 depends on the type of qubit 110 included in the quantum hardware 102. For example, in some cases, qubits 110 may be frequency tunable. In these cases, each qubit may have an associated operating frequency that may be adjusted using one or more control devices 112, e.g., a excitation pulse generator and a control line coupling the qubit to the excitation pulse generator. Example operating frequencies include a qubit idling frequency, a qubit interaction frequency, and a qubit readout frequency. The different frequencies correspond to different operations that the qubit can perform. For example, setting the operating frequency to the corresponding idle frequency may cause the qubit to enter a state in which it does not interact strongly with other qubits and can be used to execute a single qubit gate. As another example, where qubits interact through couplers with fixed couplings, the qubits may be configured to interact by setting their respective operating frequencies to some gate-dependent frequency that is detuned from their common interaction frequency. In other cases, for example, qubits may be configured to interact with each other by setting the parameters of their respective couplers to cause interaction between energy qubits when the qubits interact through a tunable coupler, and then by setting the respective operating frequencies of the qubits to some gate-dependent frequency that is detuned from their common interaction frequency. This interaction may be performed to implement a multi-qubit gate.
The control device 112 may also include a device, such as a readout resonator, configured to perform measurements on the qubit 110 and provide the measurements to the classical processor 104 for processing and analysis.
Programming hardware: example processing to simulate a Quantum System Using Quantum subspace expansion
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for simulating a quantum system characterized by respective Hamiltonian quantities using quantum subspace stretching. For convenience, process 200 is described as being performed by a system of one or more classical and quantum computing devices located at one or more locations. For example, a quantum computing system, such as system 100 of FIG. 1, suitably programmed in accordance with the present description, may perform process 200.
The system selects a first set of basis functions for simulation (step 202). The system may then define a Hamiltonian using the selected first set of basis functions. For example, as described above, in some cases, the hamiltonian may be an electronic structure hamiltonian. In these cases, the electronic structure Hamiltonian can be written in the canonical form given by equation (1) above, where each index value of i, j, k, l in equation (1) corresponds to a respective basis function.
The first set of basis functions includes a core orbit
The system may determine which elements of the first set of basis functions belong to each subset by performing a classical pre-calculation
System definition extension operator OiIs performed (step 204). The extension operator being included in the active space
In the case of the equation (2),
The system performs a plurality of quantum computations to determine a matrix representation of a target operator (corresponding to an observable target for simulation) in the second set of basis functions (step 206). For convenience, the following description continues using the example of the electronic structure hamiltonian as the target operator (where energy is an observable target), although other target operators and observable values may be used (depending on the simulation being performed). Computing such matrix elements by classical computing devices typically has high computational costs, particularly for states that exhibit strong correlation and/or entanglement. In contrast, using quantum computation to determine matrix elements inherently takes into account strong correlation and/or entanglement.
By expanding the corresponding operator OiApplied to the reference wave function | Ψref>To define each basis function in the second set of basis functions, may be in an activity space
To determine each matrix element HijThe system may repeatedly prepare the wave function | Ψref>(by preparing qubits in corresponding quantum states in a quantum computing device) and measuring the Pauli operator corresponding to the transformation of the matrix elements by a Jordan-Wigner transformation or equivalent. In some implementations, more general measurement techniques may be used, such as phase estimation or aided estimation (known).
In some implementations, the second set of basis functions { O }i|ΨrefMay be non-orthogonal. In these implementations, the system may further determine an overlap (or metric) matrix S in the second set of basis functions (to ensure that the problem is well defined) (step 208). Each element of the overlap matrix S represents a respective overlap of two basis functions in the set of basis functions. Each element may be formed by a measurement operation, and may be given by the following equation (4).
Again, to determine each matrix element SijThe system may repeatedly prepare the wave function | Ψref(by preparing qubits in corresponding quantum states in a quantum computing device) and measuring the Pauli operator corresponding to the transformation of the matrix elements by a Jordan-Wigner transform or equivalent.
The extension operator defined in step 204 and equation (2) above includes a function that acts in principle to define the activity space
For example, in some implementations, step 206 may include determining, by measurement, the matrix elements given by equation (5) below.
In equation (5), the greek letters represent virtual tracks. In this case, performing classical pre-computation may include shrinking the operator over the virtual space in equation (5) using the Wick theorem to obtain the alternative representation as given in equation (6).
In equation (6), Δξη,μv＝δξvδημ-δξμδηv，
The extension operator defined in equation (2) includes both inside and outside the active space with respect to the reference wave function | Ψref>Single excitation and double excitation as shown in equation (2). However, in some implementations, the number of shots may vary to any level within or outside of the activity space or within a sub-partition thereof. That is to say that the position of the first electrode,the system may select the maximum firing level k for any extended subset of k. For a k-order excitation, the expected number of measurements included in process 200 will grow to
The system calculates eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the electronic structure hamiltonian using the determined matrix representation H of the electronic structure hamiltonian and the determined overlap matrix S (step 210). That is, the system may perform a classical calculation to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem given in equation (7) below.
HC＝SCE (7)
In equation (7), C represents a group { O }i|Ψref>The matrix of eigenvectors in (f), and E represents a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. In some implementations, a pre-processing step, such as regular diagonalization, may be performed to remove the zero or near-zero eigenvalues of the matrix S and generate an updated overlap matrix S' before solving the generalized eigenvalue problem in the well-conditioned subspace.
The system determines characteristics of the quantum system using the computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors (step 212). For example, in some cases, the electronic structure hamiltonian may characterize the electronic structure of a semiconductor. In these cases, simulating the physical system may include simulating a property of the semiconductor, for example, simulating a conductivity or resistance of the semiconductor. Such simulation results may be used to fabricate semiconductor devices, such as integrated circuits. As another example, in some cases, the electronic structure hamiltonian can characterize the catalyst. In these cases, simulating the physical system may include simulating properties of the catalyst, such as simulating catalytic activity. Such simulation results may be used to prepare catalysts, such as electrocatalysts or biocatalysts.
FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram 300 of the presently described virtual quantum subspace expansion technique for quantum simulation of quantum systems, e.g., step 202-210 of the above-described exemplary process 200.
As described above with reference to step 202 of the example process, the technique separates the trajectory of the quantum system (e.g., including trajectory 102) into its core component 104a, active component 104b, and virtual component 104 c.
As described above with reference to step 204 and 208 of the example process 200, the quantum computing device 106 simulates the quantum system (i.e., the state of the quantum system represented by the wave function) within the activity space. Additional measurements are taken within the space. Classical computer 108 combines these additional measurements with classical post-processing from data on virtual space 104c to improve simulation without using additional qubits or circuit depth.
As described above with reference to steps 210-212 of the example process 200, the resulting improved simulated wave function(s) may be stored in a mixed quantum classical representation, which may be used to derive target properties for the wave function(s).
Programming hardware: cumulant and constrained activity space approximation
In some implementations, one or more approximations may be introduced to the above example process 200 to improve traceability.
One example approximation includes approximating an activity spaceofThe example process 200 of FIG. 2 is followed. Partitioning the activity space in this manner reduces the scaling of the number of measurements needed to determine matrices H and S to the original cost of computing the eigenvalues plus the first component
Another approximation includes estimating the matrix elements of a Reduced Density Matrix (RDM) by cumulative approximation or an integrated variational approach. For example, the product of the lower RDM and the perturbation correction may be used to form a series of approximations to the 4-RDM, e.g., 4-RDM as defined in equation (6). Such truncation may reduce the number of return measurement active space tracks
Programming hardware: example Process for simulating Quantum systems Using full spatial orbital relaxation
Fig. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for simulating a quantum system characterized by corresponding hamiltonian quantities using full spatial orbital relaxation. For convenience, process 400 is described as being performed by a system of one or more classical and quantum computing devices located at one or more locations. For example, a quantum computing system, such as system 100 of fig. 1, suitably programmed in accordance with the present description, may perform process 400.
The system obtains an analog output from a quantum simulation of the quantum system (step 402). The quantum simulation may be a quantum simulation in an activity space, e.g., a quantum simulation performed using an activity space approximation. The analog output may be an estimated energy of the quantum system, e.g., an estimated energy related to a Hamiltonian quantity in the active space. For example, in some implementations, the hamiltonian characterizing the quantum system may be an electronic structure hamiltonian, as given in equation (1) above. In these implementations, the analog output may include a 2-RDM (a hamiltonian integrated from the imaginary and core degrees of freedom) from the ground state corresponding to the active space hamiltonian. The system may obtain analog outputs from active space methods such as fully active space configuration interaction (CAS-CI), multi-configuration self-consistent field Methods (MCSCF), Density Matrix Reorganization Group (DMRG), Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), or more generally, from any method that outputs 2-RDM (or N-representable 2-RDM).
The system performs a classical calculation, adjusting the analog output in full space using a plurality of single particle rotations, U, to obtain an estimated energy of the quantum system characterized by a corresponding hamiltonian (i.e., a hamiltonian in full space) (step 404). Due to the thoulless theorem, multiple single-event rotations U can be efficiently implemented as the underlying rotation of the hamiltonian (in full space), e.g.,
Subject to
In equation (8), U represents a unitary transformation on the basis of rotation, i.e., a plurality of single-event rotations, Ui,i′Is a representation of U in the basis (e.g., Ui,i′Is the i-i' th entry of the matrix representation of U), hijAnd hijklAs defined in the above equation (1), and
in some implementations, the system can solve the nonlinear optimization problem given by equation (8) by parameterizing the unitary transform U as an exponential inverse hermitian matrix. For example, the system may set up
U＝eX
In equation (9), X denotes a generator of the unitary function U and is an inverse hermitian matrix.
In other implementations, the system may parameterize the unitary matrix U using Givens rotations. This parameterization uses a set of angles theta associated with a set of non-redundant orbital rotation generators. For the 2-RDM obtained from the exact diagonalization of the active space hamiltonian, the only non-redundant parameter is the single-event generator associated with the orbital pair involving rotation from the active space to the virtual space and the active space to the kernel space. Thus, the unitary matrix U in equation (8) can be expressed as the product of Givens matrices:
the optimal rotation of the single angle with respect to the input 2-RDM, 1-electron integral and 2-electron integral and the scan procedure to find the energy minimization U can be calculated using known techniques, e.g. full optimization based on successive jacobian rotations, using a multi-configuration self-consistent field Method (MCSF) method of ground and excited states.
In some implementations, the system can iterate between solving the active space schrodinger equation (step 402) and the full space single event rotation (404), e.g., iteratively perform the example process 400. When the system iterates to perform the example process 400, at the end of each iteration, the new basis determined by minimizing the expected value of the unitary rotation of the hamiltonian with respect to the track (determined by solving equation 8 above) is used as an input to solve the active space schrodinger equation in subsequent iterations. The iterative process may stop when the energy variation between iterations is below a predetermined threshold. In other implementations, the system may perform a single orbit relaxation process (step 404) once as a post-processing step.
Due to the principle of variation, it is ensured that the orbits are relaxed in a single step in a post-process to reduce the energy. Furthermore, if the ground state of the active space is not reached due to the approximation wave function ansatz, the system may include additional single-particle orbital rotations between pairs of orbits within the active space in the relaxation. Including these rotations would correspond to additional linear depth circuits that would perform perfectly on the quantum computer at step 402. However, any circuit that contains a single-event rotation at the end of the circuit can be shortened by replacing the single-event rotation at the end of the circuit with a classical post-processing step based on the single-event rotation described above (e.g., in active space rather than full space).
In some implementations, the example process 400 may be combined with one or more of the techniques described above with reference to the example process 200. For example, step 402 may be performed using the technique described in step 202 and 208 of the example process 200, where in the example process 200 (as described in steps 206 and 208), the contraction of the expansion operator acting on the virtual space by classical precomputation may be replaced by orbital relaxation by classical post-processing (step 404). Steps 210 and 212 of fig. 3 may then be performed.
