Definitions
- Excessive network transmissions, packet-based or otherwise, of network traffic data between computing devices can prevent a computing device from properly processing the network traffic data, completing an operation related to the network traffic data, or responding timely to the network traffic data.
- the excessive network transmissions of network traffic data can also complicate data routing or degrade the quality of the response when the responding computing device is at or above its processing capacity, which may result in inefficient bandwidth utilization.
- a portion of the excessive network transmissions can include transmissions for requests that are not valid requests.
- a system to determine operational statuses of agents interfacing with digital assistant applications can include a data processing system having one or more processors.
- a response logger component executed by the data processing system can access a log database.
- the log database can maintain a plurality of response metrics for an agent service.
- Each response metric can correspond to a response by the agent service to a first request generated by a digital assistant application responsive to an input audio signal for one of the plurality of functions of an agent interfacing with the digital assistant application.
- a probe monitor component executed by the data processing system can transmit a second request to the agent service for one of the plurality of functions of the agent and can wait for a second response from the agent service in response the second request.
- a status evaluator component executed by the data processing system can determine an operational status of the agent service for the agent based on the plurality of response metrics maintained on the log database for the agent and on a time elapsed since the transmission of the second request.
- An agent manager component executed by the data processing system can cause the digital assistant application to perform an action in interfacing with the agent based on the operational status of the agent.
- a method of determining operational statuses of agents interfacing with digital assistant applications can include accessing the log database maintaining a plurality of response metrics for an agent service.

- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example computer system.
- a digital assistant application can interface with agents via invoking functions in accordance with application programming interface (API) protocols.
- the function call can cause the agent to send a request to an agent service to access various resources for carrying out various functionalities.
- the functionalities of the digital assistant application can be extended. Certain functions can be invoked or performed in response to fulfilling a predefined condition (sometimes referred to an HTTP callback or web hook).
- the function calls for the agent can sometimes fail to execute properly.
- the function call can result in the agent service crashing and returning a server-side error message (e.g., an HTTP response with a 5xx status code).
- the function call itself can also be invalid or improper under the API protocols, and can result in the agent service responding with a client-side error message (e.g., an HTTP response with a 4xx status code). Any error can lead to a breakdown in the interfacing between the digital assistant application and the agent.
- the internal operations of the agent service and the agent can be inaccessible to the digital assistant application.
- the digital assistant application can have access to metadata for the agent (e.g., package and listing), but may not have access to the full capabilities of the agent or the agent service. Indexing (sometimes referred to crawling) the agent service to determine the full capabilities of the agent can be difficult to perform in the context of digital assistant applications.
- the present systems and methods can monitor the performance of the agent service and index the capabilities of the agent by analyzing response logs and querying the agent service.
- the agent monitor can ping the agent service by sending a request using one of the predefined function calls.
- the request can be of the same format as a request generated by the digital assistant application interfacing with the agent in response to an input audio signal for one of the functionalities of the agent.
- the agent monitor can wait for a response from the agent service until a predetermined time.
- the agent monitor can parse the response to determine a response metric for the response in reaction to the request.
- the agent monitor can determine the functionalities of the agent and the agent service providing resources to the agent interfacing with the digital assistant application.
- the agent monitor can also access a log database for the agent service.
- the log database can maintain response metrics for the responses generated by the agent service to requests the digital assistant application running on clients interfacing with the agent.
- the request can have been generated in response to an input audio signal for one of the functionalities of the agent.
- the response metric for each response indicating an elapsed time between the response and the corresponding request and an indication of whether the agent service successfully carried out the request, among other measures.
- the agent monitor can determine an operational status of the agent service indicating whether the agent service is responsive or unresponsive. Based on the operational status, the agent monitor can set or configure the digital assistant application in interfacing with the agent associated with the agent service. When the operational status indicates that the agent service is currently unresponsive, the digital assistant application can be set to present a warning that the agent is unresponsive, in response to receiving an input audio signal for one of the functions of the agent. With the determination of the capabilities of the agent, the digital assistant application can also select an alternative agent that can also carry out the task indicated in the input audio signal. On the other hand, when the operational status indicates that the agent service is currently responsive, the digital assistant application can continue to invoke the agent to access resources provided by the agent service to carry out the task indicated in the input audio signal.
