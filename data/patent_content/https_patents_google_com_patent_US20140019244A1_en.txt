The method comprises receiving one or more offers for a product; associating the offers with the product in a database; assigning cash values for any segments of the offer that are not monetary; determining an equivalent value for the offer; receiving a shopping query from a user network device; accessing the offers for the product; ranking the offers for the product based on the equivalent values of the offers; presenting the ranked offers to the user network device.
Description
- This application claims priority to international patent application no. PCT/IN2012/000497, entitled “Generating A Ranked List Of Offers In A Shopping Query” and filed Jul. 13, 2012. The entire contents of the above-identified priority application are hereby fully incorporated herein by reference.
- The present disclosure relates to online shopping queries, and more particularly to a method for generating a ranked list of offers associated with the search results of a shopping query.
- The retail market has seen significant growth in online shopping since the advent of the Internet. On the Internet, users may search for, locate, and purchase nearly everything that can be purchased at a physical marketplace.
- Online shopping websites often use shopping search engines to allow a user to search for a specific product or group of products. The shopping search engines store products and characteristics of the product. For example, a search engine may store a database of products that contains product descriptions, product user ratings, merchants offering the products, product identifications such as a model number, and other product characteristics.
- A search engine may additionally store offers for the product, such as coupons, discounts, rebates, or other offers. The offer details may be provided to the search engine by offer providers, such as the marketing system for the product, retailers, “daily deal” offer providers, and others. A search engine also can perform a web search to gather current offers and product information from product websites, retailers, and other shopping websites.
- When a user receives product offers, the user desires to know which offer is the best or most valuable. The most valuable offer is often difficult for a user to determine because the offers may not be easy to compare. For example, while some offers may be for a specific discount, other offers may include a free warranty or free installation. Users would be desirous of a way to determine which offer is the best.
- An aspect of the present invention provides a computer-implemented method for ranking offers in an online shopping search. The method comprises receiving one or more offers for a product; associating the offers with the product in a database; assigning cash values for any segments of the offer that are not monetary; determining an equivalent value for the offer; receiving a shopping query from a user network device; accessing the offers for the product; ranking the offers for the product based on the equivalent values of the offers; presenting the ranked offers to the user network device.
- Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product that is installed on a server located in a search engine system to rank offers in an online shopping search. The computer program product includes a non-transitory computer-readable storage device having computer-readable program instructions stored therein. The computer-readable program instructions include computer program instructions for receiving one or more offers for a product; associating the offers with the product in a database; assigning cash values for any segments of the offer that are not monetary; determining an equivalent value for the offer; receiving a shopping query from a user network device; accessing the offers for the product; ranking the offers for the product based on the equivalent values of the offers; presenting the ranked offers to the user network device.
- These and other aspects, objects, features and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated exemplary embodiments, which include the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently presented.

The search engine seeks to rank the product offers to provide the best deal to the user. With many different types of offers, the search engine cannot simply list the offer with the biggest discount or lowest sale price. In certain instances, the warranty may be more valuable than the discount or the accessories may be more valuable than a coupon.
- The search engine system can determine an adjusted price for each offer. The search engine system can determine the price of any non-monetary offers. For example, the search engine system can determine the equivalent cash value of items such as installation, warranties, accessories, or any other non-monetary offers. The search engine system can establish the values of the non-monetary offers from any available source. Sources may include, but not be limited to, established pricing from the manufacturer website, industry pricing standards, established estimates, input from search engine system operators, or any other suitable resource.
- The search engine system can use the equivalent cash value of non-monetary offers to determine an equivalent price for the product. For example, a particular TV at a merchant may be offered for $1000, but includes a free 2-year warranty. The search engine system can determine that the 2-year warranty is valued at $100. The search engine system can thus establish the equivalent price of the TV at $900. Another merchant may be offering the same TV for $1100, but may be including a $300 rebate. The search engine system can establish the equivalent price of the TV at $800.
- The search engine system can compare the equivalent costs of the offers for a certain product and rank the offers based on the equivalent costs. For example, the products may be ranked from the lowest equivalent cost to the highest equivalent costs.
- In an alternate embodiment, the search engine system can assign a score to the selling price of the product. The search engine system can additionally assign a score to the other aspects of the offer. The aspects receiving a score may include, but not be limited to, rebates, coupons, warranties, installation, discounts, how closely a user query matches product offer details, or other suitable offer components.
- The search engine system can assign a total score to an offer by adding the selling price score to the scores of any other offer components. The scores can be compared and the offers ranked accordingly.
- The search engine system can display the results of the search and the offer ranking or transmit the results and the offer ranking to the online shopping system. The results can be displayed to the user to assist the user in selecting the best offer for a product.

FIG. 3 is a flow chart depicting amethod 220 for asearch engine system 160 to rank offers related to an online shopping query, in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. - With reference to
FIGS. 1 and 3 , inblock 305, thesearch engine system 160 receives or gathers offers and product details fromoffer providers 140. The search engine system can receive offers fromonline offer providers 140. Theoffer provider 140 may be a marketing system for a product, retailers, “daily deal” offer providers, and others. Theoffer providers 140 may transmit offers and other product information to thesearch engine system 160. - Additionally or alternatively, the
search engine system 160 can traverse the Internet and gather deals, coupons, promotions, and other offers from the websites ofoffer providers 140 and other suitable locations and store the products and offers in the database. - Additionally or alternatively, the
search engine system 160 can conduct a web search over the Internet and gather offers and product details at the time of the query entry. Thesearch engine 160 can extract offers from the search results. - The
offer provider 140 may transmit offers and other product information to thesearch engine 160 via a message over thenetwork 105, email, text, feed, or any other suitable connection. - In
block 310, thesearch engine system 160 maintains a database or other catalog of products. Thesearch engine system 160 analyzes each offer for a product. Some offers may include a sale price, a rebate, a coupon, free or discounted installation, free or discounted warranties, “buy one get one free” offers, included accessories, or other types of offers. Thesearch engine 160 seeks to rank the product offers to provide the best deal to the user 101. With many different types of offers, a ranking system that only lists the offer with the biggest discount or lowest sale price would undervalue an offer that contains significant non-monetary aspects. In certain instances, a warranty may be more valuable than the discount or free accessories may be more valuable than a monetary coupon. - Additionally or alternatively, the database may be maintained on the
online shopping system 150. - In
block 315, thesearch engine system 160 assigns an equivalent cash value to the offers and stores the offers and product details in the database. If an offer includes only the product specified in the search query, then the equivalent cash value of that offer is the price of the offer. If an offer includes the product specified in the search query plus other items bundled therewith, then the equivalent cash value of that offer includes the price of the specified product and the value of all the monetary and non-monetary items included therewith. Exemplary items that may be bundled with a specified product include, but are not limited to, products, services, discounts, rebates, warranties, or other monetary or non-monetary items. - The
search engine system 160 can determine the equivalent cash value of any items bundled with the specified product in an offer for the specified product. For example, thesearch engine system 160 can establish the values of the non-monetary offers from any available source. Sources may include, but are not limited to, established pricing from the manufacturer website, industry pricing standards, established estimates, input from search engine system operators, or any other suitable source. - The
search engine system 160 can use the equivalent cash value of items bundled in an offer to determine an equivalent price for the specified product in the offer. In an exemplary embodiment, the equivalent cash value for the specified product can be established by subtracting the value of all bundled items from the price for the offer. For example, a particular TV at a merchant may be offered for $1000, but includes a free 2-year warranty. In this case, thesearch engine system 160 can determine that the 2-year warranty is valued at $100. Thesearch engine system 160 can establish the equivalent cash value of the TV at $900. Another merchant may be offering the same TV for $1100, but may be including a $300 rebate. In this case, thesearch engine system 160 can establish the equivalent cash value of the TV at $800. Another merchant may be offering the same TV for $950, but may be including a “free” microwave. Thesearch engine system 160 can determine that the microwave is valued at $200. In this case, thesearch engine system 160 can establish the equivalent cash value of the TV at $750. - In
block 320, thesearch engine system 160 receives a search query from a user 101, as discussed previously with reference to block 215 ofFIG. 2 . The user 101 enters the search query into the user interface provided by thesearch engine system 160 or theonline shopping system 150. - In
block 325, thesearch engine system 160 can access the products and the related offers stored in the database that most closely match the search query. Thesearch engine system 160 can alternatively or additionally perform a search of the Internet for offers and merchants at the time of the search query. If thesearch engine system 160 performs a search of the Internet for related offers, or otherwise identifies offers that have not yet been valued by thesearch engine system 160, then thesearch engine 160 can perform block 315 for each such offer. - In
block 330 thesearch engine system 160 compares the equivalent value of the offers for a certain product and ranks the offers based on the equivalent value. For example, the products may be ranked from the lowest equivalent cash value for the product to the highest equivalent cash value for the product. - In an alternate embodiment, the
search engine system 160 can assign a score to the selling price of the product in an offer. Thesearch engine system 160 can additionally assign a score to each item bundled with the offer. The bundled items receiving a score may include, but not be limited to, rebates, coupons, warranties, products, services, installation, discounts, or other suitable offer components. The scoring system can be based on any rules or algorithm configured by the search engine system operators or others. In a certain embodiment, the scores can be based on the price for which an offer component can be purchased or is otherwise valued. - The
search engine system 160 can assign a total score to an offer by adding the selling price score, other offer component scores, the score of how close user query matches product offer details, and any other relevant factors affecting the score. The scores can be compared and the products ranked accordingly. - From
