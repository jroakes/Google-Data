Definitions
- Multimedia namely, the combination of text, animated graphics, video, and sound, presents information in a way that is more interesting and easier to grasp than text alone. It has been used for education at all levels, job training, and games by the entertainment industry. It is becoming more readily available as the price of personal computers and their accessories declines.
- the Internet is the breeding ground for multimedia ideas and the delivery vehicle of multimedia objects to a huge audience.
- the World Wide Web is the Internet's multimedia information retrieval system.
- client machines communicate with Web servers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- the web servers provide users with access to files such as text, graphics, images, sound, video, etc., using a standard page description language known as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
- HTML provides basic document formatting and allows the developer to specify connections known as hyperlinks to other servers and files.
- a network path to a server is identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) having a special syntax for defining a network connection.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- the viewer uses a remote control device to select a movie and manipulate play through start, stop, rewind, and visual fast forward buttons.
- the capabilities are very similar to renting a video at a store and playing it on a VCR.
- the service can provide indices to the movies by title, genre, actors, and director.
- VOD differs from pay per view by providing any of the movies at any time, instead of requiring that all purchasers of a movie watch its broadcast at the same time.
- watching the movie on a TV set attached to a videocassette recorder (VCR) with the same abilities to manipulate the play is not considered multimedia.
- ASF objects Three types of ASF objects exist, representing:
- the ASF header object comprises a “stream properties” object, defining the properties of each stream.
- the ASF header can be user by the client machine separately from the other two objects, so that the requesting client machine can prepare to process ASF files, for example, to “play” them.
- the server machine utilizes the data structure (termed a “profile” herein) to prepare for transmitting the content data to the client computer machine.
- the data structure is transmitted to the client machine and once received, the client machine determines whether the data structure can be processed. If the data structure can be processed, the client machine utilizes the data structure to prepare for rendering the content data. Once rendered, the content data can be viewed on the client machine, via a media player.
- quality of service attributes e.g. minimum data rate required
- the server machine and the client machine utilize a handshaking protocol for communicating and negotiating the quality of service attributes.
- the server machine de-multiplexes the content data before it is transmitted to the client machine and then the content data is re-multiplexed before it is rendered.
- the content data comprises at least one data stream and the data stream further comprises at least one data sub-stream.
- one composite data stream is associated with one data structure, whereby the data structure comprises a hierarchy of objects.
- the objects represent data streams and sub-streams.
- the server machine processes the obtaining, analyzing and combining steps described above.
- the file comprising the content data and associated security functions also has associated header data.
- the present invention provides a distributed data processing system for preparing multimedia content, in which said multimedia content comprises at least one file, said at least one file comprising content data and associated security functions, said content data comprising associated characteristics
- said distributed data processing system further comprising: at least one server machine comprising storage for storing said at least one file; at least one client machine comprising means for rendering said at least one file, and a network, said system comprising: means for requesting at least one file; means, responsive to said means for requesting, for determining by said at least one server machine, whether said at least one file is stored in said memory; means, responsive to a successful determination, for obtaining associated security functions for said at least one file; means for analyzing content data to obtain said associated characteristics, and means for combining said associated security functions and said associated characteristics into a data structure, wherein said combined associated security functions and said associated characteristics are stored separately to said content data.
- FIG. 2 shows a generalized environment supporting multimedia applications to homes or to business environments
- FIG. 3 shows a representation of a composite multimedia stream
- FIG. 4 shows an overview of a client machine issuing a “pull” request for a media file from a content server, according to the present invention
- FIG. 6 shows an example “profile”, according to the present invention.
- FIG. 7 shows an overview of preparing multimedia content, according to the present invention.
- FIG. 2 shows a generalized environment supporting multimedia applications to homes or to business environments.
- U 1 represents a user at home having access to an application or service through an access network ( 200 ), while a business user (U 2 ) is connected through a local area network ( 205 ), for example, a customer-premises network.
- a multimedia server ( 210 ) delivers services (that is, multimedia data streams) over a series of (possibly) heterogeneous networks to the client machines. (Further processing can take place within the network, for example, multicasting, transformation of content etc.)
- a “profile” should be understood as a data structure comprising a definition of the stream “characteristics” required for delivery of the composite stream or sub-streams, for example, the bit rate—generally, characteristics describe the properties of the streams or sub-streams. Furthermore, the profile is preferably utilized to encapsulate the characteristics (whereby the characteristics include the “protection policy”).
- a composite stream ( 300 ) is shown in FIG. 3 . In the example, the stream ( 300 ) comprises four sub-streams ( 305 - 320 ), three sub-streams of audio data and one sub-stream of video data. Preferably, each composite stream is associated with a profile.
- the characteristics are stored separately from the content, the characteristics can be easily modified.
- the characteristics can be stored on an external database or within a system header associated with a media file.
- a protection policy for example is immediately implemented.
- FIG. 4 shows a typical scenario of a client machine ( 108 ) issuing a “pull” request for a media file, according to the present invention. It will be described with reference to FIG. 5 .
- a user of a client application triggers a request ( 400 ) to play a particular media file.
- This initiates a channel command ( 405 ) to the content server ( 104 ), whereby a communication channel is opened (step 500 ) from the client machine ( 108 ) to the content server ( 104 ).
- the content server ( 104 ) also initiates a channel command ( 410 ) to the client machine ( 108 ), and opens (step 505 ) a communication channel to the client machine ( 108 ).
- the client machine ( 108 ) can now request (step 510 ) a media file.
- the content server ( 104 ) uses the profile ( 435 ), in order to prepare the file for streaming. Specifically the sub-stream and “QoS” (Quality of Service) objects are prepared ( 430 , step 535 ).
- the sub-stream objects are created and the QoS objects are “items” that can be applied to the sub-streams (whereby each sub-stream has an associated QoS object) as opposed to characteristics, which are properties of the sub-streams.
- the attributes of QoS objects include: the minimum data rate required, the maximum error rate tolerated, the compression algorithm to be used and security functions, such as, encryption.
- a negotiation ( 445 , step 555 ) between the client machine ( 108 ) and the content server ( 104 ) occurs, in order to resolve QoS items.
- a user of a requesting client application may be challenged to authenticate himself/herself and then will be asked whether or not he/she will accept a monetary charge for the stream or sub-streams of data. It should be understood that if the user at a client machine ( 108 ) is not prepared to accept the media—for example, if the user does not wish to pay for a media file or if the user does not have the correct technology to “play” a media file—then the process ends.
- the sub-streams are flowed (step 560 ) to the client machine ( 108 ).
- the client machine ( 108 ) processes the QoS objects (e.g. decompression).
- the processed sub-streams are then preferably re-multiplexed ( 470 , step 565 ) and passed as a composite stream to a “Media Player”, such as RealPlayer (RealPlayer is a registered trademark of Real Networks, Inc.) or Windows Media Player (Windows Media is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation) for playing ( 475 , step 570 ) on the client machine ( 108 ).
- RealPlayer RealPlayer is a registered trademark of Real Networks, Inc.
- Windows Media Player Windows Media is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation
- FIG. 6 shows an example of a hierarchically built profile for an “mpeg1” stream, whereby three “fields” objects representing data for an audio stream ( 600 ), video stream ( 610 ) and a “padding” stream ( 620 ) are shown.
- the associated objects ( 605 - 625 ) represent additional data associated with the streams. For example, in the case of the audio stream ( 600 ), the number of audio sub-streams present is detailed ( 605 ).
- each of the sub-streams are associated with further objects.
- a “fields” object ( 630 ) represents data for one audio sub-stream.
- the object ( 630 ) encapsulates data representing a unique sub-stream identifier ( 635 ) and the protection policy ( 640 ) for the sub-stream.
- Further objects for a plurality of audio sub-streams (or video sub-streams) may also be included in the profile, but these are not shown.
- An “mpeg1 movie” file (essentially a “flat” file) comprises different sections.
- the architecture of this file defines the location of data within the file. In this case, by parsing the flat file, it is known that the system-header information is found after a 4-byte identifier. Once located, the system-header information can be extracted. The parsing process steps through the file (validating the system header information, extracting sub-stream specific data etc.) until the profile is complete. It should be understood, that the profile described herein is for example purposes only and the profile could be implemented in any other way.
- a movie media file comprising subtitles in various languages (e.g. English, Spanish, German and Chinese) is requested from a client machine in China and the file is also requested from a client machine in the United Kingdom.
- An administrator could set up the content server so that the file is streamed to the client machines with different QoS objects. For example, if the media file is requested from a Chinese speaking user, the file could be streamed along with Chinese language subtitles only. However, if the media file is requested from an English speaking user, the file could be streamed along with English language subtitles only. Obviously, this would be beneficial for the streaming overhead.
- a further advantage of the present invention allows efficient delivery of stream data, without the necessity for the existence a particular type of header or equivalent data prefacing the media file.
- a flexible super-set of “media file header information” is provided. Furthermore, since it is the profile (and not the data content) that is initially sent to the client machine, the processing overhead is kept low. For example, by only sending the profile to the client machine, even if a client machine cannot accept the data content, network resources have not been strained, since the profile is comparatively smaller in size than the data content.
Abstract
Description
-
- A Header object—defines the characteristics of the stream, or sub-streams
- A Data object—comprises the digitized data packets of the media streams or sub-streams
- An Index object—defines index entries which point to the data packets, in order to synchronize streams to a common timeline, so that video and audio streams are not out of synch for example.
