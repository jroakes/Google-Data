" public(open) " label is applied to talk 107 by family or the second user, talks 107
Just can be chosen as Search Results by server.
Figure 1B is that the figure that conversation type is putd question to and answered is described, specifically, focuses on following aspect:
Search engine determines whether that suggestion user initiates and the talk of trust participant obtains problem
Answer.Query terms can be input to the search box 151 of search engine homepage 150 by user, and
And select SEARCH control 152 to initiate to use the search inquiry of query terms that inputted
Perform.Search engine is referred to candidate trust participant pond 154, including the social networks of user
Friend 155 and 156 and advertiser 158 and 159, and may determine that any candidate trust is joined
Knowing specially in terms of the theme being associated with the query terms inputted whether it is likely to be of with person
Know, and/or whether any candidate trust participant can be provided that being considered to make customer satisfaction system
Answer.
In the first example shown in the upper left of Figure 1B, user have input query terms
“song caveman ad”.Search engine can be from user 155 and 156 and advertiser 158
Have selected to be supplied to the information of search engine with 159, determine user 155 and theme " music
(music) " there is association, it matches with query terms " song ", and advertiser 158
Have with theme " caveman mascot(cave people's mascot) " and associate, itself and query terms
" caveman " matches.Search engine can also check the grading of advertiser 158, its
" 7/10 ", is likely larger than predetermined threshold value.Identify due to search engine and be likely to be of
Two candidate trust participants of the expertise of the theme of the query terms inputted, search is drawn
Hold up and determine that online talk may be of value to the answer obtaining the problem to user.Therefore, search is drawn
Hold up and problem input domain 113 and POST control 114 is included on search-engine results page 110.
Search engine can use other information useful to determine whether online talk is probably, such as,
(i.e., only two) of the lesser amt that the query terms that is identified as and inputted is relevant search
Hitch fruit.
In the second example shown in the lower-left of Figure 1B, user have input query terms " Car
80 ' s Detective Show Hawaii Mustache Guy ", to determine with Hawaii as setting
The a certain eighties in 20th century TV programme in, bearded a certain TV detective driven
Vehicle.User may have input this inquiry, such as, to find the warp selling similar automobile
Pin business or sell the toys store of model of this automobile.
The query terms inputted based on these, search engine may determine that user 155 or 156 all
It is not associated with any theme corresponding to inquiry, but advertiser 159 and theme " autos(vapour
Car) " there is association, it matches with query terms " car ".Search engine checks advertiser
The grading of 159, it is likely less than predetermined threshold value in " 1/10 ".This information, with finger
Show that the posted data of the most substantial amounts of reply of advertiser 159 combine, promote search engine true
It will not be favourable that fixed and as trust participant advertiser 159 carries out talking.Due to pond 154
Candidate trust participant selected based on the query terms that inputted by search engine, search is drawn
Hold up generation search-engine results page 160, it includes result 161 to 163, but not including that for
Initiate problem input domain or the POST control of online talk.
Even if finally it is to be noted that search engine only identifies social networks friend or only knows
Other advertiser, search engine still can advise user to initiate online talking.Iff social activity
Network friend is identified, then any advertiser can not included for trusting participation by online talk
It is initiated in the case of person.Be identified iff advertiser, then online talk can be initiated,
The advertiser wherein identified and the social networks friend of user are as trusting participant.
Fig. 2 is the flow chart of example process 200.Briefly, process 200 includes following
Action: determine that user has had been filed on problem and checked, wherein for the online trust participant talked
Trust participant and include one or more social network of user, one or more advertiser and user
Network friend；From the acquisition trusted the participant reply to problem；And this reply is carried
Participant is trusted in supply.
In more detail, when user submits a question or during information request (202), and process 200 starts
(201).User can submit a question to be intended for trust participant and check or user can submit to
Problem is checked for trust participant and non-trusted participant.Attempt to use search engine user
And fail location answer or find search experience the most unsatisfactory after or draw in search
Hold up the online talk of deduction may be of value to acquisition to the answer of problem after, the submission to problem can
To occur.Problem can be submitted to from any source, such as product search page or social media website.
Trust participant can include one of user, one or more advertiser and user or
Multiple social networks friends.As an alternative, trust participant and can only include one or more advertisement
Advocate peace one or more social networks friend or only include one or more social networks friend and
User.The most as an alternative, trust participant can include user, one or more advertiser,
One or more social networks friends and neither advertiser is not the one of social networks friend
Individual or multiple other people or entities.
One or more advertisers can be expection there is the expertise about problem work as thing
Side, the party concerned paid for the right of reply problem or additionally by search engine or other letters
Participant's row is appointed to match the party concerned of problem.Social networks friend can by with user
Online relation is familiar party concerned, such as Facebook " friend Friends() ", Buzz
Or Twitter " Followers(follower) " or Linked-in " Connections(connection
System) ".When the submission that user's selection can such as occur on search engine homepage or result page
During control, problem can be submitted.
Fig. 4 illustrates search engine when performing use query terms 402(" flowers that look like
Birds(looks like the flower of bird) ") search inquiry time the search-engine results page that generated
401.Although Search Results 404 and 405 is relevant with query terms 402, but Search Results 404
Do not have to answer the problem inferred by query terms 402, specifically, problem " What with 405
is the name of the flowers that look like birds?(look like the title of the flower of bird
What is？) ".
Submit to control 406 to allow user to submit to be imported in tA entry field 407 or based on looking into
Ask the problem that word 402 automatically generates.Problem is submitted to and initiates the follower 409 user
(such as, social networks friend) and expert to credit 410(is such as, advertiser) between talk.
Use drop-down menu 411, user can change arrange with allow other, non-trusted participant ginseng
If with talk or search engine talk is identified as with other, non-trusted participant with
After search inquiry be correlated with, then allow other, non-trusted participant check talk.
Fig. 5 illustrates user by problem 502(" What's the name of those orange
and purple flowers that look like birds? Where can I buy them?") input
Under state in tA entry field 407, a part 501 for search-engine results page 401.Ask
Each in topic 502 can be to be stated by user and be manually entered into tA entry field 407
In natural language problem or in problem 502 each can submit to control 406 selected
Automatically stated before or after selecting.User by selecting submits to control 406 to submit to
Problem 502, thus initiate talk.
Problem illustrates to the people trusting participant or entity being identified as talk.Such as, user
Social networks friend can check problem in its respective social media stream.By individual or real
Body is identified as trusting participant and can relate to: such as by identifying have in terms of the theme of problem
The advertiser of specific specialized knowledge, selects the advertiser that particular problem should be routed to.
The reply (204) to problem can be obtained from trusting participant.Reply can include asking
Any other comment answered or can occur in talk of topic.Such as, participant can send out
Note reply incoherent with the theme of problem, maybe can post other advertisers can be promoted to mate
Different problems to talk.

Accuse main reply (205) of posting.Party concerned can check partly or entirely other comments, so
And, each participant is likely to be of to be provided establishment, " identical " and deletes all of comment
The different rights of power, and the observability authority about customer identification information or user contact infonnation.
Fig. 6 graphical user interface 601, its display problem 502 and to the reply 602 of problem to
609.Reply 602 to 609 includes social networks friend (" the Joshua(about book from user
Sub-) ") reply 602 and 604, from user's (" Emily(EMILY) ") return
Multiple 603,606 and 609, and from advertiser's (" Daniel(Denier) " reply)
607 enrich one's knowledge in terms of the theme that problem 502 proposes.Problem 502 and reply 602
Showing in the talk district 610 of user interface 601 to 609, it is located proximate to text input
The place in district 611.Input text area 611 includes for allowing user submit other problem to or send out
The note tA entry field 612 to the reply of problem.
Advertiser from talk benefit because he can consult problem 502 and reply 602 to 604,
The text of 606 and 609, to be more fully understood by linguistic context or the structure of the needs of user.Such
Information provides valuable insight to advertiser, and it can be used to the society based on user or user
That hands over network friend replys the clue generating the social networks friend to user or user.
Additionally, user benefits from talk.Specifically, owing to the friend of user participates in talk, extensively
Accuse master can feel can not respond with answer misleading, rubbish or dishonest or carry
Other social pressure for irrational proposal.Such as, advertiser will be if it is known that will may by him
The many individuals that can not identify check and compare and declare, then may declare about its product making
(that is, " flown in from Kauai twice a week ") is more careful.In this, when not having
The friend having user chips in to talk and points out that advertiser is likely not to have to tell the truth or advertiser is another
When being unworthy outward the dealing of user, user can be to the business transaction sense entered with advertiser's business
To more confidence.
The different participants of talk can have different clearance levels, its control user whether by
Allow adds, edit, delete, label is applied to talk in problem reply or appointment
Currently without participating in other parties concerned of talk as trusting participant.In figure 6, such as,
User has enough clearance levels and uses editor's link 614 to 617 editor's problems 502 respectively
And reply 603,606 and 609 and use " Like " to link 619 by " Like " label
It is applied to talk or problem or reply.User does not has enough clearance levels to edit other times
Multiple.
Problem and any reply of problem is partly or entirely trusted before participant checks at it
Can be anonymous.Such as, talk can its before advertiser illustrates anonymous, to remove
Identify the information of the participant of talk.If participant has enough clearance levels, such as,
If they have purchased the right of the talk checking non-anonymous, then talk can be the most anonymous
In the case of checked by this participant.
Problem, reply and/or any other information relevant with talk are stored in search engine rope
In drawing, thus terminal procedure 200(207).Problem and response are collected and index so that it
Can future searches ask in be reused.This can be to use following form: from tradition
Inquiry that query learning is more fully stated and by by the interior unit weight collected by thoughtful response
Newly it is exposed to the similar request in the landing page of index.
Fig. 3 is the flow chart of example process 300.Briefly, process 300 includes following
Action: obtain search inquiry；Resource search inquiry responded by search engine identification,
Wherein resource includes the information quoting online talk, and in this online talk, user has had been filed on asking
Inscribe to check and one or more problem being carried out of trusting in participant by trusting participant
Reply, and wherein trust participant includes user, one or more advertiser and the one of user
Individual or multiple social networks friends；And provide the information identifying resource for display.
When obtaining search inquiry (302), process 300 starts (301).When user will look into
Ask word input search box, the search box on such as search engine homepage or search-engine results page
Time, search inquiry can be obtained.
Search engine can identify the resource (304) responding search inquiry.Resource includes
Quoting the information of online talk, in this online talk, user has had been filed on problem to be joined by trust
Check with person and one or more problem being replied of trusting in participant.Trust ginseng
With one or more social networkies that person can include user, one or more advertiser and user
Friend.
There is provided the information identifying resource for display (305), thus terminate this process (306).
Information can include one or more Search Results, it unified resource location including quoting talk
Accord with (URL), problem, the description of corresponding resource, extract from corresponding resource automatic or manual
Or the extracts of the text being additionally associated with corresponding resource.
Fig. 7 graphical user interface 701, it is that search engine is performing use query terms 702
The search engine knot generated after the search inquiry of (" flowers that look like birds ")
Really page.Except identify quote the Search Results 704 of the web resource relevant to query terms 702 to
Outside 706, the Search Results 707 of talk illustrated in figure 6 is quoted in search engine identification.
The user only initiating search inquiry is the social networks friend of user, and online talk just can be by
Search engine identification.Therefore, for not being the social networks friend of user and submitting identical searching to
Another user of rope inquiry, talk can occur not as Search Results.
Fig. 8 is the system 800 that can be implemented in the various features described in this document wherein
Schematic diagram.Generally speaking, system 800 allow each user to post in social networks framework,
Consult and the various active flows of review information.Such as, user can send about user's
Recent occurrence or the microblogging model of news article read recently about user in life.Should
Model can be forwarded to select to follow its of first user (it can be individual or entity)
He is user.Those other users can use stream reader to see that this model or this model can
With (such as, consistent with their conventional e-mail messages in their e-mail applications
Or under independent Shipping Options Page) display.Those users can select to comment on regard to model, and
Model can also be commented on by other users or comment to other users is commented on.So
Even if comment they make after originally model is connected to e-mail applications, it is also possible to
It is included and illustrates in each user email is applied.It is convenient to therefore, it can on a ground
Make various types of feedback can obtain for each user sharply.User can also be by visiting
Ask that the profile page of other users sees the model relevant with those other users, and all right
Forward their its own profile page or their stream page to all models seen them and subscribe to and right
The comment of model.
Various models and the comment to model are managed by active flow rear end 802 in system 800,
It is responsible for the various submissions realizing the system that is defined into 800 the affair logic by processed mode.
The feature of active flow is movable, and it is model (such as, the microblogging that user submits to system 800
Model) theme and for the various comments of those activities.Such as, user can be by inciting somebody to action
The URL of page page of posting is posted the activity of the webpage the most just checked about them.
Such action can promote system 800 to gather important information from this URL, is included on the page
The descriptor of the theme of the image of display, title, the label of image or the description page is (such as,
As such as used the ADSENSE of the page to analyze, previously passed word on the page is analyzed
Determine).System 800 can also obtain positional information, the current location of such as user and/or
(such as, user registers recently or is identified as user and is positioned in the place that user is associated most
The place in place).
Active flow rear end 802 also realizes for determining which user receives model, comments model
The logic of other parts of the stream in opinion and system 800.Specifically, when subscribing to from other
User receives when the user of model signs in system 800 can provide model to them, when other
When user is not conventionally included in stream, user can nominate those other users and receive
The copy (such as, by keying in the identifier of those other users when consulting model) of stream,
And user can mutually directly transmit stream etc..
Reader rear end 804 of feeding is the storage that system 800 manages model and related data.Feedback
To reader rear end 804 may rely on the active storage 846 of various rank to store model,
It is needed for user builds stream to the comment of model and when user is to system 800 solicited message
Other information.Other assemblies as shown in the figure, although feeding reader rear end 804
It is shown as single piece, however, it is possible to use multiple different server or server subsystem
Realize.Similarly, active storage 846 can across multiple data bases and type of database, with
And realize across multiple server and server subsystem.
When model or other renewals be have received by active flow rear end 802, they are formatted also
And be provided to update pump 808.Update pump 808 to be responsible for needing the various of such information
Service provides the notice about the information recently posted.It practice, it is as having with system 800
The router of the information closed and distributor.Such as, mail server 814 can include for whole
Display functional, accordingly, it may be desirable to know new model so that at new letter at interflow
When breath is posted, can illustrate to the user of Mail Clients immediately.In a similar manner, search
Engine 830 can provide a user with Search Results, and it includes just being supplied to system from user
The real-time update information of various models, and can be via the API understood and remote procedure call
(RPC) by with update pump 808 and receive such more fresh information alternately, wherein API and
Two assemblies of RPC are the sub-components of bigger scope of organization system.
There is provided various web front-end to allow system 800 (and neighbouring by such as the Internet
Support network) network 806 communicate.Such as, mail server 814 can provide typical
E-mail functionality based on web, although via Mail Clients 820, by model and comment
It is integrated into the inbox of user.Such as, stream can demonstrate as discrete in the inbox of user
Message, and can be real time updated include about stream recent reviews and for stream
Original model.Such content can be movable, because if user just reads in dedicated stream
Device consults stream, then user can be allowed to such content the most substantially arrive they can
Level.Such as, can selected control can be provided with by shown by email client 820
Stream, and user can select one with comment of posting be added to stream, without leaving
Message linguistic context in email client 820.
Profile server 810 generates and is used for representing user profiles, such as user Joe Qiao Blow(cloth
Lip river) the code of profile 822.Profile page can be to use following form: from social networks station
The standard of point is fed page, its according to reversion time sequence arrangement have from other users model and
The list of comment.In a similar manner, movable front end 812 can be user (be used herein to name
For Susie User(Su Qian user) user) page 824 of feeding generates similar feeding.Profile
Page 822 and feed page 824 can be the most closely similar, and can show and be shown as postal
Posting or content that the part of microblogging part is similar of part client 820.In one example,
Profile page 822 is the content that third party sees when they check the account of user, and page of feeding
824 is the content that user self sees.
Search engine 830 and the search front end 818 being associated can be that system 800 provides different
Kind functional.Specifically, search front end 818 can allow user from such as search box
Non-traditional source provides model or comment, such as, on search and webpage or being arranged on its machine,
With its web browser cooperation operation toolbar on search box in.Such model or comment
Can be submitted to by user, and can be received in the standard fashion by search front end, as search please
As asking.User submits model rather than search inquiry (or in addition to search inquiry, also submitting model to) to
Intention can by submit to syntactic analysis determine.In one example, if alphabetical
" z ", before inquiry, has space (screen 828) behind seldom as actual search
The structural system that inquiry is submitted to can separately resolve this submission, and assumes user from syntax
It is intended to post its social networks the remainder of the inquiry submitted to as model.
Immediately or such note can be sent afterwards confirming that they are intended to post to submission user
Son.Such as, search results pages 826 can be generated, and it comprises search engine 830 with routine
Mode uses (either to be had from what the data indexing 838 generated about the inquiry submitted to
With or without preceding " z ") actual search results, and can in following region it
Lower shown: to user, the form of proposed model to be shown and note can be edited by its user
Son, then can confirm that information posted to friend, follower or other people intention optional
Control.Then model (such as, can sign in realization system as user with the identification information of user
During the wide in range service of system 800, the ID that cookie from the calculating equipment of user identifies)
Together, search front end 818 it is transmitted to active flow rear end 802.
Other syntaxes that user is submitted to can produce Different Results.Such as, if user inputs
(such as, form name@domain.com's) e-mail address, then system can will be somebody's turn to do
The residue text of submission is sent to provided as email message by Syntactic Recognition by instruction
The intention of user of e-mail address.Similarly, if user is with heel communication pattern mark
The command character knowing symbol starts to submit to, then can subsidiary or subsidiary first displaying to user built
The action of view, and in the case of confirming that user is intended to allow such communication occur, communicate with tat
The remainder that pattern is submitted to is for posting.Such as, if user keys in " z blog I ' m
Having a great time ", then to system 800, syntax can point out that user is intended to be submitted to
Blog (the wherein body of blog of phrase " I ' m having a good time " this user that posts
Part can be used by system 800 and be stored in the ID on the calculating equipment of user as cookie
Determine, and it can be interrelated with the account of user, the account of user and then and blog
Interrelated).
Search Results and other information (such as, model and email message) can be attended by
For search inquiry or other similar information, the model of such as profile information, user or comment
Text and user have related user (such as, as friend, follower or first user
The user followed) model or the targeted ads of text of comment.Such advertisement can be passed through
Search front end 818 or other front ends 810,812,814 are distributed to the user of system 800, and
And those as utilized in GOOGLE ADWORDS OR ADSENSE can be used
Technology be directed.The such of advertisement distributes the advertisement can depended in data base 834
Data, its can include the information about advertiser, for the text of advertisement and other guide,
Bid that each advertiser is submitted to and distribute the advertisement for user and/or refer to from user or
For other relevant informations needed for the flow of information of user.
Such as send the position (such as, latitude/longitude coordinates) of model or comment from it by identifying
Or place (such as, shop, space for activities, bar or restaurant), can be by various based on position
The service put combines with model or comment.Such service is in this example system 800
Thered is provided by location server 842 and geographical service 844.Location server 842 commonly responds to
Receive the positional information about the user of system 800 and the letter about place or other terrestrial references is provided
Breath.Such as, when user submits model to, the geographical coordinate of user can (such as, via with
GPS on the mobile computing device at family is functional) it is provided together with model or can (example
As, via cell tower or access point identification or triangulation) determined for user by system 800.
Geographical location information can be estimated latitude and the longitude of mobile computing device and identify estimation
The information of accuracy.Can by API make location server 842 to system 800 various its
He can use by assembly.
Location server 842 can use such geographical location information to identify the one of user
As one or more places (such as, shop, restaurant or bar) in position, it is possible to use
User and the nearness in each place and other signals are (such as, as from together with the title of place
The popularity in each place, the user of system 800 that the search inquiry submitted to determines are on the scene
Activity that residing registration is associated with the model from place, the reputation of the author of model,
Such as by the quantity of subscriber, determine for the comment amount of model or the similar of subscriber
Reputation) provide the user may the ranked list in place in the geographic area at place.Can be to
User shows the single suggestion to place or the place of some suggestions.Then user can select one
Individual such place, and this place can be relevant to this model when other users consult model
Connection.Such as, model can be attended by the metadata that instruction model " is posted from Dive Bar ", with
And other users can select title " Dive Bar " to see the other information about this place,
Including from this place other models, the grading in this place, belong to the stream in this place (such as,
If the manager in this place has made this place become the user of system 800) and other be similar to
Information.
Location server 842 can obtain it from the various external service of such as geographical service 844
Such functional required information is provided.Geographical service 844 can be to lead to via standard API
Letter carrys out receiving position information (such as, latitude/longitude coordinates) and provides higher level as response
The service of information.The information of higher level can include being determined being associated with latitude/longitude coordinates
Street address (ground, such as, nearest with the ad-hoc location represented by latitude/longitude coordinates street
Location).The information of higher level can also include geographically near ad-hoc location place name list,
The ground that street address about place, the description information about place are associated with ad-hoc location
Figure tile and the relevance score in each place.The relevance score in each place is permissible
Any appropriately combined degree of correlation identifying particular place based on following: (i) received
Positional information；(ii) the accuracy of the positional information received；And (iii) in place and institute
Distance between the position that the positional information received is identified.
Other assemblies can provide other function with the component interaction having described that for system 800
Property.Such as, crawler 850 can be that the purpose being indexed the content in system 800 is climbed
Taking various model and comment so that such as, search engine 830 can easily deliver and include using
The family up-to-date Search Results posted to system 800.Further, rubbish server 848 can be with
Active flow rear end 802 and/or renewal pump 808 communication identify and are probably inappropriate (such as, attacking
Hitting property, humiliate or the most unsuitable), replicate, deception (such as, Qi Zhongyi
Individual user pretends another user) model or comment, and about such content suitably
Action is (such as, it is provided that automatically and/or manually consulting and may move from system 800 content
Content is perhaps made to hide except interior).
Finally, can provide (such as, via active flow rear end 802) to recommendation server 840
Submit to any new activity or the model of system 800.Recommendation server 840 can be about answering
When the number of reception activity is written back to active flow rear end 802.Such information can be saved, and makes
Obtain the next message about activity and be sent out (such as, the comment to movable), new recommendation
User also obtains this activity.When determining which user should receive activity, quality can be calculated
Score value, and this score value can be by such as following because usually determining: user and post
Or the distance of the relation between other users of recommendation activity, as in the profile of user identify
(such as, user is the member of the classical automobile group in social networks to the interest of user, the most more
May receive about the movable notice relevant with classical automobile) or as sent by user
Model or other submit interest, the user that follows of user or the activity etc. identified to.Quality threshold can
To be arranged by recommendation server 840, (not many and less with the recommendation maintaining proper level
Few).
Using the assembly being described herein as, then, system 800 can provide various patterns
Post and the integration of content provided with stream be provided, described content such as microblogging model and to this
The comment of the model of sample.User can post in every way, including search page of directly posting
