Description
- Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.
- Augmented reality generally refers to a real-time view of a real-world environment that is augmented with additional content. Typically, a user experiences augmented reality through the use of a computing device. The computing device is typically configured to generate the real-time view of the environment, either by allowing a user to directly view the environment or by allowing the user to indirectly view the environment by generating and displaying a real-time representation of the environment to be viewed by the user.
- Further, the computing device is typically configured to generate the additional content. The additional content may include, for example, a user-interface through which the user may interact with the computing device. Typically, the computing device overlays the view of the environment with the user-interface, such that the user sees the view of the environment and the user-interface at the same time.
- In some cases, a user-interface overlaying a view of an environment may obscure one or more objects in the environment or may appear cluttered, which may be undesirable for a user. For this reason, a user-interface that includes content that is outside a view region of the user-interface may be beneficial. The user-interface may be configured to bring the content into the view region in response to a trigger.
- Disclosed is such a user-interface. In one embodiment, the user-interface may include a view region and a menu that is not fully visible in the view region.
- In one aspect, a method is disclosed. The method comprises receiving data corresponding to a first position of a wearable computing device and responsively causing the wearable computing device to provide a user-interface comprising a view region and a menu. The view region substantially fills a field of view of the wearable computing device and the menu is not fully visible in the view region. The method further comprises receiving movement data corresponding to a movement of the wearable computing device from the first position to a second position and, based on the movement data, making a first determination that the movement has a first angular velocity along a first direction. The method further includes making a second determination that the first angular velocity exceeds a first threshold angular velocity and, responsive to the first and second determinations, causing the wearable computing device to move the menu in a direction opposite the first direction such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region.
- In another aspect, a non-transitory computer readable medium is disclosed having stored therein instructions executable by a computing device to cause the computing device to perform the functions of the method described above.
- In yet another aspect, a wearable computing device is disclosed. The wearable computing device comprises at least one processor and data storage. The data storage comprises instructions executable by the at least one processor to receive data corresponding to a first position of a wearable computing device and responsively cause the wearable computing device to provide a user-interface comprising a view region and a menu. The view region substantially fills a field of view of the wearable computing device and the menu is not fully visible in the view region. The instructions are further executable by the at least one processor to receive movement data corresponding to a movement of the wearable computing device from the first position to a second position and, based on the movement data, make a first determination that the movement has a first angular velocity along a first direction. The instructions are still further executable by the at least one processor to make a second determination that the first angular velocity exceeds a first threshold angular velocity and, responsive to the first and second determinations, cause the wearable computing device to move the menu in a direction opposite the first direction such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region.

In the figures, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, figures, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated herein.
- Disclosed is a user-interface that avoids obscuring or cluttering a user's view of an environment. The user-interface may be provided by, for example, a wearable computing device.
- The user-interface may include a view region and a menu. In embodiments where the user-interface is provided by a wearable computing device, the view region may substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device. Further, the menu may not be fully visible in the view region. For example, the menu may be to the left of the view region, such that only a rightward portion of the menu is visible in the view region. As another example, the menu may be above the view region, and the menu may not be visible in the view region at all. Other examples are possible as well.
- The wearable computing device may be configured to detect one or more predetermined movements, such as a first movement of the wearable computing device. The first movement may have a first angular velocity along a first direction. The first angular velocity may be, for example, a maximum angular velocity of the first movement over a period of time, or may be an average angular velocity of the first movement over a period of time. The first angular velocity may take other forms as well.
- The wearable computing device may compare the first angular velocity to a first threshold angular velocity. The first threshold angular velocity may be predetermined. For example, the first threshold angular velocity may be predetermined based on one or more preferences of a user of the wearable computing device. In this example, the user may be able to adjust or vary the first threshold angular velocity by modifying the preferences. As another example, the first threshold angular velocity may be predetermined based on calibration data measured during calibration of the wearable computing device. As still another example, the first threshold angular velocity may have a value that is preset by, for instance, a manufacturer of the device. The first threshold angular velocity may take other forms as well.
- In response to determining that the first angular velocity exceeds the first threshold angular velocity, the wearable computing device may cause the menu to become more visible in the view region. For example, one or both of the view region and the menu may move, such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region. Other examples are possible as well.
- An example wearable computing device is further described below in connection with
FIGS. 1A-4 . An example user-interface is further described below in connection withFIGS. 5A-G .

In these embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to detect that the movement has a second angular velocity along the second direction. - The other user-
interface devices 428 may include, for example, one or more cameras or detectors, one or more sensors, and/or a finger-operable touch pad, which may be included in thecomputing system 400, similar to those described above in connection withFIG. 1A , or may be included in one or more peripheral devices that may be connected to the computing system. Other user-interface devices 428 are possible as well. - Furthermore,
computing system 400 may also include one or moredata storage devices 424, which can be removable storage devices, non-removable storage devices, or a combination thereof. Examples of removable storage devices and non-removable storage devices include magnetic disk devices such as flexible disk drives and hard-disk drives (HDD), optical disk drives such as compact disk (CD) drives or digital versatile disk (DVD) drives, solid state drives (SSD), and/or any other storage device now known or later developed. Computer storage media can include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. For example, computer storage media may take the form of RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium now known or later developed that can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by computingsystem 400. - According to an example embodiment,
computing system 400 may includeprogram instructions 426 that are stored in the data storage 404 (and/or possibly in another data-storage medium) and executable byprocessor 402 to facilitate the various functions described herein including, but not limited to, those functions described with respect toFIG. 7 . In some embodiments,data storage 404 may further include a first threshold angular velocity. Further, in some embodiments,data storage 404 may include a second threshold angular velocity.Data storage 404 may include additional information as well. - Although various components of
computing system 400 are shown as distributed components, it should be understood that any of such components may be physically integrated and/or distributed according to the desired configuration of the computing system. -
FIGS. 5A-G show aspects of an example user-interface 500, in accordance with an embodiment. The user-interface 500 may be displayed by, for example, a wearable computing device, such as any of the wearable computing devices described above. - An example state of the user-
interface 500 is shown inFIG. 5A . The example state shown inFIG. 5A may correspond to a first position of the wearable computing device. That is, the user-interface 500 may be displayed as shown inFIG. 5A when the wearable computing device is in the first position. In some embodiments, the first position of the wearable computing device may correspond to a position of the wearable computing device when a user of the wearable computing device is looking in a direction that is generally parallel to the ground (e.g., a position that does not correspond to the user looking up or looking down) and/or generally straight forward (e.g., a position that does not correspond to the user looking left or looking right). Other examples are possible as well. - As shown, the user-
interface 500 includes aview region 502. An example boundary of theview region 502 is shown by a dotted frame. While theview region 502 is shown to have a landscape shape (in which theview region 502 is wider than it is tall), in other embodiments theview region 502 may have a portrait or square shape, or may have a non-rectangular shape, such as a circular or elliptical shape. Theview region 502 may have other shapes as well. - The
view region 502 may be, for example, the viewable area between (or encompassing) the upper, lower, left, and right boundaries of a display on the wearable computing device. Theview region 502 may thus be said to substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device. - As shown, when the wearable computing device is in the first position, the
view region 502 is substantially empty (e.g., completely empty) of user-interface elements, such that the user's view of the user's real-world environment is generally uncluttered, and objects in the user's environment are not obscured. - In some embodiments, the
view region 502 may correspond to a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and an area outside theview region 502 may correspond to an area outside the field of view of the user. In other embodiments, theview region 502 may correspond to a non-peripheral portion of a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and an area outside theview region 502 may correspond to a peripheral portion of the field of view of the user. In still other embodiments, the user-interface 500 may be larger than or substantially the same as a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and the field of view of the user may be larger than or substantially the same size as theview region 502. Theview region 502 may take other forms as well. - Accordingly, the portions of the user-
interface 500 outside of theview region 502 may be outside of or in a peripheral portion of a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device. For example, as shown, amenu 504 may be outside of or in a peripheral portion of the field of view of the user in the user-interface 500. In particular, themenu 504 is shown to be located to the left of theview region 502. In some embodiments, themenu 504 may extend further to the left, as indicated by the dotted line. While themenu 504 is shown to have a generally horizontal shape, in some embodiments themenu 504 may have a generally vertical shape, or may have another shape. - While the
menu 504 is shown to be not visible in theview region 502, in some embodiments themenu 504 may be partially visible in theview region 502. In general, however, when the wearable computing device is in the first position, themenu 504 may not be fully visible in the view region. - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to a movement of the wearable computing device from the first position to a second position. For example, the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to a movement of the wearable computing device from the first position to a second position to the left of the first position (e.g., in the reference frame of a user of the wearable computing device).
- Further, the wearable computing device may be configured to make a first determination that the movement has a first angular velocity along a first direction (e.g., a leftward direction). The first angular velocity may take any of the forms described above. The wearable computing device may then compare the first angular velocity to a first threshold angular velocity in order to make a second determination that the first angular velocity exceeds the first threshold angular velocity. The first threshold angular velocity may take any of the forms described above.
- Responsive to the first and second determinations, the wearable computing device may cause the
menu 504 to move in a direction opposite the first direction such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. For example, the wearable computing device may cause themenu 504 to move rightward such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. Alternately or additionally, the wearable computing device may cause theview region 504 to move in the first direction such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. For example, the wearable computing device may cause theview region 502 to move leftward such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. Theview region 502 and themenu 504 may move the same amount, or may move different amounts. For example, themenu 504 may move further than theview region 502. Other examples are possible as well. - In some embodiments, when the
view region 502 moves, theview region 502 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device as if mapped onto the inside of a static sphere centered at the wearable computing device, and a scrolling or panning movement of theview region 502 may map onto movement of the real-world environment relative to the wearable computing device. Theview region 502 may move in other manners as well. - The movement data corresponding to the movement may take several forms. For example, the movement data may be (or may be derived from) data received from one or more movement sensors, accelerometers, and/or gyroscopes configured to detect the movement, such as the
movement sensor 428 described above in connection withFIG. 4 . The one or more movement sensors may be included in the wearable computing device or may be included in a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. As another example, the movement data may be (or may be derived from) data received from a touch pad, such as the finger-operable touch pad 124 described above in connection withFIG. 1A , or other input device included in or coupled to the wearable computing device and configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. In some embodiments, the movement data may comprise an indication of the first angular velocity of the movement data. In other embodiments, the first angular velocity may be derivable from the movement data. For example, the movement data may comprise indications of an angle of rotation of the movement and a time period of the movement. The movement data may take other forms as well. -
FIG. 5B shows aspects of the example user-interface 500 after receiving movement data corresponding to a leftward movement having a first angular velocity that exceeds a first threshold angular velocity, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown, the user-interface 500 includes theview region 502 and themenu 504. - In response to receiving the movement data corresponding to the leftward movement and determining that the first angular velocity of the movement exceeds the first threshold angular velocity, the wearable computing device may move one or both of the
view region 502 and themenu 504 such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. As shown, the wearable computing device has moved themenu 504 rightward, as indicated by the dotted arrow. In general, the view region and/or themenu 504 may be moved in several manners. - In some embodiments, the
view region 502 and/or themenu 504 may be moved in a scrolling, panning, sliding, dropping, and/or jumping motion. For example, as theview region 502 moves leftward, themenu 504 may scroll or pan into view. In some embodiments, when theview region 502 moves back rightward, themenu 504 may be “pulled” rightward as well, and may remain in theview region 502. As another example, as theview region 502 moves leftward, themenu 504 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device to slide rightward into theview region 502. Other examples are possible as well. - In some embodiments, a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the scrolling, panning, sliding, and/or dropping may be based at least in part on a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the movement. For example, the wearable computing device may move the
view region 502 and/or themenu 504 at a rate based on the first angular velocity. Other examples are possible as well. Theview region 502 and/or themenu 504 may be moved in other manners as well. - While the foregoing description focused on leftward movement, in some embodiments the wearable computing device could be configured to receive data corresponding to other directional movement (e.g., rightward, upward, downward, etc.) as well, and the
view region 502 may be moved in response to receiving such data in a manner similar to that described above in connection with leftward movement. In these embodiments, rather than being positioned to the left of theview region 502, themenu 504 may be positioned outside theview region 502 in other directions (e.g., to the left of, above, below, etc.). -
FIG. 5C shows aspects of another example user-interface, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown inFIG. 5C , themenu 504 is positioned to the right of theview region 502. Each of theview region 502 and themenu 504 may take any of the forms described above. Further, while themenu 504 is shown to have a generally vertical shape, in some embodiments themenu 504 may have a generally horizontal shape, or may have another shape. - As described above, the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to a movement of the wearable computing device from the first position to a second position. For example, the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to a movement of the wearable computing device from the first position to a second position to the right of the first position (e.g., in the reference frame of a user of the wearable computing device).
- Further, the wearable computing device may be configured to make a first determination that the movement has a first angular velocity along a first direction (e.g., a rightward direction). The first angular velocity may take any of the forms described above. The wearable computing device may then compare the first angular velocity to a first threshold angular velocity in order to make a second determination that the first angular velocity exceeds the first threshold angular velocity. The first threshold angular velocity may take any of the forms described above.
- Responsive to the first and second determinations, the wearable computing device may cause the
menu 504 to move in a direction opposite the first direction such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. For example, the wearable computing device may cause themenu 504 to move leftward such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. Alternately or additionally, the wearable computing device may cause theview region 504 to move in the first direction such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. For example, the wearable computing device may cause theview region 502 to move rightward such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. -
FIG. 5D shows aspects of an example user-interface after receiving movement data corresponding to a first movement having a first angular velocity that exceeds a first threshold angular velocity, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown, the user-interface 500 includes theview region 502 and themenu 504. - In response to receiving the movement data corresponding to the rightward movement and determining that the first angular velocity of the movement exceeds the first threshold angular velocity, the wearable computing device may move one or both of the
view region 502 and themenu 504 such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. As shown, the wearable computing device has moved themenu 504 leftward, as indicated by the dotted arrow. Theview region 502 and/or themenu 504 may move in any of the manners described above. - In some embodiments, a user of the wearable computing device need not keep the wearable computing device at the second position to keep the
menu 504 at least partially visible in theview region 502. Rather, the user may return the wearable computing device to a more comfortable position (e.g., at or near the first position), and the wearable computing device may move themenu 504 and theview region 502 substantially together, thereby keeping themenu 504 at least partially visible in theview region 502. In this manner, the user may continue to interact with themenu 504 even after moving the wearable computing device to what may be a more comfortable position. - As shown, the
menu 504 includes a number of menu objects 506. In some embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in a ring (or partial ring) above or at/near the top of theview region 502. Alternately or additionally, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in a ring (or partial ring) around and above the head of a user of the wearable computing device. In other embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in a dome-shape above the user's head. The ring or dome may be centered above the wearable computing device and/or the user's head. In other embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in other ways as well. - The number of menu objects 506 in the
menu 504 may be fixed or may be variable. In embodiments where the number is variable, the menu objects 506 may vary in size according to the number of menu objects 506 in themenu 504. - Depending on the application of the wearable computing device, the menu objects 506 may take several forms. For example, the menu objects 506 may include one or more of people, contacts, groups of people and/or contacts, calendar items, lists, notifications, alarms, reminders, status updates, incoming messages, recorded media, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs, digital collages, previously-saved states, webpages, applications, and shortcuts (e.g., to control the behavior of one or more applications running the foreground or the background, such as a play shortcut, a pause shortcut, a home screen shortcut, a close shortcut, an end shortcut, etc.) or to control one or more parameters on the wearable computing device (such as a shortcut to turn on/off WiFi, a shortcut to turn on/off vibrate, and a shortcut to adjust volume, etc.), as well as tools for controlling or accessing one or more devices, such as a still camera, a video camera, and/or an audio recorder. Menu objects 506 may take other forms as well.
- In embodiments where the menu objects 506 include tools, the tools may be located in a particular region of the
menu 504, such as the center. In some embodiments, the tools may remain in the center of themenu 504, even if the other menu objects 506 rotate, as described above. Tool menu objects may be located in other regions of themenu 504 as well. - The particular menu objects 506 that are included in
menu 504 may be fixed or variable. For example, the menu objects 506 may be preselected by a user of the wearable computing device. In another embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be automatically assembled by the wearable computing device from one or more physical or digital contexts including, for example, people, places, and/or objects surrounding the wearable computing device, address books, calendars, social-networking web services or applications, photo sharing web services or applications, search histories, and/or other contexts. Further, some menu objects 506 may be fixed, while other menu objects 506 may be variable. The menu objects 506 may be selected in other manners as well. - Similarly, an order or configuration in which the menu objects 506 are displayed may be fixed or variable. In one embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be pre-ordered by a user of the wearable computing device. In another embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be automatically ordered based on, for example, how often each
menu object 506 is used (on the wearable computing device only or in other contexts as well), how recently eachmenu object 506 was used (on the wearable computing device only or in other contexts as well), an explicit or implicit importance or priority ranking of the menu objects 506, and/or other criteria. - As shown in
FIGS. 5B and 5D , only a portion of themenu 504 is visible in theview region 502. In particular, inFIG. 5B , while themenu 504 is vertically inside theview region 502, themenu 504 extends horizontally beyond theview region 502 such that a portion of themenu 504 is outside theview region 502. Similarly, inFIG. 5D , while themenu 504 is horizontally inside theview region 502, themenu 504 extends vertically beyond theview region 502 such that a portion of themenu 504 is outside the view region. As a result, in each ofFIGS. 5B and 5D one or more menu objects 506 may be only partially visible in theview region 502, or may not be visible in theview region 502 at all. In particular, in embodiments where the menu objects 506 extend circularly around a user's head, like a ring (or partial ring), a number of the menu objects 506 may be outside theview region 502. - In order to view menu objects 506 located outside the
view region 506, a user of the wearable computing device may interact with the wearable computing device to, for example, pan or rotate the menu objects 506 along a path (e.g., up or down, left or right, clockwise or counterclockwise) around the user's head. To this end, the wearable computing device may, in some embodiments, be configured to receive panning data indicating a direction. - The panning data may take several forms. For example, the panning data may be (or may be derived from) data received from one or more movement sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and/or detectors configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. The one or more movement sensors may be included in the wearable computing device, like the
sensor 122, or may be included in a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. As another example, the panning data may be (or may be derived from) data received from a touch pad, such as the finger-operable touch pad 124 described above in connection withFIG. 1A , or other input device included in or coupled to the wearable computing device and configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. In some embodiments, the panning data may take the form of a binary indication corresponding to the predetermined movement. In other embodiments, the panning data may comprise an indication corresponding to the predetermined movement as well as an extent of the predetermined movement, such as a magnitude, speed, and/or acceleration of the predetermined movement. The panning data may take other forms as well. - The predetermined movements may take several forms. In some embodiments, the predetermined movements may be certain movements or sequence of movements of the wearable computing device or peripheral device. In some embodiments, the predetermined movements may include one or more predetermined movements defined as no or substantially no movement, such as no or substantially no movement for a predetermined period of time. In embodiments where the wearable computing device is a head-mounted device, one or more predetermined movements may involve a predetermined movement of the user's head that moves the wearable computing device in a corresponding manner. Alternatively or additionally, the predetermined movements may involve a predetermined movement of a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. The peripheral device may similarly be wearable by a user of the wearable computing device, such that the movement of the peripheral device may follow a movement of the user, such as, for example, a movement of the user's hand. Still alternatively or additionally, one or more predetermined movements may be, for example, a movement across a finger-operable touch pad or other input device. Other predetermined movements are possible as well.
- In these embodiments, in response to receiving the panning data, the wearable computing device may move the menu based on the direction, such that the portion of the menu moves insides the view region.
-
FIG. 5E shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving panning data indicating a direction, in accordance with an embodiment. As indicated by the dotted arrow, themenu 504 has been moved. To this end, the panning data may have indicated, for example, that the user tilted the user's head to the left, and the wearable computing device may have responsively moved themenu 504 in downward. As another example, the panning data may have indicated a predetermined downward movement across a touch pad included in our coupled to the wearable computing device. Other examples are possible as well. - Returning to
FIG. 5D , in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive from the user a selection of amenu object 506 from themenu 504. To this end, the user-interface 500 may include acursor 508, shown inFIG. 5D as a reticle, which may navigated around theview region 502 to select menu objects 506 from themenu 504. Alternatively, thecursor 508 may be “locked” in the center of theview region 502, and themenu 504 may be static. Then, theview region 502, along with the lockedcursor 508, may be navigated over thestatic menu 504 to select menu objects 506 from themenu 504. In some embodiments, thecursor 508 may be controlled by a user of the wearable computing device through one or more predetermined movements. Thecursor 508 may always be present on the device, or may become visible only at certain times, such as when themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. Accordingly, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive selection data corresponding to the one or more predetermined movements. The selection data may take any of the forms described above in connection with the panning data. - As shown, a user of the wearable computing device has navigated the
cursor 508 to themenu object 506 using one or more predetermined movements. In order to select themenu object 506, the user may perform an additional predetermined movement, such as holding thecursor 508 over themenu object 506 for a predetermined period of time. The user may select themenu object 506 in other manners as well. - In some embodiments, the
menu 504, one or more menu objects 506, and/or other objects in the user-interface 500 may function as “gravity wells,” such that when thecursor 508 is within a predetermined distance of the object, thecursor 508 is drawn towards the object by “gravity.” Additionally, thecursor 508 may remain on the object until a predetermined movement having a magnitude, speed, and/or acceleration greater than a predetermined threshold is detected. In this manner, a user may more easily navigate thecursor 508 to the object and hold thecursor 508 over the object so as to select the object. - Once a
menu object 506 is selected, the wearable computing device may cause themenu object 506 to be displayed in theview region 502 as a selected menu object.FIG. 5F shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving selection data indicating selection of a selectedmenu object 510, in accordance with an embodiment. - As indicated by the dotted arrow, the
menu object 506 is displayed in theview region 502 as a selectedmenu object 510. As shown, the selectedmenu object 510 is displayed larger and in more detail in theview region 502 than in themenu 504. In other embodiments, however, the selectedmenu object 510 could be displayed in theview region 502 smaller than or the same size as, and in less detail than or the same detail as, themenu 504. In some embodiments, additional content (e.g., actions to be applied to, with, or based on the selectedmenu object 510, information related to the selectedmenu object 510, and/or modifiable options, preferences, or parameters for the selectedmenu object 510, etc.) may be showed adjacent to or nearby the selectedmenu object 510 in theview region 502. - Once the selected
menu object 510 is displayed in theview region 502, a user of the wearable computing device may interact with the selectedmenu object 510. For example, as the selectedmenu object 510 is shown as an email inbox, the user may select one of the emails in the email inbox to read. Depending on the selected menu object, the user may interact with the selected menu object in other ways as well (e.g., the user may locate additional information related to the selectedmenu object 510, modify, augment, and/or delete the selectedmenu object 510, etc.). To this end, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive input data corresponding to one or more predetermined movements indicating interactions with the user-interface 500. The input data may take any of the forms described above in connection with the movement data and/or the selection data. -
FIG. 5G shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving input data corresponding to a user input, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown, a user of the wearable computing device has navigated thecursor 508 to a particular subject line in the email inbox and selected the subject line. As a result, theemail 512 is displayed in the view region, so that the user may read theemail 512. The user may interact with the user-interface 500 in other manners as well, depending on, for example, the selected menu object. - While provided in the
view region 502, the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selected menu object 510 (e.g., the email 512) may be “locked” to the center of theview region 502. That is, if theview region 502 moves for any reason (e.g., in response to movement of the wearable computing device), the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510 may remain locked in the center of theview region 502, such that the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510 appear to a user of the wearable computing device not to move. This may make it easier for a user of the wearable computing device to interact with the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510, even while the wearer and/or the wearable computing device are moving. - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive a request to remove the
menu 504 from theview region 502. The request may take several forms. - In some embodiments, the request may take the form of a time out. To this end, the wearable computing device may be further configured to detect when a predetermined amount of time of inactivity has passed, and, in response to the detection, may remove the
menu 504 from the view region. - In other embodiments, the request may take the form of a request from the user. The user may indicate the request by, for example, selecting a “close” option from the
menu 504 and/or by selecting an object or application outside themenu 504. To this end, the wearable computing device may be further configured to detect when a request has been indicated by the user and, in response to the detection, may remove themenu 504 from theview region 502. - In still other embodiments, the request may take the form of removal data corresponding to one or more predetermined movements. The removal data may take any of the forms described above in connection with the movement data and/or panning data. For example, the removal data may correspond to a repeated movement of the wearable computing device from the left to the right, as if a user of the wearable computing device is shaking his or her head. As another example, the removal data may correspond to a movement detected by the wearable computing device or by a peripheral device connected to the wearable computing device, such as a movement of a user's hand detected by, e.g., a proximity sensor, or a movement across a touchpad. As still another example, the removal data may correspond to a movement having an angular velocity (e.g., a downward angular velocity) that exceeds a threshold angular velocity. Other examples are possible as well.
- Once the
menu 504 is removed from theview region 502, the user-interface 500 may again appear as shown inFIG. 5A . - Several example user-interfaces have been described. It is to be understood that each of the above-described user-interfaces is merely an exemplary state of the disclosed user-interface, and that the user-interface may move between the above-described and other states according to one or more types of user input to the wearable computing device and/or the user-interface. That is, the disclosed user-interface is not a static user-interface, but rather is a dynamic user-interface configured to move between several states. Movement between states of the user-interface is described in connection with
FIGS. 6A and 6B , which show an example implementation of an example user-interface, in accordance with an embodiment. -
FIG. 6A shows an example implementation of an example user-interface on an examplewearable computing device 610 when thewearable computing device 610 is at a first position, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown inFIG. 6A , auser 608 wears awearable computing device 610. In response to receiving data corresponding to a first position of the wearable computing device 610 (e.g., a position of thewearable computing device 610 when theuser 608 is looking in a direction that is generally parallel to the ground, generally straight ahead, and/or another comfortable position), thewearable computing device 610 provides afirst state 600 of a user-interface, which includes aview region 602 and amenu 604. - Example boundaries of the
view region 602 are shown by the dottedlines 606A through 606D. Theview region 602 may substantially fill a field of view of thewearable computing device 610 and/or theuser 608. - As shown, in the
first state 600, theview region 602 is substantially empty. Further, in thefirst state 600, themenu 604 is not fully visible in theview region 602 because some or all of themenu 604 is above theview region 602. As a result, themenu 604 is not fully visible to theuser 608. For example, themenu 604 may be visible only in a periphery of theuser 608, or may not be visible at all. Other examples are possible as well. - The
menu 604 is shown to be arranged in a partial ring located above theview region 602. In some embodiments, themenu 604 may extend further around theuser 608, forming a full ring.

Method 700 shown inFIG. 7 presents an embodiment of a method that, for example, could be used with the systems and devices described herein.Method 700 may include one or more operations, functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks 702-710. Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may also be performed in parallel, and/or in a different order than those described herein. Also, the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or removed based upon the desired implementation. - In addition, for the
method 700 and other processes and methods disclosed herein, the flowchart shows functionality and operation of one possible implementation of present embodiments. In this regard, each block may represent a module, a segment, or a portion of program code, which includes one or more instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. The program code may be stored on any type of computer readable medium, for example, such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive. The computer readable medium may include a non-transitory computer readable medium, for example, such as computer-readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory, processor cache and Random Access Memory (RAM). The computer readable medium may also include non-transitory media, such as secondary or persistent long term storage, like read only memory (ROM), optical or magnetic disks, and compact-disc read only memory (CD-ROM), for example. The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non-volatile storage systems. The computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium, a tangible storage device, or other article of manufacture, for example. - In addition, for the
method 700 and other processes and methods disclosed herein, each block may represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical functions in the process. - As shown, the
method 700 begins atblock 702 where a wearable computing device receives data corresponding to a first position of the wearable computing device and responsively causes the wearable computing device to provide a user-interface that comprises a view region and a menu. - The wearable computing device may take any of the forms described above in connection with
FIGS. 1A-4 . In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be a head-mounted device. Other wearable computing devices are possible as well. - The user-interface may, for example, appear similar to the user-
interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5A orFIG. 5C . To this end, the view region may substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device. Further, the menu may not be fully visible in the view region. For example, the menu may not be visible in the view region at all. Still further, the view region may be substantially empty. The user-interface may take other forms as well. - The
method 700 continues atblock 704 where the wearable computing device receives movement data corresponding to a movement of the wearable computing device from the first position to a second position. The movement data may take any of the forms described above. - The
method 700 continues atblock 706 where, based on the movement data, the wearable computing device makes a first determination that the movement has a first angular velocity along a first direction. The first angular velocity may be, for example, a maximum angular velocity over a period of time, or may be an average angular velocity along the first direction over a period of time. The firs angular velocity may take other forms as well. In some embodiments, the movement data may comprise an indication of the first angular velocity. In other embodiments, the first angular velocity may be derivable from the movement data. For example, the movement data may comprise indications of an angle of rotation of the movement and a time period of the movement. The movement data may take other forms as well. - At
block 708, the wearable computing device makes a second determination that the first angular velocity exceeds a first threshold angular velocity. To this end, the wearable computing device may compare the first angular velocity with the first threshold angular velocity. The first threshold angular velocity may, in some embodiments, be predetermined. For example, the first threshold angular velocity may be predetermined based on one or more preferences of a user of the wearable computing device. In this example, the user may be able to adjust or vary the first threshold angular velocity by modifying the preferences. As another example, the first threshold angular velocity may be predetermined based on calibration data measured during calibration of the wearable computing device. As still another example, the first threshold angular velocity may have a value that is preset by, for instance, a manufacturer of the device. The first threshold angular velocity may take other forms as well. Themethod 700 continues atblock 710 where, responsive to the first and second determination, the wearable computing device moves the menu in a direction opposite the first direction such that the menu becomes more visible in the view region. In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may move the menu at a rate based at least on the first angular velocity. Further, in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may move the menu a distance based at least on the first angular velocity. In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may move the view region instead of or in addition to moving the menu. In these embodiments, the wearable computing device may move the view region in the first direction. - At
block 710, the user-interface may, for example, appear similar to the user-interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5B orFIG. 5D . To this end, the menu may be at least partially, and in some cases fully, visible in the view region. In some embodiments, the menu may include a number of menu objects, as described above. Further, in some embodiments, the menu may extend beyond the view region such that a portion of the menu remains outside the view region. - In some embodiments, in addition to determining that the first angular velocity exceeds the first threshold angular velocity, the wearable computing device may compare the first angular velocity with a first maximum angular velocity in order to make a third determination that the first angular velocity does not exceed the first maximum angular velocity. The first maximum angular velocity may take any of the forms described above in connection with the first threshold angular velocity. In these embodiments, the wearable computing device may, at
block 710, move the menu in response to the first, second, and third determinations. That is, the wearable computing device may only move the menu to become more visible in the view region in response to determining that the first angular velocity both exceeds the first threshold angular velocity and does not exceed the first maximum angular velocity. - In some embodiments, the movement may comprise movement in directions other than the first direction. For example, the movement may be a combination of moving, tilting, rotating, shifting, sliding, or other movement that results in a movement generally in the first direction. In these embodiments, the wearable computing device may, prior to block 710, make a third determination that the movement has a second angular velocity along a second direction. The second direction may be, for example, non-parallel to the first direction. The second angular velocity may take any of the forms described above in connection with the first angular velocity. The wearable computing device may then make a fourth determination that the second angular velocity does not exceed a second threshold angular velocity. To this end, the wearable computing device may compare the second angular velocity to the second threshold angular velocity. The second threshold angular velocity may take any of the forms described above in connection with the first threshold angular velocity.
- In these embodiments, the wearable computing device may, at
block 710, move the menu in response to the first, second, third, and fourth determinations. That is, the wearable computing device may only move the menu to become more visible in the view region in response to determining that both the first angular velocity exceeds a first threshold angular velocity and the second angular velocity does not exceed the second threshold angular velocity. - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive panning data and responsively pan and/or rotate the menu, as described above. In this manner, the wearable computing device may bring into the view region portions of the menu (e.g., menu objects) that are not previously located inside the view region. In some embodiments, after the wearable computing device pans and/or rotates the menu, the user-interface may appear similar to the user-
interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5E . - Further, in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive selection data indicating a selection of a selected menu object from the menu, as described above. In response to receiving the selection data, the wearable computing device may provide the selected menu object in the view region. In some embodiments, after the wearable computing device receives the selection data, the user-interface may appear similar to the user-
interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5F . - Still further, in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive input data corresponding to a user input. The user input may allow the user to, for example, interact with the selected menu object, as described above. In some embodiments, after the wearable computing device receives the input data, the user-interface may appear similar to the user-
interface 500 described above in connection withFIG. 5G . - Still further, in some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive removal data and may responsively remove the menu from the view region, as described above.
