- This invention is related to 1) commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/017,011 entitled: “Intra-Unit Column Address Increment System for Memory”; 2) commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/017,015 entitled: “Single Ended Read Write Drive For Memory”; and 3) commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/017,012 entitled: “Shared Row Decoder”; the three of which are filed on even date herewith.
- This invention relates to the design of a random access memory (RAM) and more specifically to circuitry which accesses and transfers data with a set of address inputs to and from a storage array within a RAM.
- RAM random access memory
- RAM random access memory
- One way in which this can be accomplished is by utilizing a shared row decoder design which permits wordlines in both left and right units of a bank division of the RAM to be accessed through the same set of row decoders, thus decreasing by half the number of row decoders required to perform that function.
- this goal is not well served if the reduction in decoder circuitry is made at the expense of increased access time or higher power consumption for the RAM, especially in cases where the design for a RAM chip requires a plurality of banks.
- FIG. 1 shows an example of a 32 Mb double unit 10 which includes left and right units 12, 20, left and right wordline (WL) driver units 14, 18, and a shared row decoder unit 16 which receives inputs including row predecoded addresses XP1 . . . XPn, and block select inputs BLKSELs.
- This 32 Mb double unit organization has been incorporated into an existing design for a 256 Mb DRAM, the details of which are described in the Article by Y. Watanabe et al. entitled "A 286 mm2 256 Mb DRAM with x32 Both-Ends DQ," IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 31, No. 4, April, 1996 (“the Watanabe Article”).
- Within the shared row decoder unit 16 there are provided are provided are provided within the shared row decoder unit 16 there are provided are provided are provided within the shared row decoder unit 16 there are provided are provided are provided within the shared row decoder unit 16 there are provided are provided are provided are
- each row decoder 30 of shared row decoder unit 16 receives as inputs a plurality of row predecoded addresses, for example three predecoded addresses (XP1, XP2, XP3), and a block select signal BLKSEL.
- a row decoder output signal RDOUT which is provided to both a left WL driver 14 and a right WL driver 18 of the double unit 10. In this way, only one row decoder 30 is needed to enable the selection of blocks from both left and right units, 12, 20.
- the BLKSEL signal is held active during a time in which both units 12, 20 are in an active state.
- RDOUT signals of row decoders 30 are precharged to HIGH, at which time units 12, 20 are simultaneously deactivated.
- the row predecoded addresses XPs must hold the information constant for the duration in which BLKSEL is active. Otherwise, RDOUT might be falsely enabled by the XPs transition between states because the XPs provide the enabling and trigger conditions for RDOUT.
- row decoder 30 requires the XPs to hold the information constant during BLKSEL active cycles, it is not possible to use row decoder unit 30 in a double unit 10 in which it is desired to utilize each unit 12, 20 as a separate bank under separate row addressing control. That is, row decoder 30 cannot be used in a double unit 10 which is configured to operate as two or more banks.
- FIG. 3 shows a schematic for the design of another existing row decoder unit 40 which permits a pair of left and right units 12, 20 to be configured as a pair of banks, rather than just a single bank, as is the conventional configuration.
- Row decoder unit 40 includes sets of row decoder circuits 42 -- for each of the left unit 12 and the right unit 20 which are completely independent from each other, i.e. the decoder circuits 42 in each set include independent devices which receive and act upon the row predecoded addresses and block select signals to activate wordlines within the respective left and right units, 12, 20. Consequently, left and right units 12, 20 can each be independently controlled, to access storage locations at different row addresses at the same time.
- row decoder unit 40 which duplicates the input and output circuits for all predecoded address and block select inputs, requires twice the number of row predecoded address signal lines and row decoder circuits 42 as row decoder unit 16. In consequence, the area occupied by row decoder unit 40 on an IC is substantially greater than the area occupied by row decoder unit 16. It would be advantageous to provide a row decoder unit which permits a double unit to be configured with multiple banks, without requiring row decoder circuits therein to be duplicated.
- blocks are arranged in the same way within left and right units 12, 20, namely, numbered in sequential order from bottom to top (or from top to bottom).
- blocks which are accessed by the same address inputs are located across from each other at the same distance away from the ends 22 of the units 12, 20. That is, block 0 in the left unit 12 is located across from block 0 in the right unit 20 and lies at the end 22 of the left unit 12, as does block 0 in the right unit 20.
- block 1 in the left unit is located across from block 1 in the right unit 20 and lies one block away from the end 22 of the left unit 12, as does block 1 in the right unit 20.
- units 12, 20 can be accessed independently in an ACTIVE mode when double unit 10 is configured as multiple banks, each bank having independent row decoder circuits 42.
- units 12, 20 are not independently controlled, such that the row decoder unit 16 accesses the same physical block numbers across both units 12, 20.
- wordlines in the same numbered blocks in both left and right units 12, 20 are alternately or simultaneously accessed, first from one unit, for example, the left unit 12, then from the other unit, i.e. the right unit 20 in this example.
- an object of the invention is to provide an arrangement of blocks within a double unit which reduces or eliminates the dependence of the current consumption, heating effects and average voltage drop upon the address of the block which is accessed.
- One known way of increasing the off-RAM access speed in synchronous dynamic RAMs is to perform a modified column burst mode operation in which sequentially adjacent addresses are accessed simultaneously from an "odd" column division (left unit) and an "even” column division (right unit) of a bank, rather than merely providing addresses to the left unit and to the right unit in sequence, as described above with reference to FIG. 1.
- DRAMs synchronous dynamic RAMs
- the lowest order bits of the column address are transferred to one of the odd/even units after being incremented by one, and transferred directly without being incremented to the other one of the odd/even units.
- Such operation is referred to a "column address increment”.
- the Kodama Article describes a design for a DRAM which performs column address increment to transfer data to and from a storage locations within a bank at twice the access speed of the storage cells within.
- each bank is configured as a double memory unit (e.g. as in FIG. 1; 10) having left and right units 12, 20 separated from each other by row decoder circuitry for the bank.
- Left and right units 12, 20 form odd and even units of the bank which are accessed with consecutive column addresses that are provided simultaneously to both odd and even units.
- the row decoder circuitry between left and right units 12, 20 decodes a set of row selection signals and activates, at the same time, wordlines in both left and right units 12, 20 in accordance with to the decoding result.
- a similar concept is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,386,385 to Stephens, Jr.
- the Kodama Article, and the Stephens, Jr. Patent describe systems which implement column address increment pipelining, but only in a double unit 10 which is configured as a single bank, i.e. with a left unit 12 implementing an "odd” unit, and a right unit 20 implementing an "even” unit.
- the Kodama Article and the Stephens, Jr. Patent do not describe a way in which column address increment could be implemented in a double unit 10 which is configured as multiple banks. A way of providing column address increment pipelining in a double unit 10 having any number of banks therein would be desirable.
- Another object of the invention is to provide a structure and method of providing column address increment operation simultaneously in each bank of a plurality of banks configured within a double unit 10.
- data is transferred to and from a DRAM storage array 400 by a circuit arrangement and signal flow known as "master DQ" (MDQ) architecture.
- MDQ master DQ
- the detailed schematic of storage array 400 in FIG. 4a corresponds to the internal organization of unit 12 or 20 of FIG. 1.
- data is passed from bitline pairs within the storage array 400 by a hierarchical arrangement of local DQ lines (LDQs) and master DQ lines (MDQs).
- a data input output circuit (DIO) 490 is coupled to the storage array 400 by a second sense amplifier unit (SSA) 450.
- SSA 450 receives data signals on master bitline pairs (MDQs) of the storage array 400, regenerates the data and transmits it again onto bidirectional read write drive lines (RWD, RWD') 480 to the DIO 490.
- the column burst current When accessing the storage array 400 during column burst mode operation in which several adjacent column storage locations are accessed sequentially, the amount of current required to perform such operation is known as the column burst current.
- the largest single contributor to the column burst current is the current needed to drive the RWD and RWD' lines 480 in transmitting data between the second sense amplifier (SSA) 450 and the data input/output circuit (DIO) 490.
- signal levels on either line RWD, or line RWD' 480 are driven, in every clock cycle of the DIO 490, between an (inactive) precharge voltage level and an (active) data level. Regardless of the data pattern, large current is required to drive the rapid swing between the precharge voltage level and the active data level in the presence of large capacitive loads 460, 461.
- Still another object of the invention is to provide a circuit and method of signal transmission by which data bits are transmitted sequentially on a read write drive signal without requiring the signal line to be precharged between each data bit.
- the present invention stabilizes the current dissipation, voltage drop, and heating effects related to accessing blocks within first and second storage units of a double memory unit.
- the system includes a row selection unit located between the first and second storage units, which accesses storage locations of the first and second storage units according to first and second selection signals conducted from the outer extremities of the double memory unit to selected row locations.
- the blocks at corresponding distances from the outer extremities are numbered differently such that the sum of lengths of signal travel of the first and second selection signals to the numbered blocks remains relatively constant regardless of the block number which is selected for access.

- FIG. 11 is a block and schematic diagram showing the structure and operation of the single ended read write drive of the present invention.
- FIG. 5 is a schematic circuit diagram of a shared row decoder 110 of the present invention.
- Row address input circuit 111 receives row predecoded address input signals, for example XP1, XP2, XP3, and provides an enabled/disabled input at terminal 113 which is determined by the states of the row predecoded address inputs.
- Separate left block select (BLKSELl) and right block select (BLKSELr) signals are provided to left and right decoder latch circuits 121 and 123, respectively.
- the block select signals BLKSELl and BLKSELr are held active during an active cycle of a bank in which the left and the right blocks are located.
- a pulsed left Row-DECoder-ON (RDECONl) signal, and a pulsed Right Row-DECoder-ON (RDECONr) signal are provided to left and right decoder latch circuits 121, 123, respectively.
- RDECONl and RDECONr signals allow for the activation of units 12, 20 within double unit 10 at different selected times, without requiring separate row decoder circuits 42, as described above with reference to FIG. 3.
- an enabling input 113 is latched into one of the left or the right latch circuits 121, 123 when the values of the predecoded address inputs XP1, 2, and 3 are in the right combination for the particular decoder, and the RDECONl signal or the RDECONr signal becomes active, respectively.
- RDECONl and RDECONr are pulsed at different times so that the values of the predecoded address inputs at XP1, 2 and 3 will be allowed to change from the time the left unit 12 is accessed until the right unit 20 is accessed.
- predecoded address inputs are not required to swing once during every RAS cycle. Rather, predecoded address inputs XP1, XP2, XP3, etc. are permitted to maintain the same states from one cycle to the next, and change state only when the information content of the address signals changes. This results in a reduction of the current required to operate shared row decoder 110, in relation to the row decoder 30 described above with reference to FIG. 2.
- the pulsed timed control over the latch circuits 121, 123 permits the implementation of a shared row decoder 110 in which the address input circuit 111 and signal lines which carry row predecoded address signals XP1, XP2, XP3, etc. thereto are shared between left and right units 12, 20 (FIG. 1) , resulting in a net savings of area occupied by the row decoder circuitry for a double unit 10 of an IC.
- a second aspect of the invention is the asymmetric assignment of block addresses within left and right units of a unit or bank. This aspect of the invention can be utilized either together with or separately from the shared row decoder aspect or other aspects of the invention.
- blocks having the same number are located at the same position within the left and right units of a unit or bank.
- block 0 in the left unit is located on the bottom left
- block 0 in the right unit is located on the bottom right.
- addresses are assigned to blocks in left and right units of each bank such that the same numbered blocks of the left and right units are not located adjacent to each other.
- the blocks can be arranged such that the bottommost block in the left unit is addressed as block 0 while the bottommost block in the right unit is addressed as block 15. Then, the next block up from the bottom in the left unit is addressed as block 1, while the next block up from the bottom in the right unit is addressed as block 14.
- a double memory unit 210 of 32 Mb capacity is arranged with a left 16 Mb unit 220 including 1 Mb physical blocks 0 to 15 (numbers correlating with physical locations), and a right 16 Mb unit 222 including 1 Mb physical blocks 0 to 15.
- Lower row domains 226 include blocks 0 to 7, while upper row domains 228 include blocks 8 to 15.
- a row decoder and driver unit 224 which is arranged to activate wordlines in particular blocks of each unit 220, 222, in accordance with three row address bits AR11, AR10, AR9, with AR11 being the most significant bit.
- row decoders are arranged such that the blocks selected by row address bits AR11, AR10, AR9 correspond directly to the physical block numbers. For example, in the left unit 220, for row address values on AR11, AR10, AR9 of (1,1,1), block 7 is activated.
- row decoders are arranged differently such that blocks selected by the row address bits AR11, AR10, AR9 lie at different locations than the physical block numbers which correspond to the combination of row address bits. For example, in FIG. 8, row address input on AR11, AR10, AR9 of (1,1,1) selects block 3 in the right unit 223 rather than block 7 as in the left unit 220.
- Blocks in the upper row domains 228 are selected such that the physical block number selected for access equals the physical block number of the selected block in the lower domain 226 plus 8.
- the selected blocks are block 7 and block 15, while in the right unit 22, the selected blocks are block 3 and block 11.
- FIG. 9 is a block and schematic diagram showing the design for a 32 Mb double unit 308 of a 256 Mb DRAM.
- the goal of this design is to permit a single unit to operate as a bank, while implementing column address increment pipelining to boost memory access speed.
- the double unit 308 includes a pair left and right units 310, 311 of 16 Mb capacity. Left and right units 310, 311 are configured to operate as separate banks which share a row decoder unit 312 having shared row decoders therein such as those described above with reference to FIG. 5.
- Each unit 310, 311 is divided into odd and even column domains; left unit 310 includes odd and even column domains 314 and 316; and right unit 311 includes even and odd column domains 318 and 320.
- Each column domain 314, 316 of a bank 310 is further divided into four 2 Mb double segments, each of which includes an upper 1 Mb segment and a lower 1 Mb segment. For example, within a double segment of the even domain 316, 1 of 64 column select lines (CSLs) is used to access four master DQ line pairs (MDQE 4-7) from the upper segment and four master DQ line pairs (MDQE 0-3) from the lower segment.
- CSLs column select lines
- Units 310, 311 are divided row-wise into sixteen 1 Mb array blocks, (only two blocks 340a, 340b, shown for the purpose of simplicity), each block containing a storage array block having 512 rows, i.e. 512 wordlines (WLs).
- Sense amplifier (SA) units 342 are placed in pairs with each storage array block, one SA unit 342 above each storage array block 340a and one SA unit 342 below.
- Each SA unit 342 contains 1024 sense amplifiers which are active on alternate bitline pairs in interleaved fashion with respect to the other SA unit 342 of the pair to support the 2048 total bitline pairs of the storage array block 340a.
- redundancy array block of 160 Kb capacity which has 80 redundancy wordlines (RWLs) is provided within each unit 310, and 311.
- Redundancy logic 346 controls access to regions of redundancy array block 344.
- each unit 310, 311 Associated with each unit 310, 311 are column address circuitry as follows. Associated with the even column domain 316 is a plus-one adder 322a which receives the lowest order column address bits YADD0-2, and increments the bits by one. An even column domain counter (CTRE) 324a receives the incremented YADD0-2 and cyclically updates the value. Associated with the odd column domain 314 is an odd column domain counter (CTRO) 326a which receives the column address bits YADD0-2 directly from address bus 330 and cyclically updates that value. Column predecoder (CPD) 348 predecodes other column address bits.
- CTR even column domain counter
- CTRO odd column domain counter
- CPD 348, CTRE 324a and CTRO 326a Coupled to the outputs of CPD 348, CTRE 324a and CTRO 326a are column decoder/second sense amplifier (CDEC/SSA) units 329a, 328a, respectively, which perform the final decoding operations to activate selected column select lines CSLO and CSLE in the odd and even column domains 314, 316, respectively.
- CDEC/SSA column decoder/second sense amplifier
- odd unit counter CTRO 326a receives the three lowest order address signals YADD0-2 from address bus 330 and transfers them to the CDEC/SSA 329a for the odd column domain 314. No incrementing of address signals provided to odd column domain 314 is required.
- a plus-one adder 322a receives the lowest order column address bits YADD0-2, increments the bits by one and outputs the result to an even unit counter (CTRE) 324a, which then passes the incremented address to CDEC/SSA 328a for the even column domain 316.
- CTRE even unit counter
- Column predecoder (CPD) 348 decodes address bits YADD3-7, and provides predecoded signals for these higher order bits to both the odd and the even column domains 314, 316.
- Simultaneous storage access to sixteen bits is provided as follows.
- a single wordline in each of two 1 Mb blocks 340a, 340b is activated in accordance with predecoded row addresses provided to shared row decoder 312.
- the lowest order column addresses YADD0-2 are incremented by plus-one adder 322a and output provided to CTRE 324a.
- the lowest order column addresses YADD0-2 are provided directly to CTRO without being incremented.
- column select lines CSLO and CSLE are activated in odd and even column domains 314, 316, respectively, in accordance with the predecoded addresses provided by CPD 348 and the outputs of counters CTRO and CTRE.
- four data bits are transferred from storage cells coupled to the activated wordline in block 340b onto four bitline pairs of the lower 1 Mb segment in the odd column domain MDQO 0-3, which data bits are then transferred onto master bitline pairs MDQO 0-3.
- four data bits are transferred from storage cells coupled to the activated wordline in block 340b onto four bitline pairs of the lower 1 Mb segment in the even column domain MDQE 0-3, which data bits are then transferred onto master bitline pairs MDQE 0-3.
- the data bits on lines MDQE 0-7 are sensed and transmitted on even domain read write drive bus RWDE 0-7 to DIO 490 (FIG. 4) and the data bits on lines MDQO 0-7 are sensed and transmitted on odd domain read write drive bus RWDO 0-7 to DIO 490 (FIG. 4).
- circuitry and method of the present invention has been shown to provide column address increment pipelining within a single unit 310.
- FIG. 10 contains a block and schematic diagram showing the design for a second sense amplifier unit (SSA) 550.
- the second sense amplifier unit (SSA) 650 described below is a further improvement over SSA 550.
- the SSA unit 550 is not admitted by the Applicants to be prior art.
- the SSA 550 includes two current mirror sense amplifiers (CMPs) 500 and 501 and a precharge/equalization circuit 510 (shown exemplarily as including three PFETS, coupled to a constant voltage source V ARRAY , and to a time-varying precharge signal DQRST').
- SSA 550 includes RWD switches 520 and 521 (shown exemplarily as NFETs), RWD precharge devices 530 and 531 (shown exemplarily as PFETs), and support devices 540-546.
- SSA 550 When the value of the data being sensed from a bitline is ⁇ 0 ⁇ , as represented by a lower voltage level present on signal line MDQ than line MDQ', by operation of CMPs 501 and 500, GL falls LOW while GL' remains HIGH.
- the LOW going signal GL causes PFET 542 to turn on, forcing signal output RWD to LOW.
- Signal RWD' by contrast, remains HIGH, since NFET 521 remains in OFF condition.
- signal DQRST rises HIGH again, signals GL and GL', GD and GD', RWD and RWD' are precharged to HIGH, LOW, and HIGH levels again, respectively.
- RWD and RWD' both drive large capacitive loads 560, 561, respectively.
- the capacitance is generally of the order of 5 pF.
- DRAMs which have a x32 organization, as that term is used in the Watanabe Article referenced herein, a typical operational voltage swing of 2.5 V, and bit access speed of 200 MHz, the steady state current required to drive these loads is 80 mA.
- SSA circuit 650 includes two CMPs 600, 601, a precharge/equalization circuit including three PFETs 610, and support devices 640 through 646, which are essentially the same as or identical to those shown in SSA circuit 550.
- SSA 650 replaces the NFETs 520, 521 used to drive the RWD, RWD' signals in SSA 550 (FIG. 10) with a unitary CMOS driver including NFET 620 and PFET 630 to provided single-ended RWD operation.
- PFETs 530, 531, used to precharge signals RWD, RWD' in SSA 550, have been eliminated from SSA 650.
- SSA 650 The operation of SSA 650 will now be described, with reference to FIG. 11.
- DQRST When the CSL is not enabled, DQRST remains at a HIGH level which precharges the MDQ pair and maintains CMPs 600, 601 in disabled condition.
- DQRST falls, ending the precharge operation and CMPs 600, 601 become enabled simultaneously.
- signals GL and GL' follow the sensing results of CMPs 600 and 601, which results are then followed again by signals GD, GD' and GD'.
- SSA 650 When the value of the data being sensed on a bitline is ⁇ 0 ⁇ , as represented by a lower voltage level present on signal line MDQ than line MDQ', by operation of CMPs 600 and 601, GL falls LOW while GL' remains HIGH.
- the low-going GL signal turns on PFET 642, which in turn, causes signal GD' to go HIGH, while signals GD and GD' are maintained LOW and HIGH, respectively.
- NFET 620 turns on, driving output RWD to LOW level and latching the data thereon with devices 652.
- Signal DQRST rises HIGH again soon; however, the data is latched onto RWD and cannot change until DQRST falls again.
- the switching of DQRST to the HIGH level again causes signals GL, GL', and GD, GD' and GD' to be precharged again to HIGH, and LOW levels, respectively.
- the single-ended RWD signal drives a large capacitive load 660 of typically 5 pF, but the voltage level thereon swings only when the data in a given cycle changes from its state in the last previous cycle.
- SSA circuit 550 at least one of signals RWD or RWD' had to be precharged in every cycle. Then, the voltage level had to swing on at least one of signals RWD or RWD' to indicate the data bit for that cycle, i.e. a ⁇ 0 ⁇ would appear in the current cycle on signal RWD', while a ⁇ 1 ⁇ would appear on signal RWD. Since the SSA circuit 650 eliminates the precharge interval entirely, at least one half of all voltage swings on the RWD line are eliminated.
- SSA circuit 550 (FIG. 10)
- SSA circuit 650 (FIG. 11) of the present invention, which transmits both ⁇ 0 ⁇ and ⁇ 1 ⁇ data on the same single-ended RWD line, does not require the voltage to swing from one cycle to the next if the next bit in the data stream is the same as the last. Therefore, the number of voltage swings for the RWD signal are reduced again by half in relation to the operation of the SSA circuit 550.
- SSA circuit 650 under the same conditions as those described for SSA circuit 550, results in a reduction of current by 75% from 80 mA to 20 mA. Even assuming worse conditions in which the transferred data bits change levels once in every cycle, the amount of required current increases only by a factor of 2 to 40 mA.
