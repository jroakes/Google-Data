- the indexing engine 120 indexes resources (e.g., web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet) found in a collection of content and the index database 126 stores the index information.
- the ranking engine 122 (or other software) is operable to rank resources that match the query 110 , such that search results associated with the results can be displayed in a rank order. The indexing and ranking of the resources can be performed using conventional or other techniques.
- the authoritative user engine 124 can access the trigger queries database 127 to determine whether one or more authoritative users are to be displayed with the search results.
- the search system 114 can transmit the search results 128 through the network to the client device 104 for presentation to the user 102 . If one or more authoritative users are to be displayed with the search results, the search system 114 can transmit the data 129 associated with the one or more authoritative users through the network to the client device 104 for presentation to the user 102 .

- data associated with a set of authoritative users is provided.
- the set of authoritative users can include K authoritative users, where K is a positive integer.
- the data associated with the set of authoritative users can be stored with the trigger query and, for each authoritative user, can include an identifier and a score (S).

- Data associated with the set of K authoritative users can include (AU 1 , S 1 ), (AU 2 , S 2 ) . . . (AU K , S K ) and can be provided for potential display of authoritative users in search results.
- the set of K authoritative users can be processed to define a set of M authoritative users, where M is an integer that is less than K. Consequently, the set of M authoritative users can be considered to be a sub-set of the set of K authoritative users.

- the set of M authoritative users can include the authoritative users having the highest M scores.
- S 1 >S 2 >S 5 >S 4 >S 3 and M is equal to 3. Consequently, the set of M authoritative users can include AU 1 , AU 2 and AU 5 .
- a rule can include partially populating the set of M authoritative users by selecting authoritative users with the highest N scores from the set of K authoritative users, where N is an integer that is less than M, and partially populating the set of M authoritative users by randomly selecting M-N authoritative users from the remaining authoritative users.

- a rule can include considering social connections that might exist between the searching user and any of the set of K authoritative users.
- Social connections between users can be defined through one or more computer-implemented services.
- Example computer-implemented services can include a social networking service, a document sharing service, a digital content sharing service (e.g., photo sharing), a blogging service and a micro-blogging service.
- user can be connected with one another as direct contacts and/or indirect contacts in a computer-implemented service.
- a social networking service can be considered, where a first user can be a direct contact of a second user, such that the first and second user can share digital content (e.g., social networking posts) via the social networking service.
- a third user can be a direct contact of the second user, but is not a direct contact of the first user. Consequently, the third user is an indirect contact of the first user (i.e., is a contact of a contact).
- the set of M authoritative users it can be determined whether one or more authoritative users in the set of K authoritative users is a contact (e.g., either direct or indirect) of the searching user. If an authoritative user in the set of K authoritative users is a contact of the searching user, the authoritative user is included in the set of M authoritative users. In some examples, if the set of M authoritative users is not complete after social connection consideration (i.e., there are vacancies after including any authoritative users having a social connection to the searching user), the remainder of the set of M authoritative users can be populated based on score and/or random selection.
- FIG. 2 depicts an example search results page 200 including a search results portion 202 and an authoritative users portion 204 .
- the search results page 200 displays example search results in the search results portion 202 .

- authoritative users 208 are displayed in the authoritative users portion 204 .
- the authoritative users 208 include “Jane Expert,” “John O'Expert” and “Arthur McExpert.”
- a rule can include populating the set of M authoritative users by selecting authoritative users with the highest M scores from the set of K authoritative users.
- the authoritative users “Jane Expert,” “John O'Expert” and “Arthur McExpert” can be the authoritative users with the highest M scores from a set of K authoritative users associated with the query “safari.”
- a rule can include partially populating the set of M authoritative users by selecting authoritative users with the highest N scores from the set of K authoritative users, and partially populating the set of M authoritative users by randomly selecting M-N authoritative users from the remaining authoritative users. In the example of FIG.
- the authoritative user “Jane Expert” can be the authoritative user with the highest score in a set of K authoritative users and the authoritative users “John O'Expert” and “Arthur McExpert” can be randomly selected from the set of K authoritative users.
- a rule can include populating the set of M authoritative users by randomly selecting authoritative users from a set of K authoritative users.
- the authoritative users “Jane Expert,” “John O'Expert” and “Arthur McExpert” can be randomly selected from the set of K authoritative users.
- data associated with each authoritative user 208 can include a thumbnail image 210 and a name 212 .
- the thumbnail image 210 and the name 212 are associated with a profile of the particular authoritative user 208 within one or more social networking services.
- each of the thumbnail image 210 and the name 212 can include a link to a profile page associated with the authoritative user 208 in a social networking service of the one or more social networking services. It is appreciated that other data associated with each of the authoritative users can be displayed (e.g., a summary of the authoritative user).
- the authoritative users that are displayed can be different for each search performed, even in instances where the same search query is provided.
- a first searching user can input a search query and, in response to the search query, a first set of authoritative users are displayed.
- the first searching user can again input the search query and, in response to the search query, a second set of authoritative users is displayed, different from the first set of authoritative users. Consequently, even though the same searching users (i.e., the first searching user) entered the same search query, different sets of authoritative users were displayed.
- a first searching user can input a search query and, in response to the search query, a first set of authoritative users are displayed, and a second searching user can input the same search query and, in response to the search query, a second set of authoritative users are displayed, different from the first set of authoritative users. Consequently, even though the same search query is input by both the first and second searching uses, different sets of authoritative users were displayed. In some examples, this can be achieved by at least partially populating the set of M authoritative users based on a random selection of authoritative users from the set of K authoritative users.
