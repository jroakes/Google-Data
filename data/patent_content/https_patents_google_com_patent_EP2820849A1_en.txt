Definitions
- the disclosure relates to the field of content presentation systems and methods, and, in particular, to video content presentation.
- Advertisers provide advertisements in different forms in order to attract consumers.
- An advertisement (“ad”) is a piece of information designed to be used in whole or part by a user, for instance, a particular consumer. Advertisements can be provided in electronic form. For instance, online advertisements can be provided as banner advertisements on a web page, as advertisements presented with search results, or as advertisements presented in a mobile application.
- An advertising system can include an advertisement in a web page, for instance, in response to one or more keywords in a user search query input to a search engine. If a user selects the presented advertisement (e.g., by "clicking" the ad), the user is generally taken to another location associated with the advertisement, for instance, to another, particular web page.
- a method of providing advertisements includes, but is not limited to any one or combination of: (i) requesting, by a software development kit for an application, an advertisement from an advertisement server in response to playback of a video content item by the application; (ii) receiving the advertisement from the advertisement server based on the requesting; (iii) displaying, with the application, the advertisement received from the advertisement server; (iv) collecting a set of metrics while the advertisement is displayed; and (v) providing the set of metrics to the advertisement server.

- Ad content can include text, graphics, still-images, video, audio, audio and video, multimedia, banners, links (e.g., advertising providing a hyperlink to an advertiser's website), and other web or television programming related data.
- ad content can be formatted differently, based on whether the ad content is primarily directed to websites, media players, email, television programs, closed captioning, etc.
- ad content directed to a website may be formatted for display in a frame within a web browser.
- ad content may be delivered in an RSS (Real Simple Syndication) feed, or ad content may be delivered relative to a radio item (such as before, during or after a radio stem).
- ad content directed to a video player may be presented "in-stream" as a video content item is played in the video player.
- in-stream ad content may replace the video content item in a video player for some period of time or may be inserted between portions of the video content item.
- An in-stream advertisement can be placed pre-roll, post-roll, or mid-roll relative to video feature content.
- An in-stream advertisement may include video, audio, text, animated images, still images, or some combination thereof.
- a "video content item" is an item of content that includes content that can be perceived visually when played, rendered, or decoded.
- a video content item includes video data, and optionally audio data and metadata.
- Video data includes content in the video content item that can be perceived visually when the video content item is played, rendered, or decoded.

- Search results can include, for instance (but not limited to), lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, hypertext links to those web pages, and/or the like.
- the search results may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for advertisements to the advertising management system 104.
- the request can include a number of advertisements desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the amount of screen or page space available for the search results and the ads, the size and shape of the ads, and/or the like
- the request for advertisements can also include the query (e.g., as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), information associated with (and/or based on) the search results, and/or the like.
- the information can include, for instance (but not limited to), identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or "docIDs"), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval ("IR") scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, and/or the like.
- IR scores are computed from, for instance, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, and/or the like.
- the advertising management system 104 includes an auction process to select advertisements from the advertisers 102.
- the advertisers 102 may be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers 102 are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click) of an advertisement, which may be an amount an advertiser pays when, for instance, a user clicks on an advertisement.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, which may be the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of an advertisement based on a keyword (e.g., a word or words in a query). Other bid types, however, can also be used. Based on these bids, advertisements can be selected and ranked for presentation.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the advertising management system 104. This combined information can then be forwarded to the users 108 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- one or more of the publishers 106 may submit requests for advertisements to the advertising management system 104.
- the advertising management system 104 responds by sending advertisements to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property. For instance, if one of the publishers 106 publishes a sports-related web site, the advertising management system 104 can provide sports-related advertisements to the publisher 106.
- the requests are executed by devices associated with the user 108, for instance, by execution of a JavaScript when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- the publisher 106 is a mobile application developer.
- a mobile application e.g., application 206 in FIG. 2 is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., mobile device 204 in FIG. 2), such as (but not limited to) a smartphone, a tablet computer, a personal digital assistant, and/or the like.
- the mobile application can also include one or more advertisements positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar to other implementations, the advertisements can be received from the advertising management system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an advertising system 200 including a mobile device application according to various implementations of the disclosure.
- the advertising system 200 may include (but is not limited to) one or more features and/or components of the advertising system 100 and/or other advertising systems described in the disclosure.

- the object 216 is a Java object that is configured to be added to a user interface of the application 206 and handle fetching and rendering of, and interaction with, content such as advertisements.
- the developer can implement a view object that extends a view class associated with the application 206.
- an advertising view object could include the following:
- GoogleBaseAdView (String client). This object can represent a base class to create an advertisement view.
- a constructor can set the client parameter in a content advertisements request that can include a URL for a frontend involved in content requests.
- the above object can extend a more general view class, such as a Web View class used in some
- implementations from Google Inc. can in some implementations be extended by other more specific classes directed at advertising.
- such an extension can use void setAdLayoutType(int placement) to specify top and/or bottom placement of the view that requests the content.
- Other ways of displaying the content e.g., an ad
- One or more functions can be used with the object 216. Such function(s) can customize the look and feel of the content when it is displayed. In some implementations, such function(s) can set one or more CGI parameters in a content request.
- An application program interface (API) 220 can be used with the object 216.
- the API is a Java API that a developer can call when incorporating content such as advertisements into the application 206.
- the object 216 can include a Java code snippet that uses the Java API 220 so that the developer can insert the code into the application 206.
- a code snippet can construct a request for the advertisement 212 (or other content) based on a developer's customization, fetch the content 212, provide the content 212 to the user interface of the application 206, and/or the like.
- the advertisement 212 can include a number of different types of content.
- advertisement types including, but not limited to, text ads, image advertisements (including static and animated images), video ads, and/or the like can be used.
- the advertisement 212 can provide for user navigation (e.g., a link) to other content associated with the advertiser.
- Other types of content are possible (e.g., non- advertising content).
- An advertisement distributor system 222 can be used to forward any type of content such as the advertisement 212 to the mobile device 204 and/or the developer system 202.
- the advertisement distributor system 222 is configured to receive request(s) for content from the mobile device 204, fetch one or more matching

- Relevant context of the application 206 and/or the mobile device 204 can be shared in different ways.
- the developer can share context including metadata about the application 206 with the advertisement distributor system 222.
- a context- sharing component 228 in the software development kit 214 can allow the developer to enter one or more keywords that the developer decides are relevant for retrieving and presenting content such as advertisements.
- the developer who creates the application can submit the keyword(s) using the context-sharing component 228 for receipt by the context component 226 for storage.
- monitoring can be performed to determine how well the submitted metadata correlates with the application 206 and if necessary, modifications in the used context parameter(s) can be made.
- context can be shared by the developer submitting the application 206 to the advertisement distributor system 222.
- the context- sharing component 228 can be used in submitting some or all of the application 206 for use in evaluating context. This can be done as part of a setup process so that the advertisement distributor system 222 can examine the application to determine the context of the advertisements to be forwarded. Aspects that can be taken into account include, but are not limited to, textual content of a previous screen or page on the mobile device 204, a content of the entire application 206 (and/or a portion thereof), a content of a video being played by the application 206, content of other view objects, such as sibling objects, and/or the like.
- Analysis of the application 206 can include (but is not limited to) analyzing the code (e.g., by static analysis), determining a general context of the application 206, determining the specific context of one or more of the particular pages 208, and/or the like. This can require the context-sharing component 228 to determine which of the pages 208 is currently active in the mobile device 204. For instance, this can be done using a version of the application 206 provided by the developer. If or when the application 206 is later updated, a revised version can be forwarded to the advertisement distributor system 222, for instance using the context-sharing component 228, so that the context can be updated if necessary.
- context can be determined by providing that the developer can specify one or more hooks in the code of the application 206.
- the software development kit 214 and/or the platform 218 can provide such feature(s).
- a global variable can be made to change state at one or more stages of the application 206. Such a variable can be read by the object 216, such as by a snippet of Java code.
- Context parameter(s) for use in finding matching content can be stored in any of a variety of forms.
- the context component 226 can store (but is not limited to) one or more keywords, categories, labels, topics, context information, and/or any other kind of parameter for use by the advertisement distributor system 222.
- a developer can create the application 206 intended for the mobile device 204 using the software development kit 214.
- the application 206 can be created according to the platform 218 and can include the object 216.
- the developer can forward the application 206 to the mobile device 204 for use, for instance when the device 204 is initially sold or as a later update, such as by a download process.
- the developer can also provide context relating to the application 206, such as by submitting one or more keywords and/or providing a version of the application 206, using the context-sharing component 228.
- One or more context parameters can be registered at the advertisement distributor system 222.
- content such as one or more advertisements 212 can be presented on the page(s) 208.
- the content can be selected for presentation by the advertisement distributor system 222 based on the context parameter(s).
- the user can interact with the ad(s) 212 in one or more ways, such as by clicking on the advertisement 212, performing a developer-specified combination of key presses (e.g., tapping a single key twice, tapping two keys in rapid succession, etc.), tapping on the advertisement on a touch screen device, and/or the like.
- Content such as the advertisement 212 can be retrieved in any of a variety of ways.
- the advertisement 212 can be retrieved essentially according to an on-demand approach.
- the advertisement 212 or other content can be requested from the advertisement distributor system 222 and forwarded from there for display.
- Such implementations can have the advantage that the advertisement 212 that is displayed to the user can be very current to the particular state of the application 206 and/or the mobile device 204.
- a pre-fetch approach can be used.
- a developer can configure the application 206 such that the advertisement 212 or other content is requested from the advertisement distributor system 222.
- the advertisement 212 can be stored at a suitable location, such as on the mobile device 204 and/or on another computer device such as a server that communicates with the mobile device 204.
- the ad 212 can be displayed on the mobile device 204, for instance when the mobile device 204 returns to an online mode after having been offline.
- the developer can provide for reporting of which contents/ads 212 have been displayed, for instance by incorporating a feature from the software development kit 214 into the application 206.
- client- side frequency capping can be used, for instance by having a class associated with content/ad presentation track previously served content/ads and ensure that the same content/ad is presented according to a rule (e.g., not more than a predetermined number of times per session). Other approaches for fetching content can be used.
- a new content portion such as the advertisement 212 can be presented when an activity that uses the class associated with content/ad presentation is displayed for the first time.
- the new ad/content can be presented when the activity has been removed from an activity stack in the mobile device 204.
- a content/ad can be presented if a previous ad/content has been displayed for a predetermined amount of time if the mobile device 204 continues to be active (e.g., if a backlight of the display on the device remains on).
- the developer can facilitate user-initiated refresh of content/ads via a class responsible for generating gallery views, for instance to provide a carousel-style browsing of ads.
- the software development kit 214 can be extended or enhanced using a wizard in an interface directed toward publishers.
- the advertisement distributor system 222 can provide a user interface where publishers can establish an account to become affiliated with an advertising program, and this interface can feature the wizard as a way for the developer to customize the look and feel of content/ads to be displayed in connection with the application 206.
- this can be implemented as a self-service sign-up process for developers, for instance to allow the opportunity to enhance their application offering with advertisements and/or other content.
- such an interface can provide reporting statistics on advertisement clicks, impressions, queries, revenue, and/or other aspects to the advertisement distributor system 222.
- the software development kit 214 is provided to a developer for developing the application 206 for the mobile device 204.
- the software development kit 214 inserts a preconfigured object (e.g., object 216) into the application 204.
- the object 216 is configured for requesting advertisements 212 for the application 206 before compilation. Accordingly, the advertisements 212 may be forwarded to the application 206 of the mobile device 204 based on requests or other instructions from the object 216.

- the types of mobile applications 308 can include games, utilities, news applications, configuration tools, video or media players, and/or the like.
- the mobile application 308 can be installed on the mobile device 304 before the device is initially sold by a manufacturer, or the mobile application 308 can be installed onto the mobile device at a later time (e.g., through a download process from a mobile device application store).
- the application 308 includes an object 314 as provided by the software development kit 214.
- the object 314 may have been provided in the code of the application 308 prior to compilation of the application 308.
- the object 314 may allow for presenting advertisements during use of the application 308.
- the object allows for display of the advertisement 306 while the mobile application 308 is playing the media content on the mobile device 304 (e.g., while a user is using the mobile application 308 to watch the media content).
- the application 308 may be configured (e.g., via the object 314 and the software development kit 214) to submit an advertisement request (or "ad request") to the advertisement system 302.
- an ad request may include ad spot information (e.g., a number of advertisements desired, a duration, type of ads eligible, etc.).
- the ad request may also include information about the content item (e.g., 312) that triggered the request for the advertisements.
- This information may include the content item itself (e.g., a page, a video file, a segment of an audio stream, data associated with the video or audio file, etc.), one or more categories or topics corresponding to the content item or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts- movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, and/or the like.
- the information in the ad request submitted by the application 308 may indicate characteristics of the video content item 312 that triggered the request for the advertisements. Such characteristics may be used to determine advertisements having a matching placement preference. For instance, the ad request may indicate whether the video content item allows pre-roll placement of ads, mid-roll placement, post-roll placement, overlaid placement, and/or the like. Alternatively or additionally, the ad request may indicate whether a viewer has capability of skipping advertisements. Then,
- advertisements with matching placement preference may be selected to be presented in or with the video content item.
- a video content item may allow only post-roll placement of advertisements (e.g., the advertisements may be presented only after the video content item has finished playing) and may not allow a viewer to skip advertisements. Then, those ads with the matching placement preference may be selected and placed relative to video content item based on the placement preference.
- VAST is an
- XML document format describing an advertisement to be displayed in, over, or around a video player of the mobile application 308 or a wrapper pointing to a downstream VAST document, such as a video advertisement (e.g., 306), to be requested.
- VAST Digital Video Ad Serving Template
- Advertising Bureau that establishes reference communication protocols between scriptable video rendering systems and advertisement servers, as well as associated XML schemas.
- VAST helps standardize the service of video advertisements to web sites or applications (e.g., mobile application 308).
- VAST may be based, at least in part, on JavaScript included in the web page or application code, and may also aid in tracking traffic and managing cookies.
- VAST can also insert promotional messages in the pre-roll, post-roll, and during (e.g., linear advertisement) viewing of other video content, as well as overlaid on (e.g., non-linear advertisement) the video content item, delivered by the web site or the application.
- a web site owner or application developer need not concern himself or herself with selling or running the advertisements and still be able to receive revenue based on audience viewership/impressions and/or the like.
- a video advertisement (or other type of advertisement) inserted into a video content item played by the mobile application 308 may be a linear video advertisement or a non-linear video advertisement.
- a linear video advertisement is displayed in sequence before, during, or after the video content item being consumed by the user (e.g., as played on the mobile application 308).
- One of the key characteristics of a linear video advertisement is that the advertisement demands the full attention from the user as the advertisement takes over the user experience entirely, typically for a bounded period of time.
- the full advertisement experience may be open-ended.
- a clickable companion display advertisement is run adjacent to the player content window.
- advertisement may be a non-video advertisement, such as a text advertisement, link advertisement, image advertisement (e.g., static image or animated image), and/or the like.
- Non-linear advertisement formats run in parallel to the main video content experience. As a result, in some implementations, multiple stages to the advertisement display are employed. For instance, initially, there is some form of invitation or teaser unit that invites the user to further interact and usually expand the advertisement unit.
- a common instance of a non-linear advertisement format is an "overlay"-type advertisement, whose invitation is shown directly over the video content item as the video content item is played by the application 308.
- These non-linear advertisements are delivered as text, graphical banners/buttons, or as video and are placed within the video window, either over the content itself or directly on the top edge or bottom edge of the video content item during the content play.
- the application 308 (e.g., via the object 314) includes a metric tracking engine 316 for collecting metrics relating to user interactions associated with the advertisement 306 presented in the mobile application 308.
- a metric tracking engine 316 for collecting metrics relating to user interactions associated with the advertisement 306 presented in the mobile application 308.
- the metric tracking engine 316 monitors and collects impression metrics and/or other metrics, non-limiting examples of which are provided in the disclosure, of the advertisement 306 presented in the mobile application 308.
- the metric tracking engine 316 sends the collected metrics to an application tracking engine 310, which may be provided on or otherwise associated with the advertisement system 302.
- the application tracking engine 310 may store and/or process the metrics received from the metric tracking engine 316.
- Metrics for the linear video advertisements include, but are not limited to:
- Video Click-through Occurs when a user clicks on the linear video advertisement and is taken to the advertiser's web landing page.
- Completed play Occurs immediately upon completion of the video advertisement play (e.g., during normal speed).
- Time spent viewing Amount of video advertisement viewed at normal speed in seconds or other appropriate time-based units; if a rewind event occurs during play, time spent viewing may be calculated on total amount of video advertisement viewed at normal speed (e.g., including additional amounts of video viewed after rewind).
- Percent complete Percentage of video advertisement viewed continuously at normal speed. If a rewind event occurs during play, percent complete may be calculated on total amount of unduplicated video advertisement viewed at normal speed. Each section of video advertisement may only be considered once in the calculation. This definition governs the triggering of any "partial play" metrics, such as the common quartile percentages (25%, 50%>, 75%)). Specifically, any partial play reporting must be based on the trigger being activated based on normal viewing speed.
- Audio mute Indicates when a user clicks or otherwise activates the mute control.
- Audio un-mute Indicates when a user clicks or otherwise actives the un-mute control. If the un-mute control is the same as the mute control, the reporting should be able to differentiate the two events.
- Collapse Indicates when the user clicks or otherwise actives the Collapse control in order to contract the video-pane size. Often refers to contraction of the video advertisement to its original experience, but can be applied to any contraction of video-pane size.
- Expand Indicates when the user clicks or otherwise actives the Expand control in order to expand the video-pane size. Often refers to expansion of the video advertisement to a full-screen experience, but can be applied to any expansion of video-pane size.
- Pause Indicates that the video advertisement was intentionally stopped mid-play when the user clicks or otherwise activates a Pause control.
- Resume Indicates that the video advertisement was intentionally re-started mid-play when the user clicks or otherwise actives a Resume control. If the Resume control is the same as the Pause control, the reporting should be able to differentiate the two events.
- Rewind Indicates that a user clicks or otherwise activates a Rewind control in order to move backwards along the video advertisement timeline.
- Metrics for non-linear advertisements include, but are not limited to:
- Accept invitation Indicates that the user clicks or otherwise activates a control to expand the viewable area (or "take-over" the video content area) and launch an additional portion of the advertisement.
- a video advertisement is usually played upon acceptance, but other types of formats, including rich media, may be also used.
- Minimize Indicates that the user clicks or otherwise activates a control to minimize the advertisement without fully dispatching the advertisement from the player environment.
- Close Indicates that the user clicks or otherwise activates a close control that fully dispatches the advertisement from the player environment.
- Overlay view duration The time that the initial advertisement is displayed based on the time between the impression and either the completed length of display based on the agreement between publisher and advertiser or a close, minimize, or accept invitation event.
- these formats may launch additional video advertisement portions when the user chooses to launch additional content. Metrics reported on any additional video portions of the advertisement may be governed by the definitions for linear video advertisements.
- an advertisement server redirect response is wrapped in additional XML including relevant tracking URIs ("XML Wrapper Method").
- tag-based syntax to include impression and click tracking in the request may be used in much the same way as rich media works today (“Rich Media Method”).
- one or more advertisement servers may include fields in their trafficking interfaces for the entry of a number of reporting URIs from publishers and networks (“Multiple URI Method").
- the application 308 begins playback of a video content item 312.
- a video content item 312 e.g., video file, video stream, etc.
- the application 308 may be or may include a video player module for playing the video content item 312.
- the application e.g., via the object 314, which corresponds to the object 214) requests an advertisement 306 from an advertisement server (e.g., the advertisement server).
- an advertisement server e.g., the advertisement server
- the application 308 may request the advertisement before, during, or after playback of the video content item 312.
- a request may be in response to the application 308 detecting an advertisement slot in the video content item.
- the video advertisement is requested for placement in the detected advertisement slot and for display to the user when playback of the video content item reaches the advertisement slot.
- the object 314 of the application 308 may be configured to request an advertisement when the video content item 312 reaches a certain timestamp (e.g., as defined by the developer with the SDK 214) during playback by the application 308.
- one or more advertisement slots are added to the video content item by the developer of the application 308, for instance, via the SDK 214.
- the developer may indicate parameters (e.g., position, length, frequency, etc.) of the advertisement slots in the video content item as part of the process of developing the application 308 or as a subsequent modification to the application 308.
- parameters of advertisement slots in the video content item 312 are determined by an automated process.
- the request merely asks for one or more advertisements, without requesting for any specific advertisement.
- the request may ask for a specific advertisement.
- the request includes information, such as (but not limited to) an identifier of the video content item (e.g., a video ID), metadata associated with the video content item, position of the advertisement slot, length of the advertisement slot, and/or the like.
- the application 308 receives a response from the advertisement system 302 in response to the request.
- the response may be based on the VAST standard.
- the advertisement system 302 may determine the response (e.g., advertisement for placement) based on any number of factors, including but not limited to the position of the advertisement slot relative to video feature content, identity of presenting application or mobile device, ability to skip advertisements, length of the advertisement slot, metadata associated with the video, any categories with which the video content item are associated, ad request preferences (e.g., post-roll placement only), and/or the like. Based on such factors, the advertisement system 302 may identify advertisements for providing to the application 308.
- the application 308 parses the response to obtain information for playing the video advertisement (or other type of advertisement) 306.
- the response may include information on a location (e.g., an advertisement server part of or remote from the advertisement system 302) from which the video advertisement 306 may be received.
- the application 308 displays the video advertisement 306 (e.g., at the advertisement slot).
- the application 308 may display the advertisement 306 before, during, or after playback of the video content item 312. For instance, if the advertisement 306 is displayed during playback of the video content item 312, the application 308 may pause the video content item 312 while the advertisement 308 is displayed or the advertisement 308 may be overlaid on the video content item 312 (e.g., while the video content item 312 is paused or continues playing).
- the application 308 may monitor user-interaction metrics, for instance, whether the advertisement 306 was clicked on, muted, expanded, and/or the like.
- the application 308 provides the metrics, for instance, to the application tracking engine 310, which may be provided on the advertisement system 302 or other suitable server.
- the metrics may be provided to the advertisement system 302 while the advertisement 306 is displayed or after the advertisement 306 is finished (e.g., upon resuming playback of the video content item 312, after the video content item 312 has finished, etc.).
- the application 308 may resume normal playback of the video content item 312 upon completion of the advertisement 306. For instance, if the video content item 312 was paused (or not yet started), the application 308 may resume playback of the video content item 312. Or for instance, if the advertisement 306 was overlaid on the video content item 312, the application 308 may resume playback of the video 312 free of any objects or the like overlaid on the video content item 312.
- delivery of video advertisements 306 may be improved by using a set of key- value pairs that can be added to the advertisement tag request (e.g., as in block B420) in order to reduce errors resulting from incorrect advertisement responses. For instance, if a publisher only wishes to receive Windows Media-formatted video
- an advertisement serving vendor may wish to define the advertisement tag in such a way as to only provide advertisements with those specifications.
- delivery of video advertisements 306 may be improved by providing communication between the video advertisement and the video player application 308 in which the video advertisement is displayed. This communication is important because both Linear and Non-Linear video advertisements can be interactive, and such user interaction will generally affect the activity of the video player application 308. For instance, when a user clicks on an overlay advertisement 306, the user may be presented with more information about the advertiser, while the video content item 312 being played on the video player application 308 is expected to pause.
- Various implementations allow an advertiser to book an advertisement campaign that delivers on both mobile devices and computers (e.g., via an HTML browser).
- the advertiser may target videos (e.g., place video advertisements within the videos) that are syndicated across web sites and mobile platforms, and that may appear on desktop web or mobile applications.
