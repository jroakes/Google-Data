Definitions
- the present invention relates, in general, to communication systems and, more particularly, to coding information signals in such communication systems.
- CDMA communication systems are well known.
- One exemplary CDMA communication system is the so-called IS-95 which is defined for use in North America by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA).
- TIA Telecommunications Industry Association
- EIA Electronic Industries Association
- a variable rate speech codec, and specifically Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) codec, for use in communication systems compatible with IS-95 is defined in the document known as IS-127 and titled Enhanced Variable Rate Codec, Speech Service Option 3 for Wideband Spread Spectrum Digital Systems, September 1996. IS-127 is also published by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA), 2001 Eye Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006.
- EIA Electronic Industries Association
- FIG. 1 generally depicts a CELP decoder as is known in the prior art.
- FIG. 2 generally depicts a Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) encoder as is known in the prior art.
- CELP Code Excited Linear Prediction
- FIG. 3 generally depicts a CELP-based fixed codebook (FCB) closed loop encoder with pitch enhancement as is known in the prior art.
- FCB CELP-based fixed codebook
- FIG. 4 generally depicts CELP-based FCB closed loop encoder with variable configuration in accordance with the invention.
- FIG. 5 generally depicts a flow chart depicting the process occurring within the configuration control block of FIG. 4 in accordance with the invention.
- FIG. 6 generally depicts a CELP decoder implementing configuration control in accordance with the invention.
- a speech coder for coding an information signal varies the codebook configuration based on parameters inherent in the information signal.
- the speech coder requires no additional overhead for sending of mode parameters while allowing subframe resolution.
- the configurations vary not only for voicing level, but also for pitch period since different physiological traits yield different codebook configurations.
- a dispersion matrix within the speech coder facilitates a codebook search which is performed on vectors whose length can be less than a subframe length. Additionally, use of the dispersion matrix allows the addition of random events for very slightly voiced speech which incurs little computational overhead but produces a rich excitation.
- a method of coding an information signal includes the steps of selecting one of a plurality of configurations based on predetermined parameters related to the information signal, each of the plurality of configurations having a codebook and determining a codebook index from the codebook corresponding to the selected configuration. The method also includes the step of transmitting the predetermined parameters and the codebook index to a destination.
- the information signal comprises either a speech signal, video signal or an audio signal and the configurations are based on various classifications of the information signal.
- a corresponding apparatus implements the inventive method.
- FIG. 1 generally depicts a Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) decoder 100 as is known in the art.
- CELP Code Excited Linear Prediction
- the excitation sequence or "codevector" c k is generated from a fixed codebook 102 (FCB) using the appropriate codebook index k.
- This signal is scaled using the FCB gain factor ⁇ and combined with a signal E(n) output from an adaptive codebook 104 (ACB) and scaled by a factor ⁇ , which is used to model the long term (or periodic) component of a speech signal (with period ⁇ ).
- the signal E t (n) which represents the total excitation, is used as the input to the LPC synthesis filter 106, which models the coarse short term spectral shape, commonly referred to as "formants".
- the output of the synthesis filter 106 is then perceptually postfiltered by perceptual postfilter 108 in which the coding distortions are effectively "masked” by amplifying the signal spectra at frequencies that contain high speech energy, and attenuating those frequencies that contain less speech energy. Additionally, the total excitation signal E t (n) is used as the adaptive codebook for the next block of synthesized speech.
- FIG. 2 generally depicts a CELP encoder 200.
- the goal is to code the perceptually weighted target signal x w (n), which can be represented in general terms by the z-transform:
- W(z) is the transfer function of the perceptual weighting filter 208, and is of the form: ##EQU1## and H(z) is the transfer function of the perceptually weighted synthesis filters 206 and 210, and is of the form: ##EQU2## and where A(z) are the unquantized direct form LPC coefficients, A q (z) are the quantized direct form LPC coefficients, and ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 2 are perceptual weighting coefficients.
- H ZS (z) is the "zero state” response of H(z) from filter 206, in which the initial state of H(z) is all zeroes
- H ZIR (z) is the "zero input response" of H(z) from filter 210, in which the previous state of H(z) is allowed to evolve with no input excitation.
- the initial state used for generation of H ZIR (z) is derived from the total excitation E t (n) from the previous subframe.
- FCB fixed codebook
- c k (n) is the codevector corresponding to FCB codebook index k
- ⁇ k is the optimal FCB gain associated with codevector c k (n)
- h(n) is the impulse response of the perceptually weighted synthesis filter H(z)
- M is the codebook size
- L is the subframe length
- * denotes the convolution process
- x w (n) ⁇ k c k (n)*h(n).
- speech is coded every 20 milliseconds (ms) and each frame includes three subframes of length L.
- Eq. 4 can also be expressed in vector-matrix form as:
- pulse 2 can occupy positions 2, 9, 16, . . . , 51, and pulse 3 can occupy positions 4, 11, 18, . . . , 53.
- This is known as "interleaved pulse permutation," which is well known in the art.
- the sign bit is then set according to the sign of the gain term ⁇ k .
- FIG. 3 generally depicts a CELP-based fixed codebook (FCB) closed loop encoder with pitch enhancement.
- FCB CELP-based fixed codebook
- the transfer function of the pitch sharpening filter P(z) is given in IS-127 as: ##EQU10## where ⁇ is the adaptive codebook gain and ⁇ is the adaptive codebook pitch period.
- MMSE minimum mean squared error
- c' k is the pitch filter input
- P is an L ⁇ L matrix given as: ##EQU11##
- the pitch period ⁇ is less than the subframe length L, but greater than L/2. If ⁇ L/2 (or L/3, etc.), higher order powers of ⁇ (i.e., ⁇ 2 , ⁇ 3 , etc.) would appear in lower left diagonals of P, and would be spaced ⁇ rows/columns apart. Likewise, if ⁇ L, P would default to the identity matrix I. For clarity, it is assumed that L/2 ⁇ L.
- the pitch filtered excitation vector c k can be generated by: ##EQU16## which is equivalent to equation 4.5.7.1-3 in IS-127.
- While the pitch filtering improves performance for short pitch periods ⁇ L, it has no effect for longer periods L ⁇ max , e.g., ⁇ max 120. It also has relatively little impact when the closed loop pitch gain ⁇ is small, which may not directly correlate with overall target signal periodicity, especially during pitch transitions (i.e., a strong pitch component may be changing from subframe to subframe, resulting in a poor ACB prediction gain). It is also ineffective during very slightly voiced speech, in which noisy sounds can be "gritty" due to undermodeled excitation together with low amplitude due to poor correlation with the target signal.
- FIG. 4 generally depicts a block diagram of a variable configuration FCB closed loop encoder 400 in accordance with the invention. As shown in FIG. 4, a configuration control block 404 and a dispersion matrix block 406 replace the pitch filtering block 304 in the prior art. Additionally, the fixed codebook block 402 can now vary with the configuration number m.
- the excitation model when given a set of predetermined quantized speech parameters ⁇ , ⁇ and A q (z), the excitation model is varied to take advantage of a particular mode of speech production that the predetermined parameters are most likely to represent.
- the prior art uses a multi-modal coding structure in which a four level voicing decision is made to determine a specific coding process. Three of the levels (strongly voiced, moderately voiced, and slightly voiced) simply use alternate fixed codebooks, while the fourth method (very slightly voiced) uses a combination of two fixed codebooks, and eliminates the adaptive codebook contribution.
- predetermined quantized speech parameters ⁇ , ⁇ and A q (Z) and codebook index k are sent to a destination for use in a decoding process in accordance with the invention, such decoding process described below with reference to FIG. 6.
- variable configuration multipulse CELP speech coder and decoder and corresponding method in accordance with the invention differs from the prior art in, inter alia, the following ways:
- the configuration mode decision is made on a subframe basis (typically 2 to 4 subframes per frame); in the prior art, the decision is made on a 20 ms frame basis;
- the prior art includes at least 1 bit in the transmitted bitstream for the voicing mode decision;
- the fixed codebook configuration varies not only for voicing level, but also for pitch period. That is, a different configuration is used for long pitch periods than for middle and/or short pitch periods. While prior art does provide some provisions for pitch synchronicity, the speech production model is altered in accordance with the invention so as to mimic various phonation sources;
- the codebook search space may be less than a subframe length.
- the "backward filtering" process allows the codebook to be evaluated at the signal c k .sup.[m].
- a unique element of the current invention is that the dispersion matrix ⁇ m , can allow the dimension of c k .sup.[m] to be less than L, according to some function of the pitch period ⁇ . The dimension of c k is then restored to L upon multiplication by ⁇ m ;
- the dispersion matrix is used to generate linear combinations of a single base vector.
- the search is evaluated at the signal c k .sup.[m] using the same pulse configuration as the default voiced mode configuration, thus adding no complexity during the search;
- the MMSE criteria in accordance with the invention can be expressed as:
- FIG. 5 generally depicts a flow chart depicting the process occurring within the configuration control block 404 of FIG. 4 and FIG. 6 in accordance with the invention.
- the quantized direct form LPC coefficients A q (z) are converted to a reflection coefficient vector r c at step 504; this process is well known.
- Configuration 1 at step 518 is the default configuration.
- the dispersion matrix ⁇ 1 is defined as the L ⁇ L identity matrix I
- the codebook structure is defined to be a three pulse configuration similar to the IS-127 half rate case. This configuration totals 10 bits per subframe which comprises 3 bits for 8 positions per pulse, and 1 global sign bit corresponding to [+, -, +] or [-, +, -] for each of the respective pulses.
- One exception to IS-127 is that the present invention utilizes a uniformly distributed interleaved pulse position codebook as opposed to the non-optimum IS-127 codebook which can actually place pulses outside the usable subframe dimension L.
- the present invention defines the allowable pulse positions for configuration 1 as:
- .left brkt-bot.x.right brkt-bot. is the floor function which truncates x to the largest integer ⁇ x.
- pulse p 3 ⁇ [4,11,18,24,31,38,44,51], which is slightly different from that given in Table 4.5.7.4-1 of IS-127. While providing only minor performance improvement over the IS-127 configuration, the importance of this notation will become apparent for the following configuration.
- Configuration 2 at step 514 is indicative of a strongly voiced input in which the pitch period ⁇ is less than the subframe length L.
- the dimension of the codebook output signal c k .sup.[2] is actually less than the subframe length L.
- the length of c k .sup.[2] is a function of the pitch period ⁇ ( ⁇ ).
- ⁇ 2 In order to compensate for this in the MMSE Eq. 21, if c k .sup.[2] is a column vector of dimension ⁇ (t), then ⁇ 2 must be of dimension L ⁇ ( ⁇ ).
- the pulse signs are the same as that for configuration 1.
- the dispersion matrix is structured to more appropriately model the shape of the low frequency glottal excitation.
- ⁇ 3 as the L ⁇ L matrix ##EQU21## we thereby "spread" the pulse energy over several samples of decaying magnitude.
- ⁇ max 120.
- Configuration 4 at step 526 is similar in concept to configuration 3 for strongly voiced pitch periods between 95 and 109.
- the same pulse position and sign convention is used, the difference being that the glottal excitation model described by ⁇ 3 is no longer valid.
- the matrix ⁇ 4 is defined simply as an L ⁇ L identity matrix I.
- Configuration 5 at step 528 which models strongly voiced speech with pitch periods between 65 and 94, is also similar to configuration 3.
- ⁇ 5 being defined as an L ⁇ L identity matrix I
- the signs of the pulses are defined to be alternating. This is because the pitch period is now approaching the subframe length, and a complete pitch period should contain no DC component.
- Configuration 6 at step 508 is used for modeling very slightly voiced speech, and is appropriately diverse in application.
- the fundamental problem with very slightly voiced speech, or noise-like sounds, is that a few pulses does not provide the richness needed for good overall sound quality.
- the normalized cross correlation (what we are trying to maximize in Eq. 22) between the multipulse codebook signal and a noisy target signal will ultimately be very low, which results in low FCB gain, and hence, synthesized speech with energy significantly lower than that of the original speech.
- Configuration 6 solves this problem as follows:
- N p 4 non-zero values of magnitude 1/ ⁇ N p and alternating signs.
- the positions within v having non-zero values are generated by a mutually exclusive uniform random number generator over the interval [0, L-1].
- This sequence is generated independently by the encoder and decoder, which can be synchronized by seeding the random number generator with a common value, such as the incremental subframe number or with a transmitted parameter, such as the LPC index.
- each pulse within the codevector c k .sup.[6] is capable of generating an independent circular phase of the base vector v.
- FIG. 6 generally depicts a CELP decoder 600 implementing configuration control in accordance with the invention.
- configuration control block 404 and dispersion matrix 406 are included in decoder 600.
- configuration control block 404 uses these parameters to determine the configuration m for the particular sample of coded speech.
- Fixed codebook 102 uses codebook index k (sent by encoder 400) as input to generate output c k .sup.[m] which is input into dispersion matrix 406.
- Dispersion matrix 406 outputs excitation sequence c k which is then combined with the scaled output of adaptive codebook 104 and passed through synthesis filter 106 and perceptual post filter 108 to eventually generate the output speech signal in accordance with the invention.
