Definitions
- Described embodiments relate generally to web-based video viewing and specifically to recommending videos based on keywords extracted from titles of videos in an online video content distribution system.
- Networked video viewing enables users to upload, watch and share videos in fast-growing online video entertainment communities.
- An online video content distribution site such as YOUTUBE allows content providers to upload videos easily; users of the site can easily share videos by mailing links to others, or embedding them on web pages or in blogs.
- Users browsing the video content distribution site can find videos of interest by, for example, searching for videos, browsing video directories, or sorting videos by ratings assigned to the videos.
- some video hosting services group related videos together based on some measurement of relatedness or similarity among the videos and present the identified videos as video recommendations to users.
- One existing solution assumes that a viewer is likely to watch videos that are similar in content and ranks videos based on similarity of the video content.
- video recommendations based on such ranking do not always make sense to viewers. For example, a video selected based on its content similar to a video that has been viewed by a viewer may not have a suitable thumbnail, or be too long to watch, especially when the viewer wants to browse as many videos as possible within a limited time period.
- a solution is provided to generate video recommendations in a video sharing environment.
- a video recommendation system selects a target video, e.g., a video related to a trending headline on Google News, and extracts target keywords from the title of the selected video. For example, the system extracts any word having more than three characters from the title of the selected video and eliminates any word identified in a predefined set of generic words (e.g., what/when/where/how/why).
- the system retrieves keywords extracted from titles of multiple candidate videos stored in a video database. For each candidate video, the system compares keywords extracted from the title of the candidate video with the target words. Based on the comparison, the system generates a similarity score for the candidate video. The system ranks the candidate videos based on their associated similarity scores and selects one or more candidate videos as the video recommendations for the target video.
- Another embodiment includes a non-transitory computer-readable medium that stores executable computer program instructions for generating video recommendations in the manner described above.

Abstract
Description
- Described embodiments relate generally to web-based video viewing and specifically to recommending videos based on keywords extracted from titles of videos in an online video content distribution system.
- Networked video viewing enables users to upload, watch and share videos in fast-growing online video entertainment communities. An online video content distribution site such as YOUTUBE allows content providers to upload videos easily; users of the site can easily share videos by mailing links to others, or embedding them on web pages or in blogs. Users browsing the video content distribution site can find videos of interest by, for example, searching for videos, browsing video directories, or sorting videos by ratings assigned to the videos.
- To facilitate users' viewing of videos of interest, some video hosting services group related videos together based on some measurement of relatedness or similarity among the videos and present the identified videos as video recommendations to users. One existing solution assumes that a viewer is likely to watch videos that are similar in content and ranks videos based on similarity of the video content. However, video recommendations based on such ranking do not always make sense to viewers. For example, a video selected based on its content similar to a video that has been viewed by a viewer may not have a suitable thumbnail, or be too long to watch, especially when the viewer wants to browse as many videos as possible within a limited time period.
- A solution is provided to generate video recommendations in a video sharing environment.
- In one embodiment, a video recommendation system selects a target video, e.g., a video related to a trending headline on Google News, and extracts target keywords from the title of the selected video. For example, the system extracts any word having more than three characters from the title of the selected video and eliminates any word identified in a predefined set of generic words (e.g., what/when/where/how/why). The system retrieves keywords extracted from titles of multiple candidate videos stored in a video database. For each candidate video, the system compares keywords extracted from the title of the candidate video with the target words. Based on the comparison, the system generates a similarity score for the candidate video. The system ranks the candidate videos based on their associated similarity scores and selects one or more candidate videos as the video recommendations for the target video.
- Another embodiment includes a non-transitory computer-readable medium that stores executable computer program instructions for generating video recommendations in the manner described above.
- The features and advantages described in the specification are not all inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the disclosed subject matter.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of avideo hosting service 100 having avideo recommendation system 102. Multiple users/viewers useclients 110A-N to upload videos to avideo hosting service 100 for hosting, and receive various services from thevideo hosting service 100, including video recommendations. Thevideo hosting service 100 communicates with one ormore clients 110A-N via anetwork 130 and provide video recommendations generated by thevideo recommendation system 102 to theclients 110A-N. - Turning to the individual entities illustrated on
FIG. 1 , each client 110 is used by a user to use services provided by thevideo hosting service 100. For example, a user uses a client 110 to upload videos or groups of videos, to watch a video and receive one or more video recommendations for a video being watched or a video search request. The client 110 can be any type of computer device, such as a personal computer (e.g., desktop, notebook, laptop) computer, as well as devices such as a mobile telephone or personal digital assistant that has the capability to record video content. The client 110 typically includes a processor, a display device (or output to a display device), a local storage, such as a hard drive or flash memory device, to which the client 110 stores data used by the user in performing tasks, and a network interface for coupling to thevideo hosting services 100 via thenetwork 130. A client 110 also has a video player 120 for playing back a video. The video player 120 may be a standalone application, or a plug-in to another application such as a network browser. - The
network 130 enables communications between the clients 110 and thevideo hosting service 100. In one embodiment, thenetwork 130 is the Internet, and uses standardized internetworking communications technologies and protocols, known now or subsequently developed that enable the clients 110 to communicate with thevideo hosting service 100. In another embodiment, thenetwork 130 is a cloud computing network and includes one or more components of thevideo hosting service 100. - The
video hosting service 100 comprises avideo recommendation system 102, avideo database 104, avideo server 106 and auser database 108. Other embodiments of thevideo hosting service 100 may include other and/or different computer modules. Thevideo database 104 stores videos uploaded by users or by other sources. Thevideo database 104 also stores metadata for each of the videos stored in thevideo database 104. Video metadata describes various characteristics of the video, e.g., identification of the video, title of the video, keywords extracted from the title, source of the video, tag of the video, duration of the video, uploading time of the video and number of viewers of the video. Videos stored in thevideo database 104 of thevideo hosting service 100 can be classified into multiple classes based on a variety of criteria, such as type of the videos (e.g., news, sports, education/academic and the like), sources of the videos and uploading dates and time of the video (e.g., videos uploaded within the past 24 hours). The classification of a video can be stored as a part of metadata associated with the video. Thevideo recommendation system 102 is adapted to rank the videos in thevideo database 104 regardless whether the videos are classified or not. Thevideo server 106 receives videos uploaded to thehosting service 100 and stores them in thevideo database 104. Theuser database 108 stores user information associated with the videos uploaded by the users to thehosting service 100. - The
video recommendation system 102 comprises akeyword extraction module 200 and avideo ranking module 300. Thevideo recommendation system 102 analyzes the videos stored in thevideo database 104 to extract keywords from the video titles and compare the extracted keywords with target keywords associated with a target video. A target video is a video for which one or more related videos are recommended by thevideo recommendation system 102 based on similarity scores associated with the recommended videos. Based on the comparison, thevideo recommendation system 102 ranks the videos and selects one or more videos based on the ranking as video recommendations. In one embodiment, thevideo recommendation system 102 generates video recommendations for target keywords offline (i.e., not in real time). Other embodiments of thevideo recommendations system 102 can generate video recommendations in real time. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of akeyword extraction module 200 of thevideo recommendation system 102 illustrated inFIG. 1 . In the embodiment illustrated inFIG. 2 , thekeyword extraction module 200 includes anidentification module 210, anextraction module 220 and ametadata module 230. Thekeyword extraction module 200 selects a video as a target video for thevideo recommendation system 102 and extracts target keywords from the title of the selected target video. The target keywords of a target video are used to select videos stored in thevideo database 104, which are related to the target video. Thekeyword extraction module 200 further obtains metadata of videos stored in thevideo database 104 and keywords from the titles of the videos stored in thevideo database 104. - The
identification module 210 selects a video as a target video for thevideo recommendation system 102. For example, theidentification module 210 selects a video that is classified as a news-related video, e.g., a video associated with a trending headline on Google News as a target video. Google News is a computer-generated news site aggregating headlines and their associated videos from news sources worldwide. In one embodiment, theidentification module 210 identifies a trending news item from a non-video corpus, e.g., a set of news stories. Theidentification module 210 selects a video as a target video based on the title of the selected trending news item. It is noted that a title of a media item, e.g., a trending news item, is often an efficient way to summarize the information the media item presents. For example, the title of a trending headline news stating “Actor Robin Williams has died at 63” compactly conveys the information presented in the news. A video having content related to the trending headline news, e.g., a collection of posters of films where Robin Williams had a leading role, is likely to be viewed by the readers of the trending headline news. - Other embodiments of the
identification module 210 may select other videos as target videos for thevideo recommendation system 102. For example, theidentification module 210 receives videos selected by users of thevideo hosing service 100 as target videos. In another example, theidentification module 210 considers each video stored in thevideo database 104 as a target video. - The
extraction module 220 of thekeyword extraction module 200 extracts target keywords from the title of a selected target video or a selected non-video trending news item and extracts one or more keywords from the titles of the videos stored in thevideo database 104. Any scheme of keywords extraction known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used by theextraction module 220, e.g., keywords identification based on distance between words, frequency of words use or predetermined word relationships. In one embodiment, theextraction module 220 extracts any words that have more than three characters from a string of characters. The string of characters may represent the title of a video of a trending headline from Google News, or the title of a user selected video. To further improve the compactness, theextraction module 220 eliminates generic words such as “what,” “where,” “when,” “whether” and “how” from the extracted keywords. To avoid eliminating keywords unnecessarily, theextraction module 220 ignores the capitalization of letters in the title. - Taking a trending news titled “People around the world celebrate the Earth Day when April 20 approaches” as an example, the
extraction module 220 extracts “People,” “around,” “world,” “celebrate,” “Earth” “April” and “approaches” as the target keywords and eliminates the generic term “when” and “around” from the list of the keywords for the video. Taking a news video titled “Iraq-ISIS 2014: Obama on Iraqi Airstrikes and Airdrops|The New York Times” as another example, theextraction module 220 extracts “Iraq,” ISIS,” “2014,” Obama,” “Iraqi,” Airstrikes,” “Airdrops,” “York” and “Times” as the keywords for the video. - In one embodiment, the
keyword extraction module 200 extracts keywords from titles of the videos upon the uploading of the videos into thevideo hosting service 100. In other embodiments thekeyword extraction module 200 extracts keywords upon request, e.g., upon a search request received by thevideo hosting service 100, according to a predetermined schedule, e.g., every 1000 videos received by thevideo hosting service 100, or every 24 hours. Thekeyword extraction module 200 stores the extracted keywords in thevideo database 104 along with their associated titles, e.g., storing the extracted keywords in a table accessible by thevideo ranking module 300. - The
metadata module 230 obtains metadata associated with videos stored in thevideo server 104. Metadata of a video describes various characteristics of the video. Examples of metadata of a video include, e.g., title of the video, keywords of the title, source of the video, tag of the video, duration of the video, uploading time of the video and number of viewers of the video. The metadata of a video may also include information describing the classification of the video and the video compression data, e.g., bitrate and frame size of the video and/or characteristics of the encoding used to encode video frames of the video data, e.g., the type of compression algorithm. Themetadata module 230 stores the metadata of a video along with the identification of the video in thevideo database 104. - The
video ranking module 300 of thevideo recommendation system 102 inFIG. 1 ranks the videos stored in thevideo database 104. A video can be related to another video in a variety of ways, such as video content, sources of videos, uploading times of videos and being grouped together with other videos on one or more video playlists. Thevideo ranking module 300 can rank the videos differently based on different ranking criteria. In one embodiment, thevideo ranking module 300 ranks the videos stored in thevideo database 104 based on the similarity between the keywords in the video titles and a set of target keywords of a target video. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of avideo ranking module 300 of the video recommendation system illustrated inFIG. 1 . Thevideo ranking module 300 inFIG. 3 has amatching module 310, aranking module 320 and arecommendation module 330. Other embodiments of thevideo ranking module 300 can have different or additional modules. - The
matching module 310 computes similarity scores for the videos stored in the video database with respect to a target video. In one embodiment, thematching module 310 generates a similarity score for a video based on the comparison of keywords extracted from the title of the video with the target keywords extracted from the title of the target video or the tile of a selected non-video news item. For each keyword of the target keywords found in the title of the video, thematching module 310 adds a point to the similarity score of the video. - For example, the target keywords for a target video selected from videos classified as news-videos, e.g., videos associated with trending headlines on Google News titled “Actor Robin Williams has died at 63” are “Actor,” “Robin,” “Williams” and “Died.” The
matching module 310 matches each of the target words against the keywords of the titles of the videos stored in thevideo database 104 or a subset of the videos stored in thevideo database 104, e.g., news videos updated to thevideo hosting service 100 in the last 24 hours. For each match found in the title of a video, thematching module 310 gives one point to the similarity score of the video. TABLE I below shows examples of videos stored in thevideo database 104 and their associated similarity scores against the target keywords extracted from the title of “Actor Robin Williams has died at 63.” -
TABLE I Source of Target Keywords Google News Target keywords {Actor, Robin, Williams, Died} Similarity Videos Title Keywords Score V1 Robin Williams Died at 63 {Robin, Williams, Died} 3 V2 Robin Williams, Beloved Actor {Robin, Williams, 4 Comedian, Died at 63 Beloved, Actor, Comedian, Died} V3 Robin Williams: Irrepressible {Robin, Williams, 3 Actor Dies at 63|The New York Irrepressible, Actor, Dies} Times V4 BREAKING NEWS: Robin Williams {BREAKING, NEWS,, 2 Found Dead Robin, Williams, Found, Dead,} V5 Robin Williams: Tribute for Actor {Robin, Williams, Tribute, 4 Died at 63 Actor, Died} - The
ranking module 320 ranks the videos stored in thevideo database 104 for a target video. In one embodiment, theranking module 320 ranks the videos based on similarity scores associated with the videos. Theranking module 320 orders the videos starting with a video having the highest similarity score followed by a video having the next highest similarity score until the video having the lowest similarity score. - To increase the granularity of the ranking, the
ranking module 320 can augment the primary ranking based on similarity scores with one or more secondary ranking criteria. Examples of secondary ranking criteria include sources of videos, uploading time, duration of videos and number of viewers associated with a video. The source of a video may indicates quality of the video. For example, a video shot by a professional for “National Geography” is presumed to have better quality than a similar video shot by an amateur. A video shared by millions of users shows higher popularity than a video shared within a small group of friends. A video recently uploaded to thevideo sharing service 100 represents higher relevancy than a video uploaded a month ago. A long video may not be suitable for a viewer who wants a quick review of videos. - To consider multiple factors for ranking the videos stored in the
video database 104, thevideo ranking module 300 can assign weight to each ranking factors and computes an aggregated ranking score for each video related to a target video. The weight assigned to each ranking factor is a configurable design choice, e.g., based on user information describing user channel in the video sharing environment, user hobbies, etc. - The
recommendation module 330 receives the rankings of the videos for a target video and selects one or more videos based on the rankings as video recommendations. In one embodiment, therecommendation module 330 selects the video having the highest ranking as the recommendation and recommends the video to users of clients 110. -
FIG. 4 is an example of a flow diagram of video recommendation based on comparison of keywords extracted from titles of videos with target keywords of a target video. In the example shown inFIG. 4 , thevideo database 104 has a set 410 of 8 videos, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 and V8. Thekeyword extraction module 200 extracts a set of keywords from the title of each video.Block 420 lists the number of keywords extracted from the title of each video. Thevideo ranking module 300 compares the keywords associated with each video with a set of giventarget keywords 402 of a target video. For each keyword of the target keywords, theranking module 300 determines whether there is a match in the title of a video and adds a point to a similarity score of the video responsive to a match.Block 430 shows the videos and their associated similarity scores and the ranking order of the videos based on their similarity scores starting with the highest one. Theranking module 300 selects thevideo 410 with the highest similarity score, e.g., video V1, as the recommendation for the given set of target keywords. - It is noted that videos V5, V6 and V7 have a same similarity score, 2. To further rank the videos V5, V6 and V7, the
ranking module 300 may consider secondary factors such as sources of the videos, duration of the videos, uploading time of the videos and number of viewers of each video. Based on the analysis using the secondary factors, theranking module 300 generates an aggregated ranking score for each video. Theranking module 300 may computes an aggregated ranking score for all the 8 videos in another embodiment. -
FIG. 5 is a flow chart of keywords based video recommendation. Initially, thevideo recommendation system 102 receives 510 a set of target keywords for a target video, e.g., keywords extracted from the title of a trending news item identified by Google News received in the past 24 hours. Thevideo recommendation system 102 receives 520 multiple candidate videos, e.g., user uploaded videos or a class of videos classified by thevideo hosting service 100. For each candidate video, thevideo recommendation system 102 extracts 530 a set of keywords from the title of the video and compares 540 the target keywords with the keywords of the candidate video. Thevideo recommendation system 102 computes 550 a similarity score for each candidate video based on the keywords comparison. For example, a match between a keyword of the target keyword with a keyword from the title of the candidate video is counted as one point, which is added to the similarity score of the candidate video. Based the similarities scores associated with the candidate videos, thevideo recommendation system 102 ranks 560 the candidate videos and selects 570 a video, e.g., the video with the highest ranking, as a video recommendation for the target video. - In addition to videos, other embodiments of the
recommendation system 102 may select any other types of media, e.g., news, articles, digital images, audio files, or any machine-readable digital documents, as targets for recommendation. For each selected media item having a title, therecommendation system 102 extracts target keywords from the title of the media item and compares the target words with keywords of titles of videos stored in a video corpus. Based on the comparison of the keywords, therecommendation system 102 computes similarity scores and selects one or more related videos as recommendations for the selected media item. - Taking a news article, e.g., a trending new item selected from Google News, as an example, the
recommendation system 102 takes the new article as a target and extracts one or more keywords from the title of the new article as the target keywords. Therecommendation system 102 compares keywords associated with videos classified as news videos and stored in a news video corpus with the target keywords. Based on the comparison, therecommendation system 102 computes a similarity score for each news video. Therecommendation system 102 selects one or more news videos as recommendations for the target news article based on the similarity scores. - Reference in the specification to “one embodiment” or to “an embodiment” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiments is included in at least one embodiment of the invention.
