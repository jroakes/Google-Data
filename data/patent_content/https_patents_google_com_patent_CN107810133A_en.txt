Safely quick to stop, particularly in the case of emergency situations, the emergency situations such as run into vehicle trouble or accident.Its
His rollback task be related to drive extend period to it is default or based on determined by the state of vehicle another location.These classes
The rollback task of type is useful in some cases, and the situation is such as when motor vehicle fuel/energy is low, detects slight biography
Sensor degenerates, loses the connection with fleet management server or complete any other higher priority for any reason
Task after when lacking any specific executable instruction on what next to do.In these cases, vehicle is still
Can safe driving for a period of time, therefore be able to carry out being related to the rollback task for continuing to drive.Vehicle oneself is allowed to be driven to one
It is local that the stop position that someone has to go to vehicle is allowed to service or fetch than being parked in some position with being serviced or recovery connection
Vehicle is more desirable.
Computing device in autonomous vehicle can include the instruction for discrete tasks.Instruction for particular task can be with
Form individual module.There can be run-length management device module, it, which can be included, is used to navigate and manipulate between position
(maneuver) instruction of vehicle.There can also be task supervision module, it, which can be included, is used to handle received task request
Instruction.Task supervision module, which can also include, to be used to determine the instruction when task should be performed relative to each other；Change sentence
Talk about, management role queue.In addition, task supervision module can include being exclusively used in the submodule for managing rollback task, retract choosing
Select device module.Rollback selector module, which can include, to be used to handle the rollback task received and determines which to be performed and is retracted to appoint
Business and the instruction when performed.
Remote scheduling system may be in response to, and the task requests of adjoint or independently of passenger's correlation or non-passenger, will be used for
The information of one or more rollback tasks is sent to vehicle.The related task requests of passenger or stroke request can be provided and such as taken
The information of the destination locations of truck position and stroke.Non- passenger's task can include pre-determined bit, oiling/charging, stop, go to tie up
Repair, turn around block and update software.Rollback selector module can receive and handle rollback task.In some instances, as schemed
Shown in 5, if vehicle can not complete the task of passenger's correlation or non-passenger for any reason, each passenger's correlation
Or the task requests of non-passenger are sent together with vehicle can be caused to perform the back-off instruction of rollback task.
The task of passenger's correlation or non-passenger can be initiated by user via client computing device.User will can use
Scheduling system is sent in the information of the task of passenger's correlation or non-passenger.Then scheduling system can send task requests
To the computing device of vehicle, the task requests are received and handled there by task supervision module.One or more, which retracts, appoints
Business can be sent to the computing device of vehicle in association with task requests.Rollback task is times performed under given conditions
Business, typically such as autonomous vehicle can not normal operating when contingency condition.Then the passenger that receives it is related or non-multiply
The task of visitor can be stored in by task supervision module in the queue in one or more of vehicle computing device, and is connect
The rollback task of receipts can be stored separately in memory by rollback selector module.
For example, it can send from user calculating equipment to system on base location or appoint when that can not perform other and retract
The back-off information for the position that vehicle is gone to during business.Then the information can be forwarded to vehicle.Or the server in system can
Inputted with determining and being sent to vehicle the information of rollback task without receiving any user.For example, server can determine to degenerate
Sensor need repairing, and be also based on current location and the map datum of vehicle to determine that sensor can be repaired
Nearest maintenance station.
Back-off instruction can include some information of the property depending on rollback task.For example, for be related to be driven to it is all
As charging station or repair garage certain type of position task, can in back-off instruction specified location or region.Such as
The information of the destination locations of driving task can determine by the computing device of vehicle, or is hard coded within the calculating of vehicle and sets
It is standby upper.In some instances, there can be the multiple positions being hard-coded into vehicle, and the computing device of vehicle can examined
Determine to go to which in the multiple position after worry adjacency, the service provided, load level and other Considerations
Individual position.In addition, the task for requiring the action in addition to driving and parking, such as interacted with external system, instruction is also
The details specific to action can be included, be such as used for the authentication information of fuel loading system or maintenance station.
Back-off instruction can also include one or more triggers.Trigger can include indicating that vehicle should when being satisfied
One or more conditions of the execution rollback task.Condition can include, for example, the fuel of vehicle or energy level meet to make a reservation for
Between the server of threshold value, the computing device of vehicle and fleet management's equipment connection lose, the task queue of vehicle be it is empty,
And the periodic maintenance in special time is scheduled.
In order to determine when the condition of certain triggers or multiple conditions are satisfied, vehicle can be periodically from control loop
Ground and/or continuously the computing device transmission state renewal to vehicle.As an example, state renewal can include such as from car
Instrument or the information of the fuel level of sensor or other internal or external measurement results.As shown in figure 5, the calculating of vehicle
Equipment can more be newly arrived with use state and determine that one or more conditions of relevant trigger are satisfied.For example, fuel indicator can
Continuously to monitor the fuel level in tank (tank).The task supervision module of the computing device of vehicle can the combustion based on vehicle
Material economy, the density of gas station in area and representing reach near the fuel quantity that may need of gas station other because
The threshold level of fuel quantity is usually set.Then, the task supervision module of the computing device of vehicle can monitor fuel level simultaneously
Determine when it reaches threshold value.
After the condition of certain triggers or multiple conditions is met, rollback task, and the calculating of vehicle can be triggered
The rollback selector module of equipment can send the instruction for performing any rollback task or the task corresponding with certain triggers,
As shown in Figure 5.For example, when fuel level reaches the threshold value such as trigger definition, then rollback selector module can be sent
Perform the instruction for the rollback task for being driven to nearest gas station.This can include current location based on vehicle and to the oiling
Stand or the minimal path of charging station determines the position of nearest gas station or charging station.
In some cases, when rollback task is triggered, autonomous vehicle may be carrying out another task.With regard to this point
For, the back-off instruction of the specific rollback task being triggered can include being used for from another Task Switching is performed to holding
The extra-instruction of the specific rollback task of row.Extra-instruction, which can also include specific rollback task, to be immediately performed, complete
Into perform after another described task or some other the specifying of the task in queue after the instruction that performs.This refers to
Show can be based on trigger emergency or specific rollback task importance.To the emergency rank or rollback task of trigger
Priority rank specify can be included in instruction.Rank can be designated as it is high, in or it is low.
In some instances, when vehicle is currently executing passenger's inter-related task, can be performed after stroke is completed
Rollback task.As shown in fig. 6, after putting down passenger therefore completing the related task of passenger, vehicle may be in queue
Other tasks, and do not carry out the further instruction of self scheduling system.In this case, vehicle can be performed and nearby stopped
The rollback task of car, until receiving further instruction.Under another situation shown in Fig. 7, passenger's correlation can performed
Task while triggering refuel rollback task, but still can be performed after the related task of passenger is completed.At this
In the case of kind, the computing device of vehicle may have determined that enough fuel arrives at, and then go to nearest oiling
Stand.However, if trigger action is urgent, the rollback selector module of the computing device of vehicle can be sent to be terminated in advance
The instruction of stroke, this may include that unloading passenger may not also be included, and continue executing with rollback task.These situations can relate to
And the problem of vehicle can be prevented to complete the vehicle of stroke.If passenger has got off, another autonomous vehicle can be sent
Carry them and complete remaining stroke.
If rollback task due to for perform rollback task back-off instruction format error or any other reason and
It can not be performed and not substituted by another rollback task also, then when the instruction with error format or the defects of other modes
Rollback task when being triggered, rollback selector module can send the instruction that autonomous vehicle is manipulated to base location, such as Fig. 8 institutes
Show.Or when being also not received by other back-off instructions, vehicle can be driven to base location.The address or position of base location
Putting coordinate can be hard-coded into vehicle.In some instances, the address of multiple base locations or position coordinates can be compiled firmly
Code, so as to allow when the rollback selector module of the computing device of vehicle is triggered to according to rollback task to select and manipulate car
To nearest or most convenient base location.In one example, if not setting base location for vehicle, vehicle will not
Start, so as to ensure no matter when in vehicle operation, vehicle has as the position gone to that can finally go part, so as to reduce
The risk that autonomous vehicle gets into a difficult position.
If due to some externally and/or internally factors, autonomous vehicle can not reach the position specified in back-off instruction
Or base location, then the rollback selector module of the computing device of vehicle can then by vehicle pulling over observing and to scheduling system hair
Send message.The message can include the position of vehicle and/or the externally and/or internally list of factor.
In some cases, condition may change so that the trigger for the current rollback task that vehicle is currently executing
Condition or multiple conditions be no longer satisfied.Rollback selector module may determine whether that this thing happens.When condition or more
When individual condition is no longer satisfied, vehicle can continue executing with current rollback task or return according to the extra-instruction of rollback task
Regularly scheduling for task in receipt row task queue.Returning to the task that execution regularly schedules can mean that execution may be worked as

Calculate equipment 110 and then instruction can be sent to vehicle from control loop 160-172 to be driven to gas station 638.
The rollback task of trigger with high emergency rank can be immediately performed, so as to interrupt any passenger it is related or
The task of non-passenger.For example, when the emergency rank of trigger is high, the rollback selector mould of the computing device 110 of vehicle
Block 137 can send instruction to terminate stroke in advance and continue executing with rollback task.Trigger with high emergency rank can
With including when the presence of vehicle 100 can prevent vehicle 100 complete stroke the problem of when.For example, based on detecting what is blown out
The trigger of condition is by with high emergency rank, because vehicle 100 may not drive far when blowing out.This can be with
Therefore triggering is driven to the rollback task in nearest maintenance garage.
In the event that rollback task is triggered but can not be performed, rollback selector module 137 can send instruction
So that autonomous vehicle 100 is manipulated into base location, as shown in Figure 8.The reason for rollback task can not be performed, is probably, for performing back
The vehicle for moving back the type that the back-off instruction form of task is incorrect, can not be sent to back-off instruction performs back-off instruction, or
Some other reasons.Alternatively, when not other back-off instructions are received and queue is empty, vehicle 100
Base location can be driven to.
Fig. 8 is gone to, task requests, back-off instruction, task requests can be sent and received as described in Figure 5 before
Instruction and state renewal.However, after step 550, when the computing device 110 of vehicle detects trigger condition, vehicle
Computing device 110 can determine that back-off instruction form is incorrect in step 860, or for some reason can not be by vehicle 100
Perform.Then the computing device 110 of vehicle can send an instruction to vehicle in step 870 and be driven from control loop 160-172
The base location specified is sailed to, and does not perform rollback task as before.
The address of base location or position coordinates can be hard-coded into vehicle.In some instances, can be to multiple bases
The address of position or position coordinates carry out hard coded, so as to allow the rollback selector module 137 of the computing device 110 of vehicle
