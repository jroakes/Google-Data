Definitions
- a diversity antenna system of a mobile device receives signals transmitted from a base station. Such signals may be affected by multipath effects and interference, resulting in signal degradation and reduced efficiency.
- Known techniques for improving signal reception through diversity antenna systems involve using multiple receiver coupled to multiple antennas. The signals are digitally combined to improve the reliability of communication systems. These techniques, however, require duplication of Radio Frequency (RF) chains and baseband processing that result in an increase of required space, required power consumption, and unit cost. These increases may be challenging for mobile device optimization because mobile device optimization generally requires smaller space, lower power consumption, and lower cost. Consequently, known techniques for combining signals are unsatisfactory in certain situations.

The following is repeated for each group of signals of the plurality of groups of signals. An adjustment associated with a time slot of each signal is set. Each signal of the group of signals is adjusted at the time slot in accordance with the adjustment associated with the time slot. A signal quality associated with each time slot of each signal of the group of signals is established, and an optimal adjustment in accordance with the signal qualities is determined. The signals are adjusted in accordance with the optimal adjustment.

- the common group character set at step 406 includes signal adjustment information for the group being processed.
- a common group character A i includes phase and amplitude information common to the group of incoming signals.
- Each signal of each group of incoming signals may be associated with time slots.
- a group i of incoming signals may be processed according to any suitable number of time slots N.
- Each time slot N may be of any duration suitable for processing the incoming signals.
- a time slot N may be set to substantially the same duration as a power control group of the communication protocol of system 10 .
- a time slot N may have a duration in the range of a symbol to frame duration of a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) power control group, such as approximately 1.25 milliseconds. Since this method operates in the time domain, incoming signals may be grouped sequentially into groups with the same number of pre-determined time slots N as the previous group.
- CDMA Code Division Multiple Access
- step 408 signal adjustment for each time slot of each signal within current group is determined, and to step 410 where the signal adjustment for current time slot is applied.
- Signal adjustment module 287 determines a signal adjustment for each time slot N.
- the signal adjustment may comprise a common group character and a time slot character.
- each time slot has a time slot character B i,N that describes signal information for the signals of group i at time slot N.
- time slot character B 1,1 describes signal information for incoming signals of group 1 at time slot 1
- time slot character B 1,2 describes signal information for incoming signals of group 1 at time slot 2 .
- the signal information described by time slot character B i,N may include phase and amplitude information for the time slot being processed.
- the group character A i combined with the time slot character B i,N may be used to adjust incoming signals of particular time slots.
- a i +B i,N is used to adjust a signal of group i at time slot N.
- Time slot characters B i,N may be selected such that different adjustments are performed at each time slot.
- two time slot characters B 1,1 and B 1,2 are determined for one group of signals associated with group character A 1 .
- the incoming signals are adjusted at a time slot at step 410 , according to the adjustment determined at steps 406 and step 408 .
- the method proceeds to step 412 , where a signal quality associated with each time slot is determined.
- the signal quality may comprise a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
- SNR signal-to-noise ratio
- adjustment A 1 +B 1,1 at time slot 1 may yield a signal quality SNR 1,1
- adjustment A 1 +B 1,2 at time slot 2 may yield signal quality SNR 1,2 .
- step 414 signal adjustment module 287 determines if there is a next time slot within the current group at step 414 .
- signal adjustment module 287 determines if there is a next time slot within the current group at step 414 .
- two time slots are used, and the method determines if time slot 2 of the current group is yet to be adjusted. If there is a next time slot to be processed, the method proceeds to step 410 to adjust the signals at the next time slot according to the signal adjustments determined at step 408 .
- step 416 signal adjustment module 287 determines an optimal adjustment.
- the optimal adjustment may be determined for each group according to the signal qualities determined at step 412 . For example, SNR 1,1 and SNR 1,2 may be compared to determine which signal adjustment is better.
- An optimal adjustment may be determined using any iteration process, recursion formula, or any other processing method suitable for determining an optimal adjustment.
- the term “optimal” as used in this document may not necessarily describe the best possible outcome.
- an “optimal adjustment” may be any relative adjustment that may result in an improved signal quality. In some cases, however, the optimal adjustment may not result in an improved signal quality.
- a next group character A i+1 is updated to the optimal adjustment A i +B i,N .
- next group character A 2 may be updated to the optimal adjustment A 1 +B 1,2 .
- a time domain filter may be used when determining the next group character A i .
- step 420 If there is a next group at step 420 , the method proceeds to step 406 to set a group character for the next group.
- the adjustment may be represented by A 2 +B 2,1
- Other methods for determining an adjustment are described with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6 . If there are no next groups at step 420 , the receipt of signals is ended. After ending receipt, the method terminates.
- the method illustrated at FIG. 4 processes incoming signals as groups of signals, where each group is associated with any number of time slots N.
- the incoming signals are adjusted by setting a group character A i and an individual character B i,N for each time slot.
- the quality of the adjusted incoming signals is compared to find an optimal adjustment, which is used to adjust subsequent signals.
- Steps may be added, omitted, modified, or performed in any suitable order without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, determining adjustment for time slots at step 408 may be modified to be performed iteratively for each time slot. As another example, determining whether there are next time slots to be processed at step 414 may be omitted. As yet another example, determining optimal adjustment at step 416 may be performed substantially simultaneously with updating group character at step 418 .
- FIG. 5 illustrates a method for adjusting signals according to phase rotation.
- the method begins at step 500 , where a phase offset between time slots for a group of signals is determined.
- the phase offset may be represented by the time slot character.
- a phase offset may be determined from field simulation where the phase offset may be in a range from one degree to 90 degrees.
- the determination of a phase offset depends on the speed of the mobile. Typically, the higher the speed of mobile device 20 the larger the phase offset, and the lower the speed of the mobile device 20 the smaller the phase offset. For example, 3 degrees may be used for a mobile being displaced at 5 km per hour and 24 degrees may be used for a mobile being displaced at 20 km per hour.
- step 510 signal quality information associated with each time slot is determined.
- signal adjustment module 287 may determine a signal quality for each time slot.
- Signal adjustment module 287 determines which direction to change the group phase determined at step 500 so that the signal quality is improved. According to one embodiment, the determination may be made by comparing which time slot phase causes a better metric M(n).
- the metric M(n) may describe the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimated by signal quality estimator 283 .
- SNR signal-to-noise ratio
- step 520 the signal adjustment module 287 updates group phase rotation.
- signal adjustment module 287 determines the group phase for the next group of signals. If the normalized difference ⁇ is less than a field variable ⁇ , the group phase remains unchanged.
- the field variable ⁇ is a predefined positive number determined by field tests. For example, the field variable may be any value within the range of 0.01 to 0.3. If the normalized difference ⁇ is greater than the field variable ⁇ , the group phase is updated.
- the step size may be any value withing the range of 3 to 90 degrees.
- step 530 a determination is made of whether there is a next group to process. If there is a next group, the method returns to step 510 , where the updated group rotation 520 is applied to the next time slots for determining the signal quality for each time slot. If there is no next group to process, the method ends phase rotation.
- the method of FIG. 5 performs a phase search for an optimal group phase that results in better signal quality. Steps may be added, omitted, modified, or performed in any suitable order without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, a step of applying the phase rotation to each time slot may be added between steps 500 and 510 . As another example, determining signal quality for each time slot at step 510 may be performed substantially simultaneously with updating group phase rotation.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an embodiment of a method for adjusting a signal according to a power ratio. This method may be performed in conjunction with the method described with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the method described with reference to FIG. 6 may be performed after group phase is determined to have reached an optimal result.
- the term “optimal result” might not necessarily be the best result possible.
- an “optimal result” may be any result corresponding to an improved signal quality for a group of signals. In some cases, however, the optimal result may not correspond to an improved signal quality.
- the method begins at step 600 , where a determination is made of whether the phase rotation is close to yielding an optimal result.
- a phase rotation may be considered to be close to yielding an optimal result when the normalized difference ⁇ from Equation 11 is less than a pre-defined positive number ⁇ 1 , where the pre-defined positive number ⁇ 1 may be any value within the range of 0.01 to 0.2, for example, 0.1.
- the method proceeds to step 610 to continue a phase search.
- the phase search at step 610 is performed as described with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the method proceeds to step 620 for determining a group power ratio.
- the group power ratio may be defined as the relative ratio between the group signal power and the power of the incoming signals.
- the method proceeds to step 630 for determining a time slot power ratio.
- the signal adjustment module 287 determines the relative power ratio for the signal of each time slot.
- signal quality information associated with each time slot is determined.
- signal adjustment module 287 receives signal quality information for each time slot from signal quality estimator 283 .
- Signal adjustment module 287 may determine which time slot power ratio results in a better signal quality.
- step 650 the signal adjustment module 287 updates the group power ratio.
- signal adjustment module 287 determines the group power ratio for the next group of signals. According to one embodiment, if the normalized differences ⁇ as described by Equation 11 is less than the field variable ⁇ , the group power ratio remains unchanged. If normalized difference ⁇ is greater than the field variable ⁇ , the group power ratio is updated to the combination of relative group power ratio and relative time slot power ratio that yields the better signal quality.
- step 660 a determination is made of whether there is a next group to process. If there is a next group, the method returns to step 620 for determining the group power ratio and applying the group power ratio updated at step 650 . If there is no next group, the method ends.
- Steps may be added, omitted, modified, or performed in any suitable order without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, determining if a phase rotation reaches optimal result at step 600 may be modified to determine if the time slot phase reaches an optimal result. As another example, determining group power ratio at step 620 may be performed substantially simultaneously with determining time slot power ratio at step 630 .
- Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages.
- a technical advantage of one embodiment may be that by adjusting the incoming signals in response to signal quality estimates, the signal reception may be improved. The adjustment may be performed by analog or digital signal processing.
- Another technical advantage of one embodiment may be that adjusting and combining incoming signals reduces the number of signals to be processed, resulting in a reduction of signal processing resources while maintaining diversity gain.
