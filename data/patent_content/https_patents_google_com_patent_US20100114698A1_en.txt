Description
- This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/110,203, titled “Advertising Meta-Keywords,” filed Oct. 31, 2008, which is incorporated here by reference.]
- The subject matter of this specification relates to advertising.
- Online advertisers use keywords to target their advertisements. An advertiser can associate an advertisement with one or more keywords. When any of the associated keywords appear in a search query or in a webpage, for example, the advertisement may be presented. An advertiser can associate an advertisement with multiple words that are variants of each other or have similar meanings. For example, an advertisement for posters can be associated with multiple words like “photo,” “photos,” “poster,” “posters,” “print,” and “prints,” etc. If the advertiser wishes to mention individual celebrities in the advertisements for posters, the advertiser can create an advertisement for each celebrity the advertiser wishes to mention, where each created advertisement is associated with the multiple words.
- This specification describes technologies relating to generating advertisements from advertising templates. An advertising template includes one or more meta-keywords, and each meta-keyword is associated with a list of keywords. An advertisement is generated by using one of the keywords in the list of keywords for one of the meta-keywords in place of the meta-keyword in the advertising template.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method that include the actions of receiving a first meta-keyword and a first list of one or more keywords, the first list associated with the first meta-keyword; receiving a first advertisement template, the first advertisement template including the first meta-keyword; and generating, for at least one keyword in the first list, an advertisement based on the first advertisement template, the generated advertisement including the respective keyword in the first list. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer-readable mediums, each configured to perform the operations of the method.
- These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The method can further include removing a keyword from the first list, and in response to the removing of the keyword from the first list, removing a respective generated advertisement that includes the removed keyword. Receiving the first list of keywords can include receiving the first list from a content feed. The method can further include receiving a search query, the search query including a keyword in the first list, and presenting a generated advertisement that includes the keyword included in the search query.
- The method can further include receiving a bid associated with the first meta-keyword, and associating the bid with each of the generated advertisements. The method can further include receiving a bid associated with a keyword in the first list, and associating the bid with a generated advertisement that includes the keyword associated with the bid.

FIG. 1 illustrates anexample network environment 100. Thenetwork environment 100 includes auser 102, anadvertiser 104, anadvertising system 106, and acontent system 108. These entities in thenetwork environment 100 can communicate over one ormore networks 110. The one ormore networks 110 can include local area networks, wide area networks, wireless networks, peer-to-peer networks, the Internet, and other networks. - The
advertiser 104 advertises tousers 102 through advertisements. Theadvertiser 104 provides advertisements to theadvertising system 106. Theadvertiser 104 creates the advertisements for an advertising campaign and submits them to theadvertising system 106. Theadvertiser 104 can also access theadvertising system 106 to manage the campaign, including targeting the advertisements to keywords, selecting a payment scheme (e.g., cost-per-click, cost-per-impression, etc.), and bidding for advertisement placements, for example. - An
advertising system 106 distributes advertisements. Theadvertising system 106 receives advertisements created by theadvertiser 104. In some implementations, theadvertising system 106 also includes a user interface where anadvertiser 104 can create an advertisement. Anadvertiser 104 who submitted advertisements to theadvertising system 106 can also manage, through theadvertising system 106, advertising campaigns related the submitted advertisements. - A
content system 108 providesusers 102 with access to content. Thecontent system 108 receives requests for content fromusers 102. Thecontent system 108 identifies the content matching the requests, and serves the content to theusers 102 or directsusers 102 to the content. In some implementations, thecontent system 108 is a search engine that indexes content from other content systems. The search engine receives search queries. The search engine identifies content that matches the search queries and sends search results corresponding to the matching content to the user. The search results can include hyperlinks to the matching content. In some other implementations, thecontent system 108 is a content host who hosts the content. The content host can serve the content directly to theusers 102. Examples of content that can be provided by thecontent system 108 include webpages, images, video clips, audio clips, text documents, etc. - The
users 102 can access content. Auser 102 can direct requests for content to acontent system 108. For example, in implementations where thecontent system 108 is a search engine, auser 102 can submit a search query, which includes one or more terms (e.g., words, phrases, characters, etc.) to the search engine. The search engine returns to the user search results that include hyperlinks to content that satisfies the search query. As another example, in implementations where thecontent system 108 hosts content, a user can submit to the content system 108 a path of the location (e.g., in a Universal Resource Locator URL)) of the desired content within thecontent system 108. Thecontent system 108 retrieves the content from the submitted path and serves the content to the user. - The
user 102 can be presented advertisements from theadvertiser 104. The advertisements can be sent by theadvertising system 106 and accompany content sent to the user by thecontent system 108. In some implementations, the content of the advertisements sent by theadvertising system 106 are related to the search query submitted by the user or the content requested by the user. - The
user 102 can submit content requests and receive content through a device. Examples of devices include desktop computers, notebook computers, tablet computers, personal digital assistants (PDA's), mobile phones, smart phones, media players, and other types of devices. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an exampleadvertisement distribution system 200. Theadvertising system 200 includes anadvertising server 202, acontent server 212, asearch engine 216, and adevice 222. These components can be connected by one ormore networks 226. The one ormore networks 220 can include local area networks, wide area networks, wireless networks, peer-to-peer networks, the Internet, and other networks. In some implementations, theadvertising server 202 is a part of anadvertising system 106, and thesearch engine 216 and/or thecontent server 212 are a part of acontent system 108. - In some implementations, the
search engine 216 includes acontent search module 218 andcontent index 220. Thecontent search module 218 crawls for content and indexes the crawled content incontent index 220. Thecontent search module 218 also receives search queries fromdevice 222, identifies from thecontent index 220 content that satisfies the query, and sends corresponding search results to thedevice 222. - The
content server 212 includescontent 214. Thecontent server 212 receives a request for content from thedevice 222. Thecontent server 212 transmitscontent 214 that matches the request to thedevice 222. - The
advertising server 202 includes anad placement module 204, anad management module 206, akeyword module 208, andadvertising data 210. Thead placement module 204 places advertisements withcontent 214 provided by thecontent provider 212 and/or search results provided by thesearch engine 216. Thead management module 206 manages advertising campaigns, including managing auctions for advertisement placements, tracking advertisement performance, and so forth. Theadvertising data 210 stores data related to advertising, including advertisements, advertising campaign settings, bid values for advertisement placements, etc. - The
advertising server 202 also includes akeyword module 208. Thekeyword module 208 manages keywords that can be associated with advertisements. For example, a keyword can be associated with one or more advertisements, so that whenever the keyword is included in a search query submitted by a user the advertisement is transmitted to adevice 222 for presentation to the user. - The
keyword module 208 can also manage meta-keywords and associated keyword lists. A meta-keyword is a term (e.g., a word) that represents a list of one or more keywords. The meta-keyword can be, like a keyword, associated with one or more advertisements. In some implementations, associating the meta-keyword with an advertisement automatically associates the keywords in the associated keyword list with the advertisement; whenever a keyword in the list is included in a search query, the advertisement is shown. Additionally, advertisements, each of which include one of the keywords in the keyword list, can be generated based on an advertisement template that includes the meta-keyword. Further details regarding meta-keywords and keyword lists are described below. - A
device 222 can be in data communication with theadvertising server 202,content server 212, or asearch engine 216 through one ormore networks 226. In some implementations, thedevice 222 is configured to interact with theadvertising server 202,content server 212, or asearch engine 216 through aclient application 224, such as a web browser. For example, anadvertiser 104 can access a user interface of theadvertising server 202 through theclient application 224. Within the user interface of the search engine, theadvertiser 104 can create and manage advertising campaigns, create and manage advertisements, associate advertisements with keywords, bid for advertisement placements, and so forth. As another example, auser 102 can access a user interface of thesearch engine 216 through theclient application 224. Within the user interface of the search engine, theuser 102 can submit queries and view search results, content corresponding to the search results, and advertisements. -
FIG. 3 illustrates aprocess 300 for generating advertisements using meta-keywords. For convenience, theprocess 300 will be described in reference to a system (e.g., advertisement distribution system 200), that performs theprocess 300. - The
advertising server 202 receives a meta-keyword and a list of keywords associated with the meta-keyword (302). In some implementations, theadvertising server 202 receives a meta-keyword and a list of one or more keywords from anadvertiser 104. The meta-keyword represents the list and serves as a name of the list. For example, a keyword list can be named “cities” and include as keywords names of various cities. The name “cities” is the meta-keyword associated with the list. - The
advertising server 202 receives an advertisement template from the advertiser (304). The advertisement template defines the content and appearance of an advertisement. Advertisements having the defined content and appearance can be generated from the advertisement template, further details of which are described below. - The advertisement template includes the meta-keyword. For example, a template for a text advertisement, the textual content in the template includes the meta-keyword, which may be set off by predefined symbols to differentiate the meta-keyword from normal text.
- The
advertising server 202 generates an advertisement for each keyword in the list of keywords (306). In each generated advertisement, the meta-keyword can be replaced by a keyword from the list. Thus, for example, if an advertisement template reads “{Outerwear} at low prices!” with meta-keyword “outerwear,” and the list of keywords are {jackets, pants, hats, boots}, then four advertisements are generated and the four generated advertisements read as follows: “Jackets at low prices!”, “Pants at low prices!”, “Hats at low prices!”, and “Boots at low prices!”. In some implementations, the set of generated advertisements are grouped into one ad group that targets the set of keywords in the list. - In some implementations, the advertisement template can include multiple instances of the same meta-keyword. For example, an advertisement template can read “Great {Outerwear} ! The best {outerwear} at the best prices!”. An advertisement generated from this template can have a keyword from the list replacing each instance of the meta-keyword. For example, an advertisement with the keyword “jackets” can read “Great Jackets! The best jackets at the best prices!”.
- In some implementations, an advertisement template can include two or more meta-keywords. An advertisement template can include, for example, one or more instances of a first meta-keyword and one or more instances of a second meta-keyword. For example, an advertisement template can read “The best {outerwear} in {cities}.”, where the meta-keywords are “outerwear” and “cities,” and each of these meta-keywords are associated with respective lists of keywords. An advertisement can be generated using the advertisement template for each pairing of a keyword from the “outerwear” keyword list and a keyword from the “cities” keyword list. For example, if the “outerwear” keywords list include {jackets, pants, hats, boots} and the “cities” keyword list include {New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago}, then the generated advertisements can read “The best jackets in Boston,” “The best jackets in Chicago,” “The best pants in Boston,” “The best pants in San Francisco,” and so on. Furthermore, in some implementations, ad groups can be identified based on one of the meta-keywords included in the advertisement template. For example, advertisements can be grouped using the meta-keyword “cities.” That is, advertisements that pairs the keyword “Boston” with each respective one of the keywords in the “outerwear” keyword list are grouped into an ad group, advertisements that pairs the keyword “Chicago” with each respective one of the keywords in the “outerwear” keyword list are grouped into another ad group, and so forth.
-
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating anexample process 400 for presenting advertisements. For convenience, theprocess 400 will be described in reference to a system (e.g., advertisement distribution system 200), that performs theprocess 400. -
Advertising server 202 receives a meta-keyword and a list of keywords associated with the meta-keyword (402). In some implementations, theadvertising server 202 receives a meta-keyword and a list of one or more keyword from anadvertiser 104. The meta-keyword represents the list and serves as a name of the list. For example, a keyword list can be named “cities” and include as keywords names of various cities. The name “cities” is the meta-keyword associated with the list. -
Advertising server 202 receives an association of the meta-keyword with an advertisement template (404). In some implementations, the association is created by the insertion of the meta-keyword into the content of advertisement template. The insertion can be made by theadvertiser 104. For example, theadvertiser 104 can create an advertisement template that includes the meta-keyword in the text of the advertisement template. Advertisements generated from the advertisement template are also associated with the meta-keyword. -
Search engine 216 receives a search query, where the query includes a term that matches a keyword in the keyword list (406). The query can be submitted by a user through a user interface of the search engine, accessed from theclient application 224 at thedevice 222, for example. - The
content search module 218 of thesearch engine 216 identifies content (e.g., web pages, images, etc.) incontent index 220 that satisfies the search query. Thecontent search module 218 generates a search results page that can, for example, include hyperlinks to the content that satisfy the query. Thecontent search module 218 can include advertisements associated with or related to the search query. Thecontent search module 218 provides the search query toadvertising server 202. Thead placement module 204 identifies advertisement templates having a meta-keyword whose keyword list include the search query term. For example, thead placement module 204 identifies the advertisements generated from the advertisement template that includes the meta-keyword, whose keyword list includes a term that matches a search query term. Thead placement module 204 provides an advertisement generated from the identified advertisement, with the meta-keyword in the advertisement replaced by the matching keyword from the keyword list, to thecontent search module 218 for placement in the search results page. - The
content search module 218 receives the advertisement from theadvertising server 202. Thecontent search module 218 places the advertisement into the search results page and transmits the search results page to thedevice 222. The search results page, including the advertisement, is presented at thedevice 222 in response to the search query (408). - In some implementations, an advertisement template can include multiple meta-keywords, each associated with a respective keyword list. An advertisement generated from this advertisement template can be selected for presentation in response to a search query if the query includes matching terms for each of the multiple meta-keywords in the advertisement template.
- In some implementations, if the advertisement template includes multiple meta-keywords and the search query does not include matching terms for each of the meta-keywords, advertisements generated from the advertisement template are not selected for presentation in response to the search query.
- More generally, the input terms based on which advertisements are generated from the advertisement can come from any suitable source.
FIG. 4 describes an implementation where the source of the input terms is a search query. Other examples of sources of input terms include electronic messages (e.g., email, instant messages) that have been processed to identify the relevant terms in the messages, web pages, etc. Thus, for example, theadvertising server 202 can receive the relevant terms of an email message, some or all of which match one or more keywords associated with the meta-keyword, and theserver 202 can generate an advertisement from the advertisement template based the matching terms. -
FIGS. 5A-5H illustrate example user interfaces for creating and managing meta-keywords and ad groups that use meta-keywords. In some implementations, the illustrated user interfaces are implemented in webpages served from theadvertising server 202. -
FIG. 5A illustrates an example user interface page 500 for managing ad campaigns. The page 500 includes alink 502 to a page for managing meta-keywords and keyword lists. -
FIG. 5B illustrates an example keyword lists page 504. The keyword lists page 504 shows meta-keywords 506 (which can also serve as the names of keyword lists) and the respective keyword lists 508 associated with the meta-keywords 506. -
FIG. 5C illustrates an example user interface 510 for creating or editing a meta-keyword and a corresponding keyword list. The advertiser can enter (or edit) a meta-keyword 512 and thekeywords 514 in the keyword list to be associated with the meta-keyword 512. For example, inFIG. 5C , the entered meta-keyword is “cities,” and the keywords in the keyword list for “cities” include “new york,” “san francisco,” “chicago,” etc. -
FIG. 5D illustrates anexample page 530 for creating or editing an advertisement template (“ad template”). Thepage 530 includes one or more text fields 534 where the advertiser can create or edit an ad template. An ad template can include one or more lines of text, including one or more lines of Universal Resource Locators (URLs). The ad template can include one or more meta-keywords in the URL and/or the non-URL text. Apreview 536 of an advertisement generated according to the template can be presented. Thepreview 536 shows an example advertisement generated according to the template, with each meta-keyword replaced by a keyword from its respective keyword lists. - As shown in
FIG. 5D , the ad template text entered into the text fields 534 includes the meta-keywords {outerwear} and {cities}. The URL also can include meta-keywords. In theadvertisement preview 536, instances of the meta-keyword {outerwear} is replaced by “jacket” and instances of the meta-keyword {cities} is replaced by “new york.” Instances of the {outerwear} and {cities} in the URL are also replaced with “jacket” and “new york,” respectively. If the advertiser enters into the template a meta-keyword that does not exist yet in the advertiser's account, the meta-keyword editing interface 510 can be shown to the advertiser, and the advertiser can enter the keywords for the new meta-keyword. - In the example user interface page shown in
FIG. 5E , the advertiser can confirm the advertisement template and proceed to creating an advertisement campaign with the advertisement template. -
FIG. 5F illustrates anexample page 550 for viewing advertisement statistics (e.g., status, bid, clicks, impressions, conversion rate, etc.). Inpage 550,statistics 552 for advertisements associated with the meta-keyword “outerwear” is shown. The shown statistics include statistics for advertisements generated using the meta-keyword combinations “{cities} {outerwear},” “{outerwear} in {cities},” and “{outerwear},” where {cities} and {outerwear} are meta-keywords. In some implementations, a meta-keyword combination can include multiple ad groups. For example, the “{cities} {outerwear}” combination includes multiple ad groups (e.g., an ad group for each keyword in the keyword list associated with {cities}). -
FIG. 5G illustrates another example interface for creating or editing meta-keywords and keyword lists.Page 516 includes one or more fields for entering or editing one or more meta-keywords and for entering or editing keywords for the meta-keywords. The advertiser can enter meta-keywords - In some implementations, the advertiser can select a meta-keyword from multiple meta-keywords and one or more ad groups can be generated from the selected meta-keyword. For example, in
page 516, the advertiser can select the meta-keyword “cities” or “outerwear,” and ad groups can be generated from each of the keywords associated with the selected meta-keyword. The advertiser can make the selection using a pull-down menu 526, for example. An ad group is generated for each keyword in the keyword list associated with the selected meta-keyword. Each ad group can have its own advertisement template and/or include additional meta-keywords.FIG. 5H shows an example of ad groups generated from keywords associated with a “cities” meta-keyword, each of which also includes a second meta-keyword “outerwear.” - In some implementations, meta-keywords can be nested. For example, a “Cities” meta keyword can include the keywords {New York, Los Angeles, Chicago}. The keyword “New York” can itself be meta-keyword associated with the keywords {New York, N.Y. City, NYC}. As illustrated in this example, nested meta-keywords can be used to indicate, among other things, synonyms or alternate names.
- In some implementations, meta-keywords and keyword lists can be created by an entity other than the
advertiser 104 and stored at theadvertising server 202. Anadvertiser 104 creating an advertisement template can insert a meta-keyword created by another entity into an advertisement template, effectively subscribing to the meta-keyword and the keyword list created by the another entity. The keyword list can be modified by the another entity as well. For example, a franchiser can create and maintain meta-keywords and associated keyword lists, which franchisees can use for their local advertisements. - In some implementations, a keyword list for a meta-keyword can include a default keyword. In an advertisement generated from an advertisement template with the meta-keyword, the meta-keyword can be replaced with the default keyword if replacing the meta-keyword with another keyword in the keyword list would cause the advertisement text to exceed a length limit, for example.
- In some implementations, when the advertisement template includes multiple meta-keywords, the
advertiser 104 can set an exclusion parameter or filter to exclude advertisements with particular keyword combinations. For example, if an advertisement template includes the meta-keywords {brand}=(Apple, Toshiba, Dell) and {device}=(laptop, handheld), an exclusion parameter or filter can be set so that advertisements with the particular keyword combination “Toshiba” and “handheld” is not generated. -
FIG. 6 illustrates ageneric computer system 600. Thesystem 600 can be used for practicing operations described above. Thesystem 600 can include aprocessor 610,memory 620, astorage device 630, and input/output devices 640. Each of thecomponents system bus 650. Theprocessor 610 is capable of processing instructions for execution within thesystem 600. Such executed instructions can implement one or more components ofsearch engine 216,advertising server 202,content server 212, ordevice 222, for example.

The term “data processing apparatus” encompasses all apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus can include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them.
- A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
- Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Computer-readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- To provide for interaction with a user, the disclosed embodiments can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- The disclosed embodiments can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of what is disclosed here, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), e.g., the Internet.
- The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- While this specification contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of what being claims or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular embodiments. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understand as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- Thus, particular embodiments have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.
