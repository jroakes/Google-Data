Definitions
- Embodiments of the present invention relate to data processing, and more specifically, to image processing.
- a digital image is generally a representation of a real image (e.g., a photograph) in a format which may be processed by a computer system.
- a digital image generally comprises a plurality of picture elements (e.g., pixels) arranged in a two-dimensional array. Each pixel may have a color and/or a color value associated with the pixel. Information associated with the location and color of each pixel may be stored and/or used by a computer system to display the digital image.
- Object detection is the task of ascertaining that a set of pixels in an image is associated with a particular object.
- Object recognition is the task of identifying what the object is (e.g., a car, a tree, etc.).
- humans can detect and recognize objects in images with little effort, these tasks are particularly challenging for computer systems.
- current object detection and object recognition techniques still fail to accurately detect and recognize objects in many instances.
- a computing device identifies a perceptual grouping for an image, where the perceptual grouping is based on the contents of the image and partitions the image into a plurality of disjoint groups of pixels.
- the computing device further identifies a geometric-configuration model for the image, wherein the geometric-configuration model comprises a set of bins located at predefined intervals within the image. The computing device then processes the image based on the perceptual grouping and the geometric-configuration model to detect one or more objects in the image.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary system architecture, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of one embodiment of an image-processing subsystem.
- FIG. 3 depicts an illustrative perceptual grouping and an illustrative geometric-configuration model for an image, in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for recognizing one or more objects in an image.
- FIG. 5 depicts a zoomed-in view of illustrative bin 315 - 2 , as shown in FIG. 3D , in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
- FIG. 6 depicts a block diagram of an illustrative computer system operating in accordance with embodiments of the invention.
- a computing device employs both a perceptual grouping of an image and a geometric-configuration model of the image.
- a perceptual grouping partitions the image into a plurality of groups, where each group consists of a proper subset of pixels in the image, and where the partitioning into groups is based on the contents of the image.
- An example of a perceptual grouping is segmentation, where an image is partitioned into a set of regions called segments that consist of pixels with similar features (e.g., color, texture, intensity, etc.).
- Such groupings are called perceptual because the groups of pixels are determined based on how the objects in the image are perceived by the viewer at a particular viewpoint.
- the pixel groups of a perceptual grouping are characterized by the fact that they can be of any size and shape, depending on the pixels of the image.
- contour detection a group is comprised of the pixels along a contour (e.g., an outline of a car, a curve that defines the border between two differently-color regions in an image, etc.).
- a perceptual grouping of contour detection yields groups that are of arbitrary size and shape and depend on the contents of the image.
- a geometric-configuration model for the image which is also employed by the computing device, divides a region into bins, where the bins have a pre-determined size and shape and are independent of the pixel values contained therein.
- a bounding box is a type of geometric-configuration model, as the arrangement of the bins is determined a priori without consideration of the pixel values within the bounding box. For example, a bounding box that is superimposed on a two-dimensional array of orange, pink, and white pixels is divided into fixed bins regardless of which pixels are orange, which pixels are pink, and which pixels are white.
- the geometric-configuration model has the advantage that computations involving the model can be performed using a fixed-size vector in memory.
- the perceptual grouping meanwhile, has the advantage of partitioning the image into regions that more closely correspond to the objects in the image.
- the computing device integrates both the perceptual grouping and the geometric-configuration model by examining the individual pixels in the bins of the geometric-configuration model and assigning to each combination of pixel and group a measure of how strongly the pixel belongs to the group. For example, if a pixel in a bin of a bounding box is in the center of a segment, the membership of the pixel in that segment can intuitively be considered strong. Conversely, if a pixel is not inside a particular segment and is not even close to the border of that segment, the membership of the pixel in that segment can intuitively be considered weak.
- a value is computed for each pair of bins and each group, based on the membership measures of the individual pixels in each of the two bins.
- the resulting value is thus an overall reflection of how strongly the two bins belong to a particular segment, and provides higher-order information for object detection and recognition algorithms than a mapping of individual bins to individual segments or individual segments to individual bins.
- the computed values are an overall reflection of how strongly each pair of bins belongs to a particular segment, and provides higher-order information for object detection and recognition algorithms than a mapping of individual bins to individual segments or individual segments to individual bins.
- embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to images. However, embodiments of the present invention also apply to videos. For example, embodiments of the present invention may perform object detection and object recognition for frames of a video. Alternatively, embodiments of the present invention may combine estimates over multiple frames to perform object detection and recognition.
- a bounding box of an object is a smallest rectangle that bounds an object in an image.
- the bounding box may have sides aligned to the image, or may have sides aligned to a shape of the bounded object.
- a bounding box is one type of geometric configuration model. It should be understood that embodiments of the present invention may also be used to determine other types of geometric configuration models, such as constellations, k-fans, and so forth.
- a segment may be a region that consists of pixels with similar features (e.g., color, texture, intensity, etc.).
- Alternative embodiments may perform other types of perceptual grouping (e.g., contour detection, etc.).

The images may then be classified based on the objects that the images contain.
- image-processing subsystem 132 determines a perceptual grouping for the image (e.g., segmentation of the image, contour detection, etc.) and a geometric-configuration model of the image (e.g., a bounding box, etc.). In one such embodiment, image-processing subsystem 132 segments the image and determines one or more bounding boxes in the image.

- the size and position of illustrative bounding box 310 may be determined in any one of a number of ways, as described above. As shown, illustrative bounding box 310 is divided into four square-shaped bins 315 - 1 through 315 - 4 .
- bounding box 310 is merely illustrative, and bounding boxes can have an arbitrary number of bins. It should also be noted that some other bounding boxes might comprise bins of another shape (e.g., rectangular, etc.) rather than square-shaped bins, or might comprise bins that are not uniformly sized, or both.
- Block 320 depicts the illustrative segmentation of illustrative image 300 in combination with illustrative bounding box 310 , in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
- each of segments 301 - 1 through 301 - 6 overlaps with at least one of bins 315 - 1 through 315 - 4 .

- the image-processing subsystem 132 , object detection/recognition engine 122 , and the object model creator 125 may run on separate machines. It should also be noted that blocks depicted in FIG. 4 can be performed simultaneously or in a different order than that depicted.
- a perceptual grouping for an image is identified.
- block 401 is performed by perceptual grouping subsystem 202 of image-processing subsystem 132 .
- perceptual grouping subsystem 202 might itself be capable of computing a perceptual grouping for an image, while in some other embodiments, perceptual grouping subsystem 202 might identify a perceptual grouping for the image that is computed by another entity (e.g., an executable library of image processing routines [not depicted in FIG. 1 ] hosted by server machine 115 , etc.) and provided to image-processing subsystem 132 .
- the perceptual grouping may result in the creation of multiple disjoint groups of pixels (i.e., groups of pixels with no overlap between any of the groups, so that every pixel belongs to a single group).
- a geometric-configuration model for the image is identified.
- block 402 is performed by geometric-configuration model subsystem 204 of image-processing subsystem 132 .
- geometric-configuration model subsystem 204 might itself be capable of constructing a geometric-configuration model for an image, while in some other embodiments, geometric-configuration model subsystem 204 might identify a geometric-configuration model for the image that is computed by another entity (e.g., an executable library of image processing routines [not depicted in FIG. 1 ] hosted by server machine 115 , etc.) and provided to image-processing subsystem 132 .
- the geometric-configuration model may include a set of bins whose positions and sizes are independent of the pixel values of the image (e.g., a set of bins located at predefined intervals within the image, etc.).
- the image is processed based on both the perceptual grouping identified at block 401 and the geometric-configuration model identified at block 402 .
- a value is computed for every combination of two bins of the geometric-configuration model and group of the perceptual grouping.
- a geometric-configuration model comprises n bins in one or more bounding boxes of an image and a perceptual grouping comprises m groups of pixels (e.g., segments) within the image
- n ⁇ ( n - 1 ) 2 ⁇ m values are computed.
- each of the computed values is based on how strongly pixels in a pair of bins belong to a particular group. In particular, let:
- h ⁇ ( b i , b j , g k ) ⁇ e 1 ⁇ pixels ⁇ ( b 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ e 2 ⁇ pixels ⁇ ( b j ) ⁇ p g k ⁇ ( e 1 ) ⁇ p g k ⁇ ( e 2 ) ( Eq . ⁇ 1 ) where pixels(b i ) denotes the set of pixels in bin b i , and where for any pixel e, p g k (e) is a measure of how strongly pixel e belongs to group g k .
- FIG. 5 depicts a zoomed-in view of illustrative bin 315 - 2 , as well as two illustrative pixels of image 300 located in bin 315 - 2 , labeled 501 - 1 and 501 - 2 , in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
- a bin such as illustrative bin 315 - 2 typically comprises a two-dimensional array of pixels covering the entire bin; however, for simplicity and illustrative purposes, only two such pixels are explicitly depicted in FIG. 5 .
- segment 301 - 1 there are four segments of image 300 that overlap bin 315 - 2 : segment 301 - 1 , segment 301 - 2 , segment 301 - 3 , and segment 301 - 6 .
- segment 301 - 1 the segment 301 - 1 , segment 301 - 2 , segment 301 - 3 , and segment 301 - 6 .
- p 301-6 ( 501 - 1 ) and p 301-1 ( 501 - 1 ) which are measures of how strongly pixel 501 - 1 belongs to segments 301 - 6 and 301 - 1 , respectively.
- Clearly pixel 501 - 1 belongs to segment 301 - 6 much more strongly than it belongs to segment 301 - 1 , and therefore p 301-6 ( 501 - 1 ) should be much larger than p 301-1 ( 501 - 1 ).
- pixel 501 - 1 belongs to segment 301 - 6 more strongly than it belongs to segments 301 - 2 or 301 - 3 , though perhaps by a smaller margin than the difference between membership in segment 301 - 6 and segment 301 - 1 .
- measure p g k (e) might be a real number in [0, 1], as in the example above, while in some other embodiments p g k (e) might have a different range, or might have quantized values, or both (for example, an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive).
- some other embodiments might employ a different methodology for performing block 403 than that of the embodiment above.
- some other embodiments might use a different formula than that of Equation 1 for processing measure p g k (e), or might use a different measure than p g k (e), or might not use any measure at all, or might not use a formula at all.
- some other embodiments might not process bin pairs, but might instead process single bins, or some other combinations of bins (e.g., triads, etc.), while in still some other embodiments the image might be processed based on the perceptual grouping identified at block 401 and the geometric-configuration model identified at block 402 in some completely different manner than that of the embodiment above.
- a maximum over all groups might also be computed for each bin pair, as follows:
- h max ⁇ ( b i , b j ) max 1 ⁇ k ⁇ m ⁇ ⁇ h ⁇ ( b i , b j , g k ) ⁇ ( Eq . ⁇ 3 )
- This measure which reflects the maximum chance that two bins b i and b j see the same grouping, factors out the group index, which can change across images.
- the values for this measure can then be used, in conjunction with the values computed in Equation 1, to build a feature vector for use in the object model creation and object detection/recognition tasks of blocks 404 through 406 , described below. It should be noted that in some other embodiments a variation of Equation 3 might be employed to compute the composite measures for the bin pairs (e.g., computing a weighted mean rather than the maximum, etc.).
- an object model is created based on the processing of the image at block 403 .
- the object model may be created by learning the object model from labeled training data, where the objects of interest in each image in the training data have a manually-selected bounding box. For each such label object, one can extract a representation as described above.
- the measure values computed in Equation 2 could be used to obtain a representation in the same manner as for patch-based object detectors.
- This representation can be used to train any standard classifier, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, etc. to obtain a model. Due to the fixed geometry of the bounding box and its bins, the object model can be stored in memory using a fixed-size vector.

Instructions 626 may further be transmitted or received over a network 620 via the network interface device 622 .
- While the computer-readable storage medium 624 is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium, the term “computer-readable storage medium” should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions.
- the term “computer-readable storage medium” shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention.
- the term “computer-readable storage medium” shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, optical media, and magnetic media.
- Embodiments of the invention also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.
- This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.
- the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description.
- the representation that is derived from a perceptual grouping might be used for the tasks of object detection and recognition, or might be used in systems that derive features from image patches to obtain a new “perceptual patch representation.”
- the concept of groupings can be extended to video, using continuity in time in the same manner as continuity in space.
Abstract
Description
values are computed.
-
- {b1, . . . , bn} denote the set of bins of the geometric-configuration model, where n is an integer greater than 1;
- {g1, . . . , gm} denote the set of groups of the perceptual grouping, where m is an integer greater than 1; and
- {h(bi,bj,gk)|1≦i<j≦n, 1≦k≦m)} denote the set of values for each combination of bin pair and group.
In one such embodiment, each value h(bi,bj,gk) is computed as:
where pixels(bi) denotes the set of pixels in bin bi, and where for any pixel e, pg
p301-6(501-2)=0.7
p301-3(501-2)=0.3
p301-2(501-2)=0.2
p301-1(501-2)=0 (Eq. 2)
