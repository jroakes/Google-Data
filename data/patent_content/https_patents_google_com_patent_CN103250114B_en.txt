Can use two of thermostat units 300 in the common obturator (for example, one family dwelling) it is different
Example provides favourable feature, these examples with based on the management server of cloud in same user account (for example, Fig. 5 C are extremely
Account " tomsmith3@mailhost.com " in Fig. 5 D) it is associated.For current description, it can be assumed that each thermostat
It is " main " thermostat, it is characterised in that this thermostat is connected with HVAC system and is responsible for controlling this HVAC system, this constant temperature
Device can be differently configured from " auxiliary " thermostat, and which has many identical sensings and disposal ability of thermostat 300, simply " aids in "
Thermostat is not connected with HVAC system, but is affected by means of with the direct or indirect communication of one or more main thermostats
The operation of one or more HVAC systems.However, the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to this, therefore in other embodiments, can
There is cooperation in the various combinations of main and/or auxiliary thermostat.
Specific obturator (for example, one family dwelling) can use two main thermostats 300, wherein presence two is different
HVAC system is controlling, for example, the HVAC system downstairs on floor downstairs and the HVAC systems upstairs on upstairs floor
System.When for example making the same user account in thermostat and management server based on cloud by operating screen 552,554,556
When being logically related connection, two thermostats provide the optimal HVAC control aspects to obturator on the whole and close mutually beneficially
Make.This cooperation between two thermostats can be directly equity cooperation, or can be supervision cooperation, wherein central authorities are based on cloud
Management server supervises thermostat as owner, referee, conciliator, arbitrator and/or the messenger for representing two thermostats
In one or more.In an example, there is provided the enhanced ability left automatically, wherein only when two thermostats are felt
When shortage activity is measured up to the required period, just call " leaving " operator scheme.For an embodiment, if had detected that
Inertia reaches the required period, then leave state " ballot " is sent to management server by each thermostat, but will not be entered
Enter " leaving " state so to do until thermostat receives license from management server.Meanwhile, if thermostat detects closing
Habitant's activity in body, then each thermostat will send cancelling for leave state ballot.Only when in each thermostat
When there is current leave state ballot, leave state license is just sent to two thermostats by central management server.Once place
In common leave state, if any one thermostats sense is to habitant's activity, then this thermostat will be cancelled and is sent to
Based on the management server of cloud, leave state is allowed to cancel (or " arrival " order) and is sent to by management server based on cloud again
Two thermostats.In the case of the scope without departing from the teachings of the present invention, the thermostat of common pairing is can be provided in (i.e.,
The thermostat being associated with the same account in management server) in many other types cooperation.
When specific obturator is present in more than one thermostat and those thermostats and the management server based on cloud
Same account it is associated when, the method for optimizing that this group of thermostat is used can cooperate with provide it is following it is enhanced automatically
Leave feature.Each thermostat keeps one group of state information object, leaves automatically preparation (AAR) mark including (i) local, its
It oneself is to leave automatically preparation to reflect whether that this indivedual thermostat is thought；And (ii) one or more equities leave preparation automatically
(AAR) indicate, which reflects whether each another thermostat in this group thinks it oneself is to leave automatically preparation.Each thermostat
Local AAR marks show as the reciprocity AAR marks in this group of state information object of each another thermostat in this group.Allow
Each thermostat changes the local AAR marks of their own, but is only permitted and reads its reciprocity AAR mark.Central authorities are based on cloud
The common function of management server and thermostat is frequently to communicate enough, so that being kept in each thermostat with hot information
This group of state information object, and especially make reciprocity AAR mark keep fresh.This can for example by encoding each thermostat
Realized with any change in passing on its local AAR to indicate to management server immediately, now management server can be immediately
This change is passed on to each another thermostat in this group to update corresponding equity AAR marks.Can be without departing from the present invention
Teaching scope in the case of, using thermostat in direct peer-to-peer communicationss other methods.
According to preferred embodiment, if all AAR marks of this group are arranged to "Yes" or " preparation ", then thermostat
Each thermostat is operable so that with consistent pattern will only enter reality " leave " state.Therefore, in any particular point in time, this
All thermostats in group will be in " leaving " state, or all thermostats are not located in " leaving " state.Further, each constant temperature
Device be configured and any one or two that are programmed in two standard sets are met in the case of, be "Yes" by AAR traffic sign placements.When
When all the followings are correct, first group of standard is met：I the sensor of () according to thermostat, for example, it is passive which can be equipped with
Infrared (PIR) motion sensor, active infrared proximity transducer (PROX) and other take sensors, existing a period of time
The inertia for sensing reaches required inertia time interval；(ii) thermostat has " leaving automatically confidence ", because before which
Think oneself it is qualified being capable of statistically sufficient amount of significant time sensing statistically significant habitant's activity；
And (iii) is met into other basic " criterion of rationalitys " for leaving automatically pattern, for example, (a) do not disable before user
Automatically leave function；If b () obturator is not enterprise, then the time is between 8 a.m. and at 8 points in afternoon；C () thermostat is not
In " shut " mode"；D () " leaving " state temperature is more more energy efficient than current setting point temperature；And (e) user is not by based on cloud
Management server and thermostat remote ground it is interactive.When all the followings are correct, second group of standard is met：I () is according to perseverance
The sensor of warm device, the inertia for sensing of existing a period of time reach required inertia time interval；(ii) in this group
The AAR of at least one other thermostat be masked as "Yes"；And (iii) all meets above-mentioned " reasonability " standard.Advantageously, it is special
Not by means of indivedual thermostats can by its AAR traffic sign placement for "Yes" second group of alternate standard, for example it may be that even if
One or more thermostats not have " leaving automatically confidence " in the case of, simply by the presence of with " leaving automatically confidence " at least
The benefit of its take sensor data can also be contributed to leaving automatically for this group by one component, all thermostats in this group
It is determined that.The reliability and scalability for this method increasing that energy-conservation leaves feature automatically is had found, wherein by means of in obturator
Around multiple sensing stations enhance reliability, and enhance scalability, because making thermostat " not with leaving letter
" misplacing " (for example, the uncontrolled position outside the barrier for limiting PIR sensitivity) of one thermostat of the heart " will
The conforming effectiveness of group and practicality are not damaged generally.
It will be appreciated that said method is easily extended to the situation that there are multiple main thermostats and/or multiple auxiliary thermostats.
It should be further appreciated that when the main thermostat of term used herein, it is not necessary in main thermostat with obturator not
Exist between same HVAC system and correspond.For example, there are many installations, multiple " regions " wherein in obturator can be borrowed
Help to stop and/or redirected air stream to the zones of different of HVAC system controllable antivibrator by single HVAC system
Service.In tiiese cases, each region there may be main thermostat, each main thermostat be connected to HVAC system and
Appropriate antivibrator is adjusting the weather of regional.

Warm device and HVAC system function and change to provide intuitively visible instruction.For example, according to preferred embodiment, background is orange red
Color (for example, R/G/B values：231/68/0) it is currently needed for from HVAC system heating for indicating thermostat, and background band
Color (for example, the R/G/B values of cyan：0/65/226) it is currently needed for from HVAC system freezing for indicating thermostat.Additionally, root
According to some embodiments, thus it is possible to vary the intensity of background color, tone, saturation, opacity or transparency are so that indicate need to
Want how many heating and/or freeze (or HVAC system work there are many " hardly possiblies ") to realize current setting point.For example, it is preferred according to some
Embodiment, when HVAC system is not activated, (that is, when heating or freeze) uses black background, and in set-point
It is (for example, orange, red or red using the selected background color for representing heat during 5 degree of temperature at least Fahrenheit higher than current environmental temperature
It is orange), and in 5 degree of set-point temperature at least Fahrenheit lower than current environmental temperature using the selected background color for representing refrigeration
(for example, blue).Additionally, according to preferred embodiment, color can be taken off or be activated color with HVAC in muted color (black)
Change between (reddish orange or the blueness for refrigeration for heating), to indicate " the work of incrementss that HVAC system must be done
Make ", so as to change ambient temperature to reach current setting point.For example, according to certain preferred embodiments, drop low-level transparent
Degree (that is, the visibility or " loudness " of the increase of HVAC activation colors) is for corresponding between current environmental temperature and set-point temperature
Increase difference.When the difference between set-point temperature and current environmental temperature from increase to 5 degree for 1 degree when, background HVAC swash
" loudness " of color living increases to fully opaque " loud " heating on a dark background from almost fully transparent covering or makes
Cold color.It has been found that the change that use example color as described shows can be very useful to give user to workload, with
And therefore by by HVAC system in currently displaying " sensation " for arranging energy that point value spends and cost.This can have again very much
Energy-conservation is benefited, is especially become apparent from when user manually adjusts set-point temperature in real time, this is because background color is provided and user
Temperature setting behavior the related immediate feedback of energy result.
According to some alternate embodiments, the parameter in addition to the difference of simply Current Temperatures with set-point temperature can
For display background color and intensity.For example, Time-temperature (reaches the estimation of the time that current setting point temperature will take for
Amount), energy and/or cost (if knowing exactly) can also be used for alone or in combination determining which color and it is many it is strong (or not
It is transparent) for the background of thermostat display screen.
According to certain preferred embodiments, as described above, main with the white being covered on black, orange or blue background
Show character and other figures.According to some embodiments, also using other colors of some display features, for example, " leaf "
Mark green.Although for the purpose of clear and print reproduction, in the accompanying drawings with the black character being covered in white background
The many screens shown and described in this paper are provided with figure, it should be understood that white on black and color background using being covered in
Color or color graphics and character be typically preferably applied to strengthen Consumer's Experience, particularly with electronic display 316 be similar to
It is more bright for the embodiment of the backlight dot matrix LCD display screen of the display screen on hand-held intelligent mobile phone and Trackpad computer
It is aobvious.Significantly, although it have been found that presently described scheme of colour is especially effective, it is to be appreciated that the scope of the teachings of the present invention is not
This is necessarily limited to, and in view of description of the invention, in the case of the scope without departing from the teachings of the present invention, can be other classes
Type known or electronic display technology (for example, electric ink, electronic-paper display screen, the Organic LED displays hereafter developed
Deng) develop other effective schemes.
In fig. 7, screen 700 has reddish orange background color, wherein the white number 720 in central authorities indicates 72 degree of Fahrenheit
Current setting point.72 degree of current setting point is also shown by big graduation mark 714.As by 716 institute of decimal fractions 718 and graduation mark
Show, current environmental temperature is 70 degree.With other graduation marks in the white displays circular arrangement of more transparent (or softer), to give
The sensation of the scope of user's adjustment and temperature is given, so as to the circular design with thermostat, viewing area and rotating ring is coordinated.According to
Some embodiments, the circular arrangement of background graduation mark are sized and are spaced apart so that 180 graduation marks and will complete one
Circle, but 40 graduation marks are skipped in bottom, so that showing most 140 graduation marks.Set-point graduation mark 714 and current
Temperature scale line 716 can replace some background graduation marks, so that and non-display all background graduation marks.In addition, using number
718 numerical value of word ground shows Current Temperatures, and numeral 718 can also be capped with soft or transparent mode or be displayed in background scale
On line.According to some embodiments, in order to project visibility, (or 0% is transparent with 100% opacity for set-point graduation mark 714
Degree) be shown, be sized so that set-point graduation mark 714 than background graduation mark to display screen center extend it is remote by 20%,
And further increased by the neighboring background graduation mark not shown.According to some embodiments, Time-temperature shows 722 use
In indicating to reach the estimation time needed for current setting point, the commonly assigned patent in co-applications is such as described more fully with
In application U.S. Serial No 12/984,602.Fig. 7 B illustrate screen 701, and which shows and indicates that HVAC system is in heating mode, but
" for being warmed to " message 724 of active state (will show " heating " when HVAC system is active) is not in currently.
According to some embodiments, the background color of screen 701 is muted color (for example, black).Fan mark 730 can be shown, from
And indicate fan to be active and without the need for any associated heating or refrigeration.Additionally, when thermostat is locked, Ke Yixian
Show lock icon 732.Fig. 7 C illustrate screen 702, outside which is removed with background color (for example, blue), also need with instruction
The message 726 " refrigeration " of refrigeration.In the case, show message 726 " refrigeration " rather than Time-temperature shows, this is because
May be lack confidence to Time-temperature number (for example, due to the data deficiencies for more accurately estimating).In fig. 7d, screen
703 show an examples, and but which is similar to screen 702 shows Time-temperature 728 rather than message 726, so as to when indicating pair
M- Temperature estimate has higher confidence.It should be noted that the background color of screen 702 and screen 703 is light blue to indicate HVAC systems
It is cold to be active, however color can part it is soft or partially transparent, this is because current setting point temperature and working as front ring
Border temperature is relatively close to.
According to some embodiments, in order to promote to protect compressor apparatus (for example, conventional refrigerant compressor or heat pump heating
Compressor) from infringement, thermostat prevents compressor from reactivating failure in set period (" locking period "), to avoid
The compressor infringement that may occur in the case where the failure for reactivating interval is too short.For example, thermostat can be programmed to
Prevent compressor from reactivating in the lockout interval of 2 minutes after failure, but regardless of the current environment temperature in this lockout interval
What there is in degree and/or current setting point temperature.Longer or shorter locking period, simply typical case's locking in 2 minutes can be provided
One example of period.During the here locking period, according to some embodiments, the message (example in the screen 704 of Fig. 7 E is shown
Such as, 762), which provides visually observable countdown and terminates until lockout interval message, so as to notify user and avoid it is right
With regard to why, compressor not yet starts again at the User Part of operating and obscures.
According to some embodiments, manual set-point change may be at active state until next programming set-point
Effective time.For example, if in the afternoon 2:38 users move towards thermostat 300 and make outer shroud 312 (referring to Fig. 3 A, above) rotation
So that set-point is manually adjusted to 68 degree of Fahrenheit, if thermostat 300 has containing being desirably in afternoon 4:30 with different from China
The programming program of the set-point that the set-point temperature of 68 degree of family name comes into force, then set-point temperature change will be until afternoon 4 manually:
30 just effectively.According to some embodiments, (for example, message is 766) (until afternoon 4 for message:When 30) it is displayed in Fig. 7 F
On screen 705, inform the user that the set-point of 68 degree of Fahrenheit will be until afternoon 4:30 just come into force.
Fig. 7 G illustrate the exemplary screen 706 for showing message " for being warmed to ", and this message indicates thermostat 300 in heating mould
Still heating system is currently not in active state (that is, thermostat need not heat) to formula.In this example, Current Temperatures China
The set-point of 70 degree of family name already above 68 degree of Fahrenheit, thus actively heating call it is not necessary that.It should be noted that using black background

Although for the sake of clarity having described in detail foregoing teachings, however, it will be apparent that without departing from the present invention's
In the case of principle, certain changes and modifications can be carried out.For example, with " virtual ", " static state " or " solid-state " form rather than machine
Tool form provides the rotating ring of above-mentioned thermostat, and the periphery of thermostat main body calculates display containing similar to used in Trackpad whereby
Touch sensitive material on screen and smart mobile phone display screen, this is in the range of the teachings of the present invention.For these embodiments,
The operation of the handss of user will be " slide " on sensitive material is touched rather than mechanical ring word rotation, the finger of user is outside
Enclose." virtual ring rotation ", " static ring rotation ", " solid-state ring can be referred to as
Rotation " or " rotational slide " this kind of form user input other side with it is above-mentioned machinery rotation identical purpose and
Effect, but by the needs of mechanical ring on cancellation element.Although because the tactile of lesser amt may be had to the user of part
Satisfaction and be not qualified as needs are met as mechanical rotating ring, but these embodiments are likely due to for example drop
The reason for low manufacturing cost and it is favourable.By further example, with " virtual " or " solid-state " form rather than mechanical type
The inside mechanical pressable characteristic or " inwardly clicking on " feature of rotating ring are provided, whereby by using the ectosome coupling with thermostat
What the inside solid state sensor (for example, solid state piezoelectric formula sensor) of conjunction detected the handss or finger of user presses inward against force,
This is in the range of the teachings of the present invention.For these embodiments, the handss or finger of user press inward against will not with it is above-mentioned
Embodiment equally causes the positive reality of thermostat inwardly to move, but in other side with above-mentioned with rotating ring
" inwardly clicking on " identical purpose and effect.It is optionally possible to provide buzzer from internal loudspeaker or other sound transducers
Or click sound, the feedback on rotating ring or virtual/solid-state rotating ring is fully pressed inward against to provide user.Although not recognized
To be that needs are met as foregoing embodiments, the bullet of rotating ring and sheet type is moved inward in foregoing embodiments
Return mechanical " click " has been observed that it is especially to meet user, but these embodiments are likely due to include reducing being manufactured into
This reason for and it is favourable.The thermostat provides ring rotation and inwardly click with " virtual " or " solid-state " form, whereby complete
Whole device is provided with complete solid-state form in the case of completely without moving parts, this is equally in the range of the teachings of the present invention.
By further example, although special user input side will be described as with ring rotation and inwardly click above
Formula, this user input mode have been observed that at the graceful and simple aspect of device be particularly advantageous, are alternatively, however the perseverance
