Description
Priority request
The rights and interests for the U.S.Provisional Serial 62/167,742 submitted this application claims on May 28th, 2015, its is complete
Portion's disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.
Technical field
The disclosure relates generally to but is not limited only to information processing, and it particularly relates to believes for being transmitted to user
The configuration of breath and the trigger of execution action.
Background technology
The past during the decade, the arrival of service, search engine, Mobile solution and location aware device based on cloud pole
The earth extends the effectiveness of mobile user devices.Many such user's sets access it except providing voice-and-data now
Outside, context-aware services and application are also provided.In addition, with the nearest progress of processing system, it is many previously each incoherent
Application and service can work to provide the ability of enhancing and Consumer's Experience together now.
The available many application services of user are inputted and are instantiated by using order.A kind of such service is to create
Action-trigger.For example, user can say (or key entry) " reminding me to buy milk tonight " input into smart phone, and
And it will call to create and carry using the smart phone of command analysis application (or alternatively, with command analysis communication for service)
Wake up, create message and/or calendar and the action-trigger process for soliciting the extraneous information from user.If user
Wish that action-trigger is sometime being performed, then such information can be the time, and/or, if the user desired that
Action-trigger is performed when user reaches certain position, then such information can be position.The action triggers of even now
The setting of device is highly useful, and available trigger has been restricted to one group of choosing by applying or servicing offer in history
.In addition, the user configuration of trigger is probably the time-consuming and complicated process including multiple different manual steps and input.
When the information for defining trigger is tediously long or when being obtained from a variety of sources, this may be especially true.
The content of the invention
This specification is related to the trigger for creating certain action or behavior, and the trigger is to be based on being probably independently of described
Such one or more generations of the type of certain action or event (or being defined by the generation or event).Generation or thing
Part is independent, because they need not be selected from the inventory dependent on selected type of action or behavior type, but can be with
Defined by user according to one or more input.
Trigger can periodically be monitored by one or more computing systems.Occur or event is can be searched by webpage
Index holds up the type of identification.Occur or event is not limited to the system of user or using group, and can come from the world around user
In generation or event array.Therefore, the trigger based on such generation or event is referred to herein as world's trigger.
Certain theme described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of advantages below.
Because embodiments of the present invention can configure the trigger more more complicated than possible trigger in conventional system, because
This can be to communicate information to user in a manner of improving the correlation of transmitted information, and thus performs action, because institute
More preferable correspondence is provided between the information of offer and the generation of particular event.This, which can reduce information, may be provided to user
And the number abandoned because of the irrelevance of information by user, which results in the device with user, equipment or system are associated
Hardware and/or software resource optimization.
By the configuration of the trigger for information transmission, device, equipment or the system of user can be with more efficiently
Mode monitors a variety of environment or operating parameter associated with trigger with so that resource will not be unnecessarily consumed
In the associated parameter of the details for testing the not direct trigger specified with user.
In addition to the transmitted information of improvement is with the correlation for the action being performed, described in greater detail below
, embodiment described herein can substantially reduce user and must be connect with device, equipment or the system mutual of user
Receive useful information notice or take the time of action.This can be reduced at the display of the device of user, equipment or system
In the total time of state of activation, and it therefore can reduce power consumption.In the case of mobile device, this can save battery electric quantity
And it can aid in and reduce the frequency that battery needs to charge.In addition to reducing power consumption, method described herein, equipment and
System reduces the load on the user interface components of device and can be used for reducing the cognitive load of user.In addition,
Some aspects, notice can provide a user some useful informations, the useful information be it is incognizant before user and/or
User has found that they are very time-consuming (therefore being all lengthy and tedious for user and their device) manually.
User can create triggering on the basis of than the generation of much broader scope possible so far or event
Device.Trigger can call the prompting to user so that the prompting based on the action that such trigger is taken according to prompting
Taken manually.For example, trigger can be set as when the price of desired model reduces at certain internet retailer by user
Reminded during to less than a certain price and herself buy new laptop computer.Or trigger can simply provide user and feel emerging
The information of interest, and not necessarily imply further action.For example, trigger can be set as when the price of certain stock drops by user
It is low to being given a warning when being less than some value.Alternatively, trigger can be set as automatically taking by user
Certain action.For example, trigger can be set as buying concert admission ticket when concert admission ticket is sold (and by system by user
All aspects of the purchase handled in response to the determination sold admission ticket).As another alternative, user can incite somebody to action
Trigger is set as showing single approval action after an event occurs.For example, trigger can be set as working as above-mentioned sound by user
To user's presentation " purchase " button, (system is only automatically completed purchase after user activates " purchase " button when happy meeting admission ticket is sold
Buy).
Trigger can be set from following：Special reminder application, another application form such as browser or calendar,
Or be configured to for establish trigger, the inspection generation associated with trigger or event and meet with occur or
The purpose that user's (that is, triggering) is alerted after the associated criterion of event receives some other types of systems of user's input.This
System behind a little can include search engine, digital assistant, including voice-based assistant, etc..In addition, triggering and notice
System may be configured to and originally independent user interface front end communication so that user instruction and notice can be by user interfaces
Front end management.
Trigger can be based on single generation or event.For example, trigger definition can be showing in film by user
Remind day and buy film ticket interested.Or multiple generations or event can be grouped together to define trigger.Example
Such as, user can create film show day but only when this show on calendar of the day in spouse not by separately it is pre- regularly
Remind the trigger for buying film ticket interested.
In some embodiments, the foundation of trigger create regular search that search system can be implemented please
Ask.The result of search can be analyzed to determine the state of searched for content.If the state being determined meets to be set by trigger
Fixed condition, then trigger be activated.Otherwise, then do not activate.For example, trigger can be configured to the stock valency when company A
Lattice alert user when being less than 50 dollars.Search system periodically can perform search for the stock price of company A.Search system
Search result can be provided to the analysis system for performing test to determine whether the price is less than per share 50 dollars of user's setting
Threshold value.If analysis system provides price and has been determined to be below the result for per share 50 dollars of the threshold value that user sets simultaneously
And only in this case, the output of analysis system can be provided to the notice system for notifying user.
Substantially, generation or the search and determination of event are the determinations of the change to user's external status.State these
Change cause system take certain act trigger-substantially, the trigger of the change based on selected world state or
World's trigger.Although the change of state be on user outside generation or event, the triggering of search can be independently of
Or dependent on user action.For example, search can be the function of time interval, such as every morning local time 7：00 search one
It is secondary, this behavior independently of user.Or search can be customer location or the function of action, such as user (or user
Mobile device) be confirmed as from location A be moved to B location when, this depends on user behavior.As just an example, user
Trigger can be set as when user is in store A but only those paper handkerchiefs expense than the paper handkerchief in B, C and D shop
User is prompted to buy paper handkerchief in the case of expense low (being determined by search described above and analysis process).These are to emphasize to trigger
The example of some differences between generation or event and search startup, is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.
Create user-defined action and specify and reminded with the user-defined action that will be presented (or will be performed)
The mutually independent trigger of trigger, it is allowed to user specifies unique for user and user to wish to be alerted the action
The situation of (or hope action is performed automatically).For example, if user is specific for viewing by user-defined action selection
Professional sportses are competed, such as when [when A teams compete with B teams] [viewing A teams], then when user does not recognize the schedule of A teams
User can be alerted the user-defined action.This avoid the needs of the specific schedule of user tracking A teams.
User-defined action can based on the information obtained via webpage, via apply addressable data or user
Data in the private network of approval and be triggered.In addition, user-defined action can not know trigger in user
Generation in the case of be triggered.

Embodiment
Action-trigger processing system helps to create user-defined action and user-defined trigger event.
In operation, action-trigger processing system receives the input of the user-defined action of user device (for example, defeated through text
Enter, voice command, click on selection etc. and perform).Action-trigger processing system can also receive user-defined event, and
And when action-trigger processing system determines that user-defined event occurs, it can be provided to user's set user-defined dynamic
The notice of work.This notice allow users to that moment execution (for example, by provide link/button/app icons/
Etc.), or the instruction that offer action is performed automatically, or the information relevant with action is directly provided in an announcement message.For example,
User-defined action selection can be the match of viewing professional sportses such as " viewing A teams ", and user-defined thing by user
Part can be " when A teams and B teams compete ".Before action-trigger processing system determines that user-defined event occurs, use
The prompting for the action that family defines will not be triggered to be presented to user in user device.User-defined action and user determine
The event of justice can be stored in action-trigger data as action-trigger.
In addition, in some embodiments, behavior trigger processing system can receive indicated condition be satisfied it is extra
User's selection of event.For example, conditional definition can be reminded viewing A teams by user when being competed with B teams for A pairs at home.Cause
This, if user is working when A teams compete with B teams, user will not be alerted viewing A teams.
Action-trigger processing system can in many ways be analyzed and determine the generation of user-defined event.For example,
Event data can be updated and/or search for.In some embodiments, information source such as webpage corpus or knowledge base or
Combination, can be searched whether having occurred with determination event.For example, information source can be by by action triggers processing system
The search engine search of calling.For example, action-trigger processor can be determined using search engine to determine whether there is user
The generation of the event of justice.
Action-trigger processing system may be implemented within user's set, or be embodied in what is separated with user's set
In computer system such as server system.In later case, server system receive the input from user's set and to
User's set sends data and is used to handle.These features and other feature is described below in more detail.
Fig. 1 is the block diagram of environment 100, and order input is treated for reminding task in environment 100 and prompting triggers.Meter
Such as Internet of calculation machine network 102 or its combination, there is provided the data communication between electronic installation and system.Pass through one
Or multiple gateways, computer network 102 can also include one or more wireless networks 103 or with one or more of nothings
The data of gauze network 103 communicate.
User's set 106 is under user's control and can inquire about and receive the resource on network 102, can also be held
The electronic installation of the other actions of row.Exemplary user device 106 include personal computer, mobile communications device, wearable device, with
And other devices of the data on network 102 can be sent and received.In the example of fig. 1, user's set 106 is intelligent electricity
Words.Example smart phone is described hereinafter with reference to Fig. 7.User's set 106 can on network 102 and 103 with wired and
The mode of wireless connection communicates with network 102 and 103 respectively.User's set 106 can also be by middle device and short distance
Transceiver accesses the device of network 102 such as WiFi, bluetooth.As described with reference to figure 6, user's set can
One group of device action is performed for various programs and performance.
User's set 106 is associated with user account, such as provided by the cloud service provider 112 of a variety of services of offer
Account.These services can include search (webpage, in-house network, document and application, etc.), web mail, calendar, social activity
Network, message, document storage and editor, digital assistant service etc..Account data 114 can store the spy of user's set 106
Due to the data of account.In addition, although present only a user's set 106 in Fig. 1, but multiple user's sets can be included
106。
Action-trigger processing system 120 receive the order from user's set input and handle input with determine in response to
Which input will take act if taking action.Although action-trigger processing system 120 is shown as in Fig. 1
The entity of separation, but action-trigger processing system 120 may be implemented within cloud service provider 112, or even with
In family device 106.
As being determined by action-trigger processing system 120, input can call a variety of actions.It is for example, defeated
Character and/or lexical item (for example, letter or number) can be included by entering.Equally, input can be interpreted search inquiry order,
In this case, search inquiry is sent to search service.Similarly, input can be interpreted the order made a phone call, at this
In the case of kind, user's set 106 is attempted to establish voice communication on network 103.Similarly, input can be interpreted that user determines
The action of justice, in such a case, it is possible to generate action-trigger.The life of action-trigger is hereinafter described in further detail
Into, user-defined action, the processing of user-defined event and such project.
In some embodiments, each input is handled by input resolver 122, and input resolver 122 is programmed to solve
Analysis input lexical item, includes the character and lexical item of input, and determines that anything should be taken to act if taking action.Some
In embodiment, input resolver 122 can with access language model with determine to take which order or action.Such language mould
Type can be based on statistical, for example, model can include being assigned to being confirmed as spy semantically related to particular command
Determine the weight of word and phrase, or it is rule-based, for example, the grammer of the sentence structure of description particular command.It can use each
Kind other Languages and text input processing system.
As described above, user can input order on user's set 106, and at action-trigger processing system 120
Whether reason order input is relevant with by the action being taken to determine order input.Can be filled by user by the action being taken
Put the action of execution, or the action performed by the system of another separation.For example, the action performed by user's set can be carried
Other actions that awake presentation, the transmission of text message or user's set is able to carry out.The action taken by another system
Can be, for example, the purchase of assets, ensure restaurant it is predetermined, etc..
In addition, the action being taken can be simply related to take to the presentation of the confirmation of action in user device, its
It is middle to complete the action being taken by user's set or the system of separation.For example, if user's input is [when price is low
10 bursts of X corporate shares are bought when 530 dollars], action-trigger processing system will identify the dynamic of 10 bursts of X corporate shares of purchase
Make, and the user-defined event when the price of X corporate shares is less than 530 dollars.However, the action may be subjected to really
Recognize action, the confirmation action causes user's set 106 to present to perform the action of purchase stock and really accept one's fate order.Therefore, when X is public
When taking charge of event of the stock less than 530 dollars and occurring, user's set is presented 10 strands of stocks of purchase and accepted one's fate really order.If user receives
The confirmation order, then user's set 106 by system 120 send represent user cause stock purchase notice.
In some embodiments, action-trigger processing system 120 includes touching with the action that input resolver 122 communicates
Send out device processor 124.Action-trigger processor 124 also accesses action-trigger data 126 and event data 128.Action is touched
Hair device processor 124 can receive user's input of the user-defined action provided by user on user's set 106.User
The action of definition is that user wants to present when user-defined event occurs or the action of execution in user (for example, determine
Prompting of the time point to user before the event of justice).User-defined action can be by multiple characters (for example, letter, number
Word, symbol) description, for example, " coming to matches ", " band umbrella ", " housecleaning ".Action-trigger processor 124 determines user
The action of justice, which is stored in action-trigger data 126, is used for specific action-trigger.Action-trigger may be stored in
Multiple action-trigger AT1, AT2 in data 126 ... ATn, and can each have one or more in multiple promptings
Individual user-defined action A1, A2 ... An.Set trigger is (for example, that of implementation created by user or previous
It can be checked a bit) at user's set 106, and user can be at any time at user's set 106 to action triggers
Device makes change (for example, addition, deletion, modification).
In addition, each in multiple action-triggers have one or more user-defined event E1, E2 ... En,
They are associated with the user-defined action provided.Each event is selected by user and is independent of relative action
Type determine.Occur or event is independent, because they, which need not be selected from, depends on selected type of action or row
For the inventory of type, but can be defined by user according to one or more inputs and the input of required movement.These one
Individual or multiple inputs can be a part for the order of required movement, or can be the follow-up series input of user.
For example, the follow-up input as a part for the order of required movement can be the form of order sentence, for example,
[when stock is less than per share 530 dollars, buying 10 bursts of X corporate shares].Herein, the identification maneuver of resolver 122 --- " purchase 10
Stock X corporate shares " --- and event --- " when X corporate shares are less than per share 530 dollars ".
How incoherent with action it is for further explanation event, considers input [if film《Consequence》Rotten banana
Scoring is higher than 75%, reminds me to be wished with south and goes to see《Consequence》].Herein, the identification maneuver of resolver 122 --- southern wish of band is presented and goes to see
Film《Consequence》Prompting --- and event --- "《Consequence》Rotten banana scoring be higher than 75% ".
Similarly, the follow-up series input of user can be search information source 130 such as webpage corpus or knowledge base
Search inquiry input, to identify and inquire about relevant event.For example, user can be specific specially for presentation viewing by action input
The prompting of such as A teams of industry sports team.User can then submit the inquiry of the schedule to A teams, and result can be with event
Form is presented, for example, " when A teams and B teams compete ", " when A teams and C teams compete ", etc..
After the generation of user-defined event, action-trigger processor 124 can be determined to the presentation user of user's set 106
The action of justice, and in some embodiments, action-trigger processor 124 will perform associated with user-defined event
User-defined action.The generation of user-defined event can include predicting that user-defined event will occur, user
The event of definition occurs, and/or user-defined event has occurred and that.In addition, in some embodiments, determine in user
After the generation that user-defined event is determined before the time point of the event of justice, user-defined action can be determined earlier than user
The time of the event of justice is presented to user's set 106 (for example, performing use as in the time of user-defined event as notice
The prompting for the action that family defines).In some embodiments, user-defined action and/or user-defined event can be
Action-trigger that is disposable or repeating.Whether the user of user's set 106 can set and provide action-trigger will
Repeat either one-time action trigger.
Although above-mentioned example one event that has been only action description, may there is the multiple events associated with acting.User
The execution of Boolean logic required movement can be used, for example, user can be specified only when each event occurs, or it is optional
Ground, if any event occurs, or if when the logical combination for the event specified by user occurs, perform action.
Other event types can include time cycle condition, band of position condition or people close to condition, etc..When
Between periodic condition can be date, date range, division of day and night or division of day and night scope, etc..For example, AT1 can include it is user-defined
(A1) " band umbrella " and user-defined event (E1) " when rainfall probability is more than 50% " are acted, and user can also include
Time cycle condition (E2) " afternoon Saturday ", it can be specific Saturday (for example, next Saturday), each Saturday, chosen week
Six or certain pattern Saturday (for example, first Saturday monthly) acquiescence or user setting time range (for example,
1 point to 5 points of afternoon).Based on this prompting AT1 example, user-defined action (A1) " band umbrella " will not be triggered, and remove
Non-action trigger processor 124 determines user-defined event E1 " when rainfall probability is more than 50% " in such as time cycle bar
Part E2 " afternoon Saturday " defined " afternoon Saturday " occurs.In addition, in some embodiments, time cycle condition can be with base
In the situation of user's offer by user's set 106.For example, the user of user's set 106 can provide time cycle condition "
Between meeting ", it can be determined based on the active conference schedule of user.
Band of position condition can be when behavior condition is satisfied user's set at or near ad-hoc location (for example,
House address) around region or location type (for example, grocery store, airport, hospital).For example, band of position condition can be with
It is " being in ", it can be defined by user on user's set 106.In addition, " near " can be specific away from identified position
Distance (for example, foot or mile) or away from identified position by different modes of transportation (for example, by bus, public transport, walking)
The certain time amount of measurement.Therefore, if user-defined action be set to " band umbrella " and user-defined event " when
When rainfall probability is more than 50% " when being set, user can also select trigger conditions " being in ".When the use of user's set 106
During family " being in ", if action-trigger processor 120 determines that user-defined event is satisfied, or otherwise touched
Hair, the then meeting of action-trigger processing system 120 notify user-defined action " band umbrella " to user's set 106.On the contrary, work as
When user's set 106 " is not in ", if action-trigger processing system 120 determines that user-defined event " works as rainfall probability
During more than 50% ", then user-defined action " band umbrella " will be not presented to user, because when user-defined event is expired
Band of position condition when sufficient applied to action-trigger is not satisfied.
If the user's set 106 of user is located within the identified user's set certain distance away from particular person or group,
Then people can be satisfied close to condition.In some embodiments, distance of the user's set 106 away from identified user's set can
To be provided by action-trigger processor 124 or user can adjust the distance.In addition, in some embodiments,
In order that action-trigger processor 124 recognizes particular person or the user's set of group, user's set 106 may need to include specific
People or group identify people or group as contact person or otherwise.However, in other embodiments, action-trigger processor
124 can identify the user's set of the particular person and group around user's set 106.For example, user can be created including following
Trigger action：The user-defined action of " discussion camping trip " is reminded, user-defined event is " when rainfall probability is more than
When 50% (during travel dates) " (for example, user can select this forecast to be for current location or specify different positions
Put), and people is close to condition " David ".Action-trigger processing system 120 can then determine in action-trigger processing system 120
User-defined event rainfall probability is more than or equal to 50% and occurred (for example, predicting user-defined event in the travel dates phase
Between occur) and notify with " David " people the user's set 106 " discussion camping trip " of user when close.In addition, user also may be used
With including time cycle condition and/or band of position condition.
Event data 128 includes the data for defining 124 available information of action-trigger processor.For example, event data
128 can include news, weather, traffic, motion and entertainment information, trip, health, other events and Financial Information etc.
World Affairs.In some embodiments, event data 128 can be from bigger information source 130 for example by search engine 132
Obtained in the data of search.Information source can be webpage corpus, knowledge graph, data feedback and can therefrom determine various
Incoherent and any other information source of the data of the event of onrelevant.In addition, information source 130 can also include by third party
The information of offer, such as third-party application and service (for example, weather forecast and reporting services).
Furthermore, it is possible to different type and the data measured and content are accessed and/or obtained as event data 128.For example, letter
Some resource contents in breath source 130 can be logical from resource publisher (for example, using publisher or web site publisher)
Often available and addressable information.In addition, addressable some resource contents can not be directed to specific user in information source 130
Personalized information, however, the content may require user's login, or otherwise provide mandate, to access
The content of resource.In addition, some resource contents can be personalized for specific user and be probably privately owned information.These
Resource can be that resource publisher is proprietary and may also require that login from user or authorization message to access user
Customized information and content.In the appropriate case and depend on the circumstances, one or more different methods can be used (beyond this
Scope of disclosure) obtain user certificate to access proprietary or private data, its object is to keep user data safety and
Privacy.
In some embodiments, action-trigger is being created using user-defined action and user-defined event
Afterwards, action-trigger processor 124 can cause search to be performed, such as be performed via search engine 132, or crawl event
Data in data 128 are to determine the state of user-defined event (for example, when user-defined event will occur).It is dynamic
Making trigger processor 124 can be constantly or periodically (for example, with interval poll (poll) event periodically or non-periodically
Data 128) search for and/or crawl the data in event data 128 to determine the state of user-defined event.In some implementations
In mode, the state and information of user-defined event can be pushed to action from event data 128 by search engine 132 and touch
Send out device processor 124.Thus action-trigger processor can obtain related to the information of user-defined event approach in fact
When or newest information, if such frequency.
More generally useful, action-trigger processor 124 may be configured to cause the generation for event to information source 130
Carry out periodicity search.The occurrence frequency of the generation of particular event possibly relies on event type.For example, with extremely variable
The event of property such as stock price can be with search in every five minutes once；On the contrary, less variable event such as weather condition can
To search for per hour once.Therefore, the search cycle of event type is the possibility changed based on event；Change relative to data
Slow event, data change quick event by with the search rate higher than the slow event of data change.Action is touched
Hair device processor 124 can obtain the real-time or up-to-date information related to the information of user-defined event.
Fig. 2 is the example mistake for creating and notifying user-defined action when user-defined event is determined performing
The flow chart of journey 200.Process 200 for example can be implemented by action-trigger processor 124.In some embodiments, example
The operation of process 200 may be implemented as being stored in the instruction on the computer-readable medium of nonvolatile, wherein instruction causes number
The operation of instantiation procedure 200 is performed according to processing equipment.
Processor 124 receives the identification for the action that will be taken, wherein action is one in multiple type of action
(202).Action-trigger processor 124 can receive the input that user-defined action is for example described at user's set 106.With
The action that family defines is the action that user wishes to carry out when event is determined.Action can be that for example something carries
Awake presentation, either represent user do something really accept one's fate order presentation or be not carried out the prompting or confirmation of action
In the case of by all or part of action performed automatically.Type of action is related to the theme acted.For example, film prompting is " electricity
Shadow " or " amusement " type of action；It is " groceries " type of action that groceries inventory, which is reminded,；Stock Purchase action is " finance " action class
Type, etc..User-defined action is stored in action-trigger data 126 for specific by action-trigger processor 124
Action-trigger.
Processor 124 receives the identification for the first event for being independent of type of action determination, wherein the generation of the first event
It can be determined (204) by action-trigger processor 124.First event is independent of the type of action determination of the first action,
Because it is not selected from the inventory of the type of action dependent on the first action, but is determined by user according to one or more input
Justice.For example, user can be with oral specified event, such as " when A teams and B teams compete ", or can be event searching information source.
No matter make how, be presented to user be used for selection event be independent of the first action type of action determine.Example
Such as, user can specify the first action " to go to the cinema《Consequence》" prompting, and event be " if the forecast of rainfall is more than
50% " and " afternoon Saturday ".The type of action of event --- weather events and time conditions --- independent of " film ".Change sentence
Talk about, the event associated with action can be any event that can be obtained or detect from big information corpus.
Processor 124 will act and the first event is associated with for determining the instruction whether the first event has occurred
(206).For example, processor 124 writes such instruction, the instruction causes the inquiry of the formulation of processor 124 action and cycle
Property to search engine 132 send inquiry with for indicate the first event generation Data Search Information source.As described above,
The frequency of search possibly relies on the mutability of event.In some embodiments, if search indicates constant event condition,
Then action-trigger processor 124 need not search again for information source 130, and can store the constant event condition as tactile
Send out device.The example of constant event condition is times that specific date, specific time or its generation can be determined in advance
What its event.In order to illustrate, for event " Thanksgiving Day in 2016 ", the date is November 26.Therefore, at 2016 7
The search of the event of the moon will obtain the date, and the subsequent searches between July and November 26 will be unwanted.It is constant
Event of the event such as being attributed to date of determination, time can be specified in advance.
Processor 124 causes the search to information source to determine whether or not there have been the generation of user-defined event (208).
For example, action-trigger processor 124 can cause search engine 132 in information source 130 search events data 128 (or
The searched engine 132 of foundation performs the search schedule until being cancelled).As described above, the search of each event can be all
Carry out to phase property.In some embodiments, when an event occurs, action-trigger processor 124 can be noted with search engine
Volume event and search engine 132 can be by the data-pushing of the generation of specified event to action-trigger processor 124.Search
Information source 130 can be by providing inquiry to perform to search engine.Inquiry can be from the event generation defined in event data.
If processor 124 determines that user-defined event has occurred, processor 124 causes action that (210) occur.It is no
Then, processor 124 will cause search to be made again, for example, another is periodically searched for, if it is determined that user-defined event
If not yet occurring.
In some embodiments, with the validity of test action trigger and/or can expire.For example, if action is touched
The hair device reception past date can be marked as invalid as event, then event.Similarly, if action-trigger never
Trigger and word conditions cause action-trigger never will be triggered in future, then action-trigger can be marked as
Phase.This latter example is the action for the multiple affair that all events must occur, and one of event is date event, for example,
" before 31 days December in 2015, and when X corporate shares are less than per share 400 dollars, buying 10 bursts of X corporate shares ".Once
Date mistake, and action is never triggered, for example, due to until December 31 X corporate shares all do not drop to it is beautiful less than 400
Member, then action-trigger be marked as expired.

The operation of process 600 may be implemented as being stored in the instruction on the computer-readable medium of nonvolatile, wherein instruction causes number
The operation of instantiation procedure 600 is performed according to processing equipment.
User-defined action is received (602) by action-trigger processor 124.Action-trigger processor 124 can be with
Reception includes describing the input of one group of lexical item of user-defined action at user's set 106.User-defined action is to work as to use
The action that user wishes to carry out or is alerted when the event that family defines is determined.User-defined action can include more
Individual character, and can be such as " band umbrella ", " carwash " " housecleaning " or any other user-defined action.Carry
User-defined action is stored in action-trigger data 126 by processor 124 of waking up is used for specific action-trigger.
Use information source 130 determines to meet the event (604) with the threshold correlation of user-defined action.In order to identify
Event, system can carry out search events using user-defined action, or be used to search for it is alternatively possible to be received from user
The extra lexical item of event or input.In previous situation, for example, search engine 132 can be based on user-defined action
Character to the search of knowledge base to lexical item and by determining related event.Action-trigger processor 124 can handle defeated
Enter and form inquiry, for example, search meets the dependent event of threshold correlation.In variant preferably, search engine
132 (or action-trigger processors 124) can access description by input same or analogous user-defined action its
The data of the event of its user selection.For example, if user provides user-defined action " band umbrella ", information source 130
The event related to umbrella (for example, rainfall forecast from weather service) can be determined, as the same or analogous user of offer
The event that user has inputted or selected during action " with the umbrella " of definition, or have relation with the lexical item in user-defined action
Or the event of contact, such as the event relevant with rainfall.Threshold value can be based on event journey similar to user-defined action
Spend to determine.For example, the scoring of similarity or other types of identifier are determined for event and user-defined action
Between similarity level.
In order to generate inquiry, action-trigger processor 124 can parse input to remove stop-word, will be user-defined
The lexical item of action submits to query rewrite device to generate one or more inquiries, using user-defined action as inquiry, or
Person can use other query generation technologies.The inquiry that machine learning can be used for being provided is determined with multiple possible users
One in the action of justice matches.As it was previously stated, search engine 132 can be based on the letter provided from user-defined action
The inquiry that breath and lexical item provide, it is determined that related event.
System is received from user and is used to search under the latter of extra lexical item of event wherein, and user can determine
Justice action is reminded, and then reminds description user to want the parameter related to event trigger for the action.The latter implementation side
Formula is to provide much more flexibility by event is associated with action.Specifically, specified specific to user or by user
Can be associated with action for the event related to action.For example, user can create user's definition of prompting " going to meet wife "
Action.Then, user can in order to create user-defined event and input inquiry " to 1234 flights in San Francisco ".Search
It can be that user-defined event determines related event that index, which holds up 132, as it was previously stated, it can be for example " when by pre- timing
Between land when (11：00AM) ", " when land by the real time (TBD) when ", " landing previous hour in the real time (TBD) " or
Person " is landed previous hour (10 in the scheduled time：00AM)”.Therefore, even if system may not be automatically by the particular flight time
It is associated with user-defined action, but inputted by using the second event of the action of previous definition, system can be still based on
Second event is inputted to identify multiple events and thereby allow users to the event of wide scope is related to user-defined action
Connection.
The data of the inventory of the optional event of the display of user's set 106 are caused to be provided to user's set (606).Event package
The event for meeting threshold correlation is included, and is the identified of action-trigger processing system 120 and information source can be based on
Those events that information in 130 determines.
The data of user-defined event of the description selected from one of the event of may be selected are received (608).User's set 106
User can select to be displayed in the optional event of user's set one is to determine user-defined event.It is determined that with
After event that family defines occurs, action-trigger processor 124 can to the action that the presentation user of user's set 106 defines,
And in some embodiments, action-trigger processor 124 is determined the user associated with user-defined event is performed
The action of justice.
In some embodiments, action-trigger condition can be supplied to action-trigger processor by user's set
124(610).Action-trigger is indicated it is determined that the condition to be met in the generation of user-defined event.For example, such as preceding institute
State, action-trigger can be one or more time cycle conditions, band of position condition or people close to condition.
(or cause search) to information source is to determine whether or not there have been user-defined thing in addition, system search information source
The generation (612) of part.For example, action-trigger processor 124 can cause search engine 132 to be directed to the thing that instruction user defines
The data of the generation of part and search for information source 130.Action-trigger processor 124 can constantly or periodically (for example, with
Interval poll event data 128 periodically or non-periodically) search for and/or crawl the data in event data 128 to determine user
The state of the event of definition.In some embodiments, the state of user-defined event and information can be by search engines 132
It is pushed to action-trigger processor 124.
Then, system determines whether there is the generation (614) of user-defined event.KBS is come from obtaining
After 130 information, action-trigger processor 124 can be by the information received from KBS 130 and user-defined thing
Part is compared to determine whether or not there have been the generation of user-defined event.Based on example above, user-defined
In the case that action is " band umbrella " and user-defined event is " 50% rainfall probability ", information source 130 can update user
The Weather information of the position of the user of device 106, and action-trigger processor 124 can be received occurs either periodically or continuously
(for example, push or poll) renewal.When action-trigger processor 124, which receives, to be updated, action-trigger processor 124 can be with
Determine whether user-defined event has occurred and that.If user-defined event does not occur, action-trigger processor 124
The search of information source 130 can be caused to be made again.
It is determined that after the generation of user-defined event, action-trigger processor 124 can provide to user's set 106
The prompting (616) of action can be presented so as to obtain user's set in data.In other embodiments, once motion trigger is handled
After device 124 determines that user-defined event occurs, action-trigger processor 124 and/or action-trigger processing system 120
Other components can perform user-defined action (for example, automatically), and in some embodiments, to user's set
106 provide the user-defined notice for acting and being activated or having completed.In addition, in some embodiments, notice can be by moving
Make trigger processor 124 to provide, and the user of user's set 106 can access the letter related to user-defined action
Breath；It is not essential however, notice is presented at the display of user's set 106.The notice that user receives can be mobile dress
Put the notice (for example, Android notice, app internal circulars etc.) of offer, or the notice on desktop is (for example, browser leads to
Know, OS notice etc.).In the notification, can provide perform the operation associated with user-defined action link or button.
For example, if user-defined action is " phoning David " and user-defined event is " when the State of the Union Message of president is broadcast
When putting ", then when providing the notice for including user-defined action " phoning David ", it can include phoning David's
Link or button.In some embodiments, when action-trigger processor 124 recognizes the action that will be performed, can wrap
Include link or button (for example, recognize phone David and " David " is included in the contact person of user's set 106).
In addition, in some embodiments, the execution of the presentation of user-defined action or user-defined action can be with
The device being provided to outside user's set 106.For example, present can be provided to be confirmed as the device close with user or
The device that person user will be seen from or see.If for example, the user's set 106 of user in threshold time period not by with
Family uses, and another device is used in user, then acts processing system 120 and may decide that the dress being used to user
Put the action that presentation user defines.
The systematic collection discussed herein on user personal information or can utilize personal information in the case of,
Control program can be provided a user or whether feature collects user profile (for example, social networks, social action on user
Or the current position of behavior, occupation, the preference of user, user, location track, the position such as family/work inferred, the feelings inferred
The information in border, calendar data, the upcoming event from Email/predetermined etc.) or control whether and/or how
Reception may be with the chance of the more relevant content from content server of user.In addition, some data being stored or
Handled in one or more ways before use so that the recognizable information of individual is removed.For example, can be to the body of user
Part is handled so that not can determine that the individual of user can recognize that information, or the geographical position of user can be generalized to
Positional information is acquired place's (for example, city, ZIP codes or state level) so that not can determine that the particular location of user.Therefore, use
How family can be controlled using described information to the information and content server how collected on user.
