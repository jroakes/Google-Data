Duplicity suggestion detecting device 206 can to comprise current (for example, receive recently) suggestion and/or in the past (for example, charge to daily record or preserve) suggestion of suggestion (for example, grading, comment, comment, abuse mark, share, like ,+1 or other social networks interaction etc.) analyze.For example the suggestion in past can be stored in following one of them various positions: duplicity suggestion detecting device 206, application program shop 208 and application memory 210.Use the submission information of working as submit information and/or pass by/charging to daily record, duplicity suggestion detecting device 206 can separate duplicity information or rubbish message with the proper block of information of submitting to just when information, the real user of for example application program.Once duplicity suggestion be detected, duplicity suggestion detecting device 206 can be sent to the various services that may use this test result by (for example, expression duplicity is graded/commented on) test result.For example, application program shop 208 can be used grade with duplicity to ignore grading/comment or the punishment/user that comment is associated of this test result or the benefited party (for example, application program or its developer) of account or the positive suggestion of punishment duplicity.
Fig. 3 describes and illustrates according to the exemplary components of the example duplicity suggestion detecting device 306 of one or more embodiment of the present invention, module, routine, connection and interactive block diagram.For example, duplicity suggestion detecting device 306 can be similar to the duplicity suggestion detecting device 206 of Fig. 2.Duplicity suggestion detecting device 306 can comprise suggestion message recipient 320.Duplicity suggestion detecting device 306 can comprise suggestion information log 322.Duplicity suggestion detecting device 306 can comprise complaint analysis device 324.Duplicity suggestion detecting device 306 can and/or (conventionally be represented by Reference numeral 328) from application program shop from one or more client terminal devices (conventionally being represented by Reference numeral 326) to receive suggestion (for example, grading, comment, comment, abuse mark, share, like ,+1 or other social networks interaction etc.).For example, client terminal device 326 can comprise the client terminal device similar to the client terminal device 202 of Fig. 2.For example, application program shop 328 can be similar to the application program shop 208 of Fig. 2.
Suggestion message recipient 320 can and/or (conventionally be represented by Reference numeral 328) from application program shop from one or more client terminal devices (conventionally being represented by Reference numeral 326) to receive suggestion (for example, grading, comment, comment, abuse mark, share, like ,+1 or other social networks interaction etc.).The core (for example, grading, comment etc.) that suggestion can comprise suggestion varied opinions information in addition.Suggestion information can be for example following opinional various information: the content/text of comment/comment, the length of comment/comment, grading are (for example, [integer or decimal] star that [maximum integer] is following), the IP address that grading/comment stems from, the geographic position that grading/comment stems from, account information (for example, user name, account's age etc.) and the various out of Memory being associated with the user who inputs this suggestion.Its suggestion/suggestion information receiving of storage for example can be stored or facilitate to suggestion message recipient 320 (for example, in suggestion information log 322), to make after a while these suggestion/suggestion information can be used to detect trend and mode in these suggestions etc. in conjunction with suggestion/suggestion information that receive recently.In certain embodiments, replace (or in combination) that suggestion/suggestion information is stored in suggestion information log 322, suggestion/suggestion information can be stored in any position, for example application program shop 208 or application memory 210.
Can come (for example, being stored in suggestion information log 322) suggestion/suggestion information to carry out index or tissue with the variety of way that can assist complaint analysis device 324 to detect various trend and modes etc.For example, can utilize specific user or account or in the mode being associated with specific user or account, suggestion/suggestion information be indexed.User-association data can help to detect bad participant/user.As another example, can utilize application-specific, game or such as other content of film, music etc. etc. or in the mode being associated with these contents, suggestion/suggestion information is indexed.As another example, can utilize the developer of content or in the mode being associated with the developer of content, suggestion/suggestion information be indexed.Application program associated data can help to detect the application program as the target of duplicity grading/comment.Can also with associated independently use these the suggestion/suggestion information of suggestion/suggestion information with user and/or application program.For example, can with specific user and/or application program relatively or irrelevantly, suggestion/suggestion information all can be used to detect the interactive or transaction of duplicity.
For example, one or more indexing models in the index scheme (, utilize user, utilize application program, have nothing to do with user/application program) that complaint analysis device 324 can be considered just to have discussed are with analysis or compare varied opinions and/or suggestion information.In this respect, complaint analysis device 324 for example can be for each user, detect trend, pattern or the general character etc. in suggestion for each application program and/or for each interaction.Coming detection trend, pattern or general character etc. for each user can help (for example,, aspect user's interactive type or frequency) to detect the user as abnormal personnel.For each application program detect trend, pattern or general character etc. can help to detect as duplicity grading/comment (may represent application program be Malware or some other types do not expect application program) the application-specific of target.Can help test example as suspicious dissimilar user interaction or the suggestion due to content only for each interaction detection trend, pattern or general character etc.In addition, complaint analysis device 324 for example can use, for detection of relevant (being, likely that same people has) account or user's service, algorithm or routine etc.Associated user/account may be create in suspicious mode or may be known be fraudulent.Associated user/account is not necessarily bad, if but there is other suspection factor for specific user's suggestion, the fact that suggestion is bound to related account may make to suspect to be increased.Therefore, the various explanations that judge for each user about the discussion here, should be appreciated that alternate embodiment can comprise the similar judgement that associated user/account is considered as to same user.
Complaint analysis device 324 from suggestion/suggestion information of suggestion message recipient 320 (for example can receive and analyze, current or receive recently suggestion information) and (for example, from suggestion information log 322) previously received alternatively suggestion/suggestion information.Complaint analysis device 324 can be analyzed suggestion information, and automatically to detect, may to speak be fraudulent trend and mode etc.Complaint analysis device 324 can automatically generate and may speak is fraudulent one or more M signal.Complaint analysis device 324 can Automatic Combined or the one or more M signals of polymerization for example, to generate the test result (, 330) for suggestion.Below illustrate that suggestion information analyser 324 for example, at the various factors or the signal that judge that suggestion can detect or consider while whether being duplicity (not being, by submitting to just when user).
Complaint analysis device 324 can be considered the interior perhaps origin of comment/comment.It may be fraudulent sign to find comment that complaint analysis device 324 can be analyzed comment current or that importing into.Complaint analysis device 324 can use various rules and/or the threshold value of past experience based on for user comment and/or the professional knowledge relevant with user comment.For example, if due to for example comment comprise about application program why good/poor illustrate,, this comment is more likely proper comment, therefore rule can represent that long comment is unlikely rubbish message.Complaint analysis device 324 can compare the length of comment/comment and defined one or more threshold value, and if this length exceedes threshold value, comment/comment can may be more fraudulent.Complaint analysis device 324 can use for identifying various routines and the algorithm etc. that comment is likely rubbish message.For example, these routines and algorithm etc. can utilize for example, model after training (, machine learning) to detect dissimilar rubbish message.As a concrete example, routine and algorithm etc. can detect the rubbish message of common type, for example, point out the link of the website (for example, adult and medicine website) of particular type.As another concrete example, it is only the user account creating for the object of spam that routine and algorithm etc. can detect, and the comment being associated with these accounts is very likely fraudulent.Complaint analysis device 324 can generate the suspection score of comment/comment.If suspect be divided into defined threshold value more than, complaint analysis device 324 can generate and represent that current comment/comment is the M signal that fraudulent possibility improves.Can generate and export with this M signal and represent that current suggestion is fraudulent test result (for example, 330).
Complaint analysis device 324 can detect closely similar consumers' opinions.Closely similar (for example with another (or some other) consumers' opinions, in defined threshold value) consumers' opinions (for example, grading, comment, comment, abuse mark, share, like ,+1 or other social networks interaction etc.) may represent that this consumers' opinions too repeats and improper.Complaint analysis device 324 can compare current suggestion and the one or more suggestions (for example, the suggestion of storage/record in suggestion information log 322) that previously received.Can determine the general character between suggestion by various information/data below for example checking and that suggestion is associated: the content/text of comment/comment (for example, the general character of the word using in comment), the length of comment/comment, grading (for example, [integer] star that [maximum integer] is following), the IP address that suggestion stems from, the geographic position that suggestion stems from, account information (for example, account's age) and the various out of Memory being associated with the user who inputs this suggestion.As the concrete example of the general character between the content/text of comment/comment, for example, if (there is the word of repetition dubiously between multiple comment/comments, same or analogous comment occurs repeatedly), this may represent that these comment/comments are fraudulent.Complaint analysis device 324 can consider that one or more information in above-mentioned information are to determine the general character between suggestion.As a concrete example, whether can how to judge two suggestions " too similar " about complaint analysis device 324, complaint analysis device 324 can unanimously generate general character score based on how many information between these two suggestions.If previously suggestion be for the current user who is of the same mind and/or identical application program, general character score can increase.If more than general character must be divided into defined threshold value, complaint analysis device 324 can generate and represent that current suggestion is the M signal that fraudulent possibility improves.Can generate and export with this M signal and represent that current suggestion is fraudulent test result (for example, 330).
Complaint analysis device 324 can be considered the distribution of grading.User's grading can be certain numerical value of a greatest measure " following ".For example, user's grading can be [1-5] star or the second value below the first greatest measure (integer/decimal) in 5 stars.Can utilize each that represent such as the icon of magnitude that user grades to increase progressively (for example a, integer).Multiple users can submit the user's grading for application-specific (or game or film or developer etc.) to, and can (for example carry out polymerization to the user's grading from multiple users, be averaging) for example, for example, to create overall user's grading, same greatest measure " with interior " numerical value (integer or decimal) (, 3.5 stars in 5 stars).The distribution of the grading in one group of relevant grading (for example,, for the grading of same application or from same user's grading) may represent that grading is wrongful.For example, for example, if one group of grading comprised that volume (, more than determined number percent) maximum (for example grade, 5 stars) or minimum grading is (for example, 1 star), comprise that with grading group the situation of the more typical distribution (for example, each grading value of particular percentile) of grading compares, this group grading may be suspicious in essence.In addition, the grading current or that just importing into being associated with suspicious grading group may be suspicious.Complaint analysis device 324 can judge whether grading current or that just importing into is suspicious, and can generate the M signal that the current grading of expression is fraudulent possibility raising.Can use this M signal to generate and export and represent that current suggestion is fraudulent test result (for example, 330).
The mark (fraction) of the quantity of download/installation that complaint analysis device 324 can be considered as the quantity of consumers' opinions application program.Complaint analysis device 324 can be (for example, for each application program and/or for each user) calculate or (for example maintain consumers' opinions, grading, comment, comment, abuse mark, share, like ,+1 or other social networks interaction etc.) quantity with respect to the ratio of the quantity of the download/installation of the application program the being associated mark of this quantity (, as).Idea can be that in fact the sub-fraction user of download/set up applications takes time grade or evaluate application program.This application program if each use of download application-specific is graded per family, this may represent dirty tricks.Equally, if specific user grades or evaluates each application program that this user downloads/installs, this may represent dirty tricks.Alternatively, this may represent that this user enlivens very much, and this may not be problem.Therefore, can find out, the various signal/factors of polymerization can avoid overemphasizing any signal/factor as described herein.Complaint analysis device 324 can compare to judge that whether the ratio of suggestion is too high by calculated ratio and threshold value.For example, the research that this threshold value can be based on following or the statistics calculating, it shows in the user of down load application program only user's grading of 10% and/or comments on this application program.Complaint analysis device 324 for example can compare calculated ratio and the ratio of the suggestion for other application program or user, for example, to judge whether active user or application program far exceed the average ratio of other application/user (, exceeding determined threshold value).Complaint analysis device 324 (for example can judge grading/comment current or that importing into, exceed outside tolerance interval because this grading/comment makes calculated suggestion ratio) whether be suspicious, and can generate the M signal that the current grading/comment of expression is fraudulent possibility raising.Can generate and export with this M signal and represent that current suggestion is fraudulent test result (for example, 330).
Complaint analysis device 324 can use sign to be combined and to consider with consumers' opinions various client terminal devices.For example, complaint analysis device 324 (or some other modules of duplicity suggestion detecting device 306) can receive use information from client terminal device 326.Use information can comprise whether and when application program collapses, and when whether application program install and/or the sign of startup etc. and other use sign.Can how to utilize an example of use information as complaint analysis device, if suggestion comprise about the how always complaint of collapse but complaint analysis device never receives any collapse report of application program, this may to speak be fraudulent.As another example, never start this application program if suggestion comprises the comment relevant with application program, this may to speak be fraudulent.
Complaint analysis device 324 can detect suspicious submission moment or submission amount pattern.As an example, complaint analysis device 324 can detect submission amount and/or the high suggestion of frequency.Complaint analysis device 324 for example can be in response to submission current or that importing into, for each user and/or each application program analyze suggestion (for example, grading, comment, comment, abuse mark, share, like ,+1 or other social networks interaction etc.).Complaint analysis device 324 for example can detect unique user and whether submitted the suggestion of a large amount (for example,, more than defined threshold value) to and/or whether for example, inputted suggestion to cross high-frequency (, more than defined threshold value).As a concrete example, if user has submitted the grading for 1,000 application program in one day, user's grading is likely fraudulent.Complaint analysis device 324 can judge whether grading/comment current or that importing into (for example, due to high trading volume/ratio) is suspicious, and can generate the M signal that the current grading/comment of expression is fraudulent possibility raising.Can generate and export with this M signal and represent that current suggestion is fraudulent test result (for example, 330).
As detecting suspicious submission moment or another example of submission amount pattern, complaint analysis device 324 can compare current suggestion and the one or more suggestions (for example, the suggestion of storage/record in suggestion information log 322) that previously received.Complaint analysis device 324 can be checked the temporal information relevant with the suggestion previously receiving (for example, with when receive the relevant timestamp of suggestion).Complaint analysis device 324 can the detection suspicious submission moment relevant with application program and/or user.For example, if specific user makes grading to extensive application program one by one, this may represent that these suggestions are fraudulent.As another example, if application-specific receives a large amount of suggestions one by one, this may represent that these suggestions are fraudulent.Complaint analysis device 324 can use known " normally " amount of suggestion or frequency to judge whether detected pattern or suggestion are suspicious.Complaint analysis device 324 (for example can detect a series of suggestions, the Y[time period] in X[integer or decimal] individual suggestion) whether be greater than known or defined threshold value, and if exceeded this threshold value, complaint analysis device 324 can generate and represent that nearest suggestion is the M signal that fraudulent possibility improves.Can generate and export with this M signal and represent that current suggestion is fraudulent test result (for example, 330).
As detecting suspicious submission moment or another example of submission amount pattern, complaint analysis device 324 can detect the suspicious interval between suggestion.For example, if submit the each suggestion for application-specific to by each interval 5 minutes (or other fixed intervals) exactly, this may represent that these suggestions are fraudulent (for example, computing machine or machine may be inputted these suggestions).As another example, if submit the each suggestion from specific user to by each interval 5 minutes (or other fixed intervals) exactly, this may represent that these suggestions are fraudulent.Complaint analysis device 324 can detect submission more difficult analysis or nonrandom interval with more senior or intelligent detection algorithm.For example, if machine is pressed the continuous interval input suggestion changing, repeat after a period of time at these intervals, and complaint analysis device 324 also can detect the suspicious submission pattern of these kinds.Whether too complaint analysis device 324 can be by for example, to submitting order-assigned robotization to assign to detect submission pattern " robotization " (, repetition or some other nonrandom patterns) to.In the situation that robotization score exceedes defined threshold value, complaint analysis device 324 can generate and represent that nearest grading/comment is the M signal that fraudulent possibility improves.Can generate and export with this M signal and represent that current suggestion is fraudulent test result (for example, 330).
