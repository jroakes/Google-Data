- the present invention is related to the commonly owned, co-pending U.S. patent applications, U.S. Ser. No. 10/600,014, filed Jun. 20, 2003, entitled, “Universal Annotation Management System” and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/757,792, filed Jan. 15, 2004, entitled “Maintaining Annotations For Distributed And Versioned Files” which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
- the present invention generally relates to annotation management, and more particularly, to managing and displaying annotations for multiple versions of data throughout the lifetime of the data.
- Peer review and comment is generally geared toward obtaining the explicit knowledge and input that each of the peers may provide to the work produce that will, in the end, help to generate a better work product.
- Some well known methods for capturing and storing explicit knowledge that may be obtained from a peer review-type situation includes using a computer system, computer generated databases, word-processor documents, text files, spread-sheets, and many other formats that are commonly used for storing and retrieving data.
- tacit knowledge is knowledge that is not made explicit. It may be highly personal, is oftentimes very transient, and usually requires joint, shared activities to be transmitted. Examples of tacit knowledge include subjective insights, intuitions, facts learned from conversational exchanges, and hunches. Despite its highly valuable quality, tacit knowledge is often only temporarily captured, for example, as cryptic notes in a lab notebook, discussions, conversations, instant messaging exchanges, e-mails messages, and other transient communications. Thus, because it is typically not captured systematically, tacit knowledge is often lost and does not have an impact on the work product.
- any identifiable type of data appearing in a data source may be annotated, including, but not limited to a matrix of data, such as a spreadsheet or database table, a text document, an image, multi-media data, objects, and/or other forms of data.
- sub-portions of objects (sub-objects) or sub-portions of data may be annotated, for example, an individual cell, row or column in a database table or a page, section, paragraph or word in a document.
- An annotation system generally operates to store descriptive information about objects, or parts of objects, without modifying the objects themselves directly.
- An annotation store which is typically a database, stores descriptive information for an annotation, and an indexing scheme generally maps each annotation to the object, or position within the object.
- An advanced annotation system such as the one described in a commonly owned, co-pending application entitled “Universal Annotation Management System,” which may be found under U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/600,382, operates to store annotations separately from the corresponding data object and associates the annotations with an identifier that is location-independent. That is, the identifier does not depend on the location of a data source in a file system hierarchy or existence in a given database. Typically this identifier is derived from the document contents rather than from location artifacts such as filename, path, URL, etc.
- the words the annotation refers to may still be correct, but the surrounding text may change the content, and thereby make the comment inaccurate.
- a value may be annotated as being the highest value encountered.
- the original annotation will not be accurate, as the annotation was only correct in the context of the original document at its state when the comment was made.
- the present invention generally provides methods, systems, and articles of manufacture providing an annotation system that manages annotations created for different versions of a data source. Annotations created for one version of a data source may be viewed in context from both subsequent and prior versions of the same data source.
- Embodiments of the invention further provide an annotation method that includes the capability to display a plurality of annotations to a user viewing a current version of a document.
- the annotations may include both current and historic annotations.
- the method of the invention allows the user to select one of the historic annotations, and then the original document or data corresponding to the historic annotation will be displayed for review to the user.
- the display of the historic document or data may be compared directly to the current document or data in a suitable graphical user interface. Once the user is finished reviewing the historic annotation and the associated document or data, the user may return to annotating the current document or data.
- Embodiments of the invention further provide a program product configured to control or manage a computer system or network that implements an annotation system of the invention.
- the program product may control a word processing program, a spreadsheet program, an image editor, or other program configured to receive annotations.
- the program product is generally configured to display both current and historic annotations to the user, and further, to allow the user to link to the document or data that was originally associated with the historic annotation, i.e., allow the user to see the document that a previous user saw when making the historic annotation, which helps the current user to put the historic annotation in context in situations where the document text or data has changed.
- Embodiments of the invention further provide a method and system for displaying annotations is provided.
- the method includes displaying current data to a user through a GUI, displaying at least one of current and historic annotations to a user through the GUI, providing a user selectable link between the historic annotations and historic data associated with the historic annotation, and displaying the historic data to the user through the GUI when the user selectable link is activated by the user.

- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary GUI 300 for a word processing program with associated annotations.
- GUI 300 includes a data section 302 and an annotation section 304 .
- the data section 302 is configured to display data for annotation (annotated data), and may be a word processing platform, a spreadsheet program, an illustration presenter, an object display program, or any other program or graphical interface configured to display data to a user for review and annotation.
- annotation section 304 may be accessed or invoked from the data section 302 , e.g., through a “view annotations” button (not shown).
- annotations may be accessed via icons displayed at or near the annotated data.
- the annotation section 304 generally includes a display section 306 where both current and historic annotations are displayed.
- the annotations that are related to the current document or data displayed in the data section 302 are listed as current annotations 308 .
- Historic annotations are also listed and are indicated as being historic and not directly associated with the current document or data contents. For some embodiments, presentation of historic annotations may be enabled or disabled through, for example, a view historic annotations button.
- a current annotation 316 which is shown in an active or highlighted mode in FIG. 3 , is the annotation that the user is currently viewing or working with. For example, the user has selected a portion of the text or data 317 in the data section 302 , and has created or is viewing an annotation to the data 317 indicating that “change enables but does not require”, which as authored by A. Smith.
- the annotation package of the invention may attach several fields to the annotation. As illustrated in FIG. 3 , representative fields may include the time and date of the annotation and the author of the annotation, however, the invention is not intended to be limited to these particular fields, as any other field may be associated with the annotation.
- the annotated data 317 will generally be represented in the data section 302 in a different manner than un-annotated data, i.e., the annotated data 317 may be underlined, as shown in FIG. 3 , or alternatively, highlighted or associated with an annotation icon.
- the annotated data (historic and/or current) may be illustrated in a manner that indicates to the reader that there is an annotation associated with the data.
- an indication e.g., via a specially designed icon, shading, or the like
- the user may then select the annotated data (or icon) to view the annotations, which will generally be displayed separately from the annotated data itself.
- a hyperlink may be activated that causes the annotation(s) associated with the selected data to be displayed.
- the annotations to the data may be displayed in a separate annotation display window 304 .
- annotations associated with a document may be identified each time a user accesses a document, or in response to a user request to view annotations.
- Techniques for managing annotations are illustrated in detail in a commonly owned co-pending application entitled commonly owned, co-pending U.S. patent application, U.S. Ser. No. 10/600,014, filed Jun. 20, 2003, entitled, “Universal Annotation Management System” U.S. incorporated by reference in its entirety to the extent not inconsistent with the present invention.
- Annotations that are related to data from a previous document or data source are displayed in the annotation section 304 and are indicated as historic annotations 310 .
- historic annotation 310 a was created in relationship to a previous version (Version 1) of the current document or data displayed in the data section 302 , and as such, historic annotation 310 a has a historic indicator 312 associated therewith.
- historic annotation 310 b includes a historic indicator 312 .
- the historic indicators 312 may generally represent the version of the document or data that the annotation was related to.
- Embodiments of the invention may also include a user selectable field associated with the historic annotations.
- the user selectable field may be selected by the user to deactivate or remove the historic annotation associated with the selectable field. This allows the user to remove historic annotations from the annotation list, e.g., when an annotation is no longer applicable to the document or data.
- Embodiments of the invention further provide historic annotation data links 314 .
- a data link 314 may be selected by the user to view the version of the document or data for which the historic annotation 310 was created. For example, in the illustration of GUI 300 , the user is shown five annotations, where the last two annotations shown are historic annotations 310 a , 310 b . As such, the historic annotations were applied to a previous version of the document or data displayed in the data section 302 . If the user wants to view the document or data that the historic annotation was applied to, then the user may select the historic data link 314 , and the historic version of the document or data will be displayed in the data section 302 for review.
- This invention assumes availability of a system to match a current version of a document with historic versions of the document so that the historic versions may be accessed and viewed in conjunction with the relevant annotations.
- This might be either a pointer in to a document repository where the historic documents are stored, a naming convention that separates historic documents from current documents, or an integrated document tracking system in communication with the annotation system, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/600,014, which is incorporated by reference above.
- the annotation section 304 may further include annotation function selections 320 .
- the function selections 320 may be drop down menu items, as illustrated in FIG. 3 , and may include functions such as annotation searching, sorting, browsing, and annotation rules that may be selected for the annotation search and display functions.
- the function selections 320 allow the user to display the list of annotations in various forms and allow for the annotations to be sorted and/or filtered according the date, version, author, or any other field associated with the annotations.
- the user may use the annotation section 304 and function selections 320 to preview annotations for the current document and previous versions of the document, as illustrated in FIG. 3 , without opening the previous documents.
- the function may also allow a user to select current existing (saved) annotations and apply them to a current version of a document.
- the function selections 320 allow for implementation of annotation policies, which may then be used to determine which annotations are migrated from one version to another, i.e., which annotations remain applicable to the current version of the document or data.
- the function selections 320 also allow the user to select an option where the annotation list will indicate whether the annotation is verified for the current version, and how many versions the annotation has been applied to. The utilization of such policies is described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/757,792, entitled “Maintaining Annotations For Distributed And Versioned Files,”which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety to the extent not inconsistent with the present invention.
- annotations associated with the document or data may be stored either with the document being annotated or external to the document being annotated.
- one embodiment of this invention provides that the annotations may be marked when the text or data associated with the annotation has been changed. For example, when an annotation suggests a change to text and an author makes the change, the invention allows the user to select a field in the annotation section 304 that will mark or indicate that the annotation is no longer applicable to the current stage of the document.
- the annotation may be saved and viewed as a historic annotation, the annotation may not be presented in the annotation section if desired, once the annotation has been addressed, for example.
- annotations may be stored separately in annotation store 130
- the annotations may be stored with a document, e.g., embedded in the document or data.
- the annotations are simultaneously loaded. More particularly, as the document loads, the embedded annotations are stripped from the document and assembled in the annotation section 304 for presentation to the user.
- the historic annotations when historic annotations are viewed, the historic document may be opened and the embedded historic annotations may be stripped from the document and presented to the user in a separate annotation section 304 .
- annotations may be stored externally to the document, e.g., in a separate file that is associated with the annotated document or data file.
- a link between the new document and annotations (which may be based on identifiers such as contents hash, GUIDs stored within the document, differing file named, etc.) existing on the original document are generally severed. How this is accomplished depends upon the nature of the link. For example, if the link is based on the contents of the document or data, then no explicit action is generally required, as the changed contents will have implicitly severed the link.
- the invention requires that the system know of the changing document and ensure that either: 1) the document identifier used for annotation linking is changed for the changed document (for example, a new document management system identifier is created); or 2) the annotations currently associated with an unchanging document identifier are marked as no longer applicable.
- Embodiments of the invention further include a method for associating versions of a document with one another.
- the annotation system of the invention may be configured to store links between documents (based on identifiers such as a contents hash, a global unique identifier (GUID) stored within the document, differing file names, etc.) in a relational store.
- the annotation system may be configured to integrate with a document-version management system that provides similar functionality. In either case, when a document is opened, the annotation system is queried both for annotations on the document being opened and also for annotations on any previous or historic versions of the document.
- the annotations found from the query against previous versions are presented visually differently in the list of all annotations and are generally not marked up in the document.
- the annotation system may be configured to display annotations or data for comparison. For example, when a user is reviewing a current document and annotating the document, the user may view previous annotations to the document. The user may select a historic annotation and view the historic document that the historic annotation applies to. Further, this embodiment of the invention allows the user to also display the historic document in the GUI at the same time with the current document for comparison purposes. As such, the user may see the historic document and any changes that have been made to the document since the historic version was created. This is a valuable tool for tracking and identifying revisions or progress on a document or data source.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a flowchart of the annotation method of the invention.
- the annotation method of the invention begins at step 400 , where the data and annotation information is displayed in a GUI, such as the GUI illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the data section of the GUI is configured to receive additional annotations from the current user.
- Annotations may be received from users, such as Users I, II, and III in FIG. 1 in the annotation manager 140 .
- the annotations may be indexed and stored in the annotation store 130 , as desires. Any new annotations, along with historic annotations, are displayed to the user in the GUI illustrated in FIG. 3 , for example.
- the new annotations added by the current user are associated with one or more fields and indexed in the annotation list or store.
- the associated fields are generally used to store, sort, filter, search, etc. the annotations, and may include information such as author, time, date, business title, importance or relevance of the annotation, etc.
- the GUI of the annotation method displays both current annotations to the document or data, along with historic annotations to the current document and previous versions of the document, as illustrated in annotation section 304 in FIG. 3 .
- the annotation data may be stored separate from the data or document, or alternatively, it may be stored as embedded information in the document or data.
- the user may select one of the annotations and request that the system of the invention display the associated text or data.
- the method of the invention determines if the selected data or text is historic or current. If the data is not historic, i.e., the data is current, then the method continues to step 406 , where the GUI continues to display the current data that is associated with the non-historic annotations.
- the method of the invention links to a previous version of the document where the historic annotation was made.
- the historic version of the document associated with the historic annotation is displayed to the user at step 407 for review.
- the historic version of the document may be displayed in the data section 302 of the GUI illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the user may review the text of the historic document or data in the form it was presented when the annotation was added by another user, which gives the current user the same context as the historic annotator had at the time the annotation was created.
- the user is viewing the historic data related to the historic annotation, and the user has the option to compare the historic version of the data to the current version. If comparison is selected by the user, the method of the invention may display the historic version of the data and the current version of the data in the same GUI to the user at step 409 . If the user doesn't want to do a data comparison, then the method of the invention may continue to step 410 , where the GUI returns to the current document or data display.
