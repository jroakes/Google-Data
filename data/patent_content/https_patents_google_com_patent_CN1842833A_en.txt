Description
1. background technology
1.1 technical field
The present invention relates to advertise.The invention particularly relates to the mode of advertisement being presented to its audient.
1.2 correlation technique
Use for example TV, radio broadcasting, the advertisement of the traditional media of newspaper and magazine is well-known.Unfortunately, even preparation supposes that with rational fully advertiser recognizes that still its mass advertising budget only is a kind of waste relevant for the demographic studies of the typical audience of various medium markets.In addition, be difficult to discern and get rid of this waste.
Recently, the advertisement of being undertaken by more interactively medium is more and more universal.For example, along with the number of internet usage increases rapidly, the potential strong mode that the good medium that provide by the internet and service become advertisement is provided in advertiser.
Advertiser has developed the value maximization of some strategies in the hope of this advertisement.In a strategy, advertiser use popular appearance interactive media is provided or the means of service (in instructions, be known as " Web website " and be without loss of generality) as the channel that obtains a large amount of audients.Use this first scheme, advertiser can be on the homepage of for example New York Times Web website or USA Today Web website placing advertisement.In another strategy, advertiser can attempt its advertisement as the spectators' of close limit target more, thereby increases the possibility of audient's active response.For example, the agency that goes sightseeing of propaganda Costa Rican rainforest can be on eco-tour (ecotourism-travel) sub-directory of Yahoo Web website placing advertisement.The artificial usually definite this target of advertiser.
Regardless of strategy, often present to its advertising audience with the form of " web page banner " (that is the rectangle frame that, comprises the figure composition) based on the advertisement (also being known as " Web advertisement ") of Web website.When the member of commercial audience (be known as " beholder " or " user " in instructions and be without loss of generality) selected in these web page banner one by clicking this advertisement, embedded hypertext link was directed to the beholder gray Web website usually.This wherein the beholder select the process of advertisement to be commonly referred to as " click " (" click " is used to contain Any user and selects.)。The ratio of the touching quantity of advertisement and space of a whole page quantity (that is display ads number of times) is commonly referred to as " clicking rate " of advertisement.When the user finishes the issued transaction of the advertisement that relates to previous service, just claim to have taken place " conversion ".The content that constitutes conversion can be different because of the difference of situation, and can determine in every way.For example, can be such situation, wherein click and be known as the advertisement of the gray Web page, and before leaving that Web page, finish there when buying the user, change.Alternatively, conversion just can be defined as being user's display ads, and the user in the given time (for example, 7 days) on the gray Web page, buy.In another candidate, advertiser can define be converted to any measurable/observable user operation, for example, download white paper, at least browse the designated depth of Web website, at least watch the Web page of some, on a Web website or the Web page, spend time of predetermined quantity or the like at least.Usually, if completed purchase is not indicated in user's operation, be not limited thereto although then constitute user's operation of conversion, it can indicate sales lead (sales lead).In fact, many other relevant definition that constitute the content of conversion can be arranged.The ratio of the conversion quantity of advertisement and space of a whole page quantity (that is display ads number of times) is commonly referred to as conversion ratio.If conversion is defined as and can takes place in the schedule time that begins since advertising service, then one of conversion ratio may define and can a consideration serve the advertisement that surpasses the schedule time in the past.
No matter, based on the precondition of the advertisement of Web website how existing scheme still has some problems.Although advertiser can touch a large amount of audients, they often are discontented with the repayment that is intended to its investment in advertising.Some people has attempted being accustomed to improving the advertisement performance by following the tracks of user's online, but this scheme causes privacy concern.

Therefore, still need to use the mode of more effectively advertising of interactive media and service, comprising by the correlativity and/or its mode to the economic worth of advertiser and/or Advertisement Server that increase itself and viewer provides service to advertisement.
