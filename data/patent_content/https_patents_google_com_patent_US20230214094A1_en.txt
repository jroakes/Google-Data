Definitions
- a web browser can be used to display content that is searched via a search engine. Content can be displayed within the web browser in response to selection of one or more of the search results by a user.
- a method can include triggering a search query of the search area and causing display of a search result area that overlays the display area (e.g., content window, tab content window) of the browser.
- the search result area represents a window (area) outside of the display area but still within the browser.
- the search request area including one or more related searches displayed as search request indicators can be generated in response to selection of a search area included in a webpage displayed within a display area of a browser.
- the search result area may include a query determined for (a search performed for) the search area.
- the search result area can include one or more related search requests (i.e., related queries), for the determined query.
- the search result area can include text that identifies the query determined for the search area.
- the one or more related search requests may be represented in the search result area by search request indicators, e.g., a first search request indicator and a second search request indicator within the search result area.
- the determined query may be represented by one of the search request indicators.
- the search result area can include a navigation area where a search result page is displayed and can be interacted with. Interaction with (selection of) a search request indicator can change the content of the navigation area without changing the search request indicators.
- FIGS. 1 A through 1 E are diagrams that illustrate rendering of content within a display area, a search result area, and a navigation area of a browser, according to an implementation.
- FIGS. 2 A through 2 C are diagrams that illustrate another implementation related to rendering of content within a display area, a search result area, and a navigation area of a browser, according to an implementation.
- FIGS. 3 A through 3 D are diagrams that illustrate another implementation related to rendering of content within a display area, a search result area, and a navigation area of a browser, according to an implementation.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram that illustrates a computing system and search server for implementing the concepts described herein.
- FIGS. 5 A and 5 B are flowcharts illustrating an example process for rendering of content within a display area, a search result area, and a navigation area of a browser, according to an implementation.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example process for determining related search requests for a search of selected content within a display area, according to an implementation.
- FIG. 7 shows an example of a generic computer device and a generic mobile computer device, which may be used with the techniques described herein.
- This disclosure is related to navigation of content associated with search results (or indicators thereof) retrieved in response to a selected search area. More specifically, this disclosure relates to providing a searched (main) query and one or more additional related search queries (related search requests) for a search area.
- the search area represents content of a webpage selected by a user of a browser.
- the search area can represent non-anchor text, or in other words, text that is not part of a link.
- the searched query and the one or more related search requests can be represented as actionable search request indicators in a search result area.
- the one or more related search requests can be represented as actionable search request indicators but the searched query is not represented as an actionable search request indicator in the search result area.
- the search result area may overlay (obscure, displace) the webpage from which the search area was selected.
- the browser may initiate a request for a search of the selected text.
- the browser may also provide an identifier (e.g., location, URL, URI, etc.) for the webpage, context for the selected text, and/or a quantity of related queries (related search requests) to include in the response to the request.
- the search server may determine a query for the search area. This query selected by the search server is referred to as the searched query or the main query.
- the search server may also provide a number (e.g., one, two, etc.) of related queries.
- the related queries represent other queries that were not searched but are also relevant to the search area.
- the search server may use the webpage identifier and the number of (quantity of) related queries to rank and select related queries. In some implementations, no more than the requested quantity of related queries are returned. In some implementations, related queries that have fewer characters are favored in the ranking.
- the search server may provide the searched query, a search result page for the searched query, and one or more related queries in a response to the request that is provided to the browser.
- the response provided by the search server to the browser is thus related to a search area selected from content within a webpage.
- the content can include all of the text visible to the user, and can extend beyond what's visible.
- the selection of text that the user chooses can be prioritized in the consideration of appropriate related searches.
- the response can include a search result page.
- the response can include related search requests.
- the related search requests can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser while a search result page and the related search requests are displayed.
- the related search requests can be provided as interactive indicators (e.g., buttons, links, a selectable area/image, etc.), which are maintained (e.g., persist) in the search result area.
- At least one of the search requests can be selected, and content associated with selected search request (i.e., a search result page) can be displayed in the search result area while maintaining the webpage in the browser display area.
- content associated with the search request e.g., a search result page
- the search request indicators can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) even as the content of a navigation area of the search result area changes.
- the search request indicators enable navigation of the content without losing the context of the searched query.
- the browser can be referred to as a browser window when associated with a window of an operating system (OS).
- OS operating system
- a technical problem associated with content in a webpage is that even after content to be searched within the webpage is identified, the content within the webpage may not be maintained during a search unless a separate browser, tab, or application is used. Where the user selects an area of the content, it also may not be apparent what search (query) the user intends, as some disambiguation is involved. For example, content within a webpage can be copied for searching, and the webpage can be replaced with a search engine interface, or a separate browser or tab can be used to search the content. Computing resources, such as memory, bandwidth, and battery, are consumed when the user submits multiple queries or must open new tabs to perform a search.
- At least one technical solution to the technical problems described above is that a search result can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, along with related search requests so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser in a separate display area while the search results and related search requests are displayed.
- At least one technical effect of this technical solution is that the original webpage content is not lost while the search results are consumed.
- Another technical effect of this technical solution is that a user can submit additional queries to get additional search results while maintaining the original webpage content and maintaining the original search context (e.g., the searched query/main query).
- the related search requests can be selected to optimize the limited display area of a mobile device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, glasses, smartwatch, etc.) and minimize keystrokes and gestures for performing multiple searches.
- search results within a search result area and webpage content within a display area can be simultaneously displayed within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser) and multiple searches performed with minimal input from the user.
- a search result area can be integrated as part of the browser so that the search result area may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by a third party or the owner of the webpage content.
- This can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search query from search results that can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of the webpage. Accordingly, the technical problem of spoofing search results can be obviated by the technical solution of integrating a search result area within the browser as described above.
- the technical effect of integration of a search result area within a browser is that spoofing can be prevented.
- search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) in a search result area even as the content of the search results are displayed.
- the content associated with the search results can be displayed within a navigation area simultaneously within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser). Accordingly, the technical problem of enabling to simultaneously navigate content associated with search results while viewing the search results in a search result area is solved by the technical solution and technical effect described above.
- the implementations described herein enable improved guided human-machine interactions for viewing webpages on the one side and for performing different queries on the viewed webpages and displaying the respective search results on the other side.
- the viewing of the webpages and performing the queries with viewing their results is done simultaneously by using one user interface only. This saves processing resources for maintaining and managing different user interfaces required for viewing a webpage and then for performing queries on the webpage and viewing the respective query results. This also results in fewer interactions of the user with the user interface.
- different queries may be executed with regard to a selected search area of the webpage and their results may be easily acquired and viewed by using one user interface only.
- a browser may handle the related search requests without requiring further extensive communication with the server.
- the user may easily switch between different requests and their results and view the webpage at the same time in the same interface. This improves the user's interaction with the web page.
- the browsers described herein can be executed within a computing device.
- the browsers can be executed within a laptop device.
- the browsers can be executed within a mobile device.
- many of the implementations shown and described herein are shown in portrait mode, any of the implementations described herein can be rendered in a landscape mode.

- An address e.g., uniform resource locator (URL)
- URL uniform resource locator
- Other controls, icons, and/or so forth can be included in the address bar area 114 .
- the address bar area 114 can be controlled by and/or associated with the browser 110 (e.g., the browser application).
- the address bar area 114 can be controlled by the browser 110 instead of the webpage W 1 and/or a provider of the webpage W 1 .
- FIG. 1 B is a diagram that illustrates a search result area 150 that includes a search request area 130 (shown by a dashed box) triggered for display within the browser 110 .
- the search result area 150 can also be referred to as an overlay area or an overlay window.
- the search result area 150 (overlay window) can include a search request area 130 and a navigation area 140 .
- the search result area 150 in FIG. 1 B can be triggered in response to receiving a search area SA (e.g., text, image) of the content C 1 .
- the search area SA can also be referred to as a search area SA of the webpage W 1 .
- the search area SA in FIG. 1 A may be received in response to being selected (e.g., interacted with).

- the request for the search is triggered when the search area SA is or includes text.
- the request for the search is triggered when the search area SA is or includes an image.
- the request for the search is triggered when the selection area SA is not identified as actionable by the webpage W 1 .
- Content of a webpage is actionable when the webpage includes markup tags that pair selection of the content with an event.
- Anchor tags, tags with an onclick mouse event, etc. are examples of content that is actionable by the webpage W 1 .
- text or images that are already actionable (e.g., actionable text, actionable images) in the webpage W 1 may be selectable to perform that action, such as navigating to another webpage W 1 or initiating an action defined by the webpage W 1 .
- Content identified as actionable by the webpage may perform the action when selected and/or may, when selected/interacted with, cause display of a pop-up menu that includes the action identified by the webpage W 1 and/or other actions to perform (e.g., a pop up window that asks if the content associated with a link should be opened in a new tab, in a new browser window, the link copied to a clipboard, the link opened in an incognito window, etc.).
- the browser may not automatically override that action by automatically submitting a request for a search of the search area.
- the request for a search can be an option in the pop-up menu.
- the browser may automatically, i.e., without further interaction from the user, submit a request to search the content represented by the search area.
- the search request can be triggered by a user of, for example, a mobile device via a search of the content in the search area SA (e.g., a text search, an image search, and/or so forth).
- the request for the search can be triggered in response to the selection of the search area SA being completed.
- the request for the search (which is based on the search area SA) can be triggered in response to a long press selection (e.g., selection of the search area for a threshold period of time) of the search area SA.
- a user interface for triggering the search query based on search area SA can be used.
- the search request includes content of the search area.
- the content of the search area may include at least one of the following: text or one or more images.
- the search request can include an identifier for the webpage W 1 (e.g., an address, such as a URL or URI).
- the search request can include context from the content C 1 of the webpage W 1 .
- the context can include text located near the search area SA (e.g., within a number of words before and/or after the search area, within a number of pixels, within a DOM node with, etc.).
- the search request can include a quantity (number) of related queries to return. In other words, the browser can, as part of the request, tell the server how many related queries to provide in the response.
- the browser may send the search request to a server, e.g., a search server.
- the search server receives the search request from the browser and determines a query for the content of the search area.
- the search server can use conventional techniques (e.g., natural language processing, entity identification, etc.) to determine the query.
- the search server may use the context, if provided, in determining the query.
- the search server may use the webpage identifier to determine the query.
- the query can comprise text, e.g., a word, a phrase, an acronym, etc.
- the text may include text identified in the (content of) the search area.
- the text may include text identified using the context.
- the text may include text using entity identification.
- the query can comprise an entity identifier. Where the search area includes an image, the query can comprise an image.
- the search server may generate a search result page for the query.
- the query determined by the search server for the search area may be referred to as a searched query or the main query.
- a search result page is a webpage generated by the search server in response to a query.
- a search result page includes a plurality of search results.
- a search result can be associated with an identifier for a resource that is considered responsive to the query.
- a search result can represent the resource.
- a resource can be any content accessible via the Internet, e.g., a webpage, a PDF file, an audio file, an image, a video file, a document, etc.
- a resource is accessible via an identifier, such as a URL, URI, etc.
- a search result includes a link to the resource, the link using the resource identifier.
- a search result can include text from the linked-to resource, e.g., a webpage title, a snippet (text extracted from the content of the resource), etc.
- a search result can include an image from the linked-to resource.
- a search result can be a rich answer, such as a knowledge panel, a short answer (e.g., a definition, an answer provided by a third-party app and triggered by queries that match a particular type of query), etc.
- the search result page can include other elements, such as advertisements, “people also asked” short answers, interactive rich answers, links for refining the query, etc., as is known.
- the search server may also determine related queries for the searched query.
- the related queries can be generated based on the search area SA, i.e., the content of the search area.
- the related queries can include queries considered for the searched query but not selected as the searched query.
- the related queries can be lower-ranked queries considered, but not selected as, the searched query.
- the related queries may be queries frequently (e.g., as determined by statistical analysis) submitted after the searched (main) query.
- the related queries can be generated based on the identifier (e.g., URL) for the webpage associated with the search area SA.
- the related queries can include a query for which the webpage is a top-ranked resource.
- the related queries can include a query frequently submitted before a user navigates to the webpage.
- the identifier may be used to identify queries that have responsive documents, including the document identified by the identifier, with shared passages.
- the related queries can also be referred to as related search requests.
- Potential (or candidate) related queries can be generated using conventional techniques.
- the search server may select some of the potential related queries to provide as part of a response to the search request.
- the search server may rank the potential (candidate) queries to identify selected related queries. If a quantity of related queries is provided to the search server as part of the search request, the search server may select that quantity of top-ranked related queries to return as part of a response to the search request.
- the search server can rank the related queries using conventional ranking factors.
- the search server can also use the location for the webpage W 1 to rank the related queries.
- the location of the webpage is not a conventional ranking factor for related queries because a webpage is not associated with search engine queries.
- Ranking factors include, e.g., semantic proximity of the suggestion to the highlighted text and how many times the suggestion follows the highlighted text.
- the search server may use the length (in characters) of a related query as a ranking factor. For example, related queries that are too long may be downranked because these related queries take up too much area on the display of the client. Thus, the search system may prefer shorter related search requests (shorter related queries) over longer related search requests (longer related queries).
- the search server may send a response to the search request back to the browser.
- the response can include the searched query, the search result page for the searched query, and at least one related search request (related query). In some implementations, no more than the requested quantity of related search requests are provided as part of the response to the search request.
- the search result area 150 is rendered within the browser 110 in FIG. 1 B .
- the search result area 150 includes search request area 130 .
- the search result area 150 overlays the display area 120 .
- the rendering of the search result area 150 causes the display area 120 to shrink in size.
- both the webpage W 1 is displayed (i.e., within the display area 120 ) and the search result area 150 is rendered within the browser 110 in FIG. 1 B .
- rendering of the search result area 150 may decrease the amount of content of the webpage W 1 visible in the display area 120 .
- the search result area 150 can include search request area 130 .
- the search request area 130 includes search request indicators 135 , labeled SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ in FIG. 1 B .
- the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can collectively be referred to as search request indicators 135 .
- the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can represent at least some of the related queries (related search requests) provided in the response from the server (other related queries provided may be associated with search request indicators that are not displayed in the search result area 150 but can be accessed via scrolling).
- the search request indicators 135 can be interacted with to request searches related to the search area SA.
- the search request indicators 135 represent actionable user interface elements.
- An actionable user interface element can be interacted with by the user to perform a programmed action.
- the action performed by a search request indicator 135 is submission of a search request to the search server, e.g., in the form of a query.
- a search request indicator can thus be associated with (generated for) one of the related search requests provided by the server.
- one of the search request indicators can be associated with (generated for) the searched query (the main query).
- the related search requests (e.g., related queries) can include a word (keyword), a phrase, and/or multiple words or phrases, e.g., so that interaction with a search request indicator requests a search for the word, phrase, etc.
- the related search requests can include/be an image, e.g., so that interaction with the search request indicator for the related search request requests a search for the image.
- the related search requests are provided by the search server as part of the response to the request to search the selected area SA.
- a first search request e.g., a search request submitted in response to interaction with SR 1 ′
- a second search request e.g., a search request submitted in response to interaction with SR 2 ′
- the searched query is not represented by (associated with) a search request indicator.
- the searched query may be represented in a query text area of the search result area 150 (e.g., as discussed with regard to FIGS. 3 A- 3 D ) and the first search request, e.g., a search request submitted in response to interaction with SR 1 ′, and the second search request are each for a different related search request provided by the server.
- the first search request e.g., a search request submitted in response to interaction with SR 1 ′
- the second search request are each for a different related search request provided by the server.
- one or more of the search request indicators 135 can include text. In some implementations, one or more of the search request indicators 135 can include images.
- the search request indicators 135 can include or can be a keyword/keywords that can be selected for retrieval of additional content (e.g., additional search result pages).
- additional search results can be navigated via the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′.
- the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can be interacted with to provide additional search results (e.g., via different search result pages), enabling a user to navigate to different search result content (different search result pages) without navigating away from the search result area 150 or the webpage W 1 .
- the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ may represent a subset of related queries surfaced in response to the search request for the search area.
- the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can be a rank-ordered (e.g., highest ranked) subset of related queries surfaced in response to the search request for the search area.
- one or more of the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can be prioritized so that the most relevant related searches (or a subset thereof) are rendered within the search request area 130 .
- the prioritization is based on a ranking order determined by the server.
- the searched query represents a highest-ranked search for the search area.
- additional search request indicators 135 can be surfaced in response to a search request for the search area SA.
- the additional search request indicators 135 may be viewed by scrolling through, or otherwise navigating through, the search request area 130 .
- the search request area 130 may include a carousel of search request indicators 135 .
- the additional related search requests can be viewed within the search request area 130 .
- the additional search request indicators 135 can be viewed by scrolling left and right within the search request area 130 .
- the size (e.g., a visible area) of the display area 120 (shown in FIG. 1 A ) is decreased.
- the visible portion of the display area 120 is decreased in size in response to the search result area 150 being displayed.
- the search result area 150 is an overlay, e.g., appears on top of the display area 120 .
- the search result area 150 can overlap with the webpage W 1 without modifying the scale of the webpage W 1 (e.g., partially overlay the webpage W 1 ).
- the webpage W 1 can be modified (e.g., scaled) in layout to fit (e.g., fit for display) into the display area 120 .
- the display area 120 shown in FIG. 1 A can be divided into the display area 120 and the search result area 150 as shown in FIG. 1 B .
- the combined areas of the display area 120 and the search result area 150 shown in FIG. 1 B can be the same as the area of the display area 120 as shown in FIG. 1 A .
- the combined areas of the display area 120 and the search result area 150 can be different from (e.g., smaller than, larger than) the area of the display area 120 .
- any background or theme applied to the address bar area 114 can flow into (and would be contiguous with) the search result area 150 .
- the contiguous background would be difficult for a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W 1 ) to imitate within an application of the browser 110 .
- the contiguous background or theme can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search query from search results that can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of the webpage.
- FIG. 1 C illustrates content C 2 (e.g., a search result webpage) rendered in a navigation area 140 within the search result area 150 .
- the content C 2 can be rendered in the navigation area 140 in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search request indicator SR 1 ′ in the search request area 130 .
- the navigation area 140 in this implementation, does not replace the display area 120 .
- the content C 2 displayed in the navigation area 140 in this implementation, is visible even while the webpage W 1 (and content C 1 ) is at least partially displayed in the display area 120 .

- a user may drag the top portion of the search result area 150 toward the display area 120 to view at least a portion of the content C 2 .
- the content C 2 could also be viewed by maximizing the search result area 150 .
- Maximizing the search result area 150 can be done, for example, by dragging a top portion of the search result area 150 toward the display area 120 . Maximizing the search result area 150 can also be done, for example, in response to selection of one of the search request indicators 135 . When the search result area 150 is in a maximized state it occupies more area than display area 120 but does not fully cover/overlay the display area 120 .
- the navigation area 140 can be used to consume (e.g., explore) the search results for the currently selected search request, i.e., the related search request represented by the most recently selected search request indicator of the search request indicators 135 .
- the searched query is considered the currently selected search request before any of the search request indicators 135 are selected.
- first content can be rendered in the navigation area 140 .
- second content can be rendered in the navigation area 140 instead of, or in addition to, the first content.
- the content can be navigated while the search results (e.g., search request indicator SR 1 ′) is maintained within the search request area 130 .
- the search request indicator SR 1 ′ is not displayed within the search request area 130 because the content C 2 corresponding to the search request indicator SR 1 ′ is already displayed. Accordingly, the search request indicator SR 1 ′ associated with content already displayed in the navigation area 140 may not be included in the search request area 130 . In some such implementations, text (or an image) corresponding to the search request indicator SR 1 ′ may be provided in a query title area of the search result area 150 , as discussed with regard to FIG. 3 B .
- interaction with (e.g., selection of) at least a portion (e.g., a link) of the content C 2 while the search request area 130 is shown can result in the search request area 130 being closed and a new browser tab opened.
- selection of a link in the content C 2 can cause the resource (e.g., webpage, file) associated with the link to open in a new tab of the browser.
- the display area 120 can be removed and the resource associated with the link can be expanded into the current tab (e.g., the entirety of the display area 120 of the browser 110 ) in response to selection of a link in the content C 2 . This can result in the search result area 150 being closed.
- selection of a link in the content C 2 can also cause display of a menu (e.g., a pop-up menu) with options for opening the resource associated with the link.
- a menu e.g., a pop-up menu
- interaction outside of the search result area 150 can result in the search result area 150 being closed.
- FIG. 1 D illustrates content C 3 (e.g., content of a search result page) rendered in a navigation area 140 within the search result area 150 of the browser 110 .
- the content C 3 is rendered in the navigation area 140 in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search request indicator SR 3 ′ in the search request area 130 .
- the navigation area 140 replaces the content C 2 within the navigation area 140 .
- the content C 3 displayed in the navigation area 140 replaces the content C 2 displayed in the navigation area 140 .
- the search request indicators 135 are shifted so that the search request indicator SR 3 ′ corresponding with the content C 3 is more centered within the search request area 130 .
- search request indicator SR 4 ′ is shown because search request indicator SR 3 ′ is shifted.
- Search request indicator SR 4 ′ may have been viewable via a scrolling input (e.g., right-to-left swipe or drag) in the search request area 130 prior to selection of the search request indicator SR 3 ′.
- a new web address can be input into input address area 113 of the address bar area 114 after the search request area 130 and the navigation area 140 are defined.
- a different webpage (not shown) can replace the webpage W 1 (or other content) in the navigation area 140 , while maintaining the search request indicators 135 in the search request area 130 .

- the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can be rendered in search request area 130 in FIG. 2 B in response to a selection of search area SA in FIG. 2 A .
- a handle 132 represented by a line
- associated with search request area 130 can be selected and used to move (e.g., drag) the search request area 130 in an upward direction (illustrated by direction A) to reveal (e.g., to generate) the navigation area 140 , as illustrated in FIG. 2 C .
- content C 2 associated with the search request indicator SR 1 ′ (which is the first search request indicator) can be rendered.
- content associated with at least one of the search request indicators 135 that is in focus e.g., centered within the search request area 130 , also referred to as the currently selected search request
- can be rendered within the navigation area 140 in response to movement of the search request area 130 e.g., movement of the handle 132 ).
- the location and/or shape of the search result area 150 can be different than shown herein.
- the search request area 130 and/or associated navigation area 140 can be smaller in size than shown.
- the search request area 130 and/or associated navigation area 140 can be included along a different side of the browser 110 (e.g., along a bottom portion, along a top portion, along the left side, and/or so forth).
- the search request area 130 (and/or associated navigation area 140 ) can float above (e.g., can be rendered in a window above) the display area 120 so that the display area 120 in FIG. 1 A is not decreased in size to the area of the display area 120 shown in FIG. 1 B .
- the search request area 130 can be a different shape (e.g., a circular shape) rather than a square or rectangular shape.
- the search request indicators 135 of SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ are arranged horizontally within the search request area 130 and can be navigated along a horizontal direction.
- the search request indicators SR 1 ′ through SR 3 ′ can be arranged within the search request area 130 in a different orientation (e.g., vertically).
- FIGS. 3 A through 3 D illustrate an alternate display implementation associated with the display area 120 and the search result area 150 (search request area 130 and navigation area 140 ).
- the search result area 150 includes a query text area 332 .
- the query text area 332 corresponds to the currently selected search request, or in other words, the search request in focus.
- the search request in focus corresponds to the searched query when the search result area 150 is initially displayed (rendered).
- the search request in focus can change based on interactions with the search request indicators 135 .
- the search result page currently displayed in the navigation area 140 corresponds to the search request in focus.
- the search request indicator SR 1 ′ corresponds to the searched query, so the query text area 332 includes text for the searched query.
- the search result area 150 e.g., as discussed with regard to FIG. 2 C
- the content of the navigation area 140 would be the search result page received for the searched query.
- the query text area 332 display area can include an image associated with the search request in focus.
- the search server sends an image for the searched query in the response to the request to search the search area.
- the image may be small (sized to occupy an area similar to a few lines of text in the search result area 150 ) and may be displayed with text in the query text area 332 above the search request area 130 .
- the image, if provided, is removed from the query text area 332 when the search result area 150 is maximized, conserving display area for additional content to be displayed in the navigation area 140 .
- the text in the query text area 332 corresponds to the related search request/searched query.
- FIG. 3 C illustrates changes to the search result area 150 in response to an interaction 305 with the search request indicator SR 3 ′.
- interaction with e.g., selection of
- the search request indicator SR 3 ′ can cause the search result area 150 to change size.
- the search result area 150 may be maximized, or in a maximized state in response to selection of the search request indicator SR 3 ′.
- selection of the search request indicator SR 3 ′ makes the related search request associated with SR 3 ′ the currently selected search request, or in other words the search request in focus. Accordingly, the content of the query text area 332 is changed to correspond to the related search request associated with the search request indicator SR 3 ′.
- a control 337 may be displayed.
- the control 337 when selected, may cause the browser to open the search result page for the search request in focus in a new tab or a new browser window.
- an appearance of the display area 120 may be modified. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3 C , the display area 120 may be shaded.
- selection of SR 3 ′ may submit a search request to the search server.
- the search request is a query that is represented by the related search request corresponding to SR 3 ′.
- the search server may thus return a search result page that corresponds to SR 3 ′ and display the search result page in the navigation area 140 , e.g., content C 3 .
- the user may decrease the size of the search result area 150 , e.g., by interacting with handle 132 .
- the user may drag handle 132 in toward the navigation area 140 , e.g., in the direction labeled B in FIG. 3 C .
- the browser may automatically change the currently selected search request, or in other words the search request in focus, to the searched query.
- the browser may change the query text area 332 to the text for the searched query and may change the content of the navigation area 140 to the search result page for the searched query, as illustrated in FIG. 3 D .
- the minimization threshold 338 may be a screen coordinate, e.g., a y-coordinate or an x-coordinate, that falls between the position of the handle 132 when the search result area 150 is in a maximized state and the position of the handle 132 when the search result area 150 is in a minimized state.
- the minimization threshold 338 may be closer to the position of the handle 132 when the search result area 150 is in the minimized state than to the position of the handle 132 when the 150 is in the maximized state.
- the search result area 150 When the search result area 150 is in a minimized state, the search result area 150 may only display the search request area 130 and, in implementations that include it, the query text area 332 . In other words, the navigation area 140 is not visible or is just barely visible when the search result area 150 is in the minimized state.

- the content is the search result page received in the response.
- the display of the content may include automatically maximizing the size of the search result area (e.g., displaying the search result area in a maximized state) so that at least a portion of the search result page for the searched query is visible.
- the display of the content may include submitting the related query to a search server and receiving a search result page for the related query, and displaying the search result page for the related query.
- the system may be configured to respond to one or more different inputs related to the search result area. For example, in step 550 , the system may receive an interaction (a selection, a tap, a click, etc.) outside of the search result area. In response to the receipt of this interaction, at step 552 , the search result area may be closed, or in other words, removed from the display area of the browser. As another example, in step 530 the system may receive a selection of a link in the navigation area (e.g., a selection of a link from the search result page currently displayed in the navigation area of the search result area).
- a selection of a link in the navigation area e.g., a selection of a link from the search result page currently displayed in the navigation area of the search result area.
- the system may receive selection of a control in the search result area configured to open the search result page currently displayed in the navigation area to a new tab.
- the system may create the new tab and display the content of the navigation area (the search result page for the search request in focus) in the new tab.
- the system may receive an interaction with a handle of the search result area.
- the interaction may be a dragging of the handle, which changes a size of the search result area displayed in the browser.
- the system may monitor the location (coordinates) of the handle during the drag and, at step 542 , determine whether the coordinates meet a minimization threshold (e.g., minimization threshold 338 of FIG. 3 C ). Responsive to determining that a coordinate of the handle does meet the minimization threshold and when the content in the navigation area is not content from the search results for the searched query, at step 544 , the system may replace the content in the navigation area with content from the search result page for the searched query, e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 3 D .
- a minimization threshold e.g., minimization threshold 338 of FIG. 3 C
- the system may receive an interaction for (a selection of a particular search request indicator.
- the particular search request indicator can be any of the search request indicators displayed in the search result area.
- the system may, at step 524 , send the query that corresponds to the particular search request indicator to a search server.
- the system receives, in response to the request, a search result page for the query.
- the system causes display of content from the search result page for the query in the navigation area of the search result area.
- the query associated with the particular search request indicator may then be considered the current search request or the search request in focus.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart that illustrates a method 600 of performing at least some of the concepts described herein in the various figures. Many elements of the method 600 can be implemented by the components shown in at least FIG. 4 .
- the method 600 can be performed by a server system (e.g., search server 440 ).

- the system may use known or later developed techniques for selecting the searched query.
- the system may, at step 606 , obtain a search result page for the searched query.
- the system may determine one or more related search requests for the search area. These related search requests can also be referred to as candidate related queries.
- the system may rank the candidate related queries at step 610 .
- the ranking may be dependent on a number of factors, including the identifier of the webpage.
- the ranking can also or instead use a length of the candidate related queries as a ranking factor.
- the system may select highest-ranked candidate related queries.
- the number of selected candidate queries can be based on the quantity received with the request to search the search area.
- the system provides the query, the selected related search request(s), and the search result page for the query to the browser as a response to the request.

Abstract
A device may, in response to selection of a search area included in a webpage displayed within a display area of a browser: request a search for content of the search area, receive a searched query, a search result page for the searched query, and a related search request, and cause display of a first search request indicator and a second search request indicator within a search result area outside of the display area and within the browser. A device may receive a selection of the first search request indicator. A device may, in response to the selection of the first search request indicator, cause display of content for the first search request indicator within a navigation area of the search result area.
Description
- This application is a non-provisional of, and claims the benefit of, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/266,294, filed on Dec. 31, 2021, entitled “METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RELATED SEARCH WITHIN A BROWSER,” the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- A web browser can be used to display content that is searched via a search engine. Content can be displayed within the web browser in response to selection of one or more of the search results by a user.
- In one general aspect, a method can include triggering a search query of the search area and causing display of a search result area that overlays the display area (e.g., content window, tab content window) of the browser. The search result area represents a window (area) outside of the display area but still within the browser. The search request area, including one or more related searches displayed as search request indicators can be generated in response to selection of a search area included in a webpage displayed within a display area of a browser. The search result area may include a query determined for (a search performed for) the search area. The search result area can include one or more related search requests (i.e., related queries), for the determined query. In some implementations, the search result area can include text that identifies the query determined for the search area. The one or more related search requests may be represented in the search result area by search request indicators, e.g., a first search request indicator and a second search request indicator within the search result area. In some implementations, the determined query may be represented by one of the search request indicators. The search result area can include a navigation area where a search result page is displayed and can be interacted with. Interaction with (selection of) a search request indicator can change the content of the navigation area without changing the search request indicators.

FIG. 7 shows an example of a generic computer device and a generic mobile computer device, which may be used with the techniques described herein. - This disclosure is related to navigation of content associated with search results (or indicators thereof) retrieved in response to a selected search area. More specifically, this disclosure relates to providing a searched (main) query and one or more additional related search queries (related search requests) for a search area. The search area represents content of a webpage selected by a user of a browser. The search area can represent non-anchor text, or in other words, text that is not part of a link. In some implementations, the searched query and the one or more related search requests can be represented as actionable search request indicators in a search result area. In some implementations, the one or more related search requests can be represented as actionable search request indicators but the searched query is not represented as an actionable search request indicator in the search result area. The search result area may overlay (obscure, displace) the webpage from which the search area was selected. Upon selection of the search area, the browser may initiate a request for a search of the selected text. As part of the request for the selected text, the browser may also provide an identifier (e.g., location, URL, URI, etc.) for the webpage, context for the selected text, and/or a quantity of related queries (related search requests) to include in the response to the request. The search server may determine a query for the search area. This query selected by the search server is referred to as the searched query or the main query. The search server may also provide a number (e.g., one, two, etc.) of related queries. The related queries represent other queries that were not searched but are also relevant to the search area. In some implementations, the search server may use the webpage identifier and the number of (quantity of) related queries to rank and select related queries. In some implementations, no more than the requested quantity of related queries are returned. In some implementations, related queries that have fewer characters are favored in the ranking. The search server may provide the searched query, a search result page for the searched query, and one or more related queries in a response to the request that is provided to the browser.
- The response provided by the search server to the browser is thus related to a search area selected from content within a webpage. The content can include all of the text visible to the user, and can extend beyond what's visible. The selection of text that the user chooses can be prioritized in the consideration of appropriate related searches. The response can include a search result page. The response can include related search requests. The related search requests can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser while a search result page and the related search requests are displayed. Also, the related search requests can be provided as interactive indicators (e.g., buttons, links, a selectable area/image, etc.), which are maintained (e.g., persist) in the search result area. At least one of the search requests (a search request indicator) can be selected, and content associated with selected search request (i.e., a search result page) can be displayed in the search result area while maintaining the webpage in the browser display area. In some implementations, the content associated with the search request (e.g., a search result page) can be presented in a new tab. The search request indicators can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) even as the content of a navigation area of the search result area changes. Thus, the search request indicators enable navigation of the content without losing the context of the searched query. The browser can be referred to as a browser window when associated with a window of an operating system (OS).
- A technical problem associated with content in a webpage, is that even after content to be searched within the webpage is identified, the content within the webpage may not be maintained during a search unless a separate browser, tab, or application is used. Where the user selects an area of the content, it also may not be apparent what search (query) the user intends, as some disambiguation is involved. For example, content within a webpage can be copied for searching, and the webpage can be replaced with a search engine interface, or a separate browser or tab can be used to search the content. Computing resources, such as memory, bandwidth, and battery, are consumed when the user submits multiple queries or must open new tabs to perform a search.
- At least one technical solution to the technical problems described above is that a search result can be displayed within a search result area of the browser, along with related search requests so that the content of the webpage is maintained (e.g., persists) in the browser in a separate display area while the search results and related search requests are displayed. At least one technical effect of this technical solution is that the original webpage content is not lost while the search results are consumed. Another technical effect of this technical solution is that a user can submit additional queries to get additional search results while maintaining the original webpage content and maintaining the original search context (e.g., the searched query/main query). The related search requests can be selected to optimize the limited display area of a mobile device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, glasses, smartwatch, etc.) and minimize keystrokes and gestures for performing multiple searches. Thus, search results within a search result area and webpage content within a display area can be simultaneously displayed within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser) and multiple searches performed with minimal input from the user.
- In some implementations, a search result area can be integrated as part of the browser so that the search result area may not be spoofed (e.g., imitated) by a third party or the owner of the webpage content. This can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search query from search results that can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of the webpage. Accordingly, the technical problem of spoofing search results can be obviated by the technical solution of integrating a search result area within the browser as described above. The technical effect of integration of a search result area within a browser is that spoofing can be prevented.
- As mentioned above, in some implementations, search results can continue to be displayed (e.g., can be maintained, or can persist) in a search result area even as the content of the search results are displayed. The content associated with the search results can be displayed within a navigation area simultaneously within the browser (e.g., within a tab of the browser). Accordingly, the technical problem of enabling to simultaneously navigate content associated with search results while viewing the search results in a search result area is solved by the technical solution and technical effect described above.
- The implementations described herein enable improved guided human-machine interactions for viewing webpages on the one side and for performing different queries on the viewed webpages and displaying the respective search results on the other side. The viewing of the webpages and performing the queries with viewing their results is done simultaneously by using one user interface only. This saves processing resources for maintaining and managing different user interfaces required for viewing a webpage and then for performing queries on the webpage and viewing the respective query results. This also results in fewer interactions of the user with the user interface. Moreover, different queries may be executed with regard to a selected search area of the webpage and their results may be easily acquired and viewed by using one user interface only. Further, less communication between a browser and a server is required in the implementations described herein as, upon requesting a search for content of a search area of a web page, different request variants are considered at the server and the server provides to the browser data that relates not only to a searched (main) query but also to (possible) related search requests. The browser may handle the related search requests without requiring further extensive communication with the server. The user may easily switch between different requests and their results and view the webpage at the same time in the same interface. This improves the user's interaction with the web page.
- The browsers described herein can be executed within a computing device. For example, the browsers can be executed within a laptop device. In some implementations, the browsers can be executed within a mobile device. Although many of the implementations shown and described herein are shown in portrait mode, any of the implementations described herein can be rendered in a landscape mode.

FIG. 1A is a diagram that illustrates a webpage W1 displayed within adisplay area 120 of abrowser 110. In some implementations, thedisplay area 120 can be within a tab of thebrowser 110. As shown inFIG. 1A , the webpage includes content C1. The content C1 can include image content, textual content, and/or so forth. - As shown in
FIGS. 1A through 1E , thebrowser 110 includes anaddress bar area 114. An address (e.g., uniform resource locator (URL)) of the webpage W1 can be illustrated in the address bar area 114 (e.g., input address area 113). Other controls, icons, and/or so forth can be included in theaddress bar area 114. Theaddress bar area 114 can be controlled by and/or associated with the browser 110 (e.g., the browser application). Theaddress bar area 114 can be controlled by thebrowser 110 instead of the webpage W1 and/or a provider of the webpage W1. -
FIG. 1B is a diagram that illustrates asearch result area 150 that includes a search request area 130 (shown by a dashed box) triggered for display within thebrowser 110. Thesearch result area 150 can also be referred to as an overlay area or an overlay window. The search result area 150 (overlay window) can include asearch request area 130 and anavigation area 140. Thesearch result area 150 inFIG. 1B can be triggered in response to receiving a search area SA (e.g., text, image) of the content C1. The search area SA can also be referred to as a search area SA of the webpage W1. The search area SA inFIG. 1A may be received in response to being selected (e.g., interacted with). In some implementations, an interaction can include a selection. In some implementations, an interaction (selection) may occur on a portion of the search area. - In some implementations, an interaction and/or selection (or an indication thereof) can be used to trigger an action or result. For example, in this implementation shown, search result SA can be selected in
FIG. 1A . In response to the selection of search area SA inFIG. 1A , while the webpage W1 is displayed within thedisplay area 120 inFIG. 1B , the browser may initiate a search request for the search area SA inFIG. 1A . In some implementations, the request for the search is triggered when the search area SA is or includes text. In some implementations, the request for the search is triggered when the search area SA is or includes an image. In some implementations, the request for the search is triggered when the selection area SA is not identified as actionable by the webpage W1. Content of a webpage is actionable when the webpage includes markup tags that pair selection of the content with an event. Anchor tags, tags with an onclick mouse event, etc., are examples of content that is actionable by the webpage W1. In other words, text or images that are already actionable (e.g., actionable text, actionable images) in the webpage W1 may be selectable to perform that action, such as navigating to another webpage W1 or initiating an action defined by the webpage W1. Content identified as actionable by the webpage may perform the action when selected and/or may, when selected/interacted with, cause display of a pop-up menu that includes the action identified by the webpage W1 and/or other actions to perform (e.g., a pop up window that asks if the content associated with a link should be opened in a new tab, in a new browser window, the link copied to a clipboard, the link opened in an incognito window, etc.). When content is identified as actionable by the webpage W1, the browser may not automatically override that action by automatically submitting a request for a search of the search area. In some implementations, the request for a search can be an option in the pop-up menu. When content is not identified as actionable and is interacted with (e.g., selected) by the user, the browser may automatically, i.e., without further interaction from the user, submit a request to search the content represented by the search area. The search request can be triggered by a user of, for example, a mobile device via a search of the content in the search area SA (e.g., a text search, an image search, and/or so forth). In some implementations, the request for the search can be triggered in response to the selection of the search area SA being completed. In some implementations, the request for the search (which is based on the search area SA) can be triggered in response to a long press selection (e.g., selection of the search area for a threshold period of time) of the search area SA. In some implementations, a user interface for triggering the search query based on search area SA can be used. - The search request includes content of the search area. The content of the search area may include at least one of the following: text or one or more images. The search request can include an identifier for the webpage W1 (e.g., an address, such as a URL or URI). The search request can include context from the content C1 of the webpage W1. The context can include text located near the search area SA (e.g., within a number of words before and/or after the search area, within a number of pixels, within a DOM node with, etc.). The search request can include a quantity (number) of related queries to return. In other words, the browser can, as part of the request, tell the server how many related queries to provide in the response. The browser may send the search request to a server, e.g., a search server.
- The search server receives the search request from the browser and determines a query for the content of the search area. The search server can use conventional techniques (e.g., natural language processing, entity identification, etc.) to determine the query. In some implementations, the search server may use the context, if provided, in determining the query. In some implementations, the search server may use the webpage identifier to determine the query. The query can comprise text, e.g., a word, a phrase, an acronym, etc. The text may include text identified in the (content of) the search area. The text may include text identified using the context. The text may include text using entity identification. The query can comprise an entity identifier. Where the search area includes an image, the query can comprise an image. The search server may generate a search result page for the query. Thus, the query determined by the search server for the search area may be referred to as a searched query or the main query. A search result page is a webpage generated by the search server in response to a query. A search result page includes a plurality of search results. A search result can be associated with an identifier for a resource that is considered responsive to the query. Thus, a search result can represent the resource. A resource can be any content accessible via the Internet, e.g., a webpage, a PDF file, an audio file, an image, a video file, a document, etc. A resource is accessible via an identifier, such as a URL, URI, etc. A search result includes a link to the resource, the link using the resource identifier. A search result can include text from the linked-to resource, e.g., a webpage title, a snippet (text extracted from the content of the resource), etc. A search result can include an image from the linked-to resource. A search result can be a rich answer, such as a knowledge panel, a short answer (e.g., a definition, an answer provided by a third-party app and triggered by queries that match a particular type of query), etc. The search result page can include other elements, such as advertisements, “people also asked” short answers, interactive rich answers, links for refining the query, etc., as is known.
- The search server may also determine related queries for the searched query. In some implementations, the related queries can be generated based on the search area SA, i.e., the content of the search area. In some implementations, the related queries can include queries considered for the searched query but not selected as the searched query. In other words, the related queries can be lower-ranked queries considered, but not selected as, the searched query. For example, where the content of the search area includes an ambiguous entity reference, the related queries can include a second entity where the first entity is selected as the searched (main) query. In some implementations, the related queries may be queries frequently (e.g., as determined by statistical analysis) submitted after the searched (main) query. In some implementations, the related queries can be generated based on the identifier (e.g., URL) for the webpage associated with the search area SA. For example, in some implementations, the related queries can include a query for which the webpage is a top-ranked resource. As another example, the related queries can include a query frequently submitted before a user navigates to the webpage. As another example, the identifier may be used to identify queries that have responsive documents, including the document identified by the identifier, with shared passages.
- The related queries can also be referred to as related search requests. Potential (or candidate) related queries can be generated using conventional techniques. The search server may select some of the potential related queries to provide as part of a response to the search request. The search server may rank the potential (candidate) queries to identify selected related queries. If a quantity of related queries is provided to the search server as part of the search request, the search server may select that quantity of top-ranked related queries to return as part of a response to the search request. The search server can rank the related queries using conventional ranking factors. The search server can also use the location for the webpage W1 to rank the related queries. The location of the webpage is not a conventional ranking factor for related queries because a webpage is not associated with search engine queries. Ranking factors include, e.g., semantic proximity of the suggestion to the highlighted text and how many times the suggestion follows the highlighted text.
- In some implementations, the search server may use the length (in characters) of a related query as a ranking factor. For example, related queries that are too long may be downranked because these related queries take up too much area on the display of the client. Thus, the search system may prefer shorter related search requests (shorter related queries) over longer related search requests (longer related queries). The search server may send a response to the search request back to the browser. The response can include the searched query, the search result page for the searched query, and at least one related search request (related query). In some implementations, no more than the requested quantity of related search requests are provided as part of the response to the search request.
- In response to receiving the search request response, the
search result area 150 is rendered within thebrowser 110 inFIG. 1B . Thesearch result area 150 includessearch request area 130. In some implementations, thesearch result area 150 overlays thedisplay area 120. In some implementations, the rendering of thesearch result area 150 causes thedisplay area 120 to shrink in size. In either implementation, in response to the selection of search area SA inFIG. 1A , both the webpage W1 is displayed (i.e., within the display area 120) and thesearch result area 150 is rendered within thebrowser 110 inFIG. 1B . Thus, while both thesearch result area 150 results and the webpage W1 are visible, rendering of thesearch result area 150 may decrease the amount of content of the webpage W1 visible in thedisplay area 120. - As shown in
FIG. 1B , thesearch result area 150 can includesearch request area 130. Thesearch request area 130 includessearch request indicators 135, labeled SR1′ through SR3′ inFIG. 1B . Thus, the search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can collectively be referred to assearch request indicators 135. The search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can represent at least some of the related queries (related search requests) provided in the response from the server (other related queries provided may be associated with search request indicators that are not displayed in thesearch result area 150 but can be accessed via scrolling). Thesearch request indicators 135 can be interacted with to request searches related to the search area SA. Thus, thesearch request indicators 135 represent actionable user interface elements. An actionable user interface element can be interacted with by the user to perform a programmed action. The action performed by asearch request indicator 135 is submission of a search request to the search server, e.g., in the form of a query. A search request indicator can thus be associated with (generated for) one of the related search requests provided by the server. In some implementations, one of the search request indicators can be associated with (generated for) the searched query (the main query). The related search requests (e.g., related queries) can include a word (keyword), a phrase, and/or multiple words or phrases, e.g., so that interaction with a search request indicator requests a search for the word, phrase, etc. The related search requests can include/be an image, e.g., so that interaction with the search request indicator for the related search request requests a search for the image. The related search requests are provided by the search server as part of the response to the request to search the selected area SA. In some implementations, a first search request, e.g., a search request submitted in response to interaction with SR1′, is the searched query (the main query) and a second search request, e.g., a search request submitted in response to interaction with SR2′, is the related search request (the related query) provided by the server. In some implementations, the searched query is not represented by (associated with) a search request indicator. In such implementations, the searched query may be represented in a query text area of the search result area 150 (e.g., as discussed with regard toFIGS. 3A-3D ) and the first search request, e.g., a search request submitted in response to interaction with SR1′, and the second search request are each for a different related search request provided by the server. - In some implementations, one or more of the
search request indicators 135 can include text. In some implementations, one or more of thesearch request indicators 135 can include images. Thesearch request indicators 135 can include or can be a keyword/keywords that can be selected for retrieval of additional content (e.g., additional search result pages). Thus, additional search results can be navigated via the search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′. In other words, the search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can be interacted with to provide additional search results (e.g., via different search result pages), enabling a user to navigate to different search result content (different search result pages) without navigating away from thesearch result area 150 or the webpage W1. - In some implementations, the search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′ may represent a subset of related queries surfaced in response to the search request for the search area. In some implementations, the search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can be a rank-ordered (e.g., highest ranked) subset of related queries surfaced in response to the search request for the search area. In some implementations, one or more of the search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can be prioritized so that the most relevant related searches (or a subset thereof) are rendered within the
search request area 130. The prioritization is based on a ranking order determined by the server. In some implementations, the searched query represents a highest-ranked search for the search area. - In some implementations, although not shown in
FIG. 1B , additionalsearch request indicators 135 can be surfaced in response to a search request for the search area SA. The additionalsearch request indicators 135 may be viewed by scrolling through, or otherwise navigating through, thesearch request area 130. For example, thesearch request area 130 may include a carousel ofsearch request indicators 135. Accordingly, the additional related search requests can be viewed within thesearch request area 130. For example, in some implementations, the additionalsearch request indicators 135 can be viewed by scrolling left and right within thesearch request area 130. - As shown in
FIG. 1B , in response to thesearch result area 150 being rendered, the size (e.g., a visible area) of the display area 120 (shown inFIG. 1A ) is decreased. In other words, the visible portion of thedisplay area 120 is decreased in size in response to thesearch result area 150 being displayed. In some implementations, thesearch result area 150 is an overlay, e.g., appears on top of thedisplay area 120. Thus, in some implementations, thesearch result area 150 can overlap with the webpage W1 without modifying the scale of the webpage W1 (e.g., partially overlay the webpage W1). In some implementations, the webpage W1 can be modified (e.g., scaled) in layout to fit (e.g., fit for display) into thedisplay area 120. In some implementations, thedisplay area 120 shown inFIG. 1A can be divided into thedisplay area 120 and thesearch result area 150 as shown inFIG. 1B . The combined areas of thedisplay area 120 and thesearch result area 150 shown inFIG. 1B can be the same as the area of thedisplay area 120 as shown inFIG. 1A . In some implementations, the combined areas of thedisplay area 120 and thesearch result area 150 can be different from (e.g., smaller than, larger than) the area of thedisplay area 120. - In some implementations, any background or theme applied to the
address bar area 114 can flow into (and would be contiguous with) thesearch result area 150. The contiguous background would be difficult for a third party (e.g., provider of the webpage W1) to imitate within an application of thebrowser 110. Moreover, the contiguous background or theme can be implemented as a security feature so that a user can distinguish legitimate search results provided by a search query from search results that can be inserted by a third party or by the provider of the webpage. -
FIG. 1C illustrates content C2 (e.g., a search result webpage) rendered in anavigation area 140 within thesearch result area 150. The content C2 can be rendered in thenavigation area 140 in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search request indicator SR1′ in thesearch request area 130. Thenavigation area 140, in this implementation, does not replace thedisplay area 120. The content C2 displayed in thenavigation area 140, in this implementation, is visible even while the webpage W1 (and content C1) is at least partially displayed in thedisplay area 120. Thesearch request area 130 with thesearch request indicators 135 are disposed between thenavigation area 140 and thedisplay area 120. In some implementations, the content C2 is populated without interaction with the search request indicator SR1′. For example, where the search request indicator SR1′ represents the searched query, the browser may populate (pre-load, pre-render) thenavigation area 140 with the search result page returned in response to the request to search the search area. In such an implementation, the content C2 can be viewed without selection of the search request indicator SR1′. For example, a user may drag the top portion of thesearch result area 150 toward thedisplay area 120 to view at least a portion of the content C2. The content C2 could also be viewed by maximizing thesearch result area 150. Maximizing thesearch result area 150 can be done, for example, by dragging a top portion of thesearch result area 150 toward thedisplay area 120. Maximizing thesearch result area 150 can also be done, for example, in response to selection of one of thesearch request indicators 135. When thesearch result area 150 is in a maximized state it occupies more area thandisplay area 120 but does not fully cover/overlay thedisplay area 120. - The
navigation area 140 can be used to consume (e.g., explore) the search results for the currently selected search request, i.e., the related search request represented by the most recently selected search request indicator of thesearch request indicators 135. The searched query is considered the currently selected search request before any of thesearch request indicators 135 are selected. For example, in response to a first search request indicator being selected from thesearch request area 130, first content can be rendered in thenavigation area 140. In response to a second search request indicator being selected from thesearch request area 130, second content can be rendered in thenavigation area 140 instead of, or in addition to, the first content. The content can be navigated while the search results (e.g., search request indicator SR1′) is maintained within thesearch request area 130. - Although not shown in
FIG. 1C , in some implementations, the search request indicator SR1′ is not displayed within thesearch request area 130 because the content C2 corresponding to the search request indicator SR1′ is already displayed. Accordingly, the search request indicator SR1′ associated with content already displayed in thenavigation area 140 may not be included in thesearch request area 130. In some such implementations, text (or an image) corresponding to the search request indicator SR1′ may be provided in a query title area of thesearch result area 150, as discussed with regard toFIG. 3B . - Although not shown in
FIG. 1C , in some implementations, interaction with (e.g., selection of) at least a portion (e.g., a link) of the content C2 while thesearch request area 130 is shown can result in thesearch request area 130 being closed and a new browser tab opened. For example, selection of a link in the content C2 can cause the resource (e.g., webpage, file) associated with the link to open in a new tab of the browser. As another example, thedisplay area 120 can be removed and the resource associated with the link can be expanded into the current tab (e.g., the entirety of thedisplay area 120 of the browser 110) in response to selection of a link in the content C2. This can result in thesearch result area 150 being closed. As another example, selection of a link in the content C2 can also cause display of a menu (e.g., a pop-up menu) with options for opening the resource associated with the link. In some implementations, although not shown inFIG. 1C , interaction outside of thesearch result area 150 can result in thesearch result area 150 being closed. -
FIG. 1D illustrates content C3 (e.g., content of a search result page) rendered in anavigation area 140 within thesearch result area 150 of thebrowser 110. The content C3 is rendered in thenavigation area 140 in response to an interaction (e.g., a user interaction) with the search request indicator SR3′ in thesearch request area 130. Thenavigation area 140, in this implementation, replaces the content C2 within thenavigation area 140. The content C3 displayed in thenavigation area 140, in this implementation, replaces the content C2 displayed in thenavigation area 140. As shown inFIG. 1D , thesearch request indicators 135 are shifted so that the search request indicator SR3′ corresponding with the content C3 is more centered within thesearch request area 130. Also, inFIG. 1D , search request indicator SR4′ is shown because search request indicator SR3′ is shifted. Search request indicator SR4′ may have been viewable via a scrolling input (e.g., right-to-left swipe or drag) in thesearch request area 130 prior to selection of the search request indicator SR3′. - Further to the implementation shown in
FIGS. 1A through 1D , in some implementations, a new web address can be input intoinput address area 113 of theaddress bar area 114 after thesearch request area 130 and thenavigation area 140 are defined. In response to the new web address area, a different webpage (not shown) can replace the webpage W1 (or other content) in thenavigation area 140, while maintaining thesearch request indicators 135 in thesearch request area 130. In other words, thesearch request indicators 135 can be maintained even while navigating within thenavigation area 140 and using a different web address in theaddress bar area 114 of thebrowser 110. -
FIG. 1E illustrates that thenavigation area 140 can be changed (e.g., increased, decreased) in size. InFIG. 1E , thenavigation area 140 is increased in size relative to the size of thenavigation area 140 shown in, for example,FIG. 1D . In some implementations, a handle (not shown) or other icon associated with, or included in, thenavigation area 140 can be used to pull, or push, thenavigation area 140 so that it can be changed in size. For example, a handle can be selected and dragged to change a size of thenavigation area 140. An example handle 132 is illustrated in at leastFIGS. 2B and 2C . - In some implementations, a user interface element (e.g., a back button, a back arrow) can be used to remove (e.g., clear, navigate away from) content rendered in the navigation area 140 (e.g., the webpage W2). In some implementations, the user interface element can be used to remove (e.g., clear) the
search request area 130 and/or thenavigation area 140. In some implementations, the user interface element can be used to navigate away from (e.g., backward from) the webpages (e.g., webpage W2), thesearch request indicators 135, and/or thesearch result area 150. -
FIGS. 2A through 2C illustrate an alternate display implementation associated with thedisplay area 120 and the search result area 150 (search request area 130 and navigation area 140). In some implementations, content C2 associated with search request indicator SR1′ is shown in response to thenavigation area 140 being expanded in size. For example, the search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can be rendered insearch request area 130 inFIG. 2B in response to a selection of search area SA inFIG. 2A . A handle 132 (represented by a line) associated withsearch request area 130 can be selected and used to move (e.g., drag) thesearch request area 130 in an upward direction (illustrated by direction A) to reveal (e.g., to generate) thenavigation area 140, as illustrated inFIG. 2C . In some implementations, in response to the movement of thesearch request area 130 to reveal thenavigation area 140 content C2 associated with the search request indicator SR1′ (which is the first search request indicator) can be rendered. In some implementations, content associated with at least one of thesearch request indicators 135 that is in focus (e.g., centered within thesearch request area 130, also referred to as the currently selected search request) can be rendered within thenavigation area 140 in response to movement of the search request area 130 (e.g., movement of the handle 132). - The location and/or shape of the search result area 150 (
search request area 130 and/or associated navigation area 140) can be different than shown herein. In some implementations, thesearch request area 130 and/or associatednavigation area 140 can be smaller in size than shown. In some implementations, thesearch request area 130 and/or associatednavigation area 140 can be included along a different side of the browser 110 (e.g., along a bottom portion, along a top portion, along the left side, and/or so forth). In some implementations, the search request area 130 (and/or associated navigation area 140) can float above (e.g., can be rendered in a window above) thedisplay area 120 so that thedisplay area 120 inFIG. 1A is not decreased in size to the area of thedisplay area 120 shown inFIG. 1B . In some implementations, thesearch request area 130 can be a different shape (e.g., a circular shape) rather than a square or rectangular shape. - As shown herein (e.g.,
FIG. 2C ), thesearch request indicators 135 of SR1′ through SR3′ are arranged horizontally within thesearch request area 130 and can be navigated along a horizontal direction. In some implementations, the search request indicators SR1′ through SR3′ can be arranged within thesearch request area 130 in a different orientation (e.g., vertically). -
FIGS. 3A through 3D illustrate an alternate display implementation associated with thedisplay area 120 and the search result area 150 (search request area 130 and navigation area 140). In the example ofFIGS. 3A through 3D thesearch result area 150 includes aquery text area 332. Thequery text area 332 corresponds to the currently selected search request, or in other words, the search request in focus. The search request in focus corresponds to the searched query when thesearch result area 150 is initially displayed (rendered). The search request in focus can change based on interactions with thesearch request indicators 135. The search result page currently displayed in thenavigation area 140 corresponds to the search request in focus. In the example ofFIG. 3B , the search request indicator SR1′ corresponds to the searched query, so thequery text area 332 includes text for the searched query. In the example ofFIG. 3B , if a user changes the size of thesearch result area 150, e.g., as discussed with regard toFIG. 2C , the content of thenavigation area 140 would be the search result page received for the searched query. - In some implementations, the
query text area 332 display area can include an image associated with the search request in focus. In some implementations, the search server sends an image for the searched query in the response to the request to search the search area. The image may be small (sized to occupy an area similar to a few lines of text in the search result area 150) and may be displayed with text in thequery text area 332 above thesearch request area 130. In some implementations, the image, if provided, is removed from thequery text area 332 when thesearch result area 150 is maximized, conserving display area for additional content to be displayed in thenavigation area 140. In some implementations, the text in thequery text area 332 corresponds to the related search request/searched query. -
FIG. 3C illustrates changes to thesearch result area 150 in response to aninteraction 305 with the search request indicator SR3′. As illustrated, interaction with (e.g., selection of) the search request indicator SR3′ can cause thesearch result area 150 to change size. Thus, for example, thesearch result area 150 may be maximized, or in a maximized state in response to selection of the search request indicator SR3′. In addition, selection of the search request indicator SR3′ makes the related search request associated with SR3′ the currently selected search request, or in other words the search request in focus. Accordingly, the content of thequery text area 332 is changed to correspond to the related search request associated with the search request indicator SR3′. In some implementations, when thesearch result area 150 is in the maximized state, acontrol 337 may be displayed. Thecontrol 337, when selected, may cause the browser to open the search result page for the search request in focus in a new tab or a new browser window. In some implementations, when thesearch result area 150 is maximized an appearance of thedisplay area 120 may be modified. For example, as illustrated inFIG. 3C , thedisplay area 120 may be shaded. In addition to causing thesearch result area 150 to be maximized, selection of SR3′ may submit a search request to the search server. The search request is a query that is represented by the related search request corresponding to SR3′. The search server may thus return a search result page that corresponds to SR3′ and display the search result page in thenavigation area 140, e.g., content C3. - In the example of
FIG. 3C , the user may decrease the size of thesearch result area 150, e.g., by interacting withhandle 132. For example, the user may drag handle 132 in toward thenavigation area 140, e.g., in the direction labeled B inFIG. 3C . In some implementations, once thehandle 132 reaches aminimization threshold 338, e.g., represented by a dashed line inFIG. 3C , the browser may automatically change the currently selected search request, or in other words the search request in focus, to the searched query. Thus, for example, once thehandle 132 reaches theminimization threshold 338 the browser may change thequery text area 332 to the text for the searched query and may change the content of thenavigation area 140 to the search result page for the searched query, as illustrated inFIG. 3D . Theminimization threshold 338 may be a screen coordinate, e.g., a y-coordinate or an x-coordinate, that falls between the position of thehandle 132 when thesearch result area 150 is in a maximized state and the position of thehandle 132 when thesearch result area 150 is in a minimized state. Theminimization threshold 338 may be closer to the position of thehandle 132 when thesearch result area 150 is in the minimized state than to the position of thehandle 132 when the 150 is in the maximized state. When thesearch result area 150 is in a minimized state, thesearch result area 150 may only display thesearch request area 130 and, in implementations that include it, thequery text area 332. In other words, thenavigation area 140 is not visible or is just barely visible when thesearch result area 150 is in the minimized state. Thus, for example, thesearch result area 150 ofFIGS. 3B and 3D illustrate thesearch result area 150 in a minimized state andFIG. 3C illustrates thesearch result area 150 in a maximized state. -
FIG. 4 illustrates a system 400 including acomputing system 402 and asearch server 440 configured for implementing the concepts and various implementations shown and described herein. As shown inFIG. 4 , thecomputing system 402 is configured to communicate with thesearch server 440 and/or a webpage provider 410 (e.g., a web server) via anetwork 450. Thecomputing system 402 includes at least abrowser manager 420 and asearch result manager 423. In some implementations, thebrowser manager 420 is configured to manage content, such as webpage content, provided by the webpage provider 410 (e.g., also referred to as a web server). In some implementations, thebrowser manager 420 is configured to operate as one ofseveral applications 428 executed via an operating system (O/S) 429. Thebrowser manager 420 can be configured to implement the key portions of the user interface, search results, windows, and/or so forth, as described in connection with the implementations described herein. - As shown in
FIG. 4 , thecomputing system 402 includes several hardware components including acommunication module 461, one ormore cameras 462, amemory 463, a central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics processing unit (GPU) 464, one ormore input devices 467, and one ormore output devices 468. The hardware components can be used to facilitate operation of thebrowser manager 420, thesearch result manager 423, and/or so forth of thecomputing system 402. - The
browser manager 420 includes a user interface (UI)generator 421 configured to generate and/or manage the various user interface elements of a browser such asbrowser 110 as shown and described herein. For example, theUI generator 421 can generate UI elements including the various windows in thebrowser 110 such as thedisplay area 120, thesearch result area 150, including thesearch request area 130, thenavigation area 140, and/or thequery text area 332, shown in at leastFIGS. 1A through 1C and other figures. - The
browser manager 420 includes atab manager 422 configured to generate and/or manage the various tabs of a browser such asbrowser 110. Thebrowser manager 420 may be configured to, amongst other things, open a new tab in response to interaction of the user with links in the search result page displayed in the navigation area (e.g., navigation area 140) of a search result area (e.g., search result area 150). Thebrowser manager 420 may be configured to, amongst other things, open a new tab in response to interaction of the user with a control of the search result area 150 (e.g.,control 337 ofFIG. 3C ). In some implementations, the control may be displayed when the search result area is displayed in a maximized state, as described herein. - The
browser manager 420 includes asearch result manager 423 configured to generate and/or manage content rendering such as content in thesearch result area 150, including the search request indicators, the content in the navigation area, the content in thequery text area 332, etc. (as shown in at leastFIG. 1B, 1C, 3B, 3C , and other figures). Thebrowser manager 420 includes adisplay area manager 424 configured to generate and/or manage content rendering associated with a webpage W1 in the display area 120 (shown inFIG. 1B and other figures). The webpage W1 content can be provided to thecomputing system 402 by thewebpage provider 410. - As shown in
FIG. 4 , session data 427 (which can be stored in memory 463 (not shown)) can be managed as, or by, one of theapplications 428. Thesession data 427 can include data related to one or more browser sessions. Theapplication information 426 can include information related to the various applications operating within and/or that can be executed by the O/S 429. - The
search result manager 423 can also be configured to manage one or more elements selected for searching, e.g., search area SA ofFIG. 1A and other figures. Thesearch result manager 423 can trigger one or more search requests, e.g., generating a request for a search of a selected search area and sending the request to thesearch server 440. Thesearch result manager 423 can include anarea detector 432 that can detect one or more areas (e.g., search area SA shown inFIG. 1B and other figures) selected for searching. Thesearch result manager 423 also includes acapture manager 431 that can manage content of search request, e.g., packaging the content of the search area, the identifier of the webpage, the context for the search area, and/or the number of related searches to return into a format expected by thesearch suggestion generator 442 of thesearch server 440. Selection of one or more areas for searching can be triggered by one or more input devices 467 (e.g., a mouse, a gesture, etc.) and can be communicated to the search result manager 423 (and area detector 432). Thesearch result manager 423 can be configured to implement the process described in connection withFIGS. 5A and 5B . - As shown in
FIG. 4 , thecommunication module 461 can be configured to facilitate communication with thewebpage provider 410 and/orsearch server 440 via thenetwork 450 via one or more communication protocols. Thecamera 462 can be used for capturing one or more images, thememory 463 can be used for storing information associated with thebrowser manager 420 and/orsearch result manager 423, the CPU/GPU 464 can be used for processing information and/or images associated with thebrowser manager 420 and/orsearch result manager 423. Thecomputing system 402 also includes one ormore output devices 468 such as communication ports, speakers, displays, and/or so forth. The functionality described in this application can be implemented based on one ormore policies 465 and/orpreferences 466 stored in thememory 463, e.g., the number of related search requests to return etc. -
FIG. 4 illustrates some aspects of thesearch server 440. For example, thesearch server 440 includes one ormore processors 446 and one ormore memory devices 448. Thesearch server 440 includes asearch suggestion generator 442 configured to receive a request for a search of a search area from thecomputing system 402. A request for a search of a search area differs from a conventional search query because the query is not known ahead of time. Thesearch suggestion generator 442 is configured to determine the searched query from the search area (optionally using the content of the webpage identified in the request to search the search area and/or the context provided with the request). Thesearch suggestion generator 442 is also configured to identify candidate related queries for the search area, rank the candidate related queries, and select candidate related queries for inclusion in the response to the request. Thesearch suggestion generator 442 may be in communication with asearch engine 444 of the search server 440 (or asearch engine 444 accessible to the search server 440). Thesearch engine 444 may be used to provide a search result page for a query. For example, once thesearch suggestion generator 442 determines the searched query for the search area, thesearch suggestion generator 442 may send the searched query to thesearch engine 444, which may provide a search result page for the searched query. A search result page conventionally includes a plurality of search results, each result representing a resource considered responsive to the query. The search result page can also include rich results, such as short answers and/or knowledge panels. The search result page can also include advertisements or sponsored results. Thesearch suggestion generator 442 can be configured to implement the process described in connection withFIG. 6 . -
FIGS. 5A and 5B are flowcharts that illustrate amethod 500 of performing at least some of the concepts described herein in the various figures. Many elements of themethod 500 can be implemented by the components shown in at leastFIG. 4 . In particular, themethod 500 can be performed by a browser, (e.g., browser manager 420) of acomputing system 402. Atstep 502, the system may cause display of a webpage within a display area of a browser. Atstep 504, the system may receive a selection of an area of the webpage content (e.g., search area SA inFIG. 1A ). In response to selection of the search area included in the webpage (506), the system may atstep 508 request a search for the content of the search area. The request can include the content of the search area, an identifier of the webpage, and context for the search area from the webpage. In some implementations, the request can include a number of (i.e., a quantity of) related queries to return. The system may provide this request to search the search area to a server, e.g., a search server. The search server may provide a response to the search request. The response can include a searched query, a search result page for the searched query, and at least one related search request. The related search request(s) are additional queries (related queries) that can be submitted by the user from the search result interface (e.g.,search result area 150 ofFIG. 1B and other figures) without navigating away from the webpage. - At
step 510 the system receives the response and atstep 512 the system causes display of a first search request indicator and a second search request indicator within a search result area outside of the display area and within the browser. In some implementations, the first search request indicator can represent the searched query and the second search request indicator can represent the related search request. In some implementations, e.g., where two or more related search requests are provided in the response, the first search result indicator can represent one of the related search requests and the second search result indicator can represent another of the related search requests. Atstep 514 the system receives a selection of the first search request indicator. Atstep 516 the system, in response to the selection of the first search request indicator, causes display of content for the first search request indicator within a navigation area of the search result area. In implementations where the searched query is represented by the first search request indicator, the content is the search result page received in the response. In such implementations, the display of the content may include automatically maximizing the size of the search result area (e.g., displaying the search result area in a maximized state) so that at least a portion of the search result page for the searched query is visible. In implementations where the first search request indicator represents a related query, the display of the content may include submitting the related query to a search server and receiving a search result page for the related query, and displaying the search result page for the related query. - Once the system renders the search result area, the system may be configured to respond to one or more different inputs related to the search result area. For example, in
step 550, the system may receive an interaction (a selection, a tap, a click, etc.) outside of the search result area. In response to the receipt of this interaction, atstep 552, the search result area may be closed, or in other words, removed from the display area of the browser. As another example, instep 530 the system may receive a selection of a link in the navigation area (e.g., a selection of a link from the search result page currently displayed in the navigation area of the search result area). Or, instep 530, the system may receive selection of a control in the search result area configured to open the search result page currently displayed in the navigation area to a new tab. In response to receiving the selection of the link or the control, atstep 534 the system may create the new tab and display the content of the navigation area (the search result page for the search request in focus) in the new tab. - As another example, at
step 540 the system may receive an interaction with a handle of the search result area. The interaction may be a dragging of the handle, which changes a size of the search result area displayed in the browser. The system may monitor the location (coordinates) of the handle during the drag and, atstep 542, determine whether the coordinates meet a minimization threshold (e.g.,minimization threshold 338 ofFIG. 3C ). Responsive to determining that a coordinate of the handle does meet the minimization threshold and when the content in the navigation area is not content from the search results for the searched query, atstep 544, the system may replace the content in the navigation area with content from the search result page for the searched query, e.g., as illustrated inFIG. 3D . - As another example, at
step 520 the system may receive an interaction for (a selection of a particular search request indicator. The particular search request indicator can be any of the search request indicators displayed in the search result area. In response to receiving the selection (522), the system may, at step 524, send the query that corresponds to the particular search request indicator to a search server. Atstep 526 the system receives, in response to the request, a search result page for the query. At step 528 the system causes display of content from the search result page for the query in the navigation area of the search result area. The query associated with the particular search request indicator may then be considered the current search request or the search request in focus. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart that illustrates a method 600 of performing at least some of the concepts described herein in the various figures. Many elements of the method 600 can be implemented by the components shown in at leastFIG. 4 . In particular, the method 600 can be performed by a server system (e.g., search server 440). Atstep 602 the system may receive, from a browser executing on a client device, a request to search a selected search area. The request includes the selected search area and an identifier of a webpage displayed by the browser. The request can include context for the search area. The request can include a quantity of related search requests (related queries) to return. In the request, the selected search area and the context are content from the webpage identified in the request. - At
step 604, the system may determine a query for the selected search area. The query may be referred to as the searched query. In determining the searched query, the system may identify several candidate queries for the search area and select a top-ranking query as the searched query. The system may use known or later developed techniques for selecting the searched query. The system may, atstep 606, obtain a search result page for the searched query. Atstep 608. the system may determine one or more related search requests for the search area. These related search requests can also be referred to as candidate related queries. The system may rank the candidate related queries atstep 610. The ranking may be dependent on a number of factors, including the identifier of the webpage. The ranking can also or instead use a length of the candidate related queries as a ranking factor. As part ofstep 610, the system may select highest-ranked candidate related queries. The number of selected candidate queries (related search requests) can be based on the quantity received with the request to search the search area. Atstep 612, the system provides the query, the selected related search request(s), and the search result page for the query to the browser as a response to the request. -
