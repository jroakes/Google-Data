Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to ranking search results for presentation to a computer user.
- Search engines provide users with a list of results identified from a set of candidate data.
- a query that includes one or more keywords related to information being sought is entered, and the system returns a set of results from which the user can choose.
- the identification of the results included in the results set can use any number of identification algorithms and criteria.
- Search engines are often used by consumers to perform research regarding products of interest in order to make a purchasing decision. For example, a user may wish to obtain information regarding a product's price, features, or availability.
- the set of data from which a given system identifies results generally includes listings for products as well as a variety of accessories related to those products.
- An accessory is an item that is sold separate from a product but is associated with the product (for example, through its function, features, operation, appearance, etc.) such that the accessory might appear in search results for the product.
- a user search for information regarding a given product often returns a set of results that includes both product and accessory listings.
- the product and accessory results can be intermingled in the order of the results presented to the user. This can prove frustrating. For example, if the user is researching a product to make a purchasing decision, the user is likely to be less interested in results related to a product accessory for a product that the user does not yet own.
- the results set includes intermingled product and accessory result listings
- the user may have to visually scan each individual result to determine if the result is of interest. To determine if a given result is a related to a product or accessory, the user may have to select the result, by clicking on it for example, to review it more thoroughly.
- This specification describes technologies relating to distinguishing accessories from products for ranking search results.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a query, identifying a set of ranked results corresponding to the query from a corpus of offer data, classifying the query as a product query or an accessory query, generating a set of modified ranked results based on the classification of the query, generating the set of modified ranked results including, if the query is a product query, for each result in the set of ranked results, determining if the result is an accessory result, and if the result is an accessory result, demoting the rank of the result, and sending at least a subset of highest ranked results in the modified ranked results in response to the query.
- the invention can provide a set of results more relevant to a user query. If a user query is indicative of a product search, for example, accessory results can be decreased in rank or omitted from the results presented to the user.

- FIG. 2A is a flowchart of an example method for generating distribution data from offer records.
- FIG. 2B is a flowchart of an example method for generating prior probabilities data from offer records.
- FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example method for processing results returned by a query.
- FIG. 3B is a flowchart of an example method for determining if a query should be processed as a product query.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example method for processing a result set for a product query.
- FIG. 5A shows two example output records of an intermediate preprocessing step.
- FIG. 5B shows an example price distribution output record.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 of an example search engine 102 configured to distinguish accessories from products.
- the search engine 102 includes a front end server 104 that interfaces with the network 106 .
- the front end server 104 can be, for example, a web server that communicates with one or more client computers over the Internet.
- the front end server 104 can, for example, provide hypertext markup language formatted web pages to a web browser of the computer 108 .
- a web browser running on the computer 108 can interpret these web pages for display on the computer 108 .
- the displayed web pages can function as a user interface of the search engine 102 .
- the front end server 104 can accept a query from the client computer 108 that includes one or more keywords.
- the query can be passed on to the query processor 110 for processing.
- the query processor 110 can identify one or more results corresponding to the query and return the results to the front end server 104 for transmission to the client computer 108 .
- Individual results in a set of results can be ordered according to a ranking score computed by the query processor 110 .
- a result set can be delivered to the client computer 108 as a complete set of results or delivered in segments. For example, the 10 highest ranked results can be delivered first in one web page that includes a link that can be selected by a user to cause the front end server 104 to deliver the next 10 highest ranked results.
- the offer data store 116 includes offer records corresponding to items offered for sale by one or more merchants.
- the merchants can, for example, register with the search engine 102 to upload offer records to the offer data store 116 .
- the search engine 102 can retrieve offer records from merchant servers, through, for example, downloading a file including the offer records from merchants, and/or using a network crawling application.
- the search engine 102 can search a corpus of offer data, for example, search the data store 116 to identify one or more query results from the offer records.
- the search engine can identify query results from both offer records in the data store 116 and an index of documents available on the network 106 that is created and updated by periodically searching the network 106 .
- a user of the computer 108 can indicate, using the user interface provided by the front end server 104 , that only items for sale should be included in the returned results. In such a case the search engine 102 can return results found in the offer data store 116 without searching the document index.
- Merchants registered with the search engine 102 can upload offer records to the offer data store 116 from one or more merchant servers 118 A, 118 B, . . . 118 n .
- the merchant servers can upload offer records corresponding to items offered on an online store operated by the merchant.
- the offer records can include multiple fields such as, for example, a title of the offer, a description of the item for sale, a price at which the item is offered for sale, and/or a category of the offer.
- the category field can include a category name and/or identifier from a list of categories designated by the search engine provider and provided to merchants. For instance, the list of categories can be provided to registered merchants, and the merchants can be instructed to categorize offer records by selecting one or more categories from the category list.
- An offer processor 120 of the search engine can perform preprocessing operations using offer records from the offer data store 116 to generate distribution data stored in the distribution data store 122 and prior probabilities data stored in the prior probabilities data store 124 .
- the prior probabilities data in the data store 124 can be used, for example, by the query classifier 112 and/or the result classifier 114 , as described in more detail below, to compare query keywords and keywords from identified results to offer record keywords that have a calculated probability of being associated with an accessory.
- the query processor 110 can use this comparison to distinguish between accessory related results and product related results in the set of search results.
- the query processor 110 can use offer records from the offer data store 116 , data from the distribution data store 122 , and/or data from the prior probabilities data store 124 to distinguish accessory related results from product related results.
- the query processor assigns lower ranking scores to accessory results than to product results so that product results appear higher in a ranked list of search results than accessory results.
- FIG. 2A is a flowchart of an example method 200 for generating distribution data from offer records.
- the offer processor 120 can, for example, perform the method 200 using offer records stored in the offer data store 116 to generate the distribution data that is stored in the distribution data store 122 .
- the offer records are classified into either a “product” cluster or an “accessory” cluster ( 202 ). For example, offer records can be heuristically classified based on information in one or more fields of an offer record.
- only a subset of the offer records is classified as products or accessories.
- the subset can be selected based on the category field of the offer record. For instance, offer records belonging to categories that are known to include products that often have corresponding accessories can be classified, but not offer records that belong to other categories.
- Example categories that often have products with corresponding accessories include categories related to computers, video games, and electronics in general.
- the offer processor 120 can heuristically classify a given offer by reading a title field of the offer to determine if the title includes words that are often associated with accessories.
- the classification can be based on the prior probabilities data in the data store 124 .
- the title field can be compared to a blacklist that includes words that are known to often be associated with accessories such as, e.g., “accessory”, “case”, “cartridge”, etc.
- the offer processor 120 can also read the category field of the offer record to determine if the offer is a product or an accessory. If the corresponding category is, for example, specifically a category for accessories, the offer can be classified as an accessory.
- the output of the offer processor 120 upon the offer processor 120 completing a heuristic classification step, can be a classification output in a format including one line for each offer title word (for example, see the format shown in FIG. 5A ).
- Offer title words can include, for example, significant words that are included in the title field of the offer records in the offer data store 116 omitting short words and stemming prefixes and/or suffixes from root words.
- a given offer record can include more than one title word in its title field such that multiple lines of the classification output format can correspond to a single offer record.
- the classification output format can also include the price of the offer record associated with the offer title word and an indication as to the heuristic classification (as product or accessory) of the offer record.
- the classification indication can be a logical yes or no as to whether the offer record was classified as an accessory.
- a price distribution of the offers placed in the products cluster and the offers placed in the accessories cluster is computed ( 204 ).
- Price distribution data can be stored in the distribution data store 122 .
- the price distribution can be computed using, for example, the output of the classification step.
- central tendency pricing data such as a mean and standard deviation of the prices for that title word, can be computed.
- the mean value and a standard deviation of the value in the price field for lines in the classification output that have a title word of “laptop” and a classification of “product” are computed.
- the mean and standard deviation of prices for lines having the title word “laptop” that are classified as “accessory” are also computed.
- the format of the generated price distribution data is a title word followed by the mean and standard deviation of prices of the product cluster, and the mean and standard deviation of prices of the accessory cluster (for example see the format shown in FIG. 5B ).
- Title word listings extracted from the offer records are then reclassified based on the likelihood that the corresponding offer is a product offer or an accessory offer according to the price distribution data ( 206 ).
- the likelihood calculation can assume equal prior probabilities and a single Gaussian distribution for each corresponding accessory and product offer. For example, a title keyword “laptop” extracted from an offer record having a price of “53.99” can be compared to the price distribution data 506 shown in FIG. 5B for offers including the keyword “laptop”.
- the offer from which the keyword in row 504 corresponds can be classified as an accessory since, given the price distribution 506 , it is more likely that the corresponding offer is for an accessory than a product.
- a check is performed to determine if the classification process is complete ( 208 ).
- the iteration criteria can be, for example, a number of title word listings that were reclassified based on the likelihood calculation. For instance, if this number is above a certain threshold, the process can return to 204 to recompute the price distributions using the reclassified clusters. Otherwise the process ends ( 210 ).
- Distributions other than a price distribution can also be used to classify offers. For example, offers can be classified according to title unigram distribution and title word pairs distribution.
- FIG. 2B is a flowchart of an example method for generating prior probabilities data from offer records.
- An offer keyword is read along with its corresponding classifications ( 216 ). For instance, the output of the classification process can be read (for example, see the format shown in FIG. 5A ).
- the number of times the keyword is found to be associated with an accessory and the number of times the keyword is found to be associated with a product can be counted and used to compute a probability that the keyword is associated with an accessory ( 218 ).
- the computed probability can be stored with the keyword in the prior probabilities data ( 220 ).
- Prior probabilities data in the datastore 124 can be used, for example, by the query classifier 112 to classify a query as described below.
- FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example method 300 for processing results returned by a query.
- a query is received ( 302 ).
- a determination is made as to whether the query is related to a product ( 304 ). If the query is found to not be related to a product, results of the query are processed as if the query is for an accessory ( 306 ). If the query is found to be related to a product, the results of the query are processed as if the query is for a product ( 308 ).
- the method 300 is performed by the query classifier 112 of the query processor 110 .
- the determination as to whether a given query relates to a product can include, for example, comparing query keywords to words in the prior probabilities data in the datastore 124 .
- the prior probabilities data includes a blacklist that includes words that have been found to have a high probability of being associated with accessories. Such a blacklist could include, for example, words such as “accessory”, “case”, and “cartridge”.
- the determination can also include retrieving a set of results for the query and checking the category field of any offer record corresponding to a given result. If a threshold number of results in the results set correspond to offer records that belong to product related categories, the query can be determined to be a product query.
- the query classifier 112 can accept an input parameter that identifies a file that includes a list of product related categories.
- the determination can also include checking a classification of offer records corresponding to results in the result set to determine if a large number of the offer records are classified as accessories. For example, if more than a threshold number of offer records corresponding to the results in the result set are classified as accessories, then the query can be determined to be an accessory query (and not a product query).
- FIG. 3B is a flowchart of an example method 310 for determining if a query should be processed as a product query.
- the method 310 is performed by the query classifier 112 of the query processor 110 .
- the query keywords of a received query are analyzed to determine if they are indicative of an accessory query.
- the query keywords can be compared to the prior probabilities data ( 312 ). If a probability calculation based on one or more query keywords and the prior probabilities data indicates that the query is an accessory query, a result set of the query is processed as if the query is for an accessory ( 314 ).
- the query classifier 112 can accept an input parameter that identifies a file that includes a list of product related categories.
- the query classifier can also accept the threshold number as an input.
- the threshold number and product related categories file can be given as command line inputs to a query classifier 112 executable file.
- a result set of the query is processed as if the query is for a product ( 318 ). For example, if a set of results includes 200 results, the threshold number used can be 10. In this case, if there are 10 or more product related results in the set of 200 results, the query is classified as a product query.
- the threshold number of results belonging to product related categories is not met, the number of results in the result set that are classified as accessory offers is compared to a second threshold number ( 320 ).
- This threshold number can be provided as a command line input parameter as well. If the threshold number of results classified as accessories is met, the result set is processed as if the query is for an accessory ( 314 ). If the threshold number of results classified as accessories is not met, the result set is processed as if the query is for a product ( 314 ). For example, if a set of results includes 200 results, 195 can be used as the second threshold number. In this case, if 195 of the 200 results are accessory related results, the query is classified as an accessory query.
- a result set processed as if the query is for an accessory is processed normally without any modification to a ranking of the results in the results set based on the offers' classification as a product or accessory.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example method 400 for processing a result set for a product query.
- the method 400 is performed by the result classifier 114 of the query processor 110 .
- An offer result in the query results set is read ( 402 ). Words found in the offer result are compared to the prior probabilities data stored, for example, in the prior probabilities data store 124 . If a comparison of the prior probabilities data and the keywords included in the offer indicates that the offer result is an accessory, the offer result is demoted ( 408 ).
- the prior probabilities data includes a blacklist that includes words known to be associated with accessories. If an offer result includes a blacklisted word (for example, in its title, and/or in its description) the offer result is demoted.
- keyword 1 keyword 2 . . . keyword n keyword 1 keyword 2 . . . keyword n ,
- n th keyword in the query is the probability that a given offer result is an accessory offer based on the offer result's price and the accessory mean and accessory standard deviation of the n th keyword in the query.
- keyword n , product] can be computed by assuming a Gaussian distribution using the parameters from the distribution data stored, for example in the data store 122 (i.e. the output of the process 200 described with respect to FIG. 2 ).
- the offer result is not demoted, and the next offer result in the result set is read ( 402 ). If the offer result is found to be an accessory, the offer result is demoted ( 408 ).
- the results in the result set include an initial ranking. If the offer result is found to be an accessory, the offer result is demoted by decreasing this initial ranking. Demotion of accessory results lowers the ranking of these results to move them down the ranked list of the results set. Product results are not demoted so that product results appear earlier in the ranked list than accessory results.
- product results can, alternatively, be promoted to move product results higher in a list of ranked results.
- an initial rank of product results for a product query can be increased in rank by a constant amount to move these results toward the top of a list of ranked results.
- the result classifier 114 of the query processor 110 can demote any results determined to be product results or, alternatively, promote accessory results.
- FIG. 5A shows example output records 500 of an intermediate preprocessing step.
- the records include a keyword field, a Boolean field that indicates whether the corresponding offer is classified as an accessory or not, and a price field.
- Example record 502 is classified as a product, and example record 504 is classified as an accessory.
- These records can be output, for example, by the heuristic classification and/or the reclassification operations of the method 200 .
- FIG. 5B shows an example price distribution output record 506 .
- the example record 506 includes a keyword field followed by four floating point numbers. These numbers correspond to, in order: the mean price of offer records classified as products that include the indicated keyword in their titles, the standard deviation of offer records classified as products that include the indicated keyword in their titles, the mean price of offer records classified as accessories that include the indicated keyword in their titles, and the standard deviation of offer records classified as accessories that include the indicated keyword in their titles.
