Definitions
- the present invention relates to multimedia systems using mass storage elements such as compact disks for accessing protected information, and to the application of such systems to personalized transaction management.
- Multimedia systems are a relatively recent development combining computer and mass storage such as compact disk (CD) technology for efficiently accessing works including encyclopedias, vendor catalogs, nationwide telephone listings, legal and technical databases, video games, audio recordings, and video recordings such as full length movies.
- CD compact disk
- Such systems avoid the problems of accessing large quantities of data over telephone lines, for example, which include severe bandwidth limitations and significant utility charges.
- a major problem in this field is the prohibitively high cost of purchasing the stored works outright, particularly in the case of first-run full length movies in the first part of their home video rental release window.
- Present marketing systems are not set up for handling both kinds of transactions for a single mass produced copy of a particular work. Also, there is no practical way to both meter authorized uses of the media while policing pirated copies. Thus many markets for multimedia products such as rental first-run movies are not being adequately served.
- the present invention meets this need by providing a mass storage drive that removably supports a mass storage element and includes a data head having an output for reading tracks of main data elements.
- the data head which can be an optical head, is movable in a predetermined auxiliary path relative to the substrate for scanning a unique machine-readable serial identifier in auxiliary data containing at least 200 bits of information in one or more tracks being exclusive of the main data tracks.
- the mass storage element includes a substrate, a main storage media on the substrate and storing the main data elements, and an auxiliary storage media on the substrate and having the unique machine-readable serial identifier.
- the main data elements are mass-stored data of the type to be read by a data head of a conventional compact disk drive when the data is recorded on a conventional compact disk.
- the main path is movement of the type involving rotation of the disk in combination with tracking movement of the data head of such compact disk drive.
- the auxiliary path is of the type involving rotation of the disk and positioning the auxiliary head means for accessing the auxiliary data elements.
- the main data elements can be substantially read-only in character.
- the main storage media can be adapted for receiving the main data elements by press-molding.
- the main storage media can be adapted for receiving the main data elements by selective radiation.
- the main data elements can be optically readable.
- the substrate and the main storage media can be configured as a rotatable compact disk.
- the auxiliary storage media can be adapted for being recorded and read by a single auxiliary head.
- the auxiliary storage media can be a magnetic coating.
- the auxiliary storage media can be adapted for receiving the auxiliary data elements by selective radiation.
- the mass storage drive also includes a head circuit connected to the data head output and having a main amplifier with an output for signaling main data elements in response to the data head, the circuit having a separate auxiliary output for signaling the auxiliary data elements in response to the data head output.
- the head circuit can include an auxiliary amplifier for driving the auxiliary output.
- the main amplifier can include a first frequency response effective for passing the main data elements, and the auxiliary amplifier can have a second frequency response for passing the auxiliary data elements while effectively blocking the main data elements.
- the main amplifier can have a first reference connection for balancing the main output relative to a data threshold, the auxiliary amplifier having a second reference connection effective for balancing the auxiliary output relative to a serial code threshold of the data head when the data head is reading auxiliary data elements.
- the mass storage element can be a compact disk, the drive means including means for rotating the disk.

- FIG. 15 is a detail plan view showing further details of the mass storage element of FIG. 11.
- a multimedia system 10 includes a transaction terminal 12 having a television monitor 14 which can be a conventional TV receiver, a pair of speakers 16, and a transaction unit 18.
- the transaction unit 18 includes a terminal drive unit 20 for accessing a selected mass storage element 22 which can be a high-density optical disk (CD), the drive unit 20 having conventional means (not shown) for reading information recorded on the element 22.
- CDS are particularly advantageous as mass media for distribution to a multiplicity of users in that they can be mass-produced by pressing from a master recording. The direct copying such as by pressing initially renders the copies indistinguishable from each other.
- the present invention provides for tracking individual copies of such mass-produced works for permitting a variety of initial and subsequent transactions involving the works.
- the terminal drive unit 20 includes means for reading a unique serial number or code 24 that is formed in or on the mass storage element 22, the means being designated bar code reader 23.
- the bar code reader 23 can be provided as an extension of the tracking range of a conventional playback head of the drive unit 20 as an alternative to having a separate stationary (low resolution) head.
- many conventional CDS have an inside track carrying a bar code that is mass-produced together with the mass-copied data, the mass-produced bar code identifying the particular work that is reproduced in the CD.
- the conventional bar code is used in existing inventory and stocking schemes, and is not intended to be read by ordinary CD players. As shown in FIG.
- the serial code 24 is located in the annular space of the CD 22 that can also contain the conventional bar code.
- One method for producing the serial code 24 is by laser-etching a reflective coating of the CD 22 that also contains the mass-produced data (and can also contain the mass-produced bar code).
- the serial code 24 is unique to each copy of the CD 22, and preferably includes further identification of the particular work, so that the work and the particular copy thereof are discernable by operation of the bar code reader 23. It will be understood that other methods of producing the serial code 24 are possible, including by application of an adhesive label, and by directly molding or pressing bar code elements into the CD 22 using movable die elements that are electrically driven under computer control.
- serial code 24 can be recorded together with other mass-stored data when the mass storage element 22 is a CD-R (recordable) disk. Further, other locations for the serial code 24 are possible, such as radially inside or outside of the mass-produced bar code. Moreover, it is preferred that at least a portion of the serial code 24 be alterable for recording status information as further described below. Accordingly, and with particular reference to FIG. 1A, a portion of the serial code 24, designated read/write serial code 24', is formed as a magnetic stripe using means well known in the credit card industry.
- an important and preferred configuration of the system 10 includes the terminal drive unit 20 having the bar code reader 23 including a magnetic read/write head 232, and a main read head 234.
- the drive unit 20 is adapted for removably receiving the element 22, being configured as a rotatable compact disk having a substantially rigid substrate 222, on a disk drive 236, the main read head 234 being movable inwardly and outwardly relative to the disk drive 236 for accessing tracks of main data elements that are pre-stored in a conventional manner in a main storage media 224 on the substrate 222.
- the read/write serial code 24' is formed in an auxiliary storage media 226 of the element 22, the auxiliary storage media 226 being located for access by the read/write head 232. Magnetic material for the auxiliary storage media 226 to receive the serial code portion 24' can be applied as part of a process for labeling the CD 22.
- serial code 24 In implementations wherein only a portion of the serial code 24 is alterable, it is contemplated that the portion 24' be radially offset from the remainder of the code 24 as shown in FIG. 1A.

- the key memory device 38 is omitted, functions thereof being provided internal to a counterpart of the transaction controller 30.
- the start up CD 22' and installation manual guide the (untrained) user through an installation process using the remote controller 36, no keyboard, mouse, or other computer-like device being required.
- the installation manual explains how to make the preliminary connections to the transaction unit 18 in order to view the start up CD 22'. Also, because it is necessary to turn the transaction unit 18 and the TV monitor 14 off when making the final connections, the manual serves as a handy reference where the installation setup shown on the startup CD 22 can be copied.
- the startup CD 22' is normally retained by the user to serve as a troubleshooting guide and operational reference after the installation has been successfully completed.
- Information e.g. name, address, credit card number
- a trained customer service representative by means of a one-time telephone call placed by the user, the information being entered through the database processor 46 of the TPF 40 into the index 48 by the service terminal 50.
- a data call is established between the transaction unit 18 and the TPF 40 over the network 42 for loading all of this information into the key memory device 38 (or other memory) using the key interface 26.
- This call is initiated by the transaction unit 18 or the TPF 40 depending on the particular system configuration.
- the transaction unit 18 indicates (via the TV monitor 14) that it has received the initialization information and the user is ready to begin any of several applications. Trained installers can be made available for consultation by telephone once transaction unit 18 is connected to the TV monitor 14.
- the transaction unit 18 plugs into an ordinary 120 volt AC outlet, a modular telephone jack, the antenna input of the TV monitor 14, and any other related home entertainment device, such as a VCR.

- the user hooks up all of the connections in accordance with the installation guide and turns on the transaction unit 18.
- the transaction unit 18 checks that the installation is correct, and if not, displays an appropriate error message to the user via the TV monitor 14.
- the necessary background information includes names and PINs (personal identification numbers), telephone number, credit cards with expiration dates, address, credit/advance amounts to be stored with maximum, minimum, and thresholds, mailing addresses for purchases, and default mailing method.
- a data call is then established over the network 42 as described above, for sending the necessary information from the TPF 40 to the transaction unit 18. Communications between the TPF 40 and the transaction unit 18 are secured by appropriate data encryption.
- public and private keys for encryption/decryption is contemplated in the present invention. Public/private key protocol is available under license from RSA Data Security Corp.
- the transaction controller 30 is firmware-programmed in a main routine 100 for appropriate operations with the mass storage element (CD) 22 in one of several formats.
- control is passed to a normal start step 102 and upon loading of the CD 22, the terminal drive unit 20 is activated in an initial play step 104 for reading header information from the CD 22, that information being interrogated in a format test sequence 106 for branching to an appropriate play routine 108, which can be a game routine 108A, a movie routine 108B, a catalog routine 108C, or an open routine 108D.
- control is passed to an eject step 110, then returned to the normal start step 102.
- the main routine 100 further includes a set-up test step 112 that is automatically entered upon power up for determining whether the transaction unit 18 has been initialized. If so, control is passed to the normal start step 102; otherwise, a set-up routine 114 is performed as shown in FIG. 3.
- a test startup CD step 116 blocks further processing until the startup CD 22' that is formatted for initialization is present.
- a message prompting insertion of the key memory device 38 is sent to the TV monitor 14 in a key prompt step 118, followed by a test key step 120 for determining the presence of and valid communication with the key memory device 38. (As indicated above, the key memory device 38 is omitted in the alternative configuration of FIGS. 7-10, discussed below.)
- If the valid communication is established within a predetermined time limit, control is passed to a test TPF call step 124; otherwise, an error message step 122 appropriately signals the TV monitor 14, with control returning to the test startup CD step 116.
- the set up routine 114 waits for completion of a data call with the TPF 40 as described above, the PIN and other personal data being transmitted over the transaction network 42 during the call.
- the received data is stored in flash memory (of the key memory device 38 or elsewhere in the transaction controller 30) in a user data update step 126, the data also being displayed on the TV monitor 14 in a user data display step 128.
- the received data also includes a date by which a subsequent TPF telephone contact is expected.
- a test data step 130 is entered for the user to verify whether the displayed data is consistent with that given verbally to personnel operating the TPF 40. If not, a user input step 132 is entered for permitting user corrections to be made, after which the test data step 130 is repeated.
- control is passed to a test changes step 134 for invoking a transmit data step 136 in case changes were made, the set-up routine 114 concluding in an eject CD step 138.
- the transmit data step 136 the edited personnel data is transmitted over the transaction network 42 to the TPF 40 where it is stored for further use as described below.
- a session begins when the user inserts a selected CD or mass storage element 22 into the terminal drive unit 20 of the transaction unit 18. Operations are displayed on the TV monitor 14 in an intuitive graphical user interface while the user makes selections with the remote controller 36 from the choices displayed. Available operations are determined by the type of mass storage element 22 inserted into the terminal drive unit 20. At this point, if the transaction unit 18 has received a text message from the TPF 40, the user will be informed, for example, that certain catalogs have been updated or that certain promotions are in effect. The user is prompted to make selections, using the remote controller 36 to select items on the TV monitor 14, to progress through the session.
- Preferably messages, commands, or updated information transmitted from the TPF 40 are accompanied by a new date by which a subsequent TPF 40 contact is expected. If there has been no call prior to this date, then the transaction unit 18 is to automatically initiate a call for updated instructions from the TPF 40. If the transaction unit 18 is unable to contact the TPF 40, then the user is advised in an error message to check the telephone line. This error message is repeated each time the unit 18 has a CD 22 inserted until the call to the TPF 40 is completed. After a set number of days without contact with the TPF 40, then the firmware in the transaction unit 18 will cause the unit 18 to disable its own operation.
- the transaction unit 18 prompts the user to insert the key memory device 38 into the transaction unit 18, if it is not already in place, and enter a counterpart of the personal identification number (PIN) using the remote controller 36, as further described below.
- PIN personal identification number
- Each person in a household may have his own PIN number stored on the key memory device 38 to uniquely identify each authorized user to the transaction unit 18. Credit information, restrictions on use (such as viewing up to PG rated movies only), catalog ordering information, etc., are associated with each PIN number, this information being duplicated at the TPF 40.
- the system 10 is configured to minimize use of the user's home telephone or other network channel, both in terms of the number and the duration of calls. Other than the cost of a local telephone call, all related voice and data telephone call charges of the system are contemplated to be free to the user. Still, in view of the computer or fax modems typically in home offices, or when teenagers are present, there is competition for use of a single home telephone line. Therefore, if the home telephone is in use when the transaction unit 18 attempts to call the TPF 40, the transaction unit 18 can be programmed to retry the telephone call at a later time until successful. Alternatively, a data-over-voice protocol is contemplated.
- the user receives catalog mass storage elements 22 in the mail or by other appropriate channels.
- the transaction controller 30 causes header information to be read from the CD 22 in the format test sequence 106.
- the sequence 106 checks for a digital signature to determine that the catalog is authorized for use on the system before entering the catalog routine 108C as described above.
- the catalog routine 108C enables the user to browse or search for specific items, normally without entering a PIN as described above. Only when the user actually orders an item is the PIN necessary.
- the user can elect to view the mass storage elements 22 at a neighbor's home or a second house having a counterpart of the transaction unit 18, and can place orders provided the user's key memory device 38 is present.
- the presentation of catalog items by the system 10 is greatly enhanced by use of stereo sound, graphics, text, and full-motion video combined in easy to use multimedia format.
- the transaction unit 18 automatically sends the order to the catalog retailer's order entry computer via the TPF 40.
- the user quickly receives confirmation of availability and total price of the order. Filling out the order on the TV monitor 14 requires only selecting the items desired, as all necessary information pertaining to the user is already stored on the user's key memory device 38 (or other memory of the transaction controller 30).
- the system 10 After the system 10 completes the order form and sends it to the retailer's computer, the retailer's normal fulfillment procedures are invoked, and the purchased items are mailed directly from the catalog retailer to the user. Any problems or returns are dealt with by the retailer and any reversals of charges that may be required are accomplished automatically and recorded by the database processor 46 of the TPF 40.
- the user can elect to use the telephone for placing an order with the catalog retailer's operator. Confirmation of the order and the purchase orders are mailed directly from the catalog retailer to the user. Any problems or returns are dealt with by the retailer, including reversal of charges.
- the transaction unit 18 is intended never to be turned off, going into a standby mode when not being used in order to receive catalog updates and promotional messages.
- catalog retailers are also able to keep pricing current through communications to the transaction unit 18, even after the catalog has been published.
- close coordination with catalog retailers, combined with the two way communications capability of the system 10, enables both the user and the retailer to benefit from the availability of special sale prices on a daily basis.
- a major feature of the system 10 is the capability of playing full length feature movies on a single mass storage element or CD 22. These movies are distributed in a variety of ways, such as from video stores, vending machines, or through the mail. Because of the minimal manufacturing cost of CDs, they do not need to be returned to the video store or any other distribution center. Thus the user can maintain a movie library at home for personal use or to give or lend to others.
- the user picks up a movie CD at the local video store and pays a small usage charge that covers two 24 hour viewing periods.
- control is passed to the movie routine 108B as described above.
- the movie routine 108B first obtains header information including a billing rate and expiration date from the CD 22 in a header step 140.
- the expiration date is compared with an internal calendar in a test expiration step 142 for determining possible expiration of authorized use, in which case an appropriate message is displayed in an expired message step 144, followed by termination of the movie routine 108B using a counterpart of the eject CD step 138.
- the drive unit 20 is activated in a play open step 148 for playing selected information from the CD 22, the selected information being typically a free preview of the main contents of the CD 22.
- the billing routine 150 first determines whether the CD 22 is owned for unlimited play in a test unlimited step 152.
- serial numbers and ownership status of each CD 22 can be stored in memory of the key memory device 38.
- such information can be stored in other memory of the transaction unit 18.
- the same information is also stored in the index 48 of the TPF 40.
- a call over the transaction network 42 for accessing same is initiated only in the event of a malfunction or other extraordinary circumstance in order to avoid unnecessary delay and usage of the network 42.
- control is passed to an update memory step 154 wherein flash memory of the key memory device 38 or other non-volatile memory of the transaction unit 18 is updated if necessary, after which authorization for playing the main contents is returned to the movie routine 108B via an authorized exit step 156.
- the update memory step 154 can include overwriting the read/write serial code 24' with the current authorization status of the CD 22.
- further testing of the status of the CD 22 can be implemented locally without placing a telephone call to the TPF 40.
- decryption key information for the CD 22 is pre-loaded into the transaction terminal 18 during previous telephonic communication.
- the number of communications between the transaction terminal 18 and the TPF 40 is significantly reduced, with corresponding cost savings.
- test unlimited step 152 control is passed from the test unlimited step 152 to a test start step 158 for determining whether a first timed billing period had previously been initiated. If not, initiation of the first period is done in a start first step 160 by retrieving the current date and time, with control being passed to the update memory step 154 for storing the current date and time in an appropriate memory location. If the first period had been initiated, expiration thereof is determined in a test first period step 162 wherein the previously stored date and time, plus a predetermined duration of the first period (24 hours, for example), is compared with the current date and time.
- control is passed to the update memory step 154 (which can be alternatively bypassed here); otherwise, a counterpart of the test start step, designated 158', is performed for determining whether a second timed billing period had been started. If not, a counterpart of the start first step 160, designated start second step 164, is done, followed by the update memory step 154 as described above; otherwise, a test second period step 166 for determining whether the second period has not expired, in which case control is passed to the update memory step 154 as described above; otherwise, an option for unlimited play is presented on the TV monitor 14 in an offer unlimited step 168, after which a test accepted step 170 is executed for determining acceptance of the offer by the user.
- control is passed to the update memory step 154 for storing the unlimited play election; otherwise, an alternative option is presented in an offer single view step 172, which is followed by a counterpart of the test accepted step 170.
- control is returned to the start second step 164, followed by the update memory step 154 for storage of acceptance and initiation of the "second" billing period. If the single view offer is refused, an unauthorized exit 174 is taken for reflecting same in returning to the movie routine 108B.
- control is passed in the movie routine 108B to a test paid step 176 for determining whether use beyond that previously paid for was requested. If not, the required decryption key is requested from the key memory device 38 in a get key step 178, and a test key step 180 is executed for determining successful access to the key. If the key was available from the device 38 (or elsewhere in the transaction unit 18), control is passed to a decrypting play step 182 for continuing play of the CD 22 beyond the initial unencrypted portion. Upon completed play of the movie, program control returns to the eject step 110 of the main routine 100.
- the decryption key is obtained by telephone using the transaction network 42 in a get TPF key step 184, followed 1by a key store step 186 in which the key is stored in appropriate non-volatile memory (of the key memory device 38).
- a payment request step 188 is performed wherein an appropriate message is sent to the TV monitor 14 for requesting payment authorization.
- a test authorization step 190 returns control to the billing routine 150 if authorized; otherwise, control is passed to the main routine 100 for ejection without further play of the CD 22.
- the first viewing period starts from the time of first play, not when the CD 22 leaves the store.
- the second viewing period may start at any time thereafter.
- This approach provides the consumer with a more convenient and cost-effective means for obtaining movies than by traditional video store time rental services. If the user subsequently decides to acquire additional 24 hour viewing periods, no further action on his part is required. He merely plays the CD 22 on the transaction unit 18, and an incremental usage fee will be automatically charged to his account. Also, the user may instead decide to purchase the movie for unlimited play, which transaction can also be implemented from the convenience of home on the transaction unit 18.
- the system 10 is also designed for the user to play video games and other multimedia entertainment CDs 22 using the joy stick unit 34 to play games or navigate through multimedia applications.
- Existing multimedia personal computer CDs can be supported by the system 10, the publisher being able to change the price/use combination at the TPF 40.
- the terminal drive unit 20 of the system 10 also has the capability to play standard audio formatted CDs, just like a standard audio CD player, the transaction unit 18 having stereo outputs for connecting to the user's amplifier or surround sound system for providing high fidelity sound. Track selection and other functions can be selected by the remote controller 36.
- the transaction unit 18 can be configured to further enable the user to display images on a Kodak® Photo CD, the images being viewed using the remote controller 36 with Photo CD Access software.
- the transaction unit 18 is like a blend of an audio CD player, a multimedia personal computer and a laser disk player, all housed in a single box about the size of a consumer VHS player. Accordingly, the transaction unit 18 provides a subset of operations and connections found on each of these entertainment systems, in addition to the key interface 26 (and/or flash memory of the transaction controller 30), the transaction interface 28, and the transaction controller 30.
- correlation of the mass storage element 22 with transactions involving same is achieved by operation of the vendor terminal 54, wherein the particular serial numbers of the CDs 22 that are sold by that vendor are read by the bar code reader 58 and transmitted to the index 48 of the TPF 40. At the same time (or at a different time) other data unique to the user can also be transmitted from the vendor terminal 54 to the index 48 for correlating vendor sale of the element 22.
- the transaction terminal 18 provides correlation of the element 22 with user play transactions by operation of the bar code reader 23 in conjunction with the key memory device 38, the key memory device 38 (or other memory of the terminal 18) being loaded with user and serial number authorization data as provided from the TPF 40.
- Another correlation capability is achieved by tracking blocks or ranges of serial numbers on mass storage elements 22 that are delivered to particular vendors, that information being stored in the index 48 of the TPF 40.
- the serial number is read by the bar code reader 23, the number being correlatable with the corresponding number (or range containing the number) in the index 48 for associating the element 22 with the particular vendor that sold it, thereby enabling payments for plays of the element 22 beyond what was initially sold to be made to the vendor.
- the correlation which is also based on the serial number of the CD 22, is first made using communications with the TPF 40 over the terminal network 42, with appropriate authorization and decryption data being stored in the key memory device 38, subsequent plays in accordance with the authorization being monitored locally by the transaction terminal 18.
- the title and other data identifying the particular work sold, the type of sale (limited or unlimited play), and the purchaser is transmitted from the vendor terminal 54 to the TPF 40 over the provider network 42' for storage in the index 48. Correlation is accomplished at the transaction terminal 12 as in the previous example, based on the title and other identifying data (but not a unique serial number) under the presumption that only one copy of a particular work would be purchased by a single user, or the copy in use is the one most recently purchased by the user. Thus it is not required to use either of the bar code readers 23 or 58.
- the title and other data needed for identifying a particular work is stored in the index 48 together with data identifying the vendor and the purchaser (user).

- a device suitable for use as the SPU 70 is being made available based on internal reference No. SPU2.0/PV3, from National Semiconductor Corp. of Sunnyvale, Calif.
- FIG. 9 shows a preferred implementation of the terminal drive unit 20, implemented in a conventional manner for playing full motion video (movies), except that quad density playback is contemplated. It will be understood that the total capacity of each CD 22 is proportional to the recording density and to the effective area of the recorded medium. Thus there is a trade-off between the size and the density of the CD 22 for obtaining a desired playing time using a given recording format. Also shown in FIG. 9 is a separate audio output for use in playing conventional audio disks, which output can directly drive an audio decoder that is described below in connection with FIG. 10.

- the leadout region 226 surrounds a main data region 228 that contains mass-recorded data of the work to be output from the terminal drive unit 20, the main data region 228 having an inside radius R I , and an outside radius R O .
- An annular "leadin" region 230 extends outwardly to the inside radius R I , the regions 226, 228 and 230 being within the main storage media 224.
- FIG. 11 shows a process 300 for producing the CD 22, including a master step 302 for preparing a master record, followed by a mass record step 304 in which counterparts of the master record are copied onto a multiplicity of substrates 222 having the main storage media 224 thereon.
- the mass record step 304 can include press-molding the substrate 222, followed by applying a reflective metalization layer. It will be understood that the data can be recorded in encrypted form, and that the data can be differently encrypted on various ones of the substrate 222.
- a serializer apparatus 306 is then used in the process 300, the apparatus 306 having a counter 308 is incremented with the passage of each of the mass-recorded substrates 222, feeding a serial number S n to an encrypter 310.
- the serial number S n can range from 1 to N where N is the total number of mass recordings to be made from a single master. It will be understood that other protocols for the serial number are contemplated.
- the encrypter 310 scrambles the serial number, either alone or in combination with other information such as a work identifier and/or authorization level as discussed above, and feeds the resulting composite code to a shift register 312.
- the composite code is serially presented by the shift register 312 to a driver 314 that feeds a selective radiation device such as a laser etcher 316 for selectively altering the main storage media 224, thereby creating the serial code 24 of the CD 22.
- the laser etcher 316 can include a conventional fixed laser device that operates in conjunction with an acoustic optical modulator (AOM) and an optical focusing system to selectively irradiate a region of approximately 25 micron diameter sufficiently to etch the metalization layer of the CD 22, the CD 22 being rotated in a predetermined manner by a counterpart of the disk drive 236, designated 318.
- AOM acoustic optical modulator
- the 11 includes the further steps of counting the CDS 22 for generating a unique serial number associated with each copy from the master, encrypting the serial number, and writing the encrypted result as the serial code 24 within the main storage media 224 of the completed CD 22. It will be understood that generation of the serial code 24 in a single pass as described above results in the width ⁇ R being approximately 25 microns.
- the focusing system of the laser etcher 316 can be configured for producing a radially narrower etch, and the serial code 24 can be generated in multiple passes (rotations of the substrate 222) with the etching being done at progressively changing radii for forming the serial code 24 with the width ⁇ F being greater than the etching width by any desired amount.
- the etching can be done in segments that are angularly dispersed for preserving sufficient information content of the "leadout" data to retain functionality such as for servo head tracking.
- the disk drive 318 can include counterparts of the main read head 234 and associated components (not shown) for verifying successful completion of the etching and initiating appropriate corrective action, if necessary.
- the drive unit 20 includes a CD ROM mechanism 240 and a diode amplifier/laser supply 242, the diode amplifier thereof having a main output 244 that feeds a CD decoder 246 and a digital servo circuit 248 that controls the motion of the main read head 234 (FIG. 1A).
- FIG. 12 shows a preferred configuration of the drive unit 20 for use with the CDS 22 as produced by the process 300.
- the main read head 234 is movable outwardly beyond the boundary radius R for purposes known to those having skill in the art, the main storage media of conventional CD elements also so extending.
- the diode amplifier counterpart of FIG. 12 has an auxiliary output 254 that is fed from upstream of the main amplifier 252, such as by an auxiliary amplifier 256 that is driven by the preamplifier 250.
- the data density of the serial code 24 is typically significantly lower than that of the mass-recorded data, and while the main amplifier 252 is best optimized for high frequencies over a limited bandwidth, it is preferred that the auxiliary output 254 provide useful signals at a much lower frequency.
- the preamplifier 250 is optional but, if present, it should not completely cut off signal components having frequencies below the bandwidth of the main amplifier 252.
- the auxiliary amplifier 256 is optional.
- the output of the main amplifier 252 is typically digital (clipped or binary), the output of the auxiliary amplifier 256 can be analog (linear) or digital.
- the main amplifier 252 is responsive to a high first reflectivity 258 and a lower second reflectivity 260 of mass recorded data, the etched regions of the serial code 24 presenting a very much lower third reflectivity 262.
- the main amplifier 252 can be balanced to detect a data threshold reflectivity 264 that is between the first and second reflectivities 258 and 260.
- FIG. 14 shows in simplified form an implementation of the amplifiers 250, 252 and 256 that applies the above considerations.
- the main amplifier 252 in FIG. 14 has a main bandpass amplifier 268 that feeds a main comparator 270 having a data reference input D that corresponds to the data threshold reflectivity 264.
- the auxiliary amplifier 256 includes an auxiliary bandpass amplifier 272 that feeds an auxiliary comparator having a serial code reference input C that corresponds to the serial code threshold reflectivity 266.
- the bit rate of the main data is on the order of 50 times or more higher than that of the auxiliary data, thereby facilitating discrimination between signals output on the main output 244 and those output on the auxiliary output 254 using the bandpass amplifiers 268 and 272.
- the mass recorded data has a channel bit rate of approximately 24 Mbits/sec.
- the auxiliary data rate of the serial code 24 is approximately 164 Kbits/sec.
- dimensional parameters of presently contemplated DVD disks include a substrate outside diameter DS of 120 mm, the outside radius R O of the main data region 228 being 58 mm maximum, the leadout region 226 having a maximum radius R L that is 58.5 mm maximum.
- a maximum "wobble" or eccentricity of recorded tracks of these DVD disks is 100 microns total, which includes 40 microns between the tracks and the locating diameter of the substrate 222, 40 microns for the disk drive 236, and 20 microns for miscellaneous contributions such as variations in locating the substrate 222 on the disk drive 236. It is further contemplated that the tracks are spaced approximately 1 micron center-to-center.
- a preferred location of the serial code 24 is near the outside of the leadout region.
- the serial code 24 can be located between an inside radius R1 of approximately 58,455 microns and an outside radius R2 of approximately 58,480 microns.
- the width ⁇ R is increased to approximately 125 microns for reliable detection without servo tracking, R1 being reduced to approximately 58,355 microns.
- the serial code 24 is preferably distributed in angularly spaced segments 24A, 24B, 24C, etc., with dummy data of the leadout region 226 being interspersed between the segments for enabling servo tracking of the main read head 234.
- the system of the present invention provides the ability to shop at home by browsing through a wide variety of fully interactive multimedia catalogs, many of the items being illustrated using video, the items ordered being automatically shipped to the user's door. Also full length feature movies can be viewed on the system, the user purchasing the movie from a rental store, a small fee being billed to the user each time the movie is viewed, with the option to purchase unlimited private viewing rights.
- the system of the present invention also permits playing of video games and educational multimedia applications, such as multimedia encyclopedias, either with the addition of appropriate header information or by configuring the system 10 directly play CD ROM disks that are currently available for personal computers.
- the system 10 can also be implemented to play open format CDs such as standard audio and video CDs as well as Kodak® Photo CDs, the photographic images being viewed on the user's home television.
- the CD elements 22 can be sold with authorization for a single play or multiple plays during a single time interval, with subsequent plays or authorized time intervals being contracted for using the transaction unit 18 as described above.
- the authorization can be for a predetermined number of plays in an unlimited time interval.
- the option for unlimited play may omitted or offered based on switches that are down-loaded from the TPF 40.
- the duration of specific play authorizations and pricing therefor can also be altered by down-loading switches.
- the CD elements can be provided without the unencrypted free preview portions.
- Set-up and/or operation of the transaction unit 18 can be implemented with communication to the TPF 40 initiated only by the transaction interface 28 for avoiding audible rings on telephones that may be present on user premises.
- software games can be developed specifically for the system 10, and the system 10 can include a cartridge slot for allowing the addition of electronics for the playing of games using third party standards.
- correlation of vendors with user transactions can be based on numbers of copies of particular works that each vendor contributed to (by creation, production, sale). Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not necessarily be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein.
