With reference to figure 3, wherein describe and what discuss is the reduced form of an arrangement of data symbols in the communication protocol that helps to detect duplicated communication units.Fig. 3 has described and has been used for oppositely or the different data of up link (mobile radio station is to the base station) cdma service amount or payload channel or code sign arrangement, and wherein this channel has used the variable-data-rate transmission for some radio configuration.This accompanying drawing is with Physical Layer Standard for cdma200 Spread Spectrum Systems (3GPP2 C.S002; The 3.0th edition, version date: on June 15 calendar year 2001, can obtain by third generation partner program 2 tissue) the 2nd～115 page accompanying drawing 2.1.3.1.9.1-1 is for the basis in.Example described below is applicable to radio configuration 1, and wherein this radio configuration refers to one of some configurations by above-mentioned prescribed by standard.Should be noted that notion of describing and discussing and principle can be applied to other radio arrangements.What in general, " radio configuration " described is modulation and the encoding scheme that is used for radio interface.For instance, radio configuration 1 (RC1) and the shared identical modulation scheme of 2 (RC2), but be to use different chnnel coding strategies.As everyone knows, compare with RC2, it is available that RC1 has more error correction/detection bits; RC2 then is " punchinging " scheme of carrying out on its coded data, so that convert its data flow to the symbol code check identical with RC1, has reduced the quantity of available error correction/detection bits among the RC2 (and having reduced its chnnel coding gain) so effectively.
What Fig. 3 showed is the universal architecture of the Frame 303 on the backward channel, wherein the duration of this frame is 20 milliseconds (ms), and 16 power control groups have been comprised (as shown in the figure, these groups are with 0～15 numbering) 305, wherein the length or the duration of each power control group all are 1.25ms.Each power control group all comprises 6 modulation symbols, and what each modulation symbol was represented is 6 code signs.Therefore, if all power control groups have all comprised data, the frame of a 20ms can comprise nearly 576 code signs or 96 modulation symbols so.Variable-data-rate is the desired data rate of the data volume that must send on uplink channel according to communication unit, for example frame and realizes by using different frames to arrange.It is noted that described frame produces after handling through normal receiver, wherein said processing comprises according to the extended code of particular communication unit carries out despreading and demodulation or the like.
What Frame 309 showed is a full rate data frame, and wherein all 16 power control groups can comprise data.In this example, described full-rate vocoding is used to the frame of 9600 or 14400 bps (bps).What Frame 311 was described is the Frame of half rate or 1/2 speed, wherein has only 8 groups can comprise data in 16 power control groups, as shown in pattern 312.Described 1/2 rate frame is used to 4800 or the frame of 7200bps.What Frame 313 showed is 1/4th speed or 1/4 speed data frame, wherein has only 4 can comprise data in 16 power control groups, as shown in pattern 314.Described 1/4 rate frame is used to 2400 and the frame of 3600bps.What Frame 315 showed is 1/8th or 1/8 speed data frame, wherein has only 2 can comprise data in 16 power control groups, as shown in pattern 316.Described 1/8 rate frame is used to 1200 or the frame of 1800bps.
312,314,316 shown specific patterns only are as illustration, and are derived according to the Data Burst RandomizingAlgorithm (data burst randomized algorithm) of the 2.1.3.1.9.2 defined in the standard of above quoting that is used for suitable communication unit or radio configuration (for example 1 of the language of this standard and 2).The data burst randomized algorithm produces the mask pattern of being made up of " 0 " and " 1 ", and this pattern shields the redundant data that the repetition of (mask out) known code is produced with random fashion.This mask pattern be by frame data speed and from the corresponding long code of communication unit the chunk of 14 bits that obtain determine.Long code mask then is to produce from the Electronic Serial Number of communication unit.These 14 bits can be last 14 bits 319 that are used for the long code expanded afterwards in last power control group (for example group 14) that follows previous frame 317 closely.In other words, these bits are 14 bits of appearance in power control group (1.25ms) before described each reverse fundamental channel frame boundary.Shown in 321, these 14 bits represent with b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11, b12, b13, and wherein b0 represents is the earliest bit, and what b13 represented is last bit.Should be noted that for the position of the data burst shown in the randomized patterns 312,314,316, having only 8 bits is strict needs.The time slot that algorithm described herein has used 14 bits to guarantee to be used for the transmission of 1/4th speed datas is the subclass that is used for the time slot of half rate, guarantees at the time slot that uses on 1/8th speed it is the subclass of the time slot that uses on 1/4th speed in addition.
The data burst randomized algorithm is as giving a definition:
If selected data rate is a full data rate, for example 9600 or 14400bps; Transmission is carried out in power control group 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 so.
If selected data rate is a half rate, for example 4800 or 7200bps; Transmission should be to control in the group at the power that is numbered b0,2+b1,4+b2,6+b3,8+b4,10+b5,12+b6,14+b7 to carry out so.
If selected data rate is 1/4 speed, for example 2400 or 3600bps; Transmission should be to carry out in the power control group of following numbering so: if b8=' 0 ' then is b0; If b8=' 1 ' then is 2+b1; If b9=' 0 ' then is 4+b2; If b9=' 1 ' then is 6+b3; If b10=' 0 ' then is 8+b4; If b10=' 1 ' then is 10+b5; If b11=' 0 ' then is 12+b6; If b11=' 1 ' then is 14+b7.
If selected data rate is 1/8 speed, for example 1200 or 1800bps; Transmission should be carried out in the power control group of following numbering so: if (b8 b12)=(' 0 ', ' 0 '), then is b0; If (b8 b12)=(' 1 ', ' 0 '), then is 2+b1; If (b9 b12)=(' 0 ', ' 1 '), then is 4+b2; If (b9 b12)=(' 0 ', ' 1 '), then is 4+b2; If (b9 b12)=(' 1 ', ' 1 '), then is 6+b3; If (b10 b13)=(' 0 ', ' 0 '), then is 8+b4; If (b10 b13)=(' 1 ', ' 0 '), then is 10+b5; If (b11 b13)=(' 0 ', ' 1 '), then is 12+b6; If (b11 b13)=(' 1 ', ' 1 '), then is 14+b7.
Illustrative pattern the 312,314, the 316th is by using b0-b13=00101101100100 and being derived by using above-mentioned randomized algorithm or produce.
Opposite with clone's communication unit, the authorized communication unit is to operate according to the data arrangement of Fig. 3, and the brief description of how operating about described communication unit helps to understand according to notion of the present invention and principle.In case will be granted unit be assigned to reverse traffic channel, data rate will be selected according to current voice or data activity on the authorized communication unit in this unit so.If there is not activity, for example be in silent status, granted unit will keep quiet so, and will select 1/8 rate frame according to the cdma2000 vocoder standard that is suitable for.Clone's unit then can be quiet all the time, so that monitor communication, and avoid on channel, otherwise being detected.If provided vocoder standard, this means that so the unit of cloning or duplicating will transmit null information in power control group according to the appropriate pattern that is used for 1/8 rate frame.Example about this 1/8 rate frame transmission is described at the 4.6th joint of 3GPP2 EnhancedVariable Rate Codec (3GPP2 enhanced variable rate codec) standard C .S0014-0.
As indicated above, have to be used for 1/4,1/2 and the subclass of the power control group of the data of full-rate vocoding a kind of in therefore will there will be two kinds of situations owing to comprised the power control group of the data that are used for 1/8 rate frame.If granted unit is sending information, will disturb the corresponding power control group of the authorized communication unit of controlling oneself so from power control group that cloned communication unit sends with 1/8 speed or null value group, and when comparing, in the power control group of 1/8 speed, will observe lower quality or higher interference with other power control groups.As an alternative, if two communication units all are quiet, for example be in silent status, the power control group that is used for 1/8 rate frame so will comprise identical information, null frames for example, thus, concerning the observer who is in the there, base station that just receives composite signal, he can observe unusual high power level, and wherein said composite signal is made up of the symbol of coherent superposition.
Thus, the power level of other power control groups that the power level of the power control group by observing or measure 1/8 speed or corresponding with it data symbol or power control that substitute and 1/8 speed group are associated can be assessed the communication unit that whether has the clone.Equally, by observing credit rating, interference level or the power of 1/8 speed control group, can produce one and be used to show the reasonable indication that whether has cloned communication unit with respect to the relative quality or the interference level of other power control groups.In addition, clearly, the variation of observed interference or degree of relatively disturbing or power level can be the function of the selected or data rate that uses in authorized communication unit.For instance,, in four power control groups, will have two phase mutual interference so if what use is 1/4 speed, yet if usefulness be full-rate vocoding, will have 2 so in 16 groups is the phase mutual interference.Therefore, selected threshold value depends on the parameter of measured or assessment and is the selected frame rate in authorized communication unit.Under the relative error condition of cost of having write down on any direction, those of ordinary skill can be by deriving or testing and determine appropriate threshold value.It is noted that whether power and interference or these difference of credit rating aspect probably are observed on a plurality of frames thus, exist the judgement of cloning the unit can be repeatedly to be viewed as the basis on a plurality of frames.
With reference to figure 4, this figure describes and has discussed the flow chart of the method embodiment that is used to detect cloned communication unit.The method of Fig. 4 both can be carried out or realized by the equipment of Fig. 2 or data handling system 209, also can carry out or realized by other equipment with identity function or ability.The flow chart description of Fig. 4 be a kind of be used to detect duplicate or the method for cloned communication unit, this flow chart is in 401 beginnings.In 403, received signal, wherein for instance, this signal has comprised a data symbol sebolic addressing, and these symbols can be arranged according to the diagram among Fig. 3.Then, in 405, based on the parameter of groups of data symbols, for example power, quality or interference level determine whether signal is derived from a plurality of communication units, the communication unit of for example authorizing and cloning.If show the communication unit that has the clone, then 407 show that refusal or termination are used for the service of described particular communication unit (ESN, MIN or the like), in addition, for instance, if wish, then send and be used to indicate and safeguard or the text message or some the similar message of service that to this unit this method finishes 409 then.Described method both can periodically repeat, and also can carry out when carrying out new each time traffic channel assignments, can also otherwise carry out according to the hope of system operator.
In more detail, 405 carry out be used for determine that whether signal can comprise additional treatments from the processing of a plurality of communication units, and these processing can change according to the air interface protocol scheme.In general, these additional treatments are actually the appropriate part in selective reception signal or the symbol, and some parameter of this part is compared with some desired value that is used for this parameter, so that judge the communication unit that has the clone.In the system of variable-data-rate, determine or judge that the processing of frame rate is very useful as being used for 411.Then, 413, select one or more groups of data symbols, wherein these groups as above can be depending on frame rate described in the argumentation of Fig. 3.Under the situation of the power control group that has provided relevant groups of data symbols, for example Fig. 3, meeting is assessed and is measured the one or more groups or the parameter of the part of one or more groups in 415, and this parameter for example is power level or credit rating.Then, in 417, with first parameter and the threshold that is adopted, when satisfying this threshold value, decision signal is from a plurality of communication units in 419, and wherein for instance, a clone unit is in the work.If do not satisfy this threshold value, this method can finish 409 so, if satisfy this threshold value, then carries out 419,407 processing.
Therefore, be used for determining that whether signal can also comprise from the processing of a plurality of communication units: in the power level of 415 assessments, first groups of data symbols, 417 this power level is compared with power threshold, and when satisfying this power threshold, decision signal is from a plurality of communication units in 419.For instance, if determined frame rate is 1/8 speed, and the related power control group from 1/8 rate frame has exceeded 3～6dB than the expection power level, so probably have a cloned communication unit, and this unit has produced effect to the power that records in these power control groups.
In another embodiment, determine that in 405 whether signal can also comprise from the processing of a plurality of communication units: the credit rating of assessment first groups of data symbols in 415, in 417, first credit rating is compared with quality threshold, and when satisfying this threshold value, determine that in 419 signal is from a plurality of communication units.For instance, if determined frame rate is not 1/8 speed, and being used for the credit rating of 1/8 power rate control group or interference level is starkly lower than target level or is the speed of other power control groups' expections or observation, so probably have a cloned communication unit, and this unit has disturbed the power control group of 1/8 speed.
In another embodiment, be used for determining that whether signal can also comprise from the processing of a plurality of communication units: in 415 assessments or measure first parameter (power or credit rating) of first groups of data symbols and second parameter (power or credit rating) of assessment data second groups of data symbols, and in 417,419, come relatively to determine that based on first parameter and second parameter signal is from a plurality of communication units.For instance, if be different from 1/8 speed in 411 frame rate of determining, first groups of data symbols can be chosen as the related power control group that is different from 1/8 power rate control group 413 so, and second group be chosen as the power control group of 1/8 speed.Concerning 1/8 rate frame, expect that its average power level begins to change (exceeding based on non-coherent addition usually) from the average power level of described other power control groups, and this will be the indication that has clone or duplicated communication units.Therefore, whether the comparative result of first power level and second power level can exist the basis of cloning the unit with judge.Equally, also can use the credit rating assessment between these two groups here, wherein concerning the power control group of 1/8 speed, if exist cloned communication unit and this unit in these power control groups, to add interference, expect that so its credit rating is lower than the credit rating of other power control groups.Therefore, by comparing first credit rating and second credit rating, can indicate whether to exist clone's unit.
Advantageously, the method for Fig. 4 can be used in the base station, so that the unauthorized communication unit in the communication system of having used cdma air interface agreement, for example cdma2000 is detected.Under the situation that has provided the CDMA agreement, at this moment can use those to be used for measuring the known technology of power level and credit rating (noise or interference level have been used as measurement result usually) and implementing power in these systems and control usually.These prior aries might need to make amendment, so that appropriately measure or assess appropriate groups of data symbols; But this modification is that technical scope at those of ordinary skill is with interior.It is additionally noted that, for any used variable-data-rate and thus based on the Data Transmission Feature difference distinguish authorize and the access technology (for example time division multiple access, frequency division multiple access or its combination) of cloned communication unit for, this technology can be as the candidate technologies of use principle disclosed herein and notion.
Especially, the method that Fig. 4 describes can be used for detecting the cloned communication unit that those are worked in the communication system of having used code division multiple access (CDMA) agreement, and wherein this method is set in the base station or is carried out by the base station.403, the processing of received signal comprises data frame sequence of reception, and wherein each Frame all comprises the groups of data symbols of all power control groups that quotes as mentioned and so on, and this group will be observed on inbound CDMA Channel.For instance, 405, be used for determining signal whether from the processing of a plurality of communication units can based on the corresponding related power level of groups of data symbols.Should be noted that described related power level can be corresponding to signal power level or interference power level, so that distinguish symbol group.Interference level can be corresponding with the signal power with respect to noise power on one or more power control groups or the one or more Frame.Because signal receives in the variable-data-rate system, therefore, normally select corresponding to the data rate of Frame here according to known technology, and at power level, related power level, interference level or the like relatively comprising of being carried out with itself and certain threshold, wherein this threshold value can be the function of data rate.
It is noted that, be used for determining that signal whether can be based on the comparison of the information such as first interference level and second interference level from the processing of a plurality of communication units, the wherein said first interference level correspondence be first frame with first data rate, the second interference level correspondence be second frame with second data rate, and for instance, described comparison can be to carry out between the parameter measurement on the different frame.In cdma2000, for instance, be 1/8 frame rate from a data speed of cloned communication unit, other or the data rate of authorized communication unit then is a 1/n speed, wherein n equals 1,2,4 or 8.
Thus, disclose a kind of equipment and method here, described equipment and method provide a kind of low latency and low-cost technologies that is used to detect the cloned communication unit on the inbound channel.Here also discuss and described by detecting clone or duplicated communication units in a kind of effective with in good time mode to simplify and provide to discern and the different embodiment of method, system and the equipment of service-denial for this type of unit.Can be contemplated that according to these embodiment of the present invention or other embodiment not only are applicable to wide area network, but also be applicable to WLAN (wireless local area network).The disclosure then can expand to combiner or the equipment that comprises this type systematic, particularly type systematic or the method for using in this type systematic thus.Advantageously, by using inventive principle disclosed herein and notion, can carry out the detection of low latency and low network overhead to cloned communication unit or equipment, this is very useful concerning user and service supplier.
