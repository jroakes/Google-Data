Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to interference suppression and in particular, to a method and apparatus for reducing interference within a communication system.
- One type of interference often encountered by a user within a communication system is interference generated by the transmissions of other users. This is typically caused by many users transmitting within the same frequency band, and is referred to as co- channel interference.
- co-channel interference In order to reduce co-channel interference many communication systems employ a frequency reuse pattern, where transmitters in adjacent cells transmit on different frequencies. However, given the price of spectrum, future communications systems will be characterized by aggressive frequency reuse patterns that will result in significantly increased levels of co-channel interference.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a receiver for reducing interference.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a frequency response for the filter of FIG. 1.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing the operation of the receiver of FIG. 1.
- a method and apparatus for interference suppression is provided herein.
- a receiver, and method for operating a receiver are provided.
- the receiver operates by utilizing a filter bank to partition a wide-band signal into smaller sub-bands.
- Interference suppression takes place individually on the sub-bands (frequency bands) instead of on the wideband signal as a whole.
- interference suppression techniques can be utilized with less computational complexity than when performing interference suppression on the broadband signal as a whole.
- the present invention encompasses an apparatus comprising a first antenna outputting a first wideband signal, a second antenna outputting a second wideband signal, a first filter bank coupled to the first antenna, receiving the first wideband signal and outputting a first plurality of narrowband signals, a second filter bank coupled to the second antenna, receiving the second wideband signal and outputting a second plurality of narrowband signals, and an interference suppressor receiving a first narrowband signal from the first filter bank and a second narrowband signal from the second filter bank and outputting an interference-suppressed signal based on the first and the second narrowband signals.
- the present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus for interference suppression.
- the present invention additionally encompasses a method comprising the steps of receiving a wideband signal at a first filter bank, receiving the wideband signal at a second filter bank, outputting a first narrowband signal having a first center frequency from the first filter bank based on the wideband signal, and outputting a second narrowband signal having the first center frequency from the second filter bank based on the wideband signal.
- the first and the second narrowband signals are received and interference suppression is performed on the first and the second narrowband signals.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of receiver 100.
- Receiver 100 utilizes an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system protocol, however in alternate embodiments of the present invention, other system protocols utilizing wideband transmission schemes may be utilized as well.
- OFDM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
- Such other system protocols include, but are not limited to frequency-domain equalized single-carrier systems with cyclic prefixes (called cyclic prefix single carrier) or without cyclic prefixes, code division multiple access (CDMA) systems with cyclic prefixes (called cyclic prefix CDMA) or without cyclic prefixes, multi-carrier CDMA systems, and spread-OFDM systems.
- CDMA code division multiple access
- receiver 100 is applicable and effective in OFDM systems, single carrier systems, CDMA systems, and any other similar or hybrid systems.
- receiver 100 comprises at least one receive antenna 101 outputting a wideband signal, at least one filter bank 103-104 receiving the wideband signal, at least one interference suppressor 105-106, a synthesis filter bank 107, a cyclic prefix remover 108, and a fast Fourier transformer (FFT) 109.
- FFT fast Fourier transformer
- s( «) being the signal received from the desired transmitter (i.e., the transmitter whose data the receiver is trying to estimate)
- i(n) is the signal received from an interfering transmitter
- n is an integer indicating a discrete time index.
- s( «) and i( «) are both column vectors having a length equal to the number of receive antennas.
- the desired signal transmitted by the desired transmitter before being corrupted by the channel is referred to as d n).
- d n The desired signal transmitted by the desired transmitter before being corrupted by the channel
- the present invention can also recover multiple data signals sent from a single desired transmitter (or single or multiple data signals sent from multiple desired transmitters).
- the desired transmitter is also referred to as the desired signal or the desired user.
- Both s(«) and i( «) are the vectors of the signals received on each receive antenna from the respective transmitters after having been corrupted by their respective channels. It should be noted that s( «) and ⁇ (n) may, or may not be synchronized to a common time source. It should also be noted that although a single interfering transmitted signal is shown, the present invention can also suppress multiple interfering signals sent from multiple interfering transmitters.
- receiver 100 comprises a single filter bank 103-104 for each channel (antenna 101-102).
- the OFDM bandwidth is divided into small frequency bands such that the received bank breaks up the received x 1 OFDM wideband signal vector, r( «), (where M is the number of receive antennas) into X sub-bands, or narrowband signals, (e.g., 16 sub-bands/narrowband signals).
- the filter, j n) is chosen so that in the absence of the interference suppressors 105-106 and for a single channel (antenna 101-102), when an arbitrary signal, q(n), that spans the same bandwidth as the OFDM system is input into the filter bank 103-104, the output of the synthesis filter bank 107 equals (or approximately equals) the arbitrary signal q(n).
- the filter bank operates continuously in a linear convolution fashion as opposed to block processing with circular convolution. In other words, the filter banks operate very differently than traditional OFDM receiver processing where the portion of the received signal corresponding to the cyclic prefix is removed before a block of N time-domain signals is transformed into the frequency domain by an FFT operation.
- the filter banks are utilized such that the received signal is continuously processed, meaning that the portion of the received signal corresponding to the cyclic prefix is processed (i.e., not discarded) along with the data portion of the received signal.
- continuous processing i.e., linear convolution as opposed to circular convolution
- FIG. 2 shows the frequency response of a particular filter, fiji), convolved with itself and frequency shifted by center frequencies m ⁇ through GT 16 .
- FIG. 2 shows the 16 particular sub-bands where the interference suppressors 105-106 will operate for this example.
- the low-pass filter, flji) was chosen as a pulse with a square-root raised-cosine spectrum with a roll-off factor of 0.2 and a symbol time of 0.8333 ⁇ sec.
- the center frequencies were given as:
- each filter bank 103-104 outputs X sub- bands/narrowband signals, with like sub-bands (i.e., like center frequencies a> ⁇ through _ ⁇ ) being directed to similar interference suppressors 105-106.
- each interference suppressor 105-106 has inputs from the various filter banks 103- 104, with each input comprising the same particular sub-band.
- a first interference suppressor will receive all sub-bands centered at ⁇ ⁇
- a second interference suppressor will receive all sub-bands centered at ⁇ 2 . . . , etc.
- Interference suppression then takes place on the particular sub-band, with the output of the interference suppressors 105-106 being a scalar time sequence for the particular sub- band. Since the bandwidth of a sub-band is significantly less than the original signal, the effective length of the channel in each sub-band is much smaller than the original channel length. Therefore, various interference suppression filters (described below) can be designed using a frequency-shifted and filtered version of the pilot sequences where a pilot sequence is a group of symbols transmitted by the desired transmitter that is known by the receiver.
- the output of the interference suppressors 105-106 is input into synthesis filter bank 107 where the signals are added to produce a composite interference-suppressed signal.
- synthesis filter bank 107 serves to create the interference -free, equalized, wideband signal d ⁇ ri) from the various interference -free sub-bands.
- the output of the synthesis filter bank 107, d(ri) is the equalized time-domain OFDM signal and thus no further equalization is necessary (only the FFT of the appropriate symbols needs to be performed). This is accomplished by up-sampling the outputs of the interference suppressors 105-106, filtering by fiji), then shifting the frequency band of the resulting signal by ⁇ ⁇ through x and finally summing all frequency-shifted signals.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing the operation of the receiver of FIG. 1.
- the logic flow begins at step 301 where a first and a second antenna outputs a first and a second wideband signal, respectively.
- the first and the second wideband signals are received at a first and a second filter bank where they are partitioned into a plurality of smaller, narrowband, signals.
- the various narrowband signals are output to interference suppression circuitry 105-106 where interference suppression takes place.
- a single interference suppressor will receive the same sub-band signal output from all filter banks 103-104.
- interference suppressor 105 will receive all sub-bands centered at co ⁇
- interference suppressor 106 may receive all sub-bands centered at e_> ⁇ .
- interference suppression takes place on the various sub-bands and the interference-free sub-bands are supplied to synthesis filter bank 107 where the interference-free wideband signal is reconstructed (step 309).
- the various interference suppressors can be designed using a frequency-shifted and filtered version of the pilot sequence.
- Cyclic-prefix communication systems incorporate redundancy by repeating the last L cp symbols in a data block of N symbols at the beginning of the data block.
- the interference suppression techniques being described herein are applicable to systems using other forms of cyclic redundancy.
- the first L cp symbols in a data block of N symbols can be repeated at the end of the data block.
- the redundancy can be present at both the beginning and end of the data block.
- interference suppression techniques are applicable to systems employing no cyclic redundancy) Even after frequency shifting by - e and filtering with «) and then decimating, the resulting signal, y ( (n,b), will still have the cyclic prefix property as long as ⁇ ji) has a finite impulse response (FIR) and has reasonable attenuation in its tails (in the preferred embodiment, fiji) is a pulse with a square-root raised-cosine spectrum). Note that a time block number, b, was added to the resulting signal, y t (n,b), in order to track the placement of the cyclic prefixes (if present).
- FIR finite impulse response
- fiji is a pulse with a square-root raised-cosine spectrum
- the blind space-time combining weights operate by making the cyclic prefix portion of the equalized data block equal to the last L symbols of the same equalized data block ( L cp is the effective cyclic prefix length of the OFDM signal after filtering with fin) and decimating).
- L cp is the effective cyclic prefix length of the OFDM signal after filtering with fin
- s e (n,b) is the desired user's symbols at time n on block b (s e (n,b) is found by multiplying the original OFDM signal, d(n) (at the appropriate times), by the phase shift e ⁇ jm '" , filtering by fin), and then decimating), h ⁇ (O ⁇ m ⁇ L-l) is the effective channel (of length L) for filter bank £, and z. ⁇ (n,b) incorporates noise plus synchronous and asynchronous interference (the receiver noise and interference will also be multiplied by the phase shift e ⁇ jm ' n and decimated).
- D is the equalizer delay (typically equal to (L g +L-l)/2).
- the equalizer can be found as the solution to the following equation:
- M g xl g e [g (0),...,g (L g -l) , and L cp *ML g Y e (b) and Y f , 2 ( ⁇ ) are:
- Y,, 2 (*) y ⁇ N f -L cp + D,b) - y t T ⁇ N f -L cp + D-L g + ⁇ ,b)
- g e is found as the non-trivial (i.e., non-zero) solution to:
- g as the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of Y e .
- this blind equalizer will also have difficulties when an unknown interferer is synchronous, meaning that the interferer's cyclic prefixes line up in time with the desired signal.
- the above blind equalizer can be used with the pilots to find an excellent semi-blind equalizer in the presence of both asynchronous and synchronous interference.
- the semi-blind estimator modifies (7) by adding a term to account for the known pilot sequence (symbols). Assuming that there is one block (including cyclic prefix) of all known time-domain pilots, (7) becomes:
- three interference suppression techniques may be utilized by interference suppressors 105-106.
- the first technique is a blind-only technique in that it does not need pilot symbols to compute the interference suppression filters but instead uses the cyclic redundancy (i.e., cyclic prefix) in the transmitted desired signal to design the interference suppression filter.
- the second technique is a pilot-only method that designs the interference suppression filter to operate using pilot symbols while not taking into account the cyclic redundancy in the transmitted desired signal. (Thus this pilot-only technique can be used for systems with no cyclic redundancy).
- the third technique is a semi- blind method that designs the interference suppression filter to operate using pilot symbols while also taking into account the cyclic redundancy in the transmitted desired signal.
- each of the X signals is then decimated by X and then shifted in frequency (as opposed to frequency shifting, filtering by low-pass fin) and then decimating by X). It is intended that such changes come within the scope of the following claims.
