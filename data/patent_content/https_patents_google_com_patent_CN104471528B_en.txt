Specific embodiment
The availability of cloud storage, which has been obtained, largely to be extended.Cloud storage is a kind of network storage, via because
Spy's net can get.As used herein, network storage may include for example via storage obtained by network, which can be with
Including internet or it is connected to internet and can not also includes internet or be connected to internet.The data stored in network storage
Data-base content, user file can be taken or usually by way of other data contents of network share.Network storage
Trustship typically occur in large-scale data center, and client rent or stored using such network.Data center operator
According to the requirement virtualization resource of client and it is displayed as storage pool on backstage, wherein client oneself can be used to store text
Part or data object.Physically, resource can cross over multiple servers in multiple positions and can be copied to and most connect
The various data centers of nearly client or its end user.These cloud storage services can pass through web services application programming interfaces
(API) or by the user interface based on Web it accesses.
This cloud or the subset of network storage are personal storages.Storage service provides one kind, and simply and easily mode is used for benefit
Any kind of file (including document, photo and music file) is stored on network with network-based storage service.Text
Part is stored on network, wherein the file substantially has network connection (for example, internet when cloud storage connects
Connect) from anywhere in may have access to.If original document was once damaged or lost from the local hard-drive of user, this document can be with
It is simply stored again by storage service.Certain storage services also allow user and other users shared file, usually by arriving
The link of file with file to be shared passes through directly linking to this document.
File can usually be accessed from various types of calculating equipment, include, for example: computer workstation, mobile phone,
Any other equipment of video station, laptop computer, tablet computer, mobile phone or accessible internet.
Certain network storage services, which access other network storage services by web browser interface, has proprietary interface, and offer is set
Meter for more intuitively uploaded, access and the feature of shared file simultaneously also provide to management function (as scheduling back up or
Create sub- account for user) access.
It is how to deposit for these files or data sharing service (that is, cloud storage and personal network storage), a problem
Store up file.A kind of mode of storage file is with binary coded format by permanent (for example, the electricity or motor) storage of file write-in
Equipment.File format is used to specify how to explain the data for including in binary file.In other words, file format is for specifying such as
What makes binary data 1 and 0 become the information useful to people.There has been described at least three kinds of implementations for determining such as
What instrument of interpretation.A kind of method for identifying file type is that the information about format is stored in file itself.This information quilt
The specific position being placed in file, in the metadata for including in such as file header.Term header need not mean in text
The beginning of part.File header can be any position in file.Header including file type information can be people can
Read or binary system.In Alternate implementations, the file metadata including the information about file format is not stored in text
It is stored in part itself in individual database.
MIME is the standard that mark file type is specified how in multiple possible standards.(multipurpose is because of spy by MIME
Net mail extension) to be also known as Internet media type be a kind of internet engineering task group (IETF) standard, which depict one
Mechanism of the kind for specifying binary file to encode in a standardized way.The various aspects of MIME are (all in several ietf standard documents
Such as RFC2045, RFC2046, RFC4288) in description.For MIME, describes ganging up for binary file type and be commonly referred to as
" mime type ".For binary file, the coding mode that well defines be used for it is determined that how two in instrument of interpretation into
Data processed.For example, referred to as the image encoding standards of JPEG describe the vision of binary data and image in image file
Mapping between rendering.The mime type of JPEG is image/jpeg.For common, normative document type there are it is several other
Mime type, such as referred to as the music file type of mpeg audio layer III or MP3, be referred to as the part MPEG-4 14 or MP4
Music file type, is referred to as portable network figure or PNG at the image file type for being referred to as GIF(Graphic Interchange format) or GIF
Graphics file type, be referred to as label image file format or TIFF image file type, plain text, to be referred to as super literary
It is the file of this markup language or html format, the file to be referred to as extensible markup language or XML format, referred to as portable
Document format or the file format of PDF etc..
Certain clouds or network store system are provided to be stored in web browser and network storage for allowing user to be used only
Document interaction is without making the full release of software program be mounted on the application on its local machine.As used herein
, " application " may include the software program integrated via API or application programming interfaces and storage system.For example, certain networks
Storage service allows document to be opened and edited using the word processor that network storage service provides.User does not need to possess
Or his or her browser can be used only in his or her hard-drive in the conventional full release of installation word processor on the contrary
Carry out editing files.
Although this application is usually provided by network storage service itself, various implementations described here make third
Its application can be integrated with storage service or its application is allowed to be used together with network storage service by square developer.As here
Used, " third party developer " may include the software developer or confession different from the owner of storage service or operator
Ying Zhe.
It therefore, is which software application energy how managed for the technical issues of these files or data network storage service
Enough file/data opened or create the different file types stored together from service.This software application can open, preview,
Check, edit, rendering or processing system in certain projects.This ability can be based on of specific project associated files type
Match or corresponding relationship and one or more file type associated with software application are (for example, MIME or alternative document type
Mark system) list in the appearance of associated files types determine.This matching can indicate that software application can be used for beating
It opens, any file of preview, rendering or processing with match-type.For security reasons, it is usually desirable to prevent third-party application
Supplier accesses the user file for the type that its application is handled intentionally.
Third-party application
In storage service, file or data storage or shared service or system can be, for given files classes
Type, there may be the multiple software applications that can open this type file.This software application may include for example by storage service
The combination of the owner or operator, the application for being authorized or being provided by third party or both.Using may include " general default "
Software application is always mounted, and can utilize certain main level functions opening or preview file or data sharing service
All types of files in system.For example, it is contemplated that portable network figure or PNG image file.System application can preview this
File.However, third-party application can permit richer preview experience.It is certain in addition can permit editor experience.
Fig. 1 illustrates may be implemented for taking file type with the example network storage of the associated technology of application
Business 100.User's use that storage service 100 allows third party developer to provide the software application based on web for storage service.
Using usually can open, handle, preview or the file for editing one or more file types.It is set using client
Standby 106,108 third party developer 102,104, which is able to use, to be provided and for integrated by the developer environment pipe of service 100
The interface that reason device 110 provides by its application integration or is registered to storage service 100.Registering or integrating includes providing to service 100
Configuration information, such as to the maintenance of service 100 or addressable third-party application database 112.Configuration information include for example using
It is intended to the list of open file type.Therefore, when developer registers third-party application, also having registered application can be to it
The list of the file type of operation.In some implementations, developer by registration mime type, file extent or both come
It realizes.These are applied to mime type (or file type) mapping, usually many-one relationship.
Certain third-party applications can operate multiple file types or mime type.For example, photo editor can be right
Image/jpeg, image/png or alternative document type operations.On the other hand, perhaps third party's project management application only can be right
In customized file extension and the associated file operation of mime type.This file for example can be together with third-party application or needle
The file that third-party application is carried out.
Each third-party application usually receives the file type or associated with its native file format of their own
Mime type.In some implementations, third party developer registers it using manageable mime type and file extent
The two.Similarly, will there is the application for being used to create this file using the document of one of these third-party applications creation or file
File type or mime type.In addition to the default document type of mime type, third-party application can also allow for exporting to each
Any type of kind file type or mime type.If user 120,121 or 122 it is expected using with different type application
File, then this can be useful.
It is also uploaded to application repository using 114,116 using its client device 106,108 by developer 102,104
118, such as via developer environment manager 110.Application repository 118 can be by service 100 trustships, management or control or can
With independence.As used herein, term " application repository " for example may include database or provide a user market or shop
The interface in face.Using 114 and 116 can then by advertisement or make to user can get and used by user.Using can
To be free or payment.
System survey
User 120,121,122 etc. can apply 114 or 116 presence by various discovery channel discoveries or understanding, all
Such as application repository 118, advertisement, developer website or the reference of another user.User 120,121 or 122 is by being intended to this purpose
Mechanism will be mounted in his or her equipment 124,125 or 126 using 114, will such as be answered via user environment manager 128
Be integrated to service 100 User in.
Installation application is not obscured with the typical installation of software, and in the typical installation of software, multiple files are copied into use
The hard-drive or solid-state at family drive and are resident there until software is unloaded.On the contrary, the application of installation is registered to user
With installation (registration) using associated database.The list for the application installed or registered uses when servicing 100 pairs at it
User is visible.
Relationship between the movement renewal of registration user of " installation " third-party application and third-party application, and as permission
Third-party application accesses user the step of servicing the resource on 100.
For example, the application 114 installed can be can be by the browser or other users Interface Controller of user by user
Browser (for example, on JavaTM or the independent virtual machine of another platform) operation interim script or small application, can be
The plug-in unit of user browser can be on the remote computer and remotely be controlled by the client machine of user 124,125,126
System is accessed by other means or is controlled.
It then can be used for user using 114 to use come the file of applicable type in the service of opening 100.User 120,121
It usually controls, dominate or with the visit that the data in service 100 are stored with file in 132 outside 130 or service 100 with 122
It asks, and is able to use its respective client end equipment 124,125 and 126 via communication network 140 (such as internet or other nets
Network) access these files.File in data storage 130 has the file type of such as mime type or extension or both.
In some implementations, service 100 using following at least one of three kinds of modes or a variety of determines how
Instrument of interpretation:
1. information is in the header.In this implementation, service check the content of file with position header, parsing header,
And its structure and format are compared with the database of known format.For example, executable or .exe file is to indicate that it can
The private code of feasibility starts.
2. file extent, the attribute of file name.
3.MIME type, with external metadata part be not directly file content part (unless occur in the header) simultaneously
It and is not file name part.
Client device 124,125 and 126 can be work station, laptop computer, notebook computer, individual digital
Assistant, tablet computer, mobile phone, intelligence TV, intelligence DVD or other media players, intelligent appliance have people
The other kinds of equipment for outputting and inputting interface, capable of networking and file capable of being opened can be used.
User preference can also be stored in user preference warehouse or database 142 by service 100.Service 100 can be with
It will be maintained in installed list of application 150 for the list for installing application of relative users 120,121,122.If answered
It is maintained, is then usually maintained in the application repository 118 for the application that multiple users are installed by service 100 with warehouse 118.It is standby
Selection of land, using can by service 100 keep.Alternatively, application can be maintained at the outside of service 100, or internal and outer
The combination in both portions.The example of application can be disposed from service 100 or from service 100 to user 120,121,122.
User interface
Fig. 2 shows the example user interfaces 200 according at least one implementation of the technology.Pacified to use
The external third-parties of dress open the file serviced in 100, the select file first of user 120,121,122 using 114.It is grasped from file
Make dialog box (such as, the dialog box 202 of user interface 200), user 120,121,122 selects how user's expectation opens text
Part, such as from " opening " 204 or " unfolding mode " 206 menu option.Can open file using using 210,212,
214,216 list 208 then renders in the submenu in user interface 200, auxiliary menus or subdialogue frame 220.If with
Opening menu option 206 has been clicked at one of family 120,121 or 122 by right key, then " unfolding mode " menu option 206 can occur,
Or it can always be occurred from dialog box 202 with option 204 is opened.
Alternatively, due to selecting specific file, what the other positions that user interface 200 may be displayed on user interface occurred
Can clickthrough or button list.
After application selection herein, selected application (for example, 114) is subsequently used in opening file.
It can not need to carry out by calling the certain defaults for not proposing to use in list of application first to open process
Above-mentioned selection, default application can be for example will be used to open or preview file application 116.
Default application
If such as user selects " opening " menu option 204 rather than " unfolding mode " option 206, can be used silent
Recognize using 116.Default application, which may exist or can be not present, is used to open file.System default can be built-in using 116
In system 100 (for example, can be used for multiple users without user installation application, and not usually third-party application), and
And the file of a large amount of types can be opened.In some implementations, default application 116 can open All Files type, to the greatest extent
The richness that pipe generates preview can render the degree of file for default application 116 is depended on.
User's application preferences
User 120 can be expected to use external third-parties and open certain types of file using 114 defaults, rather than use
System default application needs to select from the list of multiple possible applications.This preference " is answered just for the default of user 120
Use file type " mapping.Third-party application 114 may for example can be used recently and user 120 may be with 116 phase of default application
Than more preference third-party application 114.Alternatively, user may compared with default application 116 more preference third-party application 114, this
It is because third-party application 114 provides richer preview or editor's experience.
User 120,121 and 122 can select its expectation to open particular file types (for example, MIME class using to default
Type) All Files application.
In a particular example, left button, which clicks (default is opened) opening menu selection 204, will call specific application.At certain
In a little implementations, left button clicks file select file and calls default opening action, without selection " opening " option.No
It needs to click by right key and opens menu selection 204 to access " unfolding mode " submenu 220.However, clicking by right key and " opening side
Formula " menu selection 206 still can be used to cover default setting and select different application.
For example, it is contemplated that when user 120 has been mounted with two independent photo editings using 116 and 114.Selection default will
It is associated with jpeg image using 116.When user selects jpeg image, which is utilized by its preference and applies 116 dozens
It opens.But user can click same file by right key and open or cover its default choice using using 114.
In a particular example, default user application preferences indicate in submenu 220, such as in the position of application 210
222 are set, except when system default application or reader are used for opening file.The title of application will be located next to dialog box 202
In opening project occur, such as " unfolding mode " then Apply Names.If default is system default, dialog box is simply shown
Show " opening ".
User's application preferences can be stored in the service 100 in such as user data storage 130 in the specific record of user
In.When the view of file management system is rendered for user by user environment manager 128, preference is by service 100 or client
End equipment 124,125,126 uses.It is associated using between file type by service 100, to generate file type (example
Such as, mime type) and preference application between mapping.In some embodiments, if there is no for file type or
The entry of mime type, then using system default application or reader.
When one of user 120,121 or 122 is using service 100, preference can be transmitted to user client from system 100
Machine 124,125 or 126 and it is locally stored in such as application internal or web browser or the high speed of other interface internals is slow
In deposit data structure.This default preferences considers or when user expresses interested in file in the service of opening 100 with reference to determination
Whether any default preferences are previously positioned via user or express.The result of this default preferences inspection will determine which application is used
In opening specific file.
In some examples, respective application 210,212,214 and 216 has figure associated with it and next to display
Mark 224,226,228 and 230.
Management application
" management application " menu option 232 can appear in " unfolding mode " submenu or be separately provided in menu.If
It needs, then may include one or more menu item separators 236.In some examples, this menu item only " is beaten in default
Evolution formula " occurs when enabling.
Fig. 3 shows the variant of the user interface 200 according at least one implementation of the technology.When " management is answered
With " menu option 232 be clicked or drive when, " management application " dialog box 234 is activated.By dialog box 234, user 120,
121,122 default " unfolding mode " can be specified to map.
In some examples, management can be used using dialog box or other certain dialog boxes in a user in user
The application that (not shown) selection is opened file using default and can be opened.The actual text shown in dialog box can be simpler
It is single, for example, " default uses ".For example, this text can occur after for example having selected using 238,240,242 or 244.
Dialog box 234 further includes " more " menu option 246, when being clicked or driving, so that additional application 248,
250,252,254 and 256 application 238,240,242 and 244 in dialog box 258 is shown.Any application in these applications
It can be selected as default application.Menu option 260 can provide in dialog box 258, when being clicked or driving, generate more
Using shown.
It solves default and opens conflict
Certain examples it is expected the application ID simple list that " default " uses using user.The scene for needing to pay special attention to is weight
The case where folded file type or mime type: two applications can be easily selected by a user as " default " be used for same file type or
Mime type.For example, default and " contention " image can be detected as using photo and photograph, for example, having MIME
The file of type " image/jpeg ".
In the case, only one application can be won.System maintains the ranked list of default application ID, and the column
The last one application occurred in table is won, rather than is carried out letter or arbitrarily determined.In the user interface of Fig. 2 to Fig. 3, user
120, the sequence that the sequence instruction application of 121 or 122 selection default applications occurs in lists.Therefore, user can pass through choosing
Select and cancel the top that list is arrived in the application " collision " by selection application.
Alternatively, this list can be maintained queue, completely may be used wherein " moving to top " operation exists or can be
Sorted lists.
Use-case
Assuming that user 120 uploads the image file 160 of type JPEG to service 100 (see Fig. 1).User 120 can be used
Built-in reader or previewer render or check the image only checked in context using 210 (see Fig. 2), but cannot to its into
Edlin.User 120 is desired to have the enhancing function of allowing picture editting.User's search finds and installs (or addition) later
Two this photo applications 212 and 214.At this point, being not set to default using 212 and 214, therefore in certain implementations
In, it only may have access to by " unfolding mode " using 212 or 214.Photo application 212 and 214 can edit mime type JPEG
File.In addition to using default viewer using 210, user 120 now open using using one of 212 or 214 instead by expectation
JPEG photo files 160.Then user's select file 160 utilizes the file that can open the type to select files (that is, JPEG)
List of application by user environment manager 128 be presented on its calculate equipment 124 on.The list includes that built-in system default is checked
Device applies 210, and the application 212 and 214 installed can open the file of type JPEG (see Fig. 2).List is via certain

Sequence.For example, default application can appear in the top of list.Its in user's selective listing it is expected the application used.User's selection
First application 212 installed recently.Image is utilized to be opened using 212.
The expectation now of user 120 attempts second and applies 214.User repeats the process, the current installation recently of selection second
Application 214.Second application 214 be used to open JPEG photo now.It is pleased with second using 214, user 120 it is expected always
The file that type JPEG is opened using 214 that default is installed recently using second.User is undesirable to be prompted.User 120
This preference is set according to certain user's interface module (such as dialog box is applied in management), and this preference is recorded in service 100,
In such as user preference warehouse 142.Later, user 120 it is expected to open the 2nd JPEG photo 162 for being different from the first photo 160.
User calls default opening procedure.User will not prompt as that can be opened the list of application of file before.Because user is
Preference is opened provided with default, therefore there are JPEG types to the mapping for applying 214.It therefore is automatically used for opening using 214
JPEG photo 162, because previously stored preference is by dynamic reference.User recognizes for a specific purposes, based on primary
Property, they it is expected to open file 162 with application 212.But they are undesirable to destroy their previously specified more general defaults
Preference.Therefore they can be based on disposable (for example, clicking the file entries in lists of documents by right key or clicking by right key " opening "
Menu option 204) Selection utilization can open the applicable list of application of photo to prompt.In this example, user
The application 212 that selection is installed using first, and file 162 is opened according to application 212.
User 120 is unloaded later using 212.Later, if user it is expected to check the non-default opening for being directed to JPEG photo
Process is then prompted using the list of all applicable, installation applications 210 and 214, but the list will not include and unload
The application 212 of the first installation carried.When the application as current default preference is unloaded, default preferences are restored to previous note
The default application of volume (it can be default but be rewritten).If there is no this application, then default preferences will be restored
210 are applied to the system default for capableing of preview All Files.
