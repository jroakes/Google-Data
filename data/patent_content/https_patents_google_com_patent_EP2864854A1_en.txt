Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to user interfaces for providing recommended content.
- a system for providing a user interface including recommended content or information in response to an endorsement input includes a processor and a memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to: receive an input from a first user; determine that the input is related to an endorsement of a first content item from a first source; determine a social correlation between the first content item from the first source and a second content item from a second source, the social correlation indicating both the first content item and the second content item are associated with a first engagement action performed by a second user connected to the first user in a social graph; determine a source correlation between the first source and the second source, the source correlation indicating both the first source and the second source are associated with one or more second engagement actions performed by the first user; determine recommended content using the social correlation and the source correlation; and generate graphical data for depicting a user interface element that provides the recommended content to the first user.
- Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include: receiving an input from a first user; determining that the input is related to an endorsement of a first content item from a first source; determining a social correlation between the first content item from the first source and a second content item from a second source, the social correlation indicating both the first content item and the second content item are associated with a first engagement action performed by a second user connected to the first user in a social graph; determining a source correlation between the first source and the second source, the source correlation indicating both the first source and the second source are associated with one or more second engagement actions performed by the first user; determining recommended content using the social correlation and the source correlation; and generating graphical data for depicting a user interface element that provides the recommended content to the first user.
- the features include: the first source and the second source being associated with a domain specified by a publisher and the recommended content including the second content item; the input being one of a request for an endorsement button to endorse the first content item, a cursor over the endorsement button, a selection of the endorsement button, and a sharing of the first content item; the user context describing one or more of a search history being associated with the first user, social data being associated with the first user, transaction data being associated with the first user, advertisement data being associated with the first user, whether the first user has made endorsements to other content items, whether a number of endorsements made by the first user is lower than a
- the operations further include: determining a user context describing the first user, and wherein the recommended content being further determined based on the user context.
- the present disclosure may be advantageous because it can be able to identify recommended content and provide the recommended content to the user in association with endorsement activities. This can be particularly advantageous because the recommended content can be provided in a context in which it may be very useful to the user. More specifically, the present disclosure provides recommended content in a share box and the share box can include action buttons for interacting with the recommended content for example, commenting on it, sharing it, making a purchase related to it, taking other actions related to the content or transitioning to other interfaces to view the content. The present disclosure may be also advantageous because the context of the user can be used to generate the recommended content. Context information may include information from a social network, information about searches, endorsement information, web history, publisher information, and domain information which may or may not be particular to the user.

- the transaction server 122 responds by sending the context 224E.
- the context 224E includes transaction data associated with the user for purchasing content or products identified in the
- the context 224E could be information on how to purchase goods, download music, download or stream video, etc.
- the context 224E includes transaction data describing one or more transactions performed by the user.
- endorsement/recommendation module 156A sends a context request signal 222 to the recommendation server 120.
- the recommendation server 120 responds by sending recommended content 224.
- the recommended content may be web pages, video, audio, or other content based on popularity, relevance to the user, recency, number of social annotations, correlations to what other users annotated, etc.
- endorsement/recommendation module 156A as will be described in more detail below with reference to the implementation of Figure 3.
- the endorsement/recommendation module 156A receives the context 224A,
- the endorsement/recommendation module 156A then creates a user interface or share box including the recommended content and the actions that can be taken on the recommended content and sends the user interface or share box 226 to the client device 104.
- the endorsement/recommendation module 156A may also deliver ad content as part of the share box 226 or along with the share box 226 as has been described above.
- the share box 226 (and/or recommended content) can be received by the sharing client 1 10 and presented to the user 102 on the web browser 202.
- the user 102 may add content to the share box. Included within some implementations of the share box can be a number of actions or buttons that can be selectable by the user 102.
- the user 102 may choose to share the content in the share box to one or more of other server systems or take one or more other actions on the content in the share box. Three examples of potential actions are shown in Figure 2.
- the content in the share box may be shared/sent back 228A to the endorsement/recommendation module 156A.
- the content in the share box may be shared/sent back 228B to the social network server 124 for sharing with friends or groups of friends of the user 102.
- the content in the share box may be shared/sent back 228C to the search server 1 14 for use in improving the operation of the search engine 130.
- the content in the share box may also be shared with other systems including but not limited to micro blogging sites, bulletin boards, video hosting sites, blogs, forums, etc.
- the actions in the share box may also be to consummate transactions and provide information to the transaction server 122.
- Figure 2 describes one implementation in which most of the operations of the present disclosure can be performed by the endorsement/recommendation module 156A
- at least part of the steps described above may be performed by the sharing client 1 10.
- the sharing client 1 10 processes the share box request 220, generates the share box, communicates with the other servers 114, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128 to request and receive context, determines the content for the share box based upon the context and provides the share box with injected content for presentation by the web browser 202.
- the sharing client 1 10 also receives input from the user regarding actions to take on the content and performs those actions for example, sharing 228A, 228B, 228C with other systems.
- the endorsement/recommendation module 156A includes a recommendation generator 302, one or more recommendation data store(s) or interface(s) 304, a user interface (UI) creation module 306, a correlation module 308, a publisher control module 310, a social interface module 312, a search interface module 314 and a trans action/other server interface module 316.
- the recommendation generator 302 may be software or routines for generating recommended content.
- the recommendation generator 302 is coupled or configured for communication with the one or more recommendation data store(s) or interface(s) 304, the UI creation module 306, the correlation module 308, the publisher control module 310, the social interface module 312, the search interface module 314 and the transaction/other server interface module 316.
- the recommendation generator 302 cooperates with the one or more recommendation data store(s) or interface(s) 304 to retrieve content that can be processed and potentially sent as recommended content.
- the recommendation generator 302 may receive additional content from the social interface module 312, the search interface module 314 and the transaction/other server interface module 316.
- the recommendation generator 302 cooperates with the UI creation module 306 and receives requests from it for recommended content.
- the recommendation generator 302 produces the recommended content and sends it to the UI creation module 306 for inclusion with the user interface created by the UI creation module 306.
- the recommendation generator 302 also cooperates with the social interface module 312, the search interface module 314 and the transaction/other server interface module 316 to receive context information that the recommendation generator 302 uses to process and identify the most relevant recommended content.
- These sources can provide information specific to the user thereby increasing the relevance of the recommended content to the user.
- the recommendation generator 302 may receive social signals from the social interface module 312 that provide information about a user's interaction with the social network that can be used to identify more relevant recommended content.
- the recommendation generator 302 may receive endorsement signals from the endorsement server 112 that provide information about what the user has endorsed.
- the recommendation generator 302 may receive search signals from the search interface module 314 that provide information about what the user 102 has searched for and clicked upon.
- the recommendation generator 302 may receive transaction signals or other signals from the transaction/other server interface module 316 provide additional information about purchases the user has made or information of interest to the user.
- the recommendation generator 302 also cooperates with the correlation module 308 and the publisher control module 310 to receive information that can be used to adjust the ranking of recommended content or exclude content from a recommendation, respectively.
- the correlation module 308 and the publisher control module 310 may be used to adjust the ranking of recommended content or exclude content from a recommendation, respectively.
- recommendation generator 302 identifies recommended content based upon a number of factors, for example, content ordered by the number of social annotations, content ordered by recency or timestamp, content ordered by correlation (people who annotated this also annotated that), content ordered by author and a relation to the user, content ordered by topic, content ordered by search, content ordered by commenting, posting or sharing, content ordered by endorsement, etc.
- the recommendation generator 302 may provide recommended content based on, for example, a top (ordered by number of endorsements, annotations or shares) or endorsed or shared topic in the domain by one or more users, a most recently (ordered by timestamp) endorsed or shared topic in a domain, and a correlated topic (people that endorsed or shared on this topic also endorsed or shared on that topic) based on signals from the correlation module 308.
- the above bases for recommending content may be additionally based upon all users, a subset of users, or users within a social group. Further, the recommended content may be restricted to a current domain or source, or a group of domains and sub-domains. In some implementations, the recommendation generator 302 may also introduce some randomization by adding random content.
- the recommendation generator 302 can also provide recommended content based upon the topic having the most endorsements by source; topics recommended based upon the user's group or circle in a social graph; the topic having the most endorsements on a given domain that the user will like; topic most endorsed by users that endorsed this- another related topic-sentiment analysis; and topics that people I know who endorsed also endorsed this topic.
- the recommendation generator 302 only recommends content once for a given user.
- the recommendation generator 302 also generates recommended content based in part upon "similarity.” In other words, content that can be similar to the content being viewed or of interest may be identified and recommended by the recommendation generator 302. This could be alone or in combination with the other information identified above.
- the one or more recommendation data store(s) or interface(s) 304 may be software, routines or storage for storing aggregated content.
- the recommendation data sources may be data sources that store the actual content.
- the one or more recommendation interfaces may be interfaces to aggregated content including searches, search results, social network information, transaction information, annotation information, endorsement information, etc.
- the one or more recommendation data store(s) or interfaces 304 are coupled to provide this content to the recommendation generator 302.
- the user interface (UI) creation module 306 may be software or routines for creating a user interface including recommended content.
- the UI creation module 306 may generate and provide annotations, share boxes, recommended content, and engagement action buttons as will be described in more detail with reference to Figures 6A-8C.
- the UI creation module 306 receives the share box request 220 from the client device 104.
- the UI creation module 306 can provide various combinations of annotations, share boxes, recommended content, and engagement action buttons adapted to be responsive to the request received from the sharing client 1 10. Example user interfaces are described below in more detail with reference to Figure 6A-13F.
- the UI creation module 306 sends requests for recommended content to the recommendation generator 302 and in response to the request and the context, receives recommended content from the recommendation generator 302.
- the UI creation module 306 combines this recommended content with the user interface constructs and sends a user interface (e.g., share box 226) to the client device 104.
- the correlation module 308 may be software or routines for generating or identifying correlated recommendations.
- the correlation module 308 can be configured for communication with the recommendation data store(s) or interface(s) 304, the social interface module 312, the search interface module 314 and the transaction/other server interface module 316.
- the correlation module 308 correlates the relationship between annotations and generates information that represents likelihood of what the user may be likely to annotate.
- the correlation module 308 may generate a score that can be a linear combination of public endorsements the user has made, endorsements made by other others in the user's social graph, and endorsements by others on a first topic that also endorsed or shared us on a second topic.
- the correlated recommendations can be weighted by recency. Further, the correlation ranking can be used in combination with other categorizations identified above made by the recommendation generator 302.
- the publisher control module 310 may be software or routines for receiving information from publishers about restrictions and settings for providing related content.
- the publisher control module 310 provides a variety of inputs or settings that can be received from a publisher or owner of a website.
- the publisher control module 310 is coupled to provide this information to the recommendation generator 302 so that it can be used as a filter to remove recommendations responsive to input from the publisher. For example, the publisher may restrict recommended content to a particular domain, sub-domain or may exclude external content.
- the social interface module 312 may be software or routines for sending context requests 222B to the social network server 124 and receiving context responses 224B from the social network server 124.
- the social interface module 312 retrieves this context information and other social signals and information and provides it to the recommendation generator 302 and the UI creation module 306. Both of these modules 302 and 306 utilize this information in generating content or creating the user interface, respectively.
- the search interface module 314 may be software or routines for sending context requests 222D to the search server 1 14 and receiving context responses 224D from the search server 114.
- the search interface module 314 retrieves the search signals and other information and provides them to the recommendation generator 302 and the UI creation module 306. As with the other interface modules, this information can be used by the recommendation generator 302 and the UI creation module 306 to identify recommended content and determine which user interface to create, respectively.
- the transaction/other server interface module 316 may be software or routines for sending context requests 222E to the transaction server 122 or other servers, and receiving context responses 224E from the transaction server 122 or other servers. Again, the transaction/other server interface module 316 provides this information to the transaction/other server interface module 316
- recommendation generator 302 and the UI creation module 306 for use in performing their functions.
- the method 400 begins by receiving 402 an input from a first user.
- the input may be a request for an endorsement button, a hover over an endorsement button or the selection of an endorsement button provided for users of the search engine 130 or a social network, for example.
- the method determines 404 whether the received input was related to an endorsement of a first content item.
- an input that can be related to an endorsement of a first content item includes a request for an endorsement button to endorse the first content item, a hover over an endorsement button for the first content item, the selection of an endorsement button to endorse the first content item, a right-click over the endorsement button or similar input.
- An input related to an endorsement may be associated with any input a first user can make from the web browser 202. If the input was not related to an endorsement, the method 400 ends. On the other hand, if the input was related to an endorsement, the method 400 continues to determine 406 the context of the input and the first user. For example, the method 400 determines an input context for the input, a user context describing the first user, a third context of the request or the identity of the first user.
- the method 400 determines any information that can be used to determine the input context in which the input related to an endorsement was made.
- This context information e.g., the input context, user context and other context
- determining the input context may include determining the webpage being viewed, determining the portion of the web page being viewed, determining the domain or sub-domain of the webpage being viewed, determining information associated with the input, determining input associated with the endorsement button, etc.
- part of this information can be used to determine what content can be filtered and not presented in the steps below.
- the input context includes (1) a social correlation between the first content item from the first source and a second content item from a second source and (2) a source correlation between the first source and the second source.
- the method 400 determines a first source where the first content item related to the endorsement input is from.
- a social correlation can be data indicating that both the first and the second content items have engagement actions performed by a common user. For example, a social correlation indicates that a common user who annotates a first content item also annotates a second content item. In a further example, assume the input from the first user indicates that the first user uses a cursor to hover over an endorsement button for a video. A social correlation between the video and another content item (e.g., an article) indicates that a second user has endorsed both the video and the article.
- another content item e.g., an article
- both engagement actions can be of the same type of actions (e.g., a common user who endorses the first content item also endorses the second content item; a common user who shares the first content item also shares the second content item, etc.) or of different types of actions (e.g., a common user who endorses the first content item also comments on the second content item; a common user who reposts the first content item also shares the second content item; a common user who endorses the first content item also reposts the second content item, etc.).
- the common user can be a second user connected to the first user in a social graph. In some instances, the common user can be a second user not connected to the first user in a social graph.
- a source correlation can be data indicating that the first source is correlated to the second source.
- a source correlation indicates that both the first and second sources have engagement actions performed by a common user.
- a source correlation indicates that the first user or the second user, or both, has endorsed both the first source and the second source.
- a source correlation indicates that both the first source and the second source are from the same domain.
- a source correlation indicates that the first source and the second source are from domains specified by the same publisher.
- the method 400 determines the user context describing the user by processing one or more of social information, endorsement information and a search history associated with the user, publisher information and a domain visited by the user, etc.
- the method 400 retrieves 408 recommended content according to the context in which the input related to an endorsement was made.
- the method 400 determines the recommended content for the first user based on the input context and/or the user context so that the recommended content matches the input context and/or the user context. For example, if the input context indicates that the first user may be viewing a particular web page, at least portions of that webpage may be retrieved and used to identify recommended content for inclusion in the share box.
- determining 406 the context includes determining the domain and/or sub-domain for the particular webpage the first user was viewing.
- the recommended content can be then determined using the domain name or sub-domain of that particular webpage. For example, there may be three articles on the particular topic within a particular domain.
- the retrieval recommended content for a first user that may be viewing one of three articles may be to retrieve as recommended content abstracts of the other two articles provided on the same domain. Additional information like the content of the webpage, HTML tags on the webpage, recency in viewing the webpage, other web pages that have been viewed whether in the same domain or related domains can also be used to identify other recommended content. Similarly in some implementations, since the input can be associated with a particular endorsement button, the content related to that endorsement button can be identified for addition into the share box. In further implementations, additional content not visible to the first user may also be retrieved for possible inclusion in the share box. In one implementation, certain portions of the webpage may be tagged with semantic classifications provided by the publisher. That information can also be used to determine the recommended content that can be retrieved.
- the recommended content also matches the user context describing the user. For example, if the user context indicates that the user has searched for and purchased a first product online, the recommended content may include (1) a second product similar to the first product and (2) a link to a webpage from a specific domain for the first user to purchase the second product.
- the method 400 filters 410 the content based on publisher input or settings.
- Step 410 can be optional and thus shown with dashed lines in Figure 4.
- the publisher or owner of the web domain can control the recommended content and possible actions that can be incorporated into the user interface element.
- the publisher may allow or not allow the user to share content.
- the publisher may also limit the recommended content sources to the current domain or sub-domain.
- the publisher may specify that no external content be provided as recommended content.
- information provided to the user includes additional non- visible or visible tags for semantically classified information that can be presented to the user.
- this information can be further refined using the semantic classifications provided by the publisher.
- the information can be filtered by the publisher specifically indicating what information may be copied into the share box as recommended content.
- the endorsement/recommendation module 156 decides what content to filter based on auto crawling or some alternative mechanism.
- the information can be filtered by a combination of input from the endorsement/recommendation module 156 and the publisher. There may be a number of additional ways in which the content may be filtered based on semantic classification, requirements of the publisher, requirements of the search server 114, or requirements of other related entities.
- the method 400 creates 412 a user interface element.
- the user interface element may be an endorsement button and an annotation, or may be the share box or bubble including recommended content. Examples of such user interface elements are shown and described below with reference to Figures 6A-8C.
- the method 400 continues by adding 414 the recommended content to the user interface element. For example, the recommended content retrieved in step 408 can be added to the user interface element. In some
- the top one or several items of recommended content can be added to the user interface element because of the limited amount of real estate.
- the added content can be the annotation.
- the added content could be one or more items of information, links, etc. added to the share box.
- one or more engagement action buttons can be added 416 to the user interface element. Step 416 can be optional and thus shown with dashed lines in Figure 4.
- the share box may be pushed to one or more of: 1) third-party sites; 2) a stream of information from the user; 3) a post by the user; 4) a recommendation page of the user; 5) annotation storage for later presentation with the search results; 6) a micro blogging site; and 7) another site, page, database or system in which the information may be useful and valuable.
- Individual buttons for taking an action on the information in the share box can be added to the share box.
- engagement action buttons may be provided to allow the user to: 1) post a comment; 2) share content; 3) follow a topic; 4) follow another user in the social network; 5) add another user to the user's social graph; 6) transition to view the recommended content; 7) view content related to the recommended content; 8) make a purchase of a product identified in the recommended content; 9) download music or video identified in the recommended content; etc.
- the method 400 completes by providing 418 the share box for display.
- the share box can be sent from the endorsement server 1 12 to the client device 104 and the information can be presented in a browser 202 at the client device 104. The user can add additional information to the share box and select anyone of the engagement action buttons such that the content in the share box may be delivered according to the action selected.
- the user can take a number of actions.
- the user can add additional content by inputting it to the share box.
- the user 102 can specify other users or systems with which to share the content in the share box. This can be done following selection of the share button.
- the content from the share box can be sent to individuals or other systems.
- the content in the share box could be e-mailed to a particular user.
- the information in the share box may be added to the stream of the user 102 in his/her social network.
- the content in the share box may be returned to the third party server 126, the search server 1 14, the endorsement/recommendation module 156 or other systems for additional processing, analytical evaluation, or presentation.
- the ability to easily add content and share with a multitude of other users and systems allows the user to spread content in a viral manner.
- Figures 5A-5C show another implementation of the method 500 for providing recommended content in a user interface element.
- the method 500 begins by receiving 502 an input.
- the method 500 determines 504 whether the received input was a request for an endorsement button. If not, the method 500 continues to step 520 as will be described in more detail below with reference to Figure 5B.
- the method 500 continues to determine 506 the context of the user and request. For example, the context may be determined from the social search, or endorsement signals that may indicate a webpage being viewed, the user viewing the webpage, etc.
- the method 500 uses the determined context to retrieve 508 the recommended content.
- the recommended content can be a short statement or other information pertinent to the endorsement button.
- the method 500 creates 510 an annotation from the recommended content. Examples of annotations including recommended content will be described below with reference to Figure 6A-6F.
- the method 500 then creates 512 an endorsement button. This button can be added to a webpage and can be selectable by the user 102 to provide endorsement information to the endorsement server 112.
- the method 500 completes by providing 514 the endorsement button then the annotation for display in the web browser 202 of the client device 104.
- step 504 If the method 500 determined in step 504 that the input was not a request for an endorsement button, the method 500 continues in step 520 of Figure 5B.
- the method 500 described with reference to Figure 5B below can be advantageous because the recommended content can be provided to the user at a time when they may be thinking about endorsing the content, but before they actually do. This has the benefit that users will start to learn that if they want recommendations, they can hover over the endorsement button 602, which will generate more endorsements.
- step 520 the method 500 determines whether the input was a cursor over an endorsement button. If not, the method proceeds to step 540 of Figure 5C as will be described below. On the other hand, if the method 500 determined that the input was a cursor over an endorsement button, the method 500 determines 522 the context of the user and the request. As has been described above with reference to Figure 2, the user context can include a variety of signals including social signals, endorsement signals, search signals, the domain or webpage being viewed, etc. Next, the method 500 retrieves 524 recommended content for the context.
- the recommended content can be for a given domain or sub- domain, based upon the content that is most often publicly endorsed, based upon the content that may be most often shared, based upon endorsements of the user, based upon whether others in the user's social graph have endorsed content, based upon search history, click through and other click behavior, etc.
- the method 500 filters 526 the content based on publisher input or settings. In some implementations, this step may be optional. The content may be filtered based on publisher input provided by the publisher control module 310 as has been described above.
- the method 500 personalizes 528 the recommended content for the user.
- the content can be personalized based on information from the social network server 124, for example, using known attributes of the user, information from friends of the user, information from use of the social network by the user, information from endorsements made by the user or any other sources.
- the content can be personalized based on information from the search server 1 14, e.g., the browsing history of the user.
- information from a profile server (not shown) that includes preferences for the user can be used to personalize the content.
- the method 500 customizes the content that will be added to the share box based on the identity of the user, who they are and his/her preferences.
- the personalization step 528 can be optional. The method 500 then creates 530 a share box or bubble.
- the share box or bubble can be one example of the user interface element for presenting the recommended content.
- Various other configurations of boxes, toolbars, buttons, and windows that have the same or similar functionality may be used instead of the share box.
- the method 500 continues by adding 532 the recommended and/or personalized content to the share box. Depending on the recommended content, one or more engagement action buttons can be added 534 to the share box. Finally, the method 500 provides 536 the share box including the recommended content for display, for example by sending the share box and the
- the use of a share box including the recommended content can be particularly advantageous because it presents the recommended content at the right time and in the right context when it can be most valuable to the user.
- step 540 the method 500 determines whether the input was the selection of the endorsement button or sharing of content. If not, the method 500 is complete, and the input can be processed by another system. On the other hand, if the method 500 determined that the input was the selection of the endorsement button or sharing, the method 500 determines 542 the context of the user and the request. This can be similar to step 522 described above, but in this case, the context includes the fact that the user has selected the endorsement button or decided to share content that may be presently being viewed. The method 500 continues by performing steps 544 to 556. Steps 544 to 556 are similar to steps 524 to 536 respectively so that description will not be repeated here.
- Figure 6A shows one example of the user interface 600 including an endorsement button 602A and an annotation 604A.
- This can be an option for presenting endorsement buttons and annotations for users that are logged into a system, e.g., a social network.
- the annotation 604A may be positioned proximate the endorsement button 602A, in this case to the right.
- the annotation 604A includes a suggestion to share this (the content being viewed) with other users and includes pictures of those other users that may be retrieved from the social network.
- the other users may be in particular groups or the social graph of the user.
- Figure 6B shows another example of the user interface 610 including the endorsement button 602B and the annotation 604B. Again, this can be an option for presenting endorsement buttons and annotations for users that are logged into the system, for example, a social network.
- the annotation 604B has a similar position to that of Figure 6A.
- the annotation 604B includes a suggestion that the user share this content with other users and identifies those other users by name.
- the names include links that can be selected by the user to provide more information about who specifically those users are.
- Figure 6C shows an example of the user interface 620 including the endorsement button 602C and the annotation 604C.
- This can be an option for presenting endorsement buttons and annotations for users that are logged into a social network.
- the annotation 604C includes a suggestion that the user share this content with a group, including the user's family.
- the group can be identified by a name that has been given to the group by the user in the social network.
- the name portion of the annotation also includes a link that can be selected by the user to provide more information about who may be included within the group.
- Figure 6D shows another example of the user interface 630 including the endorsement button 602D and the annotation 604D. Again, this can be an option for presenting endorsement buttons and annotations for users that are logged into a system.
- the annotation 604D includes information specific to the user, in this case that the user has 756 followers, and a suggestion of who can be included within that group of followers. Certain portions of the annotation 604D can include links to access more detailed information about the annotation.
- Figure 6E shows another example of the user interface 640 including the endorsement button 602E and the annotation 604E. In this example, the annotation 604E can be for a user that may be not logged into another system.
- the annotation 604E includes a general suggestion that content be shared with friends since the user may be not logged into the system, no additional information from the system is added to the annotation.
- Figure 6F shows another example of the user interface 650 including the endorsement button 602F and the annotation 604F.
- the user may be not logged into another system, e.g., a social network.
- the annotation 604F includes an icon, for example, an image of flame or other indicia suggesting that the information can be "hot" or popular.
- the annotation 604F also includes text about the continent the user can be viewing.
- Figure 7A shows another example of the user interface 700 including the share box 702A and the recommended content 704A presented in response to a cursor over an endorsement button.
- the user interface 700 can be an example of a share box 702A presented when the user is logged into another system, e.g., social network, and has not selected the endorsement button before.
- the share box 702a includes an upper portion 706A with a picture of the user and a prompt or suggestion to use the endorsement button.
- the share box 702A also includes recommended content 704A including a title and a link to access that content on the World Wide Web.
- the recommended content 704A may also include an identification of others that have endorsed the recommended content 704A and may include more information about them including their photo.

- input that relates to an endorsement can include requesting a webpage, requesting a webpage including an endorsement button, input proximate the endorsement button, a cursor over an endorsement button, a selection of an endorsement button, whether the content has been endorsed by any user, whether a particular user has endorsed the content, whether the user has made any endorsements to any content, whether the user has made a low number of endorsements, posting related to content, or sharing content.
- the endorsement context may include the timing of the selection of the endorsement button, events that occur before selection of the endorsement button and events that occur after the selection of the endorsement button.
- endorsement buttons may be provided alone or with annotations.
- different recommended content may be presented in the share box before selection of the endorsement button (around the time of cursor over) as compared with recommended content that can be provided after selection of the endorsement button.
- the recommended share box 702 includes mechanisms for users to view more detail about the recommended content. Some of these mechanisms can be provided to the user before they endorse a particular webpage or portion of content. In the event a user does not selected the endorsement button 602 and instead views the recommended content and transitions to a different or second webpage or system, a second endorsement button 602 will be presented on the second webpage or system. In some implementations, the endorsement/recommendation module 156 will process inputs from the user and if the endorsement button on the second webpage is selected, the endorsement/recommendation module 156 can present one or more message to disambiguate which content the user intended to endorse.
- messages to the user could include: "We noticed you just came from page X, would you like to endorse that page?" "Would you like to endorse both the current page enter prior page?" Or "Would you like to endorse both only this page?”
- the endorsement/recommendation module 156 may present a list of prior web pages that the user has visited and allow them to endorse one, all, or selected pages.
- endorsement/recommendation module 156 may receive and process other signals in addition to the domain or sub-domain of the content being viewed by the user. For example, other interfaces may be provided to allow the user to indicate how interesting the content is.
- a drop-down dialog box may be provided to allow the user to provide an endorsement rating of 1 to 5, 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest and most interesting.
- the level of interestingness that particular content has may also be automatically determined (e.g., how long a user views or engages a particular page or content). If the user views the page for a short period versus a long period (dwell time), the endorsement/recommendation module 156 automatically determined that can be an endorsement with a low level of interestingness. This dwell time could also be used by the endorsement server 112 to classify and boost recommendations. This automatic
- the identity of the referring page could be encoded into a token that includes a hash portion of the URL.
- the endorsement button on the second page could then decode the token to determine what the referring page was at the time the user transition to the recommended content. This approach can be advantageous because it minimizes the traffic and data that are sent to the endorsement server 112.
- Figure 9 shows an example webpage 900 including the endorsement button
- the example webpage 900 has various sections for
- This particular webpage 900 presents a photograph and thumbnail images of other pictures.
- the webpage includes content selections for subscriptions, editorial teams, services and other information.
- the webpage 900 provides navigation buttons for transitioning to other posts, accessing micro blogging sites and accessing other social networks.
- Figures 10A and 10B are example implementations 1000, 1050 of the webpage 900 of Figure 9 showing example share boxes 702B, 702C after the user has moved the cursor over the endorsement button 602.
- Figure 10A shows the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the user interface 710 of Figure 7B overlaid in response to the user moving the cursor over the endorsement button 602.

- Figures 11A and 1 IB are additional example implementations 1 100 and 1150 of the webpage 900 of Figure 9 showing example share boxes 702E, 702D after the user has moved the cursor over the endorsement button 602.
- Figure 11A shows the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the user interface 740 of Figure 7E overlaid in response to the user moving the cursor over the endorsement button 602.
- Figure 1 IB shows the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the user interface 730 of Figure 7D overlaid on the webpage 900 in response to the user moving the cursor over the endorsement button 602.
- Figures lOA-1 IB illustrate a particular advantage of the present disclosure which is that the recommended content 702 can be positioned on the user interface in close proximity to the endorsement button 602.
- the share box 702 may positioned and field with recommended content and placed near the endorsement button 602— in other words, without need for the user to move the cursor over the endorsement button 602.
- Figures 12A-12D show an example implementation 1200, 1220, 1240 and 1260 for a content icon 1202, 1204, 1206 and 1208 and associated information presented in response to hovering over the endorsement button 602. More specifically, Figure 12A shows the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the endorsement button 602, the content icon 1202 and the annotation 604 as part of the webpage 900. This interface 650 can be similar to that described above with reference to Figure 6F. Figures 12A-12D illustrate the transition of the content icon from content icon 1202 to content icon 1204 to content icon 1206 and then finally to content icon 1208. This transition can be responsive to a cursor over input upon either the endorsement button 602 or the content icon 1202.
- the transition of content icon 1202 to content icon 1208 provides a mechanism to give the user more information about why particular content is popular or "hot.”
- content icon 1202 can be a symbol indicating that the particular content on the website may be popular.
- content icon 1208 indicates the number of endorsements that the content has received. In other implementations, the numerical value could be used to indicate endorsements, instances of sharing the content, posts about the content, etc.
- the content icon 1204 of Figure 12B shows the original icon and a portion of the numeric value.
- the content icon 1206 of Figure 12C shows a portion of the original icon and a greater portion of the numerical value.
- Figures 13A-13F show example implementations of the webpage 900 and the share box 702 including recommended content 704 presented in response to selection of an endorsement button 602 or the sharing of content.
- Figure 13A shows an example implementation 1300 of the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the share box 7021 overlaid in response to the user selecting the endorsement button 602.
- This implementation of the share box 7021 includes an area for the user to add a comment as well as the recommended content 704 and the engagement action buttons for a photography group and to post the comment.
- Figure 13B shows an example implementation 1310 of the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the share box 702J.
- the share box 702J can be similar to the share box 7021, but also includes a comment that has already been added near the top of the share box 702J.
- the share box 702J is one example for the appearance of the share box 702 after the user has posted a comment.
- Figure 13C shows an example implementation 1320 of the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the user interface 800 of Figure 8A overlaid in response to user selection of the endorsement button 602.
- Figure 13D shows an example implementation 1330 of the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with a share box 702K overlaid in response to user selection of the endorsement button 602.
- the share box 702K has similar functionality to a combination of functions from share box 702A, 702E and 702H because it includes links to related articles, a follow action button, an add action button, identification of topics and other users with indicia of common users.
- Figure 13E shows an example implementation 1340 of the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the user interface 810 of Figure 8B overlaid in response to user selection of the endorsement button 602.
- Figure 13F shows an example implementation 1350 of the webpage 900 of Figure 9 with the user interface 820 of Figure 8C overlaid in response to user selection of the endorsement button 602.
