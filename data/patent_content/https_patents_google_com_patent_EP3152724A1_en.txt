- FIG. 1 is an illustration of one implementation of a system to provide notification via a computer network.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of one implementation of vector distance functions used to provide notifications via a computer network.
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of one implementation of vector distance functions used to provide notifications via a computer network.
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of one implementation of a method of providing notifications via a computer network.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating a general architecture for a computer system that may be employed to implement various elements of the systems and methods described herein, in accordance with an implementation.
- the notifications may identify a new competitor of the customer or a change in activity of a competitor (e.g., the competitor may become more or less active, enter a different market, change their marketing strategy or tactics, become more or less successful at reaching end users, etc.).
- the notifications can identify types of competitors (while masking a competitors identity) in various different platforms including, e.g., an online advertisement platform, social media platform, online video streaming platform, online news aggregator platform, social network platform, or other online platform where competitors may compete with a customer for market share, impressions, clicks, conversions, or access in general.
- a data processing system can periodically check for new competitors, which may include (1) new advertising entities that were not competing with a customer in the past or (2) existing advertising entities that were active in an online advertising platform but became more active.
- the data processing system can then identify the competitor and notify to the customer of the competitor, thus keeping the customer updated about changes in the market place. Further, the data processing system can notify the customer of important events associated with the identified competitors, such as a top competitor making a change to their advertisement campaign that results in 20% more meaningful impressions.
- the data processing system can automatically detect competitors and detect new competitors of the customer with minimum or no input from the customer. For instance, in some implementations, the data processing system can dynamically determine advertisement categories according to the customer's profile or customer's activities. The data processing system can then search for competitors based on the determined advertisement categories. Thus, in some implementations, the data processing system can identify competitors without the customer identifying the advertisement categories.
- An "online advertiser” or “internet advertiser” refers to a business (typically represented by a domain name, a web address, URL, or a smartphone app) that uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers.
- an online advertiser desires to display online advertisements on an online space that is likely visited by potential customers. Online advertisers that target similar consumer groups, accordingly, are likely to compete with each other for the same online space. Such online advertisers, therefore, belong to the same “advertising category” and are “advertisement competitors.”
- some or all competitors in a particular advertisement platform can be identified for an advertising customer.
- a comparison of the lists of potential competitors can help determine which of them are new.
- top competitors also referred to as "top competitors”.
- a finite number of competitors can be predetermined, either arbitrarily or statistically.
- a threshold or criterion can be established to filter the list of potential competitors to obtain the top competitors.
- the data processing system can identify an advertiser as a competitor to an advertising customer if the advertiser participates in a bid with the customer for particular online space, e.g., a keyword, phrase, term, entity, vertical, category at a particular location, etc. Further, the data processing system may determine that the advertiser is a competitor if the advertiser outbids the customer and wins the bid.
- the data processing system can manipulate data about advertising customers to determine competitors.
- the data processing system plots advertising customers of an advertisement platform on a multidimensional space. Using this
- the data processing system can determine that the nearest neighbors of a customer are determined to be the most likely competitors to the customer. In other words, the data processing system can generate a distance matrix using these dimensions to measure the "market similarity" between advertising customers.
- the data processing system can apply one or more functions, techniques, procedures, or algorithms on metrics such as clicks, cost, impressions, conversions, etc. to identify competitors or entities that similar to the customer.
- the techniques can include vector distance functions such as EXTENDEDJACCARD, DOT PRODUCT, SUM OF MIN, OVERLAP, WEIGHTED JACCARD and TWO HOP PAGERANK.
- the data processing system can determine these vector distance functions using the following functions:
- Equation 1 DOT PRODUCT
- Equation 2 SUM_OF_MIN
- Equation 3 EXTENDED JACCARD:
- Equation 4 WEIGHTED JACCARD:
- Equation 5 OVERLAP
- Equation 6 TWO HOP PAGERANK:
- C3 ⁇ 4(m) refers to the number of clicks that a customer's advertisement campaign is getting on a market m.
- Ch(m) refers to the cost of a customer's advertisement campaign in a market m.
- M refers to the overall set of markets under consideration.
- C m denotes the total number of clicks (or cost) in market m, over all competitors, not just the two under consideration.
- C d (m) refers to the number of clicks or costs associated with a domain of a potential competitor.
- the data processing system can apply weights to the vector distance functions.
- the weights can be based on an effectiveness of the vector distance functions or an importance of the vector distance functions.
- the effectiveness of a vector distance function in identifying competitors can be determined based on experimentation, optimization algorithms, or predetermined.
- the data processing system can weight the vector distance functions "TWO_HOP_PAGERANK,” “SUM OF MI " and "DOT-PRODUCT” higher or more heavily as compared to the other three vector distance functions when measuring the similarity between advertising customers.
- the data processing system can be configured to periodically identify competitors for a customer. They can then be stored and compared against previous lists of competitors. When the list changes because a new competitor is added to it (or a competitor is replaced) then a notification can be generated and displayed to the customer.
- the data processing system may notify a customer about an existing competitor base on a recent event such as, e.g., the existing competitor adding new campaigns, editing existing campaigns (e.g., changing bid, changing user interface), removing existing campaigns, or broadening an existing campaign (e.g., to new keywords or demographics).
- Events might also include passive actions such as a competitor winning more (or most) impressions in a particular vector (search term/demographic/web location/geolocation).
- events associated with a competitor can be aggregated to determine whether the competitor has become more active or less active (e.g., more or less active with respect to a threshold such as an activity threshold).
- a threshold such as an activity threshold.
- incremental bid increases can be combined into a single event so that the actual bid delta is represented instead of the most recent bid.
- Events can be combined based on their importance or based on the time period they represent.
- the data processing system can combine incremental bid events to generate a report or notification for a time period (e.g., provide a single notification or report to a customer that has not been on its advertisement account or looked at competitive reports for a predetermined period of time, such as 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, etc.).
- the customer may preset the time period, while in other implementations the data processing system may generate a notification for a time period based on the number of events (e.g., provide a notification for every 10 events, or 20 events, etc.).
- the notifications for a customer can be aggregated when, for instance, they are of the same event, category, user, or combination thereof.
- the data processing system can be further configured to measure the importance of a particular event.
- the importance of an event can be determined based on a threshold (relative or absolute) with respect to the bid or vector(s).
- a threshold relative or absolute
- an event can be identified as important if it generates a certain percentage more meaningful impressions or it has a percentage of increase in bid price.
- bids can be measured relative to the current customer. That is, events can be deemed critical when the bids exceed the bid in a particular vector of the current customer or an advertiser gains more impressions than the user in a particular vector.
- the data processing system can provide notification for presentation on a computing device of an advertisement customer.
- the notifications can be displayed on a display device of the computing device or coupled with the computing device.
- the data processing system can push the notifications to the computing device via a network, or the computing device can pull the notifications from the data processing system.
- the data processing system can periodically provide or transmit the notifications to the computing device via the network.
- the notification may include relevant information about the new competitor that can help the advertisement customer adjust their advertisement strategy.
- the notification may mask the identity of the new competitor (e.g., company or domain name) or the new competitor's advertisement strategy (e.g., advertisement keywords purchased or bid on or purchased or bid on video clips in an online streaming video platform or social media platform, etc.).
- the notification can include the advertisement category or targeted demographic of the new competitor.
- Advertisement category can be based on classification of an advertisement, and the category does not include information of a specific advertisement which may be not suitable for display due to privacy, regulatory or contractual restrictions. For instance, if a new competitor, which is a new supplier, purchases an advertisement keyword "sushi," the relevant advertisement category can be Asian food or catering. Accordingly, a notification that shows Asian food or catering will be informative to the advertisement customer.
- the new competitor may have purchased to place advertisement on certain video clips in an online video streamlining platform or web pages in a social network platform. Even if the specific identification of the video or the page is not included in the notification, certain categorization of the video or the page, as well as summary statistics of the visitors to the video or the page, can be valuable to the customer.
- the customer may be able to appreciate the relevant advertisement direction a new competitor is taking, or whether the new competitor is attempting to access a different group or location of people. Further, and in some
- the data processing system may hide or not provide actual bid values.
- a smart television module (or connected television module, hybrid television module, etc.), which may include a processing module configured to integrate internet connectivity with more traditional television programming sources (e.g., received via cable, satellite, over-the-air, or other signals).
- the smart television module may be physically incorporated into a television set or may include a separate device such as a set-top box, Blu-ray or other digital media player, game console, hotel television system, and other companion device.
- a smart television module may be configured to allow viewers to search and find videos, movies, photos and other content on the web, on a local cable TV channel, on a satellite TV channel, or stored on a local hard drive.
- a set-top box (STB) or set-top unit (STU) may include an information appliance device that may contain a tuner and connect to a television set and an external source of signal, turning the signal into content which is then displayed on the television screen or other display device.

- the competition analyzer 135 can be configured to apply various techniques to identify competitors of the customer.
- the competition analyzer 135 may identify competitors in real-time, a periodic basis, or upon request. In some implementations, the competition analyzer 135 may identify competitors responsive to receiving data about potential competitors or responsive to the customer taking an action (or receiving information about the action). In an illustrative implementation, the competition analyzer 135 may be configured to identify potential competitors of the customer responsive to the customer adding, modifying or removing an advertisement campaign, changing content selection criteria associated with an advertisement campaign (e.g., adding/removing keywords, bid amounts, geographic location selection criteria, demographic selection criteria, etc.).
- the competition analyzer 135 can be configured to identify competitors of the customer responsive to determining that the customer's advertisement metrics (such as impression rate, click through rate, conversion rate, cost per click, etc.) is sub-optimal (e.g., decreased or increased by a threshold amount within a certain time period).
- advertisement metrics such as impression rate, click through rate, conversion rate, cost per click, etc.
- the competition analyzer 135 can identify competitors using information associated with the customer (e.g., content provider 125). In some implementations, the competition analyzer 135 can identify competitors by measuring a vector distance between the customer and potential competitors. The dimensions of the vectors may be referred to as "nano- markets", where each dimension may represent information such as a query string, day, geographic location, or platform (or a combination of one or more information). Each advertiser in a market may be weighted using metrics such as impressions, clicks, cost, etc. The competition analyzer 135 may then apply one or more techniques or vector functions to determine the distance between the potential competitors and the customer.
- the competition analyzer 135 can apply the vector functions identified in Equations 1-6 to determine the vector distance.
- m refers to a nano-market such as search query string, day, time of day (e.g., time range or morning, afternoon, evening, night), geographic location (e.g., geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude), geographic area (e.g., country, state, city, town, county, geographic tiles), platform (e.g., operating systems, mobile operating system, desktop operating system), device type (e.g., mobile device, desktop device, tablet, smartphone, mobile telecommunications device, watch, smart watch, notebook computer), web browser, etc.
- M refers to the overall set of nano-markets under consideration.
- the identifier h used in Equations 1 -6 may refer to information about the customer for whom the data processing system 120 is identifying competitors. Further, the identifier d used in the Equations 1-6 may refer to the domain associated with a potential competitor (e.g.,
- FIGs. 2 and 3 provide a graphical illustration of the effectiveness of Equations 1-6 using the metrics clicks and cost, respectively.
- One or more of Equations 1-6 is plotted with respect to known competitor information to determine whether Equations 1 -6 identify a sufficient number of competitors.
- the known competitor information is obtained from bid-to-beat data provided by advertisers.
- Advertisers may provide, for an advertisement campaign, a bid amount to beat a domain (e.g., a competitor) during a time period. These domains represent perceived competitors of the advertiser.
- the bid amount may be a percentage increase in bid amount or an absolute increase in bid amount. If one or more of Equations 1-6 can reliably or accurately identify a sufficient number of competitors with respect to the bid-to-beat data, then the data processing system 120 can dynamically and automatically identify additional competitors using Equations 1-6 without having to rely on data provided by advertisers.
- FIG. 2 illustrates the recall as a function of competitor list size using clicks for each of Equations 1-6 as follows: SUM_OF_MIN 205, DOT_PRODUCT 210, OVERLAP 215,
- the y-axis represents the recall for the ranking algorithm as the fraction of the domains identified via bid-to-beat data provided by advertisers that were found within the first k competitors using one of the Equations 1-6.
- the recall at 1 is 0%
- the recall at 2 is 50%
- the recall at 3 is 50%
- the recall at 4 is 100% (further, the recall at 5 would also be considered to be 100%).
- Equations 1-6 illustrated in FIG. 2 the data is aggregated across campaigns, taking the average recall at ranking indices 1...n in order to compare algorithms.
- the data processing system 120 applies a certain algorithm to output the top N competitors, then it is estimated that this would output on average X% of the competitors identified via the bid-to-beat data provided by advertisers.
- the TWO HOP PAGE RANK 230, SUM OF MTN 205, and DOT PRODUCT 210 equations perform better than the other three equations because they identify a greater percentage of competitors (e.g., have a higher recall value).
- FIG. 3 illustrates that using cost as the metric may not produce as strong results as clicks as shown in FIG. 2 because all Equations 1-6 perform better with clicks is the metric.
- TWO HOP PAGE RANK 230, SUM OF MI 205, and DOT PRODUCT 210 equations may be effective at identifying competitor domains that customers or advertising campaigns regard as competitors that they would like to outperform.
- the competition analyzer 135 may use only one equation to identify competitors (e.g., Equation 2: SUM_OF_MIN). In some implementations, the competition analyzer 135 may use more than one equation to identify competitors (e.g., generate a list of potential competitors using multiple Equations, and identifying competitors as those potential competitors that are identified as being the top N competitor on both lists). Upon identifying competitors using one or more of Equations 1-6, the competition analyzer 135 may store the data in database 150, or provide the data to one or more modules or engines of the data processing system 120.

- the events can be associated with information about the event such as a description, time stamp, user identifier (e.g., competitor identifier such as a unique anonymous identifier), geographic location, etc.
- Events may include, e.g., the addition of a new advertisement campaign, editing an existing advertisement campaign (e.g., changing a bid, changing user interface, changing content selection criteria such as keywords, phrases, entities, demographics, location, device type, etc.), removing an existing advertisement campaign, broadening an existing advertisement campaign (adding new keywords or demographics).
- Events may include passive actions such as a competitor winning more (or the most) impressions in a vector dimension or nano-market (search term, demographic, web location, geographic location, etc.).

- the event evaluator 140 may combine events based on a time period (e.g., events falling within a predetermined or dynamically determined time period), category, competitor identifier, type of event, importance, activity type, etc.
- the event evaluator 140 may aggregate or combine events in situations in which the events may be too granular to make a significant impact individually, but the events may be important in the aggregate or signify an important trend or pattern.
- the event evaluator 140 may combine incremental bid increases made by a competitor into a single event so that the combined bid delta is represented instead of the most recent incremental bid.
- the event evaluator 140 may aggregate events or reports for a user (e.g., an online advertisement customer) that has not accessed their online account for a period of time (e.g., three weeks) or otherwise accessed or viewed their competitor reports for the time period. In this situation, the event aggregator may combine incremental bid events to represent changes for the last three instead of syndicating only the most recent bid change, even though the last bid change alone may be significant.
- the event evaluator 140 can be designed and constructed to determine the importance of the identified or aggregated events.
- the event evaluator 140 can measure events using various techniques.
- the event evaluator 140 may determine the importance of an event by comparing the event with a threshold (relative or absolute) based on a bid or a vector function.
- the event evaluator 140 may determine an event to be important if the event generates more meaningful impressions than a threshold (e.g., a percentage of more meaningful impressions such as 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 50% 75%, 100%, etc.), or the event is an increase in bid price by a threshold (e.g., a percentage increase in bid price or an absolute increase in bid price).
- the event evaluator 140 may determine that an identified event (e.g., a change to a content selection criteria such as a keyword of an advertisement campaign) is important if the event resulted in 5% more meaningful impressions (e.g., the impression resulted in a click or a conversion, or the impression was viewed for more than a certain number of seconds or minutes).
- an identified event e.g., a change to a content selection criteria such as a keyword of an advertisement campaign
- the event evaluator 140 can determine whether an event is important by measuring bids relative to the advertising customer. Events may be deemed important when the bids exceed the bid in a particular vector dimension or nano-market of the advertising customer, or the potential competitor gains more impressions than the customer in a particular vector.
- the event evaluator 140 weights events based on importance.
- the event evaluator 140 may determine weights using a machine learning mechanism such as a logistic regression analysis or other regression analysis.
- the event evaluator 140 may use the logistic regression model to determine that types of events (e.g., adding a new advertisement campaign, editing an existing advertisement campaign, removing an existing advertisement campaign, broadening the scope of an existing advertisement campaign, narrowing the scope of an existing advertisement campaign, winning a campaign bid, or losing a campaign bid) are more or less significant, and weight those events accordingly.
- the weights may be based on the effect of the event, such the event improving a competitor's click through rate, number of meaningful impressions, winning bids, conversion rate, etc.
- the data processing system 120 may determine that an event is important and provide a notification if a competitor broadens the scope of their advertisement campaign and achieves 5% more meaningful impressions (or any other percentage that indicates a significant event).
- the data processing system 120 may include a notification engine 145 designed and constructed to generate and provide notifications to a user device (e.g., a content provider 125 or an advertising customer using device 1 10).
- the notification engine 145 can generate a notification based on the arrival of a new competitor or activity from an existing competitor in an existing advertising category.
- the notification engine 145 may access a database 150 to retrieve a list of old competitors stored in the database 150.

- the activity may include an event or action.
- the notification engine 145 may generate or provide a notification based on the comparison.
- a competitor on the old, retrieved list of competitors may not have been active (e.g., winning few bids, having a relatively low number of meaningful impressions, having a constant or stagnant number of impressions, etc.).
- the notification engine 145 may then determine (e.g., via the event evaluator) that the same competitor now has a relatively higher level of activity (e.g., winning more bids or having a higher number of meaningful impressions).
- the notification engine 145 may generate or provide a notification to the customer that indicates that a competitor has an increased activity level.

- a computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a circuit, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.
- a computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system.
- a program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more circuits, sub programs, or portions of code).
- a computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, without limitation, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer.
- a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both.
- the essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data.
- a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks.
- mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks.
- a computer need not have such devices.
- a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few.
- Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including without limitation semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
- the processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor
- keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; in most implementations, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- references to "or” may be construed as inclusive so that any terms described using “or” may indicate any of a single, more than one, and all of the described terms.
- the phrase "at least one,” in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements.
- This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase "at least one" refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified.
- At least one of A and B can refer, in one implementation, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another implementation, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another implementation, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.
- the notifications can be associated with any program capable of generating and providing notifications for display.
