Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to information retrieval and, more particularly, to automated techniques for ranking documents in response to a search query.
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains a vast amount of information. Search engines assist users in locating desired portions of this information by cataloging web pages. Typically, in response to a user's request, the search engine returns references to documents relevant to the request.
- Search engines may base their determination of the user's interest on search terms (called a search query) entered by the user.
- the goal of the search engine is to identify links to high quality relevant results based on the search query.
- the search engine accomplishes this by matching the terms in the search query to a corpus of pre-stored web documents. Web documents that contain the user's search terms are considered “hits” and are returned to the user.
- a basic technique for sorting the search engine hits relies on the degree with which the search query matches the hits. For example, documents that contain every term of the search query or that contain multiple occurrences of the terms in the search query may be deemed more relevant than other documents and therefore may be more highly ranked by the search engine. Other factors, such as the closeness of terms (also referred to as distance between the terms) in the document may also be considered. Closeness of terms in this context may be measured simply by counting the number of words in the document occurring between the search terms.
- search engines For search engines, returning relevant and high quality documents in response to a search query is of paramount importance. Accordingly, it would be desirable to improve search engine ranking techniques that consider closeness of terms in a search query in the underlying document.
- One aspect of the invention includes a method of calculating a distance value between terms in a document.
- the method may include locating implicitly defined semantic structures in the document and calculating the distance values in the document based on the implicitly defined semantic structures.
- Another aspect consistent with the invention is a method for ranking documents relative to a search query.
- the method may include determining semantically based distance values between terms that occur in the search query and that are present in the documents, and ranking the documents for relevancy to the search query based on the determined distance values.
- Yet another aspect of the invention is a device that includes a memory and a processor coupled to the memory.
- the processor may determine semantically based distance values between terms that occur in a search query and that are present in documents.
- the processor may also rank the documents for relevancy to the search query based on the determined distance values.

- FIG. 9 illustrates concepts that may be used to augment a word count between terms when generating a distance metric
- FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary implementation of a ranking component implemented in the context of an Internet search engine.
- a relevance component uses a measured “distance” between pairs of search query terms when determining relevance of documents to the search query.
- the distance may be measured based on how close together terms are semantically rather than visually. In other words, even if terms are visually far apart in the rendered document, the measured distance may still indicate that the words are relatively close if the semantic structure of the document indicates that the words are semantically close.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an exemplary overview illustrating the concept of semantic distance relative to visual distance.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary document, such as a web page, including a list of facts about the planet Saturn. Semantically, each row of the list is probably equally relevant to every other row and to the title of the list, “Saturn Facts,” despite the fact that the various items are spaced at different visual distances from each other and from the title of the list. Thus, from a semantic standpoint, the item “Mass is 95 times that of Earth” should be considered to be equally distant from the title of the list (“Saturn Facts”) as the item “One Orbit of Sun is 10,759.2 Days.”

- FIG. 3 is an exemplary diagram of a client 210 or server 220 .
- Client/server 210 / 220 may include a bus 310 , a processor 320 , a main memory 330 , a read only memory (ROM) 340 , a storage device 350 , input devices 360 , output devices 370 , and a communication interface 380 .

- hardwired circuitry or other logic may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions to implement processes consistent with the present invention.
- implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an implementation of ranking component 225 in additional detail.
- Ranking component 225 may include a page analyzer component 410 , a distance component 420 , and a relevance component 430 .
- Page analyzer component 410 may generally analyze documents, such as HTML-based (Hyper-Text Markup Language) web pages, to detect lists, including implicit lists, within the documents.
- Distance component 420 may implement a distance function that calculates distance metrics between pairs of terms in the document. The distance metrics may be semantically based distances, such that, for example, terms that are in different items of a list, terms that are structurally separated, or terms that are separated by many words are considered far apart. The distances determined by distance component 420 may be used by a relevance component 430 in determining the relevance of the document to the search query.
- Structures other than lists may be detected by page analyzer component 410 .
- titles and headings may also be detected.
- page analyzer component 410 may analyze documents to detect lists.
- the lists can be determined based on HTML tags.
- Some lists may be explicitly defined by the HTML tags.
- the HTML “ ⁇ ul>” and “ ⁇ /ul>” tag are used to delimit the start and stop of an explicitly defined unordered list.
- An unordered list may be defined as a collection of items (typically related somehow) that are in no particular order.
- the “ ⁇ ol>” tag is another HTML tag that explicitly defines a list. More specifically, “ ⁇ ol>” and “ ⁇ /ol>” delimit the start and stop of an ordered list.
- HTML lists in addition to being defined explicitly with the ⁇ ul> and ⁇ ol> tags, may be defined implicitly. Web authors frequently use HTML tags other than ⁇ ul> and ⁇ ol> to create lists. To create different layouts, they may, for example, use nested tables (using the “ ⁇ table>” and “ ⁇ tr>” tags) or other HTML tags, such as the “ ⁇ div>” tags, “ ⁇ br>” tags, and “ ⁇ p>” tags to create lists. Other tags, in addition to these listed tags may be used to define an implicit list. Unlike ⁇ ol> and ⁇ ul>, however, these tags not formally defined for the creation of lists. Rather, they are used by web authors in an ad-hoc manner to create lists.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B are diagrams illustrating an exemplary implicit list defined using the ⁇ br> (line break) tag and the ⁇ b> (bold font) tag.
- FIG. 5A illustrates the HTML code 520 of the list
- FIG. 5B illustrates an exemplary rendered version 500 of the list.
- rendered version 500 of the list includes a number of items 510 - 514 .
- Each item, as shown in HTML code 520 is defined using the ⁇ b> tag to cause the first word in the list to be a bold font and ends with a ⁇ br> tag to create a line break.
- Page analyzer component 410 may decompose a document, such as the HTML code 520 , to analyze the structure of the document.
- page analyzer component 410 decomposes the document into a tree structure using the HTML markup (e.g., HTML tags) information. Implicit lists may be determined based on the repetition of the HTML tags in the tree structure.
- HTML markup e.g., HTML tags
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations of page analyzer component 410 for detecting semantic structures in a document, such as HTML code 520 , in additional detail.
- the document may be initially parsed into a tree structure (act 601 ).
- FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary tree structure 700 created from HTML code 520 .
- Tree structure 700 may display the hierarchical tag markup structure of HTML code 520 .
- DIV tag 710 is an HTML tag used to divide a document into sections and specify alignments for the sections.
- DIV tag 710 specifies center alignment (see FIG. 5A ).
- Tree structure 700 includes a first line break tag 713 ( ⁇ br>).
- Tree structure 700 next includes bold tag 714 ( ⁇ b>).
- Bold tag 714 and line break tag 713 are repeated for each item in HTML code 520 to thus create an implicit list.
- the combination of the bold font and the line breaks make clear to the reader that this text is a list of items.
- the repetition of commands in tree structure 700 may be analyzed to detect implicit lists (act 602 ).
- the analysis may be performed by looking for sets of two or more text formatting commands that are repeated.
- the potential text formatting commands may include the HTML tags ⁇ div>, ⁇ br>, and ⁇ p>, or that include table related HTML tags.
- Other text formatting commands, in addition these commands could be used to create implicit lists and could be included in the potential text formatting commands.
- other techniques, or variations on the technique of looking for sets of two or more text formatting commands may be used to detect implicit lists.
- special rules can be used to handle the first or last element of a list. For example, in tree structure 700 , the first ⁇ br> tag 713 may be missing. The special rules may be designed to handle these situations and still identify the list.
- each set of ⁇ br> tags 713 and ⁇ br> tags 714 may be recognized as a set of repeating tags in act 602 that defines an item of an implicit list.
- Tree structure 700 of HTML code 520 or the document itself, may be annotated to indicate the presence of this implicit list (act 603 ).
- Other lists, such as explicit lists specified with ⁇ ol> or ⁇ ul> tags may also be annotated.
- page analyzer component 410 may use tree structure 700 to detect headings and titles (act 602 ). Headings and titles can be detected in tree structure 700 as text associated with nodes that are above other nodes in the tree structure. In other words, text below a header/title node in the tree structure can be considered to belong to that heading/title.
- page analyzer component 410 locates visual structures that are semantically meaningful, such as implicitly defined lists in HTML documents, headings, and titles.
- semantically meaningful structures other than these structures may also be located by page analyzer 410 .
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart illustrating operations according to an exemplary implementation for determining ranking scores for documents.
- the ranking scores may be generated in the context of a search engine that is returning documents to a user that are relevant to a search query.
- ranking component 225 may more generally be used to generate a ranking score for any document relative to a sequence of terms.
- ranking component 225 may receive a document and a list of terms, such as a search query, that are to be used to rank the document (act 801 ).
- the document may be analyzed to locate semantically meaningful structures such as lists (implicit lists or explicit lists) or the text associated with headings/titles (act 802 ).
- this analysis may be performed by page analyzer component 410 and output as annotation information associated with the document.
- this analysis to locate semantically meaningful structures can be performed ahead of time on a corpus of documents. In this situation, act 802 may simply involve looking up the pre-calculated annotation information for the document.
- Distance metrics may next be generated for pairs of terms in the search query (act 803 ).
- the distance metrics may be generated by, for example, distance component 420 .
- the distance metrics may generally be based on how far apart terms are, such as that measured by the number of words (“word count”) between terms, in the document.
- the distance metrics may be further augmented by the concept of semantic closeness, determined based on structures within the document.
- FIG. 9 illustrates concepts that may be used to augment the word count between terms when generating a distance metric.
- a list 900 includes a header 905 and three list items: item A 910 , item B 912 , and item C 914 .
- Each item 910 , 912 , and 914 may include multiple words that describe the particular list item. Assume that both terms of a pair of terms are located in list 900 .
- the following rules may be used to generate the distance metric between the terms: (1) if both terms appear in the same list item, the terms are considered close to one another; (2) if one term appears in a list item and the other term appears in header 905 , this pair of terms may be considered to be approximately equally distant to another pair of terms that appear in header 905 and in another of the list items; (3) pairs of terms appearing in different list items may be considered to be farther apart than the pairs of terms falling under (1) and (2).
- these rules consider a pair of terms in which one term is the last word in item A 910 and the other term is the first word in item B 912 . Although these terms may be very close from a word count standpoint, the distance metric may indicate that they are farther apart than pairs of terms falling under (1) or (2).
- a term in the title of a document may be considered to be close to every other term in document regardless of the word count between the terms.
- a term occurring in a heading may be considered to be very close to other terms that are below the heading in the tree structure.
- a ranking score may be calculated for the document (act 804 ).
- Relevance component 430 may, for example, calculate the ranking score for the document.
- documents that include search terms that are relatively close to one another, as given by the distance metrics may be given higher ranking scores (i.e., these documents are considered to be more relevant to the search query).
- other factors could be used in generating the final ranking scores.
- the inverse document frequency (IDF) may be used to give more weight to less common words.
- different measurements of document quality such as those based on the interconnecting link-structure of a corpus of documents or those based on a predetermined quality of certain web sites or domains, may be factored into the final ranking score for a document.
- FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary implementation of ranking component 225 implemented in the context of an Internet search engine.
- a number of users 1005 may connect to a search engine 1010 over a network 1015 , such as the Internet.
- Search engine 1010 may be a traditional search engine that returns a ranked set of documents related to a user query.
- Search engine 1010 may be a general search engine, such as one based on all documents from a large collection, such as documents on the web, or a more specialized search engine, such as a news search engine.
- search engine 1010 may be implemented over a specialized corpus of documents, such as a corporate document database made available over a corporate network 1015 .
- search engine 1010 may receive a user query.
- the search engine may generate an initial set of documents that match the search query (i.e., documents that contain the terms of the search query) by comparing the search terms to document database 1020 .
- the search engine may then submit the initial set of documents to ranking component 225 for processing.
- Ranking component 225 may generate ranking scores for the documents.
- Search engine 1010 may sort the set of documents based on the ranking scores. Search engine 1010 may then return some or all of the sorted documents (or references to the sorted documents) to the user.
