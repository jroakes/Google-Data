Description
Technical Field
This description relates to improving wireless charging efficiency.
Background
Many mobile devices and other battery-powered devices need to receive energy for regular operation and to charge their batteries. Energy may be transferred wirelessly using electromagnetic coupling between the power transmitter and the power receiver.
Disclosure of Invention
In some implementations, the wireless charger and the power-receiving electronic device may cooperate to adaptively control an operating point for wireless charging. For example, to achieve high power transfer efficiency, the input voltage of the wireless power transmitter of the charger may be adjusted, and the output voltage from the wireless power receiver of the electronic device may be adjusted. The voltage may be dynamically adjusted as power delivery requirements change. In some cases, efficiency can be improved by adjusting the voltage. In some cases, efficiency may be improved by adjusting other parameters (such as the frequency of power transfer) or by adjusting the voltage in conjunction with these other parameters. By cooperatively changing the operating point, the charger and the electronic device can select and apply a combination of operating parameters that allows for high efficiency, low waste heat generation, and high charging speed. In some embodiments, the parameters may be set such that charging occurs at a point on or near the optimal efficiency envelope, as discussed further below.
To determine the appropriate operating parameters for wireless charging, charger profile data indicative of characteristics of the charger may be generated and stored, for example, as a model number, an equation, a table, a set of curves, or another form. When the device is charged using the charger, the device and/or charger may use the charger profile data to determine a set of operating parameters that provide high efficiency in view of the level of power transfer required. As power requirements change, the device and charger can adjust operating parameters to achieve high efficiency at different power levels. For example, when 6W of power is required, the input voltage of the wireless transmitter may be set to 9V, and the output voltage of the wireless receiver may be set to 9V. When 10W of power is required, the input voltage of the wireless transmitter may be set to 12V, and the output voltage of the wireless receiver may be set to 12V. Thus, the voltage and potentially other parameters may be varied to achieve the highest efficiency available for the desired power transfer level.
The charger and the device being charged may also set operating parameters to achieve high efficiency when charger profile data is not available or the charger characteristics are unknown. For example, an initial set of operational parameters may be used, and an efficiency metric may be calculated to indicate a current efficiency level. The operating parameters may be changed periodically and the efficiency recalculated. For example, the voltage of the wireless power transmitter and the voltage of the wireless power receiver may be gradually or incrementally increased. While the efficiency metric shows an increase in efficiency, the system can still continue to increase the voltage in this manner. However, once the efficiency begins to decrease, the system may stop incrementing the voltage and use one of the high efficiency settings found by the incremental adjustment of the parameters.

Detailed Description
Fig. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless charging system 100 including an electronic device 110 and a wireless charger 120. The electronic device 110 is placed on the wireless charger 120 such that the wireless charger 120 can be used to transfer power to the electronic device 110 through electromagnetic coupling. For example, the system 110 may transfer power through inductive coupling or resonant inductive coupling. The electronic device 110 may be, for example, a cell phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a wearable device, a pair of headphones, or another battery-powered device. The wireless charging system 100 automatically adjusts parameters for wireless charging to improve the overall efficiency of power transfer. For example, as shown in operation 130, the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger cooperate to improve wireless charging efficiency by automatically adjusting (i) an input voltage of a power transmitter in the charger 120 and (ii) an output voltage of a wireless power receiver in the electronic device 110. In some implementations, other wireless charging parameters may additionally or alternatively be adjusted, such as the frequency of the excitation pulses applied to the wireless power transfer coil of the wireless charger 120. As discussed below, the charger 120 and the electronic device 110 may determine or adjust the wireless charging parameters at various times, such as at the beginning of charging and/or when the demand level for wireless power transfer changes.
The wireless charger 120 may be configured to operate using operating parameters supported by specifications of the wireless charging consortium (WPC), such as the Qi standard for wireless charging. For example, the charging may be performed in a frequency range of 87kHz to 205 kHz. Additionally or alternatively, the charger 120 may be configured to operate using parameters of other standards, such as the AirFuel standard or Rezence standard. Examples discussed herein extend or enhance the operating modes of these standards by adjusting to improve efficiency, as discussed below. Further, the techniques disclosed herein may be used with voltages, currents, frequencies, power levels, communication protocols, and other parameters that may differ from those of the standard.
Fig. 2A is a block diagram illustrating an example of a wireless charging system 200. Fig. 2B and 2C illustrate various operations of the system 200 in more detail. The system 200 includes a power supply 210, a wireless charger 120, and an electronic device 110. Power is wirelessly transferred from the wireless charger 120 to the electronic device 110 using electromagnetic induction (e.g., magnetic induction) between the receiver coil and the transmitter coil. Positioning the receiver coil of the device 110 above the transmitter coil of the charger 120 allows for electromagnetic coupling (e.g., magnetic coupling) when the transmitter coil is driven. Through this coupling, currents and voltages are induced in the receiver coil. The output voltage of the receiver coil is then rectified and used by the electronic device 110, for example, to operate the device 110 and to charge a battery of the device 110.
In more detail, the power supply 210 is connected to a power source, such as an Alternating Current (AC) power outlet. The power supply 210 converts input power, such as an input AC voltage, to a DC voltage that is used as an input to the wireless charger 120. In particular, the output of the power supply 210 may be used as the input voltage VINAs discussed further below. In some embodiments, the power supply is programmable or otherwise adjustable to output different voltage levels in response to communications from the wireless charger 120. For example, the power supply 210 may include circuitry to receive data from the wireless charger 120 requesting a particular voltage, and then adjust its output voltage (e.g., voltage V) accordinglyIN). For example, the power supply 210 may support only a few voltage levels, such as 5V, 9V, and 12V, or as another example, may support a broader set of voltage levels, such as any voltage from 5V to 20V in increments of 1V, 0.5V, 0.1V, or 10 mV. In many cases, fine-grained increments may be used, such as 20mV increments. In some embodiments, the power supply may operate according to the universal serial bus power delivery (USB-PD) specification, which may involve a voltage step of 20mV for the output voltage. Although the power supply 210 is illustrated as being separate from the wireless charger 120, the power supply 210 may alternatively be integrated with the wireless charger 120.
The wireless charger 120 includes a wireless power transmitter 220. The wireless power transmitter 220 includes a driver circuit 240, a capacitor Cs _ tx, and a power transfer coil L11_ tx. Driver circuit 240 receives a DC voltage V from power supply 210INAnd generates a series of excitation pulses at a desired frequency. For example, the driver circuit 240 may be a switching inverter driver using MOSFETs in a half-bridge or full-bridge topology. The excitation pulse is supplied to a capacitor Cs _ tx which is connected in series with the power transmitter coil L11_ tx. The capacitor Cs _ tx and the transmitter coil L11_ tx form a resonant tank and the excitation pulse causes an alternating magnetic field to be generated by the power transmitter coil L11_ tx.
The electronic device 110 includes a wireless power receiver 250, a processor 285, a charger circuit 290, and a battery 292. Other components of the electronic device are not shown, but may include any suitable device (e.g., input device, output device, screen, speaker, processor, etc.) and be powered by the battery and wireless power receiver 250.
The wireless power receiver 250 includes a receiver power management circuit 270, a capacitor Cs _ rx, a power receiver coil L22_ rx, and a detection capacitor Cd _ rx. The capacitor Cs _ rx and the power receiver coil L22_ rx form a resonant tank that is tuned to efficiently receive power at a frequency that is substantially the same as the frequency transmitted by the power transmitter 220 (e.g., typically within 5% or less). When the electronic device 110 is properly placed over the wireless charger 120 and the power transmitter coil L11_ tx is activated, the power receiver coil L22_ rx is inductively coupled with the power transmitter coil L11_ tx such that the power receiver coil L22_ rx receives the power transmitted from the power transmitter coil L11_ tx. The inductive coupling induces a voltage and current in the power receiver coil L22_ rx provided to the receiver power management circuit 270. In the figure, the label M indicates a coupling coefficient which depends on the position of the power receiver coil L22_ rx relative to the transmitter coil L11_ tx.
Receiver power management circuit 270 includes a rectifier 275 and a voltage regulator 280. The rectifier 275 converts the AC voltage and current to a DC voltage and current. The rectifier 275 mayIncluding a full bridge rectifier or any suitable circuit that provides rectification. For example, the rectifier may be a diode-based rectifier or a switching rectifier. Voltage regulator 280 receives the rectified DC output from rectifier 275 and regulates it to a desired output DC voltage level. This regulated DC output VOUTMay be the output of the wireless power receiver 250. Voltage regulator 280 may be programmable or otherwise adjustable such that the output voltage level V provided by the voltage regulator may be dynamically adjustedOUT. For example, in response to instructions from the processor 285, the receiver power management circuit 270 and its voltage regulator 280 may regulate the voltage VOUTTo provide a desired output voltage to the charger circuit 290. Voltage regulator 280 may be any suitable type of voltage regulator, such as a linear regulator or a switching regulator. The voltage regulator 280 may be configured as a Low Dropout (LDO) regulator.
In the electronic device 110, the charger circuit 290 receives power from the wireless power receiver 250 and converts it to the appropriate voltage and current to charge the battery 292. The charger circuit 290 or other circuitry of the electronic device 110 also uses power from the wireless power receiver 250 for normal operation of the electronic device 110, e.g., system loads of power currently being consumed by the electronic device 110. In general, the electronic device 110 is configured such that power from the wireless power receiver 250 can be used to power both the system load and the battery charging load.
The processor 285 communicates with the receiver power management circuit 270 and the charger circuit 290 to determine and set the appropriate wireless charging parameters. For example, the processor 285 may be a Central Processing Unit (CPU), microcontroller, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), or other circuitry. Although illustrated as a single element, the processor 285 may be implemented as a plurality of processors and the functions of the processor 285 may be distributed among a plurality of different processors or circuits.
In the system 200, the wireless charger 120 and the electronic device 110 are configured to communicate with each other (e.g., data communication to exchange requests, acknowledgements, instructions, identifiers, power levels, voltage indications, efficiency indications, etc.). This communication may be bidirectional. In some embodiments, communication is over inductive coupling between the power transmitter coil L11_ tx and the power receiver coil L22_ rx, which may be referred to as "in-band" communication between the wireless power transmitter 226 and the wireless power receiver 250. The wireless charger 120 may communicate data through inductive coupling using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), e.g., modulating the frequency of the excitation pulse used to drive the power transmitter coil L11_ tx using the fundamental frequency of the power transfer as the carrier. These frequency changes may be detected and interpreted by the electronic device 110. The electronic device 110 may transmit data, for example, by changing an impedance presented by the wireless power receiver 250 using Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK). The change in impedance may be detected by the wireless power transmitter 22, for example, as a change in reflected impedance. In this way, both the wireless charger 120 and the electronic device 110 can transmit and receive data through inductive coupling between the coils L11_ tx, L22_ rx. In some implementations, communication between the wireless charger 120 and the electronic device 110 may additionally or alternatively be accomplished using a communication channel separate from the inductive coupling, which may be referred to as "out-of-band" communication. For example, the communication may occur via a radio frequency wireless communication protocol such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
Communication between the wireless charger 120 and the electronic device 110 may be used to identify or verify device compatibility, control power levels, and communicate other data discussed below, such as negotiating operating voltages. For example, the electronic device 110 may provide data indicative of power requirements to the wireless charger 120. The electronic device 110 may also provide data indicative of one or more operating parameters of the wireless charger 120, such as to be used as the input voltage VINThe voltage of (c). The electronic device 110 may also receive data identifying the wireless charger 120 (e.g., an identifier of the model or type of charger), which may allow the electronic device 110 to verify the authenticity and compatibility of the wireless charger 120 and determine appropriate settings for charging with the wireless charger 120.
As discussed below, the operating parameters of the electronic device 110 and/or the wireless charger 120 may be adjusted to be integralProviding high efficiency of the system 200, e.g., the overall efficiency from the power input of the wireless power transmitter 220 to the power output at the wireless power receiver 250. In some implementations, the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger 120 coordinate VINAnd VOUTTo achieve the highest efficiency possible for the overall power requirements of the electronic device 110 (e.g., power for battery charging, system operation, or both). In some embodiments, other parameters may be adjusted, such as the switching frequency of the driver circuit 240, which may be tuned to change the power conversion gain, thereby changing the output voltage.
Fig. 2B is a block diagram illustrating an example of the operation of the wireless charging system 200. The example of fig. 2B illustrates how the electronic device 110 may determine operating parameters for wireless charging based on known characteristics of the wireless charger 120. Operation of system 200 for establishing operating parameters for charging is shown in a series of stages (a) - (H), which may occur in the order shown or in other orders.
The operation shown in fig. 2B may occur when wireless power transfer is first initiated as electronic device 110 and wireless charger 120 negotiate to establish appropriate operating parameters for wireless charging. As another example, operation may occur as the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger 120 determine parameters for entering a high power charging mode from a charging mode that provides a lesser amount of power or a default power level. Some or all of the steps may be repeated at other times, for example, in response to changes in the power requirements of electronic device 110, or after a predetermined period of time has elapsed.
To enable efficient charging at various power levels, characteristics of different wireless charger models may be determined and stored in the charger profile 286. In some implementations, a single wireless charger model (or a group of similar models) may have a corresponding charger profile 286. Each charger profile 286 may indicate different operating characteristics of the corresponding charger, including different input voltage levels VINWhich provides the most efficient power transfer at different wireless power output levelsAnd (4) rate. For example, the charger profile 286 of the charger 120 may indicate that for a power output of 0W up to 3.5W, V of 5V should be usedIN(ii) a For power outputs of 3.5W up to 7W, V of 9V should be usedIN(ii) a For power outputs of 7W up to 11.5W, V of 12V should be usedIN(ii) a And a power output of more than 11.5W, V of 15V should be usedIN. This information may be represented in any suitable form or data structure, such as one or more data models, tables, files, maps, equations, executable code segments, and so forth. The charger profile data may indicate a relationship between operating settings (e.g., voltage, frequency, etc.) and power transfer levels that provide the maximum efficiency achievable in view of the characteristics of the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger 120. For example, the charger profile data 286 may indicate parameters that specify operating points along an upper limit of a maximum efficiency envelope, where efficiency is the total system efficiency from the input of the power transmitter 220 to the output of the wireless power receiver 250.
In some embodiments, the inefficiency of the charger circuit 290 or the power it consumes may be taken into account in the model for a more comprehensive estimation of the overall system efficiency. To address this issue, the charger profile 286, which represents the interaction characteristics of the electronic device 110 and a different wireless charger, may incorporate information about the charger circuit 190. In some embodiments, the information characterizing the charger circuit 290 may be stored in a separate model or data set used with the charger profile 286.
Additionally, the charger profile 286 may reflect the capabilities of the charger, and possibly also the power source used with the charger. Thus, the charger profile 286 may indicate the operational modes supported by the charger and its power supply, such as the allowed input voltage range, the supported power class range, the optional set of discrete input voltages, for VINThe minimum increment of change allowed (e.g., 1.0V, 0.1V, 0.01V, etc.). The charger profile 286 for the charger may also specifically indicate capabilities and/or limitations of the charger, e.g., which of various operating modes or parameter ranges the charger may use.
In some implementations, the charger profile 286 indicates not only characteristics of a wireless charger, but also system level characteristics resulting from interaction of a particular electronic device 110 with different models or types of chargers. For example, two models of phones may have different shapes or types of power receiving coils, resulting in different inductive coupling characteristics. As a result, the two phone models may have different charger profiles 286 for a single model of wireless charger to account for the different ways in which the two phones interact with the wireless charger. Accordingly, the charger profile 286 stored and used by the electronic device 110 may be customized to reflect particular coupling characteristics resulting from interaction of a particular model of the electronic device 110 with a particular model of wireless charger. Further, the charger profile 286 may indicate operating parameters and parameter ranges for the wireless power receiver 250 of the electronic device 110, such as V for different power transfer levelsOUT. For example, the charger profile 286 stored by the electronic device 110 may indicate VINAnd VOUTProvide optimal efficiency for different power transmission levels and potentially other parameters of the electronic device 110 and/or the wireless charger 120.
In some implementations, the charger profile 286 may be developed based on metrics for actual operating results measured for different device-charger pairs. In some implementations, the charger profile 286 may be based at least in part on an estimation or simulation of the results of the interaction between the device-charger pair.
The electronic device 110 may store the various wireless charger profiles 286 in one or more storage devices (e.g., non-volatile storage) of the electronic device 110. As a result, the charger profile 286 of the wireless charger 120 (as well as other models and types of wireless chargers) may exist and be available for use on the electronic device prior to placing the electronic device 110 on the wireless charger 120. In some implementations, the charger profile 286 may be obtained through various other channels (e.g., from the wireless charger 120 or from a server system over a computer network).
Still referring to fig. 2B, in stage (a), the electronic device 110 receiving power identifies a charger model or charger type of the wireless charger 120. This may occur, for example, at the beginning of wireless charging because the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger 120 negotiate operational settings to initiate power transfer or increase power transfer from an initial or default level to a higher power level. The electronic device 110 may receive identification information of the wireless charger 120, such as a model identifier of the wireless charger 120. The identification information may be provided automatically by the wireless charger 120 or may be provided in response to a request for information from the electronic device. In the illustrated example, the processor 285 determines that the wireless charger 120 with which it communicates has a model of "model 123".
In the illustrated example, communication of the identification information of the wireless charger 120 (as with other communications discussed between the wireless charger 120 and the electronic device 110) occurs using "in-band" communication through inductive coupling between the wireless charger 120 and the electronic device 110. However, communication may additionally or alternatively be achieved using "out-of-band" communication through a communication channel separate from the coupling of the power transmission coil L11_ tx and the power reception coil L22_ rx.
In stage (B), the electronic device 110 selects a charger profile 286 that is appropriate for the identified model of the wireless charger 120. In this example, the electronic device 110 stores multiple charger profiles 286 for different models of wireless chargers. Each of these may be associated with a model identifier or other identifying information to facilitate the lookup. The processor 285 selects a charger profile 286 corresponding to the identified charger model (e.g., "model 123") from various charger profiles 286. The charger curve 286 may indicate different operating voltages, e.g., VINAnd VOUTWhich provides the highest efficiency for different power transmission classes.
The processor 285 may determine whether there is an available charger profile 286 for the identified model or type of wireless charger. If the electronic device 110 does not store the appropriate charger profile 286 for the current charger, the electronic device 110 may request and obtain one. In some implementations, the wireless charger 120 can store and provide a charger profile to the electronic device. In some implementations, the electronic device may obtain the charger profile over a computer network (such as over the internet). If the electronic device 110 cannot obtain the appropriate charger profile 286 for the wireless charger 120, or if the wireless charger 120 cannot be identified during phase (a), the electronic device 110 may use the technique of fig. 2C instead of the remaining technique of fig. 2B to determine the operating parameters. When the charger profile 286 is available and identified, as in the example of fig. 2B, the charger profile data is used to set the operating parameters of the system 200, as discussed further below.
In stage (C), the electronic device 110 determines the power requirements of the electronic device. For example, the processor 285 communicates with the charger circuit 290 and determines the total amount of power required by the electronic device 110. This may include determining a system load, e.g., an amount of system power required or currently consumed by the operation of device 110, and a charging load, e.g., an amount of power required to charge battery 292 of device 110. The power requirement may be the sum of the system load and the charging load up to a maximum level (e.g., a maximum power level of the wireless power receiver 250 or a maximum power level of the wireless power transmitter 220). In this example, the electronic device 110 determines that the power requirement is 10W.
In stage (D), the electronic device 110 will use the charger profile 286 of the wireless charger and the power demand level of the electronic device 110 to determine the operating parameters for wireless charging. For example, the processor 285 looks up the selected charger profile 286 to indicate the most efficient charging parameters for delivering power at the current power demand (e.g., 10W). Using the charger profile 286, the processor 285 determines (i) the input voltage V to be provided to the wireless power transmitter 220INAnd (ii) an output voltage V to be provided by the wireless power receiver 250OUTIn order to achieve the highest overall power transmission efficiency. In the illustrated example, the processor 285 determines that the preferred operating parameter for 10W power transfer is an input voltage V of 12VINAnd an output voltage V of 12VOUT。
May depend on how the charge is storedThe appliance profile data uses the charger profile 286 in different ways. For example, the charger profile may be expressed as a table with data representing different power levels and corresponding operating parameters (e.g., V)INAnd VOUTValue of). This allows processor 285 to identify the table entry with the power level closest to the current power demand and use the operating parameters for that entry. As another example, the charger profile data may include one or more equations or functions that the processor 285 may use to calculate operating parameter values based on power demand. As another example, the charger profile data may include data specifying efficiency curves indicating efficiencies of using different voltage levels at different power levels, and the processor 285 may determine which curve and which voltage level provide the highest efficiency for the current power demand. As another example, the charger profile data may specify a maximum efficiency envelope across different power levels, such that the processor 285 may determine a point along the maximum efficiency envelope and select an operating parameter corresponding to the point. Other types of charger profile data may additionally or alternatively be used, such as classifiers, machine learning models, and the like.
For many chargers and device combinations, at VINAnd VOUTAt a specific ratio of (A) or at VINAnd VOUTWithin a certain ratio range, the highest overall transmission efficiency is achieved. For example, the highest efficiency can be achieved at a ratio of 1: 1. As another example, depending on various conditions, the highest efficiency may be achieved at a ratio between 1:1 and 1.2: 1. The charger profile 286 may indicate desired ratios and/or voltage levels, and the electronic device 110 may use them to set operating parameters, or the charger profile 286 may in some implementations simply specify parameter values consistent with these ratios.
Furthermore, for many charger and device combinations, the highest efficiency can be achieved when the current level is about 0.3A to 1.5A. The most efficient current level may vary from device to device and power level, but may be about 1A in some cases. In many cases, the most efficient charge setting will be VINAnd VOUTThe voltage is placed at a level between 1x and 3x of the power transmission level in watts. For example, if 1.5 times the power level provides higher efficiency for a particular combination of device and charger, V for a 6W power transferINAnd VOUTCan be set at 9V, V for a power level of 8WINAnd VOUTMay be set at 12V, etc.
In some implementations, the electronic device 110 determines that the wireless charger 120 and/or the power supply 210 is doing VINThe ability to adjust. Some wireless chargers 120 and power supplies 210 may allow for continuous regulation (e.g., any voltage within a range), fine-grained regulation (e.g., voltage steps at 0.1V, 0.5V, etc.), others may allow only coarse regulation (e.g., voltage steps at 1.0V, 2.0V, etc.), and others may allow only certain predetermined modes of operation (e.g., 5V, 9V, and 12V). Similarly, different power levels may be supported. This information may be included in the charger profile 286 of the charger. However, because the wireless charger 120 may use different power supplies 210 (e.g., USB ports, dedicated AC/DC adapters, etc.) at different times, the capabilities may change at different times. Thus, the electronic device 110 may obtain the type or capability of the power source 210 and/or the wireless charger 120 by communicating with the wireless charger 120. With this information, processor 285 may adjust selected operating parameters, such as by adjusting VINAnd VOUTSet to the supported level closest to the effective level calculated using the charger profile 286.
In stage (E), the electronic device 110 transmits data indicative of the calculated operating parameters of the wireless charger 120 to the wireless charger 120. For example, the electronic device 110 transmits an indication of the power requirements of the electronic device 110 and an input voltage V to be used for the input of the wireless charger 120INIs indicated. In this example, the processor 285 causes the wireless power receiver 250 to transmit an indication of the requested power level (e.g., 10W). Alternatively, the electronic device 110 may transmit data indicative of other operating parameters of the wireless charger 120, such as the frequency used to drive the transmitter coil L11_ tx, which may adjust the inductionThe gain of the coupling and thus the power transfer is adjusted to increase efficiency. In some cases, where the wireless charger sets parameters based on parameters used by the electronic device 110, operating parameters of the electronic device 110 (e.g., V used) may be transmittedOUT)。
The electronic device 110 may indicate the operating parameters to the wireless charger 120 in any of a variety of different forms. As an example, specific values of power levels or operating voltages may be provided. This value may be indicated in absolute terms (e.g., 12V) or relative terms (e.g., increasing the voltage by 3V or increasing the voltage by 30%). As another example, the electronic device 110 may transmit a code corresponding to an operating mode or parameter of the wireless charger 120, such as V representing V at 5VINCode "1" of the following operation, V at 9VINCode "2" of operation below, and so on, for different supported operating modes or supported operating parameters of the wireless charger 120. The operating mode and corresponding code and communication protocol information may be stored in and retrieved from the charger profile 286 of the charger.
In stage (F), the electronic device 110 sets the operating parameters of the wireless power receiver 250 to the settings determined in stage (D). For example, processor 285 sends instructions for receiver power management circuit 270 to set voltage regulator 280 to the determined output voltage level (e.g., set V)OUTSet to 12V). By determining and setting operating parameters for both the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger 120, the system 200 may enhance the overall efficiency of power transfer for both the wireless power transmitter 220 and the wireless power receiver 250. This may ensure that settings are coordinated or aligned. This may allow for improved charging speed and avoid excessive heat generation or excessive temperature generation in the wireless power transmitter 220 and the wireless power receiver 250, which may otherwise require lower power transfer levels and slower charging speeds.
In phase (G), the wireless charger 120 communicates with the power supply 210 to regulate the input voltage V provided by the power supply 210 to the wireless power transmitter 220IN. In the illustrated example, wireless chargingThe indicator indicates that the power supply 210 will input a voltage VINSet to 12V as indicated by communications from electronic device 110.
In some implementations, the wireless charger 120 may provide confirmation to the electronic device 110, for example, confirming receipt of data and/or confirming that the requested operating parameters have been set. For example, the response may be provided after receiving data indicative of the power level and the operating voltage level in phase (E), or after adjusting the operating voltage level in phase (G). The wireless charger 120 may indicate VINOr the actual values of other operating parameters used, particularly if the power supply 210 or wireless charger 120 is unable to support the specified power level or operating voltage requested by the electronic device 110. This may allow the electronic device 110 to adjust its settings accordingly, such as reducing battery charging power if the wireless charger 120 is unable to supply the full amount of power requested.
Similarly, if the wireless charger is unable to support the input voltage V specified by the electronic device 110INThen electronic device 110 may base on the V usedINWill output a voltage VOUTAdjusted to a desired level. This can avoid VINAnd VOUTMismatch between levels, which may negatively impact efficiency. For example, if power supply 210 has a maximum voltage output of 9V, and thus cannot provide the desired 12V for maximum efficiency, electronic device 110 may use indication 9V VINAnd the voltage V is measuredOUTDown to 9V. As discussed above, for many charger and device combinations, at VINAnd VOUTA specific ratio of (A) or (V)INAnd VOUTWithin a certain ratio range, the highest overall transmission efficiency is achieved. For example, the highest efficiency can be achieved at a ratio of 1: 1. As another example, depending on the conditions, the highest efficiency may be achieved with a ratio between 1:1 and 1.2: 1.
In phase (H), the electronic device 110 monitors the power requirements of the electronic device 110. As charging proceeds, the processor 285 may perform this ongoing monitoring. Electronic device 110 may dynamically determine new operational parameters during chargingNumber, including voltage VINAnd VOUT. If the processor 285 determines that the total power demand (e.g., system load and/or battery charging load) has changed by, for example, at least a predetermined minimum amount, the processor 285 may cause the operating parameters for wireless charging to be determined and reset using the operation of phases (C) through (G) to achieve high efficiency at the new power demand level.
In some implementations, for example, the processor 285 periodically recalculates the power requirements and wireless charging settings using the operations of phases (C) through (G) at a predetermined rate, such as every 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, every minute, every 10 minutes, and so forth.
In some embodiments, when a predetermined event or condition is detected, such as the output voltage VOUTWhen the target output voltage level is dropped below, or the system power load changes by at least a predetermined minimum amount, the electronic device 110 adjusts the operating parameter. In response to the detected event or condition, the wireless charging system 200 may repeat some or all of the operations of stages (C) through (G). To facilitate detection of events and conditions, the electronic device 110 may store a plurality of values for evaluating current conditions of wireless charging, such as: a target output voltage 287, e.g., a desired level of VOUT, in this example 12V; a target output current 288, and a target efficiency metric 289. If it is determined that the actual output voltage, output current, or efficiency deviates from the target level (e.g., by more than a predetermined amount), processor 285 may reevaluate the operating parameters for wireless charging.
In the example of fig. 2B, the electronic device 110 determines operating parameters, including the voltage V, that affect the operation of both the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger 120INAnd VOUT. This is beneficial in many situations because electronic devices such as telephones and portable computers often have storage and processing capabilities that exceed those of many chargers. This also allows the electronic device 110 to operate efficiently with various chargers, even with future charger designs, by obtaining a new charger profile 286. Similarly, it allows the wireless charger 120 to include relatively simple processing logic, thereby preserving the cost and complexity of the charger. However, it can be usedHe arranges it. For example, in some embodiments, the roles may be reversed, and the wireless charger 120 may determine an operating parameter, such as voltage VINAnd VOUTAnd may be substituted with a preferred VOUTThe rating is communicated to the electronic device. For example, the wireless charger 120 may store one or more charger profiles, receive data indicative of a model identifier or capabilities of the electronic device 110, receive data indicative of power requirements of the electronic device 110. The wireless charger 120 may then determine the voltage V of the electronic device 110 using the stored charger profileOUTTo use and transmit data indicative of the voltage. In other embodiments, the determined operating parameters may be obtained by sharing processing among the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger 120, for example, by further negotiation and exchange of messages therebetween.
In some cases, the electronic device 110 may determine that the charger is not identifiable or does not have a charger profile 286. In these cases, electronic device 110 may determine and set the operating parameters to achieve high efficiency using the techniques discussed with respect to fig. 2C.
Fig. 2C is a block diagram illustrating an example of the operation of the wireless charging system 200. The illustrated example shows a technique that may be used to determine operating parameters for efficient wireless charging without the charger profile 286. This technique may be used, for example, when the electronic device 110 is unable to identify the type of charger 120 being used, or if there is no charger profile 286 available for the wireless charger 120 of the electronic device 110. Various operations are shown in stages (a) - (E), which may be performed in the order indicated or in other orders.
Wireless charging may initially begin with a default set of operating parameters, e.g., a default or low power charging mode suitable for a large number of devices. The electronic device 110 may obtain information from the wireless charger 120 indicating the capabilities of the wireless charger 120 and/or the power supply 210 to determine the operating mode and voltage level available for use.
The electronic device 110 may instruct the wireless charger 120 to use the basic or safe set of operating parameters even though they are not the most efficient.For example, the electronic device 110 may instruct the wireless charger 120 to use an input voltage V that is typically lower than the optimal input voltageIN. In this example, the electronic device 110 sends a message 293, the message 293 instructing the wireless charger to use an input voltage V of 9VINAnd a power level of 10W. Electronic device 110 may then perform various parameter adjustment cycles discussed below in phases (a) - (E) to increase input voltage VINUntil high efficiency is achieved, e.g., approximately optimal efficiency given charging conditions.
In phase (a), the electronic device 110 obtains data indicative of the current settings of the wireless power receiver 250. For example, the processor communicates with the receiver power management circuit 270 to determine the output voltage V of the wireless power receiver 250, such as (i) the current supplyOUTAnd (ii) a parameter of an amount of output power or output current from the wireless power receiver 250.
In phase (B), the electronic device 110 obtains data indicative of the current settings of the wireless power transmitter 220 of the wireless charger 120. For example, the electronic device 110 may send a request for these settings, or may be automatically provided by the wireless charger 120. The wireless charger 120 sends a message 294 indicating a setting for wireless charger use, such as (i) the input voltage V currently being usedINAnd (ii) the amount of input power or input current received by the wireless power transmitter 220.
In stage (C), the electronic device 110 calculates and stores a combined efficiency metric for the transmitter and receiver settings currently in use. For example, the processor 285 calculates the power transfer efficiency of the system 200 by dividing the input power to the wireless power transmitter 220 by the output power from the wireless power receiver 250. This is illustrated in the first row of table 295, showing when for VINAnd VOUTProcessor 285 calculated an efficiency of 77.0% using a voltage of 9V.
In stage (D), the electronic device 110 compares the latest efficiency metric to a previous efficiency metric, such as an efficiency metric for an immediately previous parameter adjustment cycle. However, for the initial parameter adjustment period, there are no previous periods and efficiency metrics available for comparison. The stored first efficiency measure is used as a reference to compare with the efficiency measure of the subsequent parameter adjustment cycle.
In stage (E), the electronic device 110 determines an adjusted set of operating parameters for the electronic device 110 and the wireless charger 120. The electronic device 110 sends an indication to the wireless charger 120 that the operating parameters of the wireless charger 120 should be changed. For example, the electronic device 110 may apply the voltage VINAnd VOUTSome increments are added in order to achieve higher system level efficiency for wireless power transfer. The processor 285 may determine the level of increments supported by the wireless charger 120 and the power supply 210, e.g., whether 0.1V or 1.0V increments are allowed, the voltage range allowed, whether regulation is limited to a particular voltage set, etc.
In this example, the processor 285 determines that a voltage delta of 0.1V is supported, so the processor 285 determines that the voltage V is to be appliedINAnd VOUTIncreases the increment from 9.0V to 9.1V. The processor 285 causes a message 296 to be sent to the wireless charger 120 requesting a new voltage V of 9.1VIN. The wireless charger 120 then communicates with the power supply 210 to charge VINAdjust to this level or the closest voltage level supported. Processor 285 also causes receiver power management circuit 270 to adjust the voltage V used by voltage regulator 280OUTChanging to 9.1V. In some implementations, the electronic device 110 may indicate other operating parameter changes made to the electronic device 110 and/or the wireless charger 120, such as adjusting the frequency used for power transfer and thus adjusting the gain of the inductive coupling.
With the updated settings indicated in the applied phase (E), the operations of phases (a) - (E) are repeated to continue to attempt to adjust the operating parameters of the electronic device 110 and/or the wireless charger 120 to achieve progressively or stepwise higher efficiencies. For example, several parameter adjustment cycles may be performed to find the combination of operating parameters that achieves the highest efficiency or achieves at least the lowest level of efficiency. The new parameter adjustment cycle may be performed at a predetermined rate, such as every second, every 5 seconds, every 10 seconds, every 30 seconds, etc.
For example, inDuring the second parameter adjustment period, the electronic device 110 repeats stage (a) to determine the output voltage V currently provided by the wireless power receiver 250OUTAnd output power or current. Electronic device 110 repeats stage (B) to determine the input voltage V currently received by wireless power transmitter 220 (e.g., via message 297)INAnd input power or current. The electronic device 110 repeats stage (C) to determine and store a new efficiency metric for the current setting combination, which is shown as 77.2%.
As the electronic device 110 repeats stage (D), the processor 285 compares the most recent efficiency metric (e.g., 77.2%) to the previous efficiency metric (e.g., 77.0%) and determines whether the efficiency has increased. In this example, efficiency has increased, and thus increasing the values of voltages VIN and VOUT shows an increasing trend in efficiency. As long as the efficiency is increased or maintained, the electronic device 110 may continue to increase the voltage level (or similarly adjust other operating parameters) in order to find a more efficient operating point. Thus, the operating voltage may be periodically raised to reach a high efficiency operating point, perhaps the highest efficiency operating point available. Once the comparison shows a decrease in efficiency, the electronic device 110 does not perform further voltage regulation cycles. The current operating parameter or a parameter corresponding to the highest efficiency metric may be used for the next wireless power transmission. In some embodiments, the series of adjustment cycles may be stopped based on determining a decrease in average efficiency over a plurality of cycles or a decrease in efficiency by at least a predetermined amount to avoid being affected by noise or slight errors in the measurements.
In response to determining that the efficiency has increased (e.g., from 77.0% to 77.2%), electronic device 110 repeats stage (E) to determine VINAnd VOUTIncrementally higher voltages. In this example, this new voltage level is 9.2V, and processor 285 causes voltage regulator 280 to convert V to VOUTIncreasing to 9.2V. Processor 285 also sends message 298 instructing wireless charger 120 to charge wireless battery 120 with voltage VINIncreasing to 9.2V. After a predetermined amount of time, such as 5 seconds, has elapsed, the electronic device 110 begins another parameter adjustment cycle.
In the illustrated example, once VINAnd VOUTReaches 13.5V, processor 285 determines that the power transfer efficiency has decreased compared to the previous set of operating parameters, e.g., by increasing the voltage from 13.4V to 13.5V, the efficiency decreases from 80.5% to 80.3%. In response to determining that the efficiency has decreased, processor 285 stops performing additional parameter adjustment cycles. The electronic device 110 may maintain the current settings for wireless charging. In some embodiments, processor 285 may look for a combination of operating parameters that provides the highest efficiency (e.g., a voltage level of 13.4V), and indicate those operating parameters to use, if desired.
In this example, V for each adjustment stepINAnd VOUTThe values of (c) are all the same, but this is not required. Can use VINAnd VOUTAnd different adjustments to the value may be determined during the adjustment period.
In some implementations, the process of discovering the appropriate set of operating parameters may be restarted in response to detection of one or more events or conditions by electronic device 110. For example, processor 285 may periodically check for efficiency, implemented VOUTA level of power demand of the electronic device 110 relative to the target level. If one or more of these amounts change by at least a predetermined amount, the electronic device 110 may perform a parameter adjustment cycle to determine new parameters for wireless charging. For example, if the power demand changes significantly, the electronic device 110 may reset the operating voltage to a lower level and then incrementally increase the voltage over various parameter adjustment cycles until a suitable operating point for the new power demand level is found.
In some embodiments, the parameter adjustment period may be used to determine an operating parameter other than voltage. For example, the frequency of power transmission may be adjusted incrementally upward or downward to assess efficiency at different frequencies. The transmissions of the wireless charger 120 and the receiver of the electronic device 110 may be adjusted or tuned for different frequencies. By comparing the efficiency measures for different settings, the frequency providing high efficiency can be determined iteratively, in the same way as done for adjusting the voltage.
Fig. 3 is a graph 300 illustrating an example of a power transfer efficiency curve. The graph 300 includes four curves indicating the power transfer efficiency of the wireless charging system as the input voltage VINAnd an output voltage VOUTAs a function of (c). The horizontal axis of graph 300 represents charging power output in watts. The vertical axis of the graph 300 represents the power transfer efficiency, which may be calculated by dividing the input power to the wireless power transmitter 220 by the output power of the wireless power receiver 250. Efficiency is expressed as a percentage.
In this example, an input voltage V is appliedINAnd an output voltage VOUTIs set to 1:1, which generally results in high charging efficiency. Graph 300 illustrates the power transfer efficiency of a wireless charging system at various input and output voltages. Curve 310 shows dividing VINAnd VOUTEfficiency at 5V. Curve 320 represents VINAnd VOUTEfficiency when set to 9V. Curve 330 represents VINAnd VOUTEfficiency at 12V. Curve 340 shows dividing VINAnd VOUTEfficiency at 15V.
Another curve 350 represents the optimum power transfer efficiency curve across a voltage range of 5V to 15V. In other words, curve 350 indicates the pass through VINAnd VOUTThe maximum efficiency achievable at any level from 5V to 15V for the range of output power shown along the horizontal axis is set. Thus, curve 350 represents V from having different voltage levelsINAnd VOUTThe highest efficiency point obtained in the polymerization of the multiple curves of (1).
For VINAnd VOUTE.g. along the respective curves 310, 320, 330, 340The power transfer efficiency increases with increasing output power up to a maximum point where the efficiency begins to decrease thereafter. For example, as shown by curve 310, the efficiency increases from 50% to 79% over the output power range from 0W to about 2-3W when a voltage of 5V is used. After which the efficiency begins to decrease.
At point 3, the 12V curve 330 intersects the 15V curve 340 at an output power of about 11.5W. Thus, the 12V rating provides the highest efficiency from 7W to 11.5W, while above 11.5W, the 15V rating provides higher efficiency.
Aggregating each curve from the curves 310, 320, 330, and 340 and the point of highest efficiency for the curve representing the intermediate voltage level yields a curve 350 representing the optimal power transfer efficiency curve. In other words, curve 350 shows the highest system level efficiency that can be used for any of the different output power levels along the horizontal axis. The operations discussed in either of fig. 2B and 2C enable the system 200 to determine and set operating parameters that will enable the power transfer operation to achieve an efficiency that tracks, or at least approximates, the values of the optimal efficiency curve.
For example, the charger profile 286 for the wireless charger 120 may include data indicative of the relationship shown in the graph 300, such as V indicative of providing maximum efficiency for certain power output levels (e.g., for a particular power output value or for a range of power output values)INAnd VOUTData of voltage levels of (a). For example, when the power demand is 2W, it may be VINAnd VOUTA value of 5V was chosen. On the other hand, when the power demand is 5W, it may be VINAnd VOUTSelecting 9VThe value is obtained. Thus, the operating voltage is set to provide the highest efficiency for the current power demand level. The information in the charger profile 286 may be more refined than that shown in the graph 300, for example, showing a greater number of intermediate voltage levels than the four voltage levels illustrated (e.g., showing power output ranges best suited for 5V, 6V, 7V, 8V, etc., which each provide the best efficiency). As another example, incrementally adjusting the parameters as discussed with respect to fig. 2C may achieve the same result of finding efficient operating points along the optimization curve 350 without specifying a charger profile of predetermined charger characteristics.
Fig. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a method 400 of setting parameters for wireless charging. The method 400 may be used to determine operating parameters when the charger characteristics are known, for example, when the electronic device to be charged identifies the type of charger used and charger profile data for the charger is available. For example, the method 400 may include the operations described with respect to fig. 2B. The method 400 may be performed by an electronic device or other device to be charged.
In the method 400, a model or type of wireless charger is identified (402). A power demand level for the electronic device received power is determined (404). Charging parameters are determined based on the device power requirements and the wireless charger profile (406). The charging parameter may include an input voltage V of a wireless power transmitter of the wireless chargerIN. Data is sent to the wireless charger indicating the amount of power requested to be transferred and the operating voltage, such as the input voltage V for the wireless chargerIN(408)。
Fig. 5 is a flow chart illustrating another method 500 of setting parameters for wireless charging. The method 500 may be used to determine operating parameters when charger characteristics are unknown, for example, when the electronic device to be charged does not identify the type of charger used or if appropriate charger profile data is not available. For example, method 500 may include the operations described with respect to fig. 2C. The method 400 may be performed by an electronic device or other device to be charged.
The electronic device communicates with the wireless charger and transmits data indicative of an initial transmitter input voltage to the wireless transmitter (502). The data includes, for example, an initial or default input voltage for a wireless power transmitter of the wireless charger.
As wireless charging progresses, the electronic device receives data indicative of transmitter operating parameters, e.g., input voltage V, used by the wireless power transmitterINAnd an indication of the input power or current (506).
The electronic device determines a receiver operating parameter, e.g. the output voltage V of a wireless power receiverOUTIncluding the output power and the output voltage (508).
The electronic device records the transmitter operating parameters and the receiver operating parameters. The power transfer efficiency of the wireless charging system is further calculated and stored in the electronic device (510).
In step (512), the electronic device determines whether to increase or maintain the wireless charging system power transfer efficiency as compared to a previous round of charging operation.
If the power transfer efficiency is determined to have increased (or at least maintained), the electronic device sends a request to the wireless charger to incrementally increase the input voltage for further charging (514). With this change, the electronic device may update the receiver operating parameters, e.g., causing a corresponding increase in the receiver output voltage. In other words, if the transmitter input voltage increases by 100mV, the receiver output voltage may also increase by 100 mV. The method 500 then continues by returning to step 506.
If it is determined that the power transfer efficiency has decreased, the electronic device sends a request to the wireless charger to maintain the current charging settings (516). Alternatively, the operating parameters may be changed to the parameter set that provides the highest efficiency in the various iterations of steps 506 through 514.
After step 516, FIG. 5 shows a connection back to step 506, indicating that the process may optionally repeat the parameter adjustment step even after a valid set of settings has been found. The electronic device may repeatedly measure efficiency to verify operation maintained at the efficiency level, e.g., keep checking whether efficiency is appropriate and adjust if efficiency changes. Over time, fluctuations in the load, changes in the position of the device relative to the charger, and other factors may alter the coupling of the electronic device and the charger. After a certain period of time has elapsed, the electronic device may again determine the transmitter and receiver operating parameters (steps 506 and 508) and determine the power transfer efficiency (step 510). Although the operating parameters may not have changed, the efficiency may be higher or lower than when the current setting was initially selected. Thus, the new condition may result in further incremental increases in parameters, such as a transmitter input voltage (514) and a corresponding receiver output voltage, and a second set of valid parameters set at some time after the first set of valid parameters is selected.
In some embodiments, after setting the valid parameters in step 516, the system may determine that the efficiency of using the current operating parameters has decreased, and in response, the system may decrease the transmitter input voltage and the receiver output voltage. This reduction may be performed incrementally, or by a larger step size having a magnitude of multiple increments (e.g., a 1V or 2V reduction when the voltage increment is 100 mV). By this approach, if the charging conditions have changed so that the operating voltage is significantly above the most efficient level, the electronic device may decrease the voltage and then gradually increase back to the most efficient level. As another approach, upon determining that the efficiency has decreased and that the incremental voltage increase further decreases the efficiency, the electronics can incrementally decrease the voltage of the transmitter and receiver, which is generally the opposite of step 514. The voltage or other parameter may be incrementally decreased until a peak efficiency level is reached at which the efficiency begins to decrease, and the efficiency setting determined using a series of efficiency metrics.
In some implementations, the electronic device may repeat the cycle of adjusting and evaluating the operating parameter in response to detecting a condition (504), such as a change in power demand of the electronic device or a decrease in output voltage of a wireless power receiver of the electronic device. If one of these conditions is detected, the method 500 may continue to step 506.
