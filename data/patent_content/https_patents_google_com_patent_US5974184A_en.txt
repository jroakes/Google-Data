Definitions
- the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for coding of DC and AC coefficients for intra-macroblock digital video, in particular, when the current macroblock and/or a neighboring macroblock is interlaced (e.g., field) coded.
- Predictor coefficients from neighboring macroblocks are selected for use in differentially encoding the coefficients of a current macroblock to optimize coding efficiency.
- the coefficients are obtained from a spatial transformation such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), for example.
- DCT Discrete Cosine Transform
- the invention is particularly suitable for use with various multimedia applications, and is compatible with the MPEG-4 Verification Model (VM) 8.0 standard (MPEG-4 VM 8.0) described in document ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC29/WG11 N1796, entitled “MPEG-4 Video Verification Model Version 8.0", Sweden, July 1997, incorporated herein by reference.
- the MPEG-2 standard is a precursor to the MPEG-4 standard, and is described in document ISO/IEC 13818-2, entitled “Information Technology--Generic Coding of Moving Pictures and Associated Audio, Recommendation H.262, " Mar. 25, 1994, incorporated herein by reference.
- MPEG-4 is a new coding standard which provides a flexible framework and an open set of coding tools for communication, access, and manipulation of digital audio-visual data. These tools support a wide range of features.
- the flexible framework of MPEG-4 supports various combinations of coding tools and their corresponding functionalities for applications required by the computer, telecommunication, and entertainment (i.e., TV and film) industries, such as database browsing, information retrieval, and interactive communications.
- MPEG-4 provides standardized core technologies allowing efficient storage, transmission and manipulation of video data in multimedia environments. MPEG-4 achieves efficient compression, object scalability, spatial and temporal scalability, and error resilience.
- the MPEG-4 video VM coder/decoder is a block- and object-based hybrid coder with motion compensation. Texture is encoded with an 8 ⁇ 8 Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) utilizing overlapped block-motion compensation. Object shapes are represented as alpha maps and encoded using a Content-based Arithmetic Encoding (CAE) algorithm or a modified DCT coder, both using temporal prediction.
- CAE Content-based Arithmetic Encoding
- the coder can handle sprites as they are known from computer graphics. Other coding methods, such as wavelet and sprite coding, may also be used for special applications.
- Motion compensated texture coding is a well known approach for video coding, and can be modeled as a three-stage process.
- the first stage is signal processing which includes motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) and a two-dimensional (2-D) spatial transformation.
- ME/MC motion estimation and compensation
- 2-D two-dimensional spatial transformation.
- the objective of ME/MC and the spatial transformation is to take advantage of temporal and spatial correlations in a video sequence to optimize the rate-distortion performance of quantization and entropy coding under a complexity constraint.
- the most common technique for ME/MC has been block matching, and the most common spatial transformation has been the DCT.
- coding efficiency may be improved when macroblocks are INTRA coded, e.g., without reference to a temporally subsequent or previous predictor macroblock.
- INTRA coding may be desirable for an image sequence with rapid motion, a scene change, or rapid changes in lighting conditions, where there may be little frame-to-frame correlation. Coding efficiency may further be improved by differentially encoding the DCT coefficients of a current block using the coefficients of a neighboring block as predictor coefficients.
- field mode macroblock may be reordered or non-reordered in an adaptive coding scheme. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a system for selecting predictor coefficients for differentially coding the AC and DC DCT coefficients of a current INTRA coded block, where the current block and/or the neighboring blocks are coded in a frame mode, non-reordered field mode, and/or reordered field mode.
- the system should further provide non-linear quantization of DC transform coefficients.
- the present invention provides a system having the above and other advantages.
- a method and apparatus are presented for selecting predictor coefficients for differentially coding the coefficients of a current INTRA coded block.
- a method for coding spatial transform coefficients of a current, INTRA coded block in a digital video image includes the step of identifying an adjacent left-hand block, an adjacent top block, and a top, left block which is adjacent to the left-hand block and the top block.
- the left-hand block, top block, and top, left block each have a DC spatial transform coefficient and a plurality of AC spatial transform coefficients.
- each of the blocks is coded in a coding mode according to a frame mode, a reordered field mode, or a non-reordered field mode.
- Predictor AC spatial transform coefficients are selected from the left-hand block or the top block for use in differentially encoding the AC spatial transform coefficients of the current block.
- the selecting step considers the coding mode of the current block and the top block.
- the AC spatial transform coefficients may be selected from the left-hand block when the top block is coded according to the frame mode or the non-reordered field mode, and the current block is coded according to the reordered field mode.
- the AC spatial transform coefficients may be selected from the left-hand block when the current block is coded according to the frame mode or the non-reordered field mode, and the top block is coded according to the reordered field mode.
- the DC spatial transform coefficient for use in differentially encoding the DC spatial transform coefficient of the current block may be selected from the left-hand block or the top block according to a gradient between the DC spatial transform coefficients of the left block and the top, left block, and a gradient between the DC spatial transform coefficients of the top block and the top, left block.
- the AC spatial transform coefficients may be selected from the left-hand block or the top block according to the selected DC spatial transform coefficient.
- the AC spatial transform coefficients may be selected from the top block when the DC spatial transform coefficient is selected from the top block, and the current block is coded according to the frame mode or the non-reordered field mode, and the top block is coded according to the frame mode or the non-reordered field mode.
- the AC spatial transform coefficients may be selected from the top block when the DC spatial transform coefficient is selected from the top block, and the current block and the top block are both coded according to the reordered field mode.
- Zeroed AC spatial transform coefficients may be used in place of the AC spatial transform coefficients from the selected block when the selected block is not INTRA coded.
- zeroed AC spatial transform coefficients may be used in place of the AC spatial transform coefficients from the selected block when the selected block does not reside in the current VOP.
- the DC coefficients may be non-linearly quantized.
- the decoder may identify the predictor coefficients independently by performing the selection process used at the encoder, or the decoder may recover a codeword from the transmitted bitstream which identifies the predictor coefficients.

- FIG. 3 illustrates DC coefficient prediction for an INTRA coded block in accordance with the present invention.

- FIG. 7 illustrates a macroblock packet structure in accordance with the present invention.
- a method and apparatus are presented for selecting predictor coefficients for differentially coding the coefficients of a current INTRA coded macroblock.
- DC and AC coefficients are differentially encoded by selecting predictor DC and AC coefficients from a left-hand neighboring block and a top neighboring block. Each block is coded according to a frame mode, a reordered field mode, or a non-reordered field mode.
- the AC predictor block is selected according to the respective coding modes of the blocks, and the block in which the DC predictor resides.
- the top block is selected as an AC predictor when the top block and current block are both reordered field mode, or both frame mode and/or non-reordered field mode, and the DC predictor resides in the top block.
- Zeroed AC spatial transform coefficients are used in place of the AC spatial transform coefficients from the selected block when the selected block is not INTRA coded, or does not reside in the same Video Object Plane (VOP) as the current block.
- DC coefficients can similarly be set to a non-zero value in this case.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an encoder in accordance with the present invention.
- the encoder is suitable for use with video object planes (VOPs) such as those defined in the MPEG-4 standard.
- VOPs are pictorial elements in a frame.
- a VOP can have an arbitrary shape, and a succession of VOPs is known as a video object.
- a full rectangular video frame may also be considered to be a VOP.
- VOP will be used herein to indicate both arbitrary and non-arbitrary (e.g., rectangular) image area shapes.
- Each pixel in a frame is identified as belonging to a particular VOP.
- a VOP may be classified as a predicted VOP (P-VOP), an intra-coded VOP (I-VOP) or a bi-directionally predicted VOP (B-VOP).
- a single VOP may include different types of macroblocks.
- a VOP may include a number of macroblocks (MBs) which are coded individually using an intra-frame mode or an inter-frame mode.
- MBs macroblocks
- I-VOP intra-coded VOP
- B-VOP bi-directionally predicted VOP
- a single VOP may include different types of macroblocks.
- a VOP may include a number of macroblocks (MBs) which are coded individually using an intra-frame mode or an inter-frame mode.
- intra-frame INTRA
- the MB is coded without reference to a temporally previous or subsequent MB.
- inter-frame (INTER) coding the MB may be differentially coded with respect to a temporally subsequent and/or previous reference (e.g.
- the anchor frame (e.g., VOP) for a P-VOP must be another P-VOP or an I-VOP, not a B-VOP.
- An I-VOP includes self-contained (e.g., intra-coded) blocks which are not predictive coded.
- both intra-frame and inter-frame coded MBs can be coded in a frame mode, a reordered field mode, or a non-reordered field mode.
- B-VOPs can use the forward prediction of P-VOPs as well as backward prediction, bi-directional prediction, and direct mode, which are all inter-frame techniques.
- B-VOPs do not currently use intra-frame coded MBs under MPEG-4 VM 8.0 referred to previously, although this is subject to change.
- the anchor frame (e.g., VOP) for a B-VOP must be a P-VOP or I-VOP, but not another B-VOP.
- the encoder shown generally at 100, includes a shape coder 110, a motion estimation function 120, a motion compensation function 130, and a texture coder 140, which each receive video pixel data input at terminal 105.
- the motion estimation function 120, motion compensation function 130, texture coder 140, and shape coder 110 also receive VOP shape information input at terminal 107, such as the MPEG-4 parameter VOP -- of -- arbitrary -- shape. When this parameter is zero, the VOP has a rectangular shape, and the shape coder 110 therefore is not used.
- a reconstructed anchor VOP function 150 provides a reconstructed anchor VOP for use by the motion estimation function 120 and motion compensation function 130.
- a current VOP is subtracted from a motion compensated previous VOP at subtractor 160 to provide a residue which is encoded at the texture coder 140.
- the texture coder 140 performs the DCT on the residue to provide texture information (e.g., transform coefficients) to a multiplexer (MUX) 180.
- MUX multiplexer
- the texture coder 140 also provides information which is summed with the output from the motion compensator 130 at a summer 170 for input to the previous reconstructed VOP function 150.
- the DCT is performed on the DCT coefficients from the pixel data of a current block, not on a residue.
- the DCT coefficients themselves may be differentially encoded using AC and DC coefficient predictors from a selected block which is adjacent to the current block in the same VOP.
- motion information e.g., motion vectors
- shape information which indicates the shape of the VOP is provided from the shape coding function 110 to the MUX 180.
- the MUX 180 provides a corresponding multiplexed data stream to a buffer 190 for subsequent communication over a data channel.
- the pixel data which is input to the encoder may have a YUV 4:2:0 format.
- the VOP is represented by means of a bounding rectangle.
- the top left coordinate of the bounding rectangle is rounded to the nearest even number not greater than the top left coordinates of the tightest rectangle. Accordingly, the top left coordinate of the bounding rectangle in the chrominance component is one-half that of the luminance component.
- SAD inter is the sum of the absolute differences taken on a pixel-by-pixel basis between the pixels of the current macroblock and the pixels of the best match macroblock.
- the best match macroblock is referenced by the horizontal and vertical motion vectors, MV x and MV y , respectively.
- Nc is the number of pixels in the current VOP.
- a VOP typically comprises several macroblocks. Note that the MV in SAD inter (MV x ,MV y ) for this decision is at integer pixel resolution. If the INTRA mode is chosen, no further operations are necessary for the motion search. If the INTER mode is chosen, the motion search continues for a half-pixel resolution MV.
- FIG. 2 illustrates reordering of pixel lines in an adaptive frame/field DCT scheme in accordance with the present invention.
- the decision to reorder lines is made after the decision to use INTRA or INTER coding.
- the luminance lines for INTRA mode (or luminance error for INTER mode) in the spatial domain of the macroblock are permuted from the frame DCT orientation to field DCT configuration.
- the resulting macroblock is transformed, quantized and VLC encoded normally.
- the inverse permutation is performed after all luminance blocks have been obtained from the IDCT. In the 4:2:0 format, chrominance data are not effected by this mode.
- a field mode image e.g., a 16 ⁇ 16 macroblock (MB) is shown generally at 20.
- the MB includes even-numbered lines 202, 204, 206, 208, 210, 212, 214 and 216, and odd-numbered lines 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 213, 215 and 217.
- the even and odd lines are thus interleaved, and form top and bottom fields, respectively.
- the MB shown generally at 250 is formed.
- Arrows, shown generally at 245, indicate the reordering of the lines 202-217.
- the even line 202 which is the first line of MB 200, is also the first line of MB 250.
- the even line 204 is reordered as the second line in MB 250.
- the even lines 206, 208, 210, 212, 214 and 216 are reordered as the third through eighth lines, respectively, of MB 250.
- a 16 ⁇ 8 luminance region 280 with even-numbered lines is formed.
- the odd-numbered lines 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 213, 215 and 217 form a 16 ⁇ 8 region 285.
- an 8 ⁇ 8 DCT is performed on the two blocks in the top region 280, and the two blocks in the bottom region 285.
- a separable two-dimensional DCT is used.
- further coding efficiencies can be achieved for INTRA blocks by differentially encoding the DCT coefficients using predictor coefficients from blocks which are adjacent to the current block.
- FIG. 3 illustrates DC coefficient prediction for an INTRA coded block in accordance with the present invention.
- DC coefficient prediction is not affected by whether a block is frame mode or field mode.
- lossless prediction of quantized DC and some AC coefficients of the DCT is performed to concentrate the coefficient distribution around zero so that entropy coding can be more efficient.
- the adaptive DC prediction method for a current block involves selection of either the quantized DC (QDC) value of a block which is to the left of the current block, or the block which is immediately above the current block, i.e., in the previous row.
- QDC quantized DC
- quantization of the DC coefficients may be linear or non-linear.
- QDC dc//8, where "dc" is an 11-bit unquantized transform coefficient value from the DCT. "//" denotes rounded division.
- Non-linear quantization for DC coefficients of an intra-macroblock is described with reference to Table 1.
- a non-linear scaler parameter (dc -- scaler) for DC coefficients of DCT blocks is expressed in terms of a piece-wise relationship with a quantization level, Qp.
- Adaptive selection of the DC predictor coefficient is based on a comparison of horizontal and vertical QDC value gradients around the current block. For example, assume that block X 310 is an 8 ⁇ 8 block of DCT coefficients in an INTRA macroblock 300 which is currently being coded. Block X includes a DC coefficient 312. Block A 320 is an 8 ⁇ 8 block which is the immediate left-hand neighbor of X, block C 340 is an 8 ⁇ 8 block which is the immediate top neighbor of block X, and block B 330 is an 8 ⁇ 8 block that is the immediate left-hand neighbor of block C. Block A includes a DC coefficient 322, block C includes a DC coefficient 342, and block B includes a DC coefficient 332.
- the QDC predictor value of block X, QDC' X is obtained from either the QDC value of block A, QDC A , or the QDC value of block C, QDC C , based on a comparison of horizontal and vertical QDC gradients.
- QDC' X QDC C .
- QDC' X QDC A .
- the DC prediction block is selected in a similar manner for the luminance and each of the two chrominance components of a block.
- the QDC values are scaled according to the quantization levels of the macroblock in which the DC coefficient resides and the macroblock in which the selected prediction block resides.
- dc -- scaler is assigned on a MB by MB basis.
- the parameters QDC and Qp can be transmitted to a decoder in a digital bitstream.
- Qp is differentially encoded from MB to MB and transmitted as the MPEG-4 parameter DQUANT.
- DQUANT MPEG-4 parameter
- dc -- scaler is obtained from Qp according to Table 1.
- the QDC predictor is determined by re-calculating the horizontal and vertical gradients and considering the other predictor selection criteria, and, finally, the scaled QDC value, QDC.sup.(1), is obtained using the non-scaled QDC value and the dc -- scaler values.
- FIGS. 4(a)-4(d) illustrate four possible arrangements of a current block and potential predictor blocks in accordance with the present invention. Selection of a DC coefficient predictor is not affected by the relative position of the current block X in the macroblock.
- FIG. 4(a) shows a first arrangement which corresponds to the arrangement of FIG. 3.
- block X 310 which is the block currently being coded, is the upper left-hand block of the macroblock 300
- block A 320 is the upper right-hand block of a macroblock 420
- block B is the lower right-hand block of a macroblock 430
- block C 340 is the lower left-hand block of a macroblock 440.
- FIG. 4(b) shows a second arrangement, where the block X 310 is the upper right-hand block of the macroblock 300, block A 320 is the upper left-hand block of the macroblock 300, block B 330 is the lower left-hand block of the macroblock 440, and block C is the lower right-hand block of the macroblock 440.
- all blocks in the same macroblock are either all frame mode, all field mode without reordering, or all field mode with reordering. Additionally, all blocks in the same macroblock are either INTRA mode or INTER mode. Moreover, blocks in adjacent macroblocks may have different modes. Thus, in FIG. 4(b), block A 320 and block X 310 are either both frame mode, both field mode without reordering, or both field mode with reordering. Similarly, block B 330 and block C 340 are either both frame mode, both field mode without reordering, or both field mode with reordering.
- FIG. 4(c) shows a third arrangement, where the block X 310 is the lower left-hand block of the macroblock 300, block A 320 is the lower right-hand block of the macroblock 420, block B is the upper right-hand block of the macroblock 420, and block C is the upper left-hand block of the macroblock 420.
- Block A 320 and block B 330 are either both frame mode, both field mode without reordering, or both field mode with reordering.
- block X 310 and block C 340 are either both frame mode, both field mode without reordering, or both field mode with reordering.
- FIG. 4(d) shows a fourth arrangement, where the block X 310 is the lower right-hand block, block A 320 is the lower left-hand block, block B 330 is the upper left-hand block, and block C 340 is the upper right-hand block, each in the macroblock 300. Since each of the blocks A, B, C and D are in the same macroblock, they are all frame mode, all field mode without reordering, or all field mode with reordering.
- FIG. 5 illustrates AC coefficient prediction for an INTRA coded block in accordance with the present invention.
- AC prediction either the left-hand neighboring block or the top neighboring block is selected for use in differentially encoding the AC DCT coefficients of a current block.
- all coefficients in a DCT block are AC coefficients, except the upper left-hand coefficient, which is a DC coefficient.
- DC refers to direct current, which describes a steady state coefficient energy
- AC refers to alternating current, which describes a coefficient energy which varies relative to the DC level.
- the distribution of energy in the AC coefficients is such that many coefficients near the lower right-hand portion of a block have a zero or near-zero value, and therefore need not be differentially encoded, while the coefficients near the upper left-hand portion of a block are differentially encoded.
- Block X 310 includes a first row of AC coefficients 314 and a first column of AC coefficients 316
- block C includes a first row of AC coefficients 344
- block A includes a first column of AC coefficients 324.
- Either DC coefficient 322 in block A 320 or DC coefficient 342 in block C 340 will be selected as the predictor for the DC coefficient 312 in block X 310.
- AC coefficients from either the first row or the first column of a previous coded block i.e., within the same VOP are used to predict the corresponding coefficients of the current block.
- the MPEG-4 flag "dct -- type" was discussed above in connection with FIG. 2.
- the first row of AC coefficients 344 of block C is used to predict the first row of the AC coefficients 314 of block X on a coefficient-by-coefficient basis. That is, the first AC coefficient of row 344 is used to predict the first AC coefficient of row 314 as indicated by arrow 346, the second AC coefficient of row 344 is used to predict the second AC coefficient of row 314, and so forth.
- the second row of AC coefficients of block C 340 is used to predict the second row of the AC coefficients of block X 310, and so forth, until the last row of AC coefficients of block C is used to predict the last row of the AC coefficients of block X. Note that the first row of each block has seven AC coefficients, while the remaining rows have eight AC coefficients.
- the first column of AC coefficients 324 of block C is used to predict the first column 316 of the AC coefficients of block X on a coefficient-by-coefficient basis.
- the first AC coefficient of column 324 is used to predict the first AC coefficient of column 316 as indicated by arrow 326.
- the second column of AC coefficients of block A is used to predict the second column of the AC coefficients of X and so forth, until the last column of AC coefficients of block A is used to predict the last column of the AC coefficients of block X.
- the first column of each block has seven AC coefficients, while the remaining columns have eight AC coefficients.
- block A is selected as the AC predictor block, regardless of the DC predictor block.
- Block A is selected as the AC predictor in this case even if block A and block X have different dct -- types, since the reordering of lines in a reordered field mode block does not significantly affect the distribution of horizontal spatial frequencies relative to a non-reordered field mode block or a frame mode block. Accordingly, an improved coding efficiency can still be expected by using block A as an AC predictor block.
- block C is selected as the AC predictor block, regardless of the DC predictor block.
- the DC predictor it is possible for the DC predictor to come from block C, for example, while the AC predictors are from block A. Alternatively, it is possible for the DC predictor to come from block A, while the AC predictors are from block C.
- block C and block X have different dct -- types.
- reordering of the pixel lines changes the vertical distribution of spatial energy in a block, so the correlation between the spatial frequencies between two blocks with different dct -- types is significantly reduced.
- block X is an image of a fast-moving object with a vertical boundary which moves horizontally across the block.
- block X may be coded as a reordered field mode block to avoid a zippering or zigzag effect of the vertical boundary.
- Such zippering which is caused by a temporal delay between the top and bottom fields, is manifested as a vertical zigzag line in the block.
- block C may be coded in non-reordered field mode, or in frame mode. In this case, block C cannot provide good AC predictor coefficients for block X due to poor correlation of the AC coefficients, so block A is used as the AC predictor block. Block A will generally provide a higher correlation.
- blocks A and X have the same dct -- type as one another, and blocks B and C have the same dct -- type as one another. If blocks X and C also have the same dct -- type as one another, then the AC coefficients of the DC predictor block are used to differentially encode the AC coefficients of the current block. If blocks X and C have different dct -- types, then block A is used as the AC predictor block, regardless of the DC predictor block.
- Blocks X and C have the same dct -- type as one another, and blocks A and B have the same dct -- type as one another. If blocks X and A also have the same dct -- type as one another, then the AC coefficients of the DC predictor block are used to differentially encode the AC coefficients of the current block. If blocks X and A have different dct -- types, then block C is used as the AC predictor block, regardless of the DC predictor block.
- block C is used as the AC predictor block only when block X and block C have the same dct -- type, and the DC predictor is from block C. Otherwise, block A is used as the AC predictor block. Moreover, AC predictions are performed similarly for the luminance and each of the two chrominance components.
- block A would be selected by default (i.e., when block X and block C have different dct -- types), but there is no block A in reality, such as when block X is in the left half of the first macroblock in a row, zero is used for the AC predictors.
- each block is assumed to be INTRA coded, and within a common VOP boundary. However, if any of the blocks A, B or C are outside of the VOP boundary in which block X is contained, or do not belong to an INTRA coded macroblock, their quantized AC (QAC) values are assumed to take a value of zero for the purpose of computing prediction values.
- QDC quantized AC
- scaling of prediction coefficients is required.
- the prediction is modified so that the predictor is scaled by the ratio of the current quantization step size and the quantization step size of the predictor block.
- the scaled horizontal AC prediction is: ##EQU3## where QAC i0A is the non-scaled quantized AC value for the (i,0)th coefficient, QP A is the quantization parameter for block A, and QP X is the quantization parameter for block X.
- the scaled vertical AC prediction is: ##EQU4## where QAC j0C is the non-scaled quantized AC value for the (0,j) th coefficient, QP C is the quantization parameter for block C, and QP X is the quantization parameter for block X.
- differential encoding of DCT coefficients in an INTRA block as discussed in connection with FIGS. 3-5, in particular, can usually improve coding efficiency by reducing the amount of data needed to represent the block, this is not always the case.
- AC coefficient prediction results in a larger magnitude error signal as compared to the original signal, it is desirable to disable AC prediction.
- AC prediction can be switched on or off on a macroblock-by-macroblock basis rather than on a block-by-block basis.
- the decision for switching AC prediction on or off is based on a comparison of the sum of the absolute values of all AC coefficients to be predicted in a macroblock, and the sum of the absolute values of the predicted differences.
- a criterion S is calculated, as follows: ##EQU5##
- a flag such as the MPEG-4 flag
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a decoder in accordance with the present invention.
- the decoder shown generally at 600, can be used to receive and decode the encoded data signals transmitted from the encoder of FIG. 1.
- the encoded video image data and differentially encoded motion vector (MV) data are received at terminal 640 and provided to a demultiplexer (DEMUX) 642.
- the encoded video image data is differentially encoded in DCT transform coefficients as a prediction error signal (e.g., residue).
- the video image itself is not differentially encoded, but the DCT coefficients may be differentially encoded using neighboring transform coefficients in the same VOP, i.e., according to ACpred -- flag.
- a shape decoding function 644 processes the data when the VOP has an arbitrary shape to recover shape information, which is, in turn, provided to a motion compensation function 650 and a VOP reconstruction function 652.
- a texture decoding function 646 performs an inverse DCT on transform coefficients to recover residue information for INTER coded macroblocks.
- pixel information is recovered directly and provided to the VOP reconstruction function 652.
- the inverse DCT at the texture decoding function 646 recovers the AC coefficients of the current block directly since the AC coefficients are not differentially encoded.
- the DC coefficient is differentially encoded using the DC coefficient (e.g., predictor) of either the top or left-hand block.
- the DC predictor may be zeroed when the selected predictor block is outside the current VOP, or is from an INTER coded block.
- both the AC and DC coefficients of the current block are differentially encoded.
- the AC predictor may be zeroed when the selected predictor block is outside the current VOP or is in an INTER coded block
- a codeword or codewords in the bitstream for each macroblock which indicates the predictor block For example, a codeword of "00" may indicate that the top block is the predictor for both AC and DC coefficients, a codeword of "01” may indicate that the left-hand block is the predictor for both AC and DC coefficients, a codeword of "10” may indicate that the left-hand block is the predictor for the DC coefficient while the top block is the predictor for the AC coefficients, and a codeword of "11” may indicate that the left-hand block is the predictor for the AC coefficient while the top block is the predictor for the DC coefficients.
- bits or codewords or the like may be used to indicate that a zeroed predictor is to be used for either the DC or AC coefficients.
- the decoder may independently check to see if a selected predictor block is INTER coded or outside the current VOP, and set the predictor coefficients to zero or to a non-zero constant as required.
- the texture decoding function 646 at the decoder 600 may independently perform the selection algorithm discussed above in connection with FIGS. 3-5 to determine the correct predictor coefficients.
- the texture decoding function 646 may have a memory for storing the decoded DCT coefficients of the left, top, and top, left blocks for use in processing the current block.
- the flag dct -- type must also be available for each macroblock in this case.
- Appropriate circuitry can be implemented in software, firmware, or hardware to identify the desired predictor coefficients in order to decode the current block.
- the pixel information provided from the texture decoding function 646 to the reconstructed VOP function 652 represents a residue between the current MB and a reference image.
- the reference image may be pixel data from a single anchor MB which is indicated by a forward or backward MV.
- the reference image is an average of pixel data from two reference MBs, e.g., one past anchor MB and one future anchor MB. In this case, the decoder must calculate the averaged pixel data according to the forward and backward MVs before recovering the current MB pixel data.
- a motion decoding function 648 processes the encoded MV data to recover the differential MVs and provide them to the motion compensation function 650 and to a motion vector memory 649, such as a RAM.
- the motion compensation function 650 receives the differential MV data and determines a PMV according to the coding mode and pmv[ ] index of the current MB and the previous MB, in bitstream order.
- the motion compensation function 650 determines a full reference MV and sums it with the differential MV of the current MB, the full MV of the current MB is available. Accordingly, the motion compensation function 650 can now retrieve anchor frame best match data from a VOP memory 654, such as a RAM, calculate an averaged image if required, and provide the anchor frame pixel data to the VOP reconstruction function to reconstruct the current MB.
- a VOP memory 654 such as a RAM
- the retrieved or calculated best match data is added back to the pixel residue at the VOP reconstruction function 652 to obtain the decoded current MB or block.
- the reconstructed block is output as a video output signal and also provided to the VOP memory 654 to provide new anchor frame data.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a macroblock packet structure in accordance with the present invention.

- the field Interlaced -- information in the third row 750 indicates whether a macroblock is interlaced coded.
- the Interlaced -- information field may be stored for subsequent use as required in the motion vector memory 1349 or other memory in the decoder.
- the Interlaced -- information field may also include the flag dct -- type which, as discussed, indicates whether top and bottom field pixel lines in a field coded macroblock are reordered.
- MVD, MVD2, MVD3 and MVD4 refer to motion vector data.
- Alpha -- ACpred -- flag refers to an ACpred -- flag for alpha shape coding.

- FIG. 7 The arrangement shown in FIG. 7 is an example only. Various other arrangements for communicating the relevant information to the decoder will become apparent to those skilled in the art.
- bitstream syntax and MB packet syntax for use in accordance with the present invention is described in MPEG-4 VM 8.0 as well as commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/897,847 to Eifrig et al., filed Jul. 21, 1997, entitled “Motion Estimation and Compensation of Video Object Planes for Interlaced Digital Video", incorporated herein by reference.
- the present invention provides a scheme for efficiently coding DC and AC DCT transform coefficients of an INTRA coded block.
- the DC and AC coefficients are differentially encoded by selecting predictor DC and AC coefficients from a left-hand neighboring block and a top neighboring block.
- Each block is coded according to a frame mode, a reordered field mode, or a non-reordered field mode.
- the AC predictor block is selected according to the respective coding modes of the blocks, and the block in which the DC predictor resides.
- the top block is selected as an AC predictor when the top block and current block are both reordered field mode, or both frame mode and/or non-reordered field mode, and the DC predictor resides in the top block.
- Zeroed AC spatial transform coefficients are used in place of the AC spatial transform coefficients from the selected block when the selected block is not INTRA coded, or does not reside in the same Video Object Plane (VOP) as the current block.
- DC coefficients can similarly be set to a non-zero value in this case.
- the present invention improves coding efficiency over previous schemes which do not provide the top block as a candidate predictor block, or account for whether the current and candidate blocks are coded in a frame mode, non-reordered field mode, or reordered field mode. Correlation of spatial frequencies between the current block and the top block can result in improved coding efficiency. Additionally, the scheme encompasses the MPEG-4 standard by providing for zeroing of predictor coefficients when the candidate predictor is outside a current video object plane (VOP), is not INTRA coded, or is otherwise not available.
- VOP current video object plane
- the scheme is compatible with both linear and non-linear quantization of the DCT coefficients.
- non-linear quantization of DC coefficients is disclosed, where the coded coefficient is scaled at a decoder according to the quantization levels of the macroblock in which the coefficient resides and of the macroblock in which the selected prediction block resides to recover the scaled coefficient.
