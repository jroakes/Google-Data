Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to methods and systems for query result presentation.
- the present invention relates particularly to methods and systems for constructing a query result set.
- Conventional search engines receive a search query from a user and execute a search against a global index.
- Such conventional search engines typically use one or more conventional methods for performing a search. For example, one known method, described in an article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a document, such as an HTML document, based on the link structure of the HTML document.
- the search results are often presented in a list format, comprising article identifiers and brief snippets about the articles in an HTML document that can be resized.
- the window comprising the search results may be layered on top of other windows or may be covered by other windows. In either case, information that may be of interest to the user is obscured.
- the user can manually adjust attributes of the display, such as the position and size of a window, to alleviate interference between windows.
- Conventional interface may also provide a capability to adjust the relation of all windows displayed in the interface.
- all the windows in the interface may be layered, cascaded, or arranged so that the windows together fill the entire screen.
- Conventional applications do not provide a means to adjust the size of a particular window based on the combination of windows currently displayed in the user interface in an effective manner.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for constructing a query result set.
- a display processor or query system refreshes a first result set; the first result set comprising a first plurality of article identifiers based on a second result set; the second result set comprising a second plurality of article identifiers.
- the display processor or query system then creates a third result set, the third result set based at least in part on the first result set and the second result set.
- creating the third result set comprises constructing the first result set based at least in part on the second plurality of article identifiers.
- creating the third result set comprises constructing the second result set based at least in part on the first plurality of article identifiers. In one embodiment, the second plurality of article identifiers is then displayed. Embodiments of the present invention present a consistent and effective content display to the user.

- the server device 104 may comprise a single physical or logical server, or there may be no server.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to explain the exemplary methods shown in FIGS. 2 , 7 , and 8 .
- the display processor 128 receives a first result set comprising one or more article identifiers from a messaging index in response to a search query. For example, in one embodiment, if a user 112 a is editing a document and types the term “laptop” into the title, the display processor 128 receives a result set from the messaging index that includes article identifiers in the messaging index 142 that are relevant, as determined by the search engine 122 , to the term “laptop.”
- the article identifiers may include links to email threads, chat messages, instant messages, and other messaging articles.
- the display processor 128 receives a second result set comprising an article identifier from an article index in response to the search query.
- the display processor receives a result set that includes article identifiers in the article index that are relevant, as determined by the search engine 122 , to the term “laptop.”
- the article index 143 may include, for example, an index of word-processor documents, and the article identifiers may include links to the documents.
- the display processor 128 next generates a user interface comprising the first article identifier and the second article identifier.
- the display processor may, for example, generate an HTML document or other document that may be viewed in a browser, the document including both the article identifiers from the messaging index and the article index so that the user can easily access either or both of the articles associated with the article identifiers.
- the messaging index 142 may comprise at least one of a chat message identifier, an email message identifier, an instant message identifier, or other messaging article.
- the messaging index 142 may comprise article identifiers for any messaging-related articles. Indexes other than an article or messaging index may also be utilized.
- the search query that the search engine 122 executes against the indexes is a user context-dependent search query.
- the context in which the user 112 a is operating may be determined based on the client applications 120 that the user 112 a is executing, the content of the files on which the user 112 a is operating, or other activity or event occurring on the client 102 a .
- the user context may comprise, for example, a user action history comprising a plurality of user actions. Each user action comprises various parameters, including, for example, a date/time parameter. For example, if the user 112 a prints a word-processing document multiple times in a short period of time, the queries against the messaging and article indexes may be related to the content of the document the user 112 a printed.
- the queries against the messaging and article indexes may be created using a combination of user actions. For example, if the user prints a word-processing document and also highlights a selection of words within that document, the queries generated may be a combination of content from the entire printed document and the highlighted words.
- the user interface may comprise a content display.
- the content display may be constructed as, for example, an HTML document, add-in, or horizontal or vertical toolbar.
- the display processor 128 generates the user interface with the articles identifiers.
- the article identifiers comprise one or more of a title, URL, text snippet or thumbnail associated with the each article identifier.
- the display processor generates a user interface as an HTML document resembling a conventional search engine results page.
- each article identifier includes one or a combination of: a URL or path corresponding to the article, and a text snippet summarizing or otherwise associated with the article to which the article identifier refers.
- the display processor 128 receives a trigger to display a content display in a user interface, detects an area of the user interface comprising non-primary content, and creates a content display comprising an attribute associated with the area of the user interface comprising non-primary content.
- the attribute may comprise, for example, the size, height, width, position, transparency, or other attribute of the content display.
- the display processor 128 may alter the size or position of the content display when other elements in the display are moved or resized.
- automatically sizing and positioning the content display may comprise resizing existing windows in the display to create an area in which to create the content display. For example, if a client application is currently maximized, the display processor 128 may call that applications window restore command to clear space somewhere on the display for the content window. Alternatively, the display processor 128 may explicitly set position and size parameters for the display of a client application to make room for the content display.
- the display processor identifies changes in pixel brightness and/or color as an indicator of where primary or non-primary content is displayed on the display.
- a large change in pixel brightness and/or color indicates a transition between an area where content is located and one where no content is located.
- the largest empty section at the top of a window is located near the title bar, menu bar, and any task bars.
- the content display may be placed overlaying the titlebar/menubar/taskbar area of a window even though that is not the largest area of non-primary content on the screen.
- a display processor 128 detects an area at the top of a user interface that includes only one small area of content in a large rectangular area.
- the display processor 128 queries the operating system using the position of a pixel with in the small area of content to determine what is located in the identified position.
- the operating system provides information in response that indicates to the display processor 128 that the content comprises an application icon.
- the display processor 128 concludes that the content is non-primary content according to rules in the program and/or preferences provided by the user. Accordingly, the display processor 128 constructs a content display that fits within the large rectangular area comprising non-primary content.
- the display processor 128 receives a request to refresh a first result set comprising a first plurality of article identifiers. For example, the display processor 128 may periodically (e.g., every five minutes) refresh the list of article identifiers in a content display. To do so, the display processor 128 may receive a second result set comprising a second plurality of article identifiers. The display processor 128 then creates a third result set based at least in part on the first result set and the second result set.
- Creating the third result set may comprise reconstructing the first result set or reconstructing the second result set.
- the display processor 128 then causes the third result set to be displayed in place of the first result set.
- Embodiments of the present invention may utilize one or more previous result sets in constructing or reconstructing a result set.
- a display processor 128 issues a search query to the search engine 122 .
- the search query may be identical to the query initially issued to the search engine 122 to populate the content display or may be altered based on the current context of the user or for some other reason.
- the display processor 128 receives the second result set from the search engine 122 and compares the article identifiers in the second result set to the article identifiers in the first result set.
- the result sets may be identical, or the display processor 128 may identify article identifiers that are in one result set and not in the other, or may identify article identifiers that are in both but are in different positions.
- the display processor 128 sorts the second result set based at least in part on the sort order of the first result set. For example, the user 112 a may be viewing a sub-set of the first result set, e.g., identifiers 20 - 30 in the first result set at the time of the refresh.
- the display processor 128 may create the third result set by sorting the second result set such that the same article identifiers appear in spaces 20 - 30 . In this way, when the refresh occurs, the user's then-view is not unduly disturbed.
- Sorting the second result set may comprise, for example, identifying a first article identifier in a first position in the first result set, identifying the first article identifier in a second position in the second result set, and relocating the first article identifier to the first position in the second result set.
- the display processor 128 creates the third result set by deleting an article identifier from the second result set based on an event associated with the article identifier in the first result set. For example, if the article identifier in the first result set has appeared in the content display numerous times but has not been clicked by the user, the display processor 128 in such an embodiment may delete the article identifier from the second result set. In other embodiments, other events serve as indicators that an article can be deleted from the result set.
- the display processor 128 replaces article identifiers in the first result set with article identifiers in the second set.
- the display processor receives a request to refresh a first result set comprising a first plurality of article identifiers, receives a second result set comprising a second plurality of article identifiers, and identifies a first article identifier in the first result set that is not in the second result set.
- the display processor then identifies a second article identifier in the second result set that is not in the first result set and replaces the first article identifier in the first result set with the second article identifier.
- the entire first result set is not replaced; only specific article identifiers are replaced. In this way, the display processor 128 minimizes changes to the interface, resulting in greater constancy and fewer distractions for the user. Zero, one, or more article identifiers in the content display may be replaced during any one refresh.
- first, second, and third are used here merely to differentiate one item from another item.
- the terms first, second, and third are not used to indicate first, second, or third in time, or first, second, or third in a list, or other order, unless explicitly noted.
- the “second” may come in time or in list before the “first,” unless it is otherwise explicitly indicated.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating generating a user interface in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
- the query system 132 receives a search query 202 .
- the query may be an explicit query, e.g., a query entered by a user 112 a in a text box, or the query may instead be an implicit query generated by a client application 120 in response to events associated with the user 112 a , for example, information being entered by or output to the user.
- the query or the response to the query may additionally depend on user context.
- the response to the query may depend on the time of day the query is run or on previous or a sequence of previous actions by the user.
- the current user context is derived from a data store comprising a history of user actions, such as printing or opening a file, or sending an email message.
- the query system 132 executes the search query on a messaging index 142 stored in the data store ( 140 ) 204 .
- the query system 132 then receives the result set from the messaging index 206 .
- the messaging index may comprise information regarding, for example, chat messages, emails, and instant messages.
- the result set comprises one or more article identifiers and may comprise snippets or text summaries of the article with which the article identifier is associated.
- the query system 132 then executes the search query on an article index stored in the data store ( 140 ) 208 .
- the query system 132 receives the result set from the article index 210 .
- the result set comprises one or more article identifiers that satisfy the search query. In the case of a file, the article identifier may be a fully qualified path.
- the query system 132 then ranks the article identifiers in each of the two result sets 212 (this may be done separately and then combined or combined and then ranked).
- the query system 132 may perform queries on additional indexes, such as an index comprising news articles or any other type of document or file that can be indexed.
- the query system 132 may also cause queries to be executed on indexes not stored on the client 102 a or in the data store 140 . For example, in one embodiment, the query system 132 causes queries to be executed on the search engine 170 .
- the query system 132 transmits the result sets to the display processor 128 , which combines the result sets 214 .
- the display processor 128 may combine the result sets into one comprehensive list or may combine the result sets into one interface (shown together or separately).
- the display processor 128 creates tabs on the user interface into which the article identifiers are arranged.

- FIG. 10 is a screen shot illustrating information displayed in a hovering bar in one embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 11 is a screen shot illustrating information displayed in a side bar in one embodiment of the present invention.
- the display processor automatically constructs the user interface page based on the space available on the display screen. In one such embodiment, the display processor attempts to identify a section of the screen in which non-primary content is displayed. The display processor 128 then constructs the page to fit in the space. FIGS. 6 through 8 illustrate one method to allow for such fit-to-space construction.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a computer display comprising areas with and without content in one embodiment of the present invention.
- areas are described as having non-primary content in the embodiments described, the invention may be used in relation to areas with little, irrelevant, or unused content.
- non-content areas may comprise areas in which the computer desktop or in which only icons are viewable.
- a display 602 currently comprises two application windows 604 , 606 .
- the first window 604 comprises Application 1
- the second window 606 comprises Application 2 .
- the display 602 also comprises a menu bar 608 .
- These areas 604 , 606 , and 608 have content (such as text and graphics) present.
- the display 602 includes a number of areas in which non-primary content is present. The largest of these areas is at the top of the screen 610 .
- the display processor 128 is able to construct a content display to fit in the area 610 that does not include any content.
- FIG. 7 is a block diagram of the user display shown in FIG. 6 including a content display in one embodiment of the present invention.
- the display processor 128 has identified an area at the top of the display in which the content display 702 may be placed. Accordingly, the display processor sizes and positions the content display 702 to fit in the area with non-primary content 610 .
- the display processor 128 uses the following method to locate a position to display a content window overlaying the titlebar/menubar/taskbars of an application window:
- the display processor retrieves an image of the focused window, including the titlebar/menubar/taskbar region.
- the threshold is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the R, G, and B values of the pixels.
- the content display remains rectangular.
- the content display is either narrow and tall or shorter and allowing it to be wider.
- a heuristic may be used to choose the best size.
- the display processor 128 consults a list of preferences or pre-defined areas that affect the display of the content window. For example, in one embodiment, the display processor 128 accesses a list of windows to never show the content display on (blacklist), a list of windows to show the content display on (whitelist), and/or a list of windows to limit the height of the content display to specified values.
- the display processor 128 may rely on other attributes of the display to determine how to create the content display window. For example, in one embodiment, the display processor 128 identifies entry fields in dialog boxes and avoids having the content display overlap these fields.
- FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a process for identifying available screen area and sizing the results window accordingly in one embodiment of the present invention.
- the display processor 128 receives a trigger to display a content display (such as those shown in FIGS. 3 , 4 , and 5 ) 802 .
- the trigger may comprise, for example, the passage of a predetermined time period or a notification that a window in the user interface has been resized.
- the display processor 128 examines the current layout of the computer display 804 .
- the layout of the computer display comprises the layout of the windows comprising primary and non-primary content as well as the background and any icons or other elements in the display.
- Primary content comprises, for example, windows in which the user is actively or has recently been working, toolbars that are active or have recently been active, and any other content that is identified as content that should not be covered by the content display.
- the display processor 128 searches for and detects an area with non-primary content if such an area exists 806 .
- the area with non-primary content may, for example, comprise only background or may comprise background and application program icons.
- the area with non-primary content comprises an application window that has been inactive for more than a predetermined time period, e.g., five minutes.
- the display processor 128 may detect an area with non-primary content in a variety of ways. For example, in one embodiment, the display processor 128 evaluates the color and/or brightness of the pixels within the display to detect changes. In one such embodiment, the display processor 128 determines the color of the background and then evaluates pixels to detect pixels that comprise a color different than the background color. If the display processor 128 detects such a pixel, it concludes that content exists in that pixel. If the color is the same as the background, the display processor 128 detects an absence of content.
- the display processor 128 If the display processor 128 detects content, then the display processor 128 must further determine whether the content is primary content.
- the display processor 128 may determine whether content is primary by locating a pixel with content and then using the position of the pixel to determine what type of content is displayed at that position. For example, the display processor 128 may make an operating system call to determine which application or applications are displaying content at the position. The display processor 128 then uses the supplied information to make a determination of whether or not the content is primary.
- the display processor 128 evaluates the color and/or brightness intensity of various pixels.
- Large or sudden changes in intensity between pixels or over a range covering a specified size or number of pixels indicate that content may be present in the more intense pixel.
- the background may change smoothly to show a shaded appearance—by looking for large or sudden changes we are able to ignore relatively slow gradual changes as typical for backgrounds.
- Anti-aliasing may cause the color and/or intensity to vary smoothly at the edge of items like characters, in which case it may be necessary to analyze the change over a range of a specified size or number of pixels (typically a small size or number of pixels).
- the display processor 128 evaluates the changes in color or brightness to determine the outer perimeter of each of the elements displayed on the screen. In this way, the display processor 128 is able to determine the areas with no or with non-primary content. In yet another embodiment, the display processor 128 evaluates both the color and intensity of pixels to determine whether or not primary content exists in a pixel.
- display processor 128 determines whether or not an area exists with non-primary content 808 . If no such area exists, the display processor 128 resizes the existing application windows comprising primary content to create an area with non-primary content 810 . For example, the display processor 128 may execute an applications window restore method to cause the application to be non-maximized. Once the area with non-primary content is detected or created, the display processor 128 creates the content display, an attribute of the content display, such as the height, width, position, transparency or other attribute of the content display, the attribute associated with the size of the area of the display with non-primary content 812 . The display processor 128 then causes the content display to be displayed in the area comprising non-primary content 814 .
- the display processor 128 selects the most appropriate area in which to create the content display.
- the appropriateness of an area may be determined based on a variety of factors. For example, in one embodiment, the display processor 128 selects the largest area with no content in which to create the content display. In another embodiment, the display processor 128 selects an area on the right or left side of the computer display to construct the content display. The relative appropriateness of various areas may be determined when the display processor is programmed or may be based on user-supplied preferences. For example, a user 112 a may indicate a preference for a content display arranged vertically on the right-hand side of the screen.
- the display processor 128 may also vary the parameters of the displayed content depending on the available space. For example, in one embodiment, the display processor causes the content display to be semi-transparent so that a user can see an application executing behind the content window.
- the computer display 602 shown in FIG. 7 provides an illustrative display on which the process shown in FIG. 8 may operate.
- the display processor 128 first identifies the layout of the screen and is able to determine the perimeter of the Application 1 window 604 , the Application 2 window 606 , and the toolbar 608 . Based on the analysis, the display processor determines that the top section of the screen has an area with non-primary content 610 . The display processor 128 then constructs a content display 702 , the height, width, and position of the content display 702 based at least in part on the size and dimensions of the area with non-primary content 610 .
- the information displayed in the content display 702 of FIG. 7 may be generated in various ways in embodiments of the present invention.
- the information in the content display 702 is generated according to the method shown in FIG. 2 .
- Article identifiers from the messaging index 142 and from the article index 143 are displayed in the content display 702 .
- the number of articles identifiers displayed and the layout of the sections of the content display 702 may vary according to the size of the content display 702 that is constructed.
- the number of article identifiers displayed and the layout of the article identifiers within the content display 702 is affected by both the size of the content display 702 and by previously supplied user preferences.
- the set of article identifiers displayed or available in the content display may be refreshed periodically. Refreshing may occur, for example, substantially continuously, at pre-determined intervals, random intervals or upon events or inactivity (e.g., after a period of inactivity of ten minutes).
- the display processor 128 reconstructs the results available or provided in the content display in various ways.
- FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a process of reconstructing a result set in one embodiment of the present invention.
- the display processor 128 or query system 132 receives a trigger to refresh a result set displayed in the content display 902 .
- the result set comprises a plurality of article identifiers.
- the display processor 128 or query system 132 issues a request for a new updated result set 904 .
- the request includes a search query.
- the search query may be identical to the search query issued for the result set currently displayed in the content display, or may vary based on user activity, the passage of time, or for some other reason.
- the display processor 128 transmits the search query in the request to a search engine.
- the search query may be sent to the search engine 122 on the client or the search engine 170 on the server device 104 .
- the display processor receives a second result set in response to the query 906 .
- the result set that is returned may be identical to the result set in the content display, may overlap somewhat, or may be completely different.
- the display processor 128 then creates a new, third result set that is based at least in part on the first result set and on the second result set 908 .
- the display processor 128 may create the third result set by modifying the first result set (e.g., adding, deleting, or moving article identifiers) or the second result set, or the display processor 128 may create an entirely different result set based on each of the first and second result sets.
- the display processor compares the second result set to the first result set. For example, the display processor 128 may determine how many of the article identifiers in the second set are different from the article identifiers in the first set. The display processor 128 may further determine the position of article identifiers that exist in both result sets.
- the display processor sorts the results returned in the second result set based at least in part on the order of the results shown in the first result set.
- the display processor may move the article identifier to the third position in the second result set. In this way, the display processor 128 maintains consistency for the user 112 a . Once the display processor 128 has sorted the second result set, the display processor 128 causes the new result set to be displayed in the content display 912 .
- the display processor 128 compares the two result sets and then replaces article identifiers in the currently displayed result set with article identifiers in the second result set. For example, if the third article identifier in the currently displayed list does not appear in the second result set, the display processor may replace the third article identifier with a newly-identified article identifier in the second result set. Such a process also helps to maintain consistency in the user interface for the user. In one embodiment, the display processor 128 is able to vary the rules for replacing results in the currently displayed result set based on actions by the user 112 a .
- the display processor removes the result from the displayed set, or places that result set in a lower position when it is included in future result sets.
- the display processor 128 or query system 132 has a limitation on the number or percentage of results that can change, for example only allowing 2 results to be different in the new result set. Further, the system may have a minimum time period that it displays results for, and tries to avoid or never replaces results that have been displayed for less than the minimum time period. In one such embodiment, each result in the result set includes a display time measure that indicates the length of time that the result has been displayed. In one embodiment, the amount of change that is allowed in the result set is based on the current and past activity of the user 112 a .
- the amount of change allowed may be relatively low; whereas if the user 112 a switches to a new application, the amount of change may be higher or even unlimited.
- Activity of the user 112 a may be used to alter the threshold. For example, navigating to a new page in a web browser may be an event where the amount of change allowed is greater.
- the display processor 128 or query system 132 considers additional result sets. For example, consider a first result set containing items A, B, and C; and a second result set containing items C, D, and E. One embodiment creates the new result set with item C in the same position as it was in the first result set, and replaces items A and B with items D and E. However, if the embodiment allows only changing one of the results, then the system must choose whether to replace A or B. One such embodiment accomplishes this by considering additional earlier result sets, replacing the item that has been displayed for the longest time period. For example, if A has been in the result list for the last 30 seconds while B only appeared in the result set in the last second, the system replaces A. Such an embodiment provides consistency for the user 112 a.
- the display processor 128 supports a set of application programming interface (API) calls.
- API application programming interface
- an application running on the client 102 a such as the web server, is able to call an API to display information according to an embodiment of the present invention, such as those exemplary methods set out above.
- the API may also provide the capability of formatting the result set in HTML, XML, or any other format required by the user.
- One embodiment of the present invention comprises an administration page.
- the user 112 a clicks on an icon that provides access to the administration page.
- the user is able to set preferences for display, such as the minimum size of the window, the type of window to be displayed, the type of content to include, and various other parameters that may or may not relate to display, such as refresh rate, etc.
