- Data packets or other protocol based signals corresponding to the selected operations can be routed through a computer network between multiple computing devices. For example the data processing system can route a content item to a different interface than an interface from which a request was received.
- the different interface can be on the same client computing device or a different client computing device from which a request was received.
- the data processing system can select at least one candidate interface from a plurality of candidate interfaces for content item transmission to a client computing device.
- the candidate interfaces can be determined based on technical or computing parameters such as processor capability or utilization rate, memory capability or availability, battery status, available power, network bandwidth utilization, interface parameters or other resource utilization values.
- the data processing system can reduce network bandwidth usage, latency, or processing utilization or power consumption of the client computing device that renders the content item. This saves processing power and other computing resources such as memory, reduces electrical power consumption by the data processing system and the reduced data transmissions via the computer network reduces bandwidth requirements and usage of the data processing system.
- the systems and methods described herein can include a data processing system that receives an input audio query, which can also be referred to as an input audio signal. From the input audio query the data processing system can identify a request and a trigger keyword corresponding to the request. Based on the trigger keyword or the request, the data processing system can generate a first action data structure.
- the first action data structure can include an organic response to the input audio query received from a client computing device, and the data processing system can provide the first action data structure to the same client computing device for rendering as audio output via the same interface from which the request was received.
- the data processing system can also select at least one content item based on the trigger keyword or the request.
- the data processing system can identify or determine a plurality of candidate interfaces for rendering of the content item(s).
- the interfaces can include one or more hardware or software interfaces, such as display screens, audio interfaces, speakers, applications or programs available on the client computing device that originated the input audio query, or on different client computing devices.
- the interfaces can include java script slots for online documents for the insertion of content items, as well as push notification interfaces.
- the data processing system can determine utilization values for the different candidate interfaces.
- the utilization values can indicate power, processing, memory, bandwidth, or interface parameter capabilities, for example.
- the data processing system can select a candidate interface as a selected interface for presentation or rendering of the content item. For example, the data processing system can convert or provide the content item for delivery in a modality compatible with the selected interface.
- the selected interface can be an interface of the same client computing device that originated the input audio signal or a different client computing device.
- the data processing system selects a destination for the content item in a manner that can use the least amount of processing power, memory, or bandwidth from available options, or that can conserve power of one or more client computing devices.
- the data processing system can provide the content item or the first action data structure by packet or other protocol based data message transmission via a computer network to a client computing device.
- the output signal can cause an audio driver component of the client computing device to generate an acoustic wave, e.g., an audio output, which can be output from the client computing device.
- the audio (or other) output can correspond to the first action data structure or to the content item.
- the first action data structure can be routed as audio output, and the content item can be routed as a text based message.
- the data processing system can conserve resources utilized by each interface, relative to providing both the first action data structure and the content item to the same interface. This results in fewer data processing operations, less memory usage, or less network bandwidth utilization by the selected interfaces (or their corresponding devices) than would be the case without separation and independent routing of the first action data structure and the content item.
- the data processing system can identify one or more devices within range of a computing device that detects an input audio signal via a microphone.
- the data processing system can poll the one or more identified devices within range to identify one or more candidate interfaces.
- the data processing system can determine a resource utilization value for each of the one or more candidate interfaces in order to select an interface via which to transmit a notification or content item. For example, the data processing system can determine to transmit a content item or a notification.
- the data processing system can determine to transmit the content item or the notification responsive to voice input received by a computing device. Prior to transmission of the content item or the notification, the data processing system can identify one more computing devices within range of the computing device.
- the data processing system can poll the plurality of computing devices to identify candidate interfaces for the content item.
- the data processing system can determine, for example, that a first candidate interface of a first computing device has a high resource utilization value (e.g., the first candidate interface can be an audio interface and the data processing system can determine that the first computing device is playing music).
- the data processing system can determine that a second candidate interface has a low resource utilization value (e.g., the second candidate interface can include a visual display that is not currently in use).
- the data processing system can further determine that the content item can be presented in either audio format or a visual format.
- the data processing system can then select the second candidate interface, convert or select the content item in the visual format, and transmit the candidate content item for presentation via the second candidate interface.

- the sensor utilization can refer to a temperature of the computing device.
- the data processing system 105 can determine that computing device is performing a processor intensive task, and may determine to not utilize that computing device or an interface of that computing device. Accordingly, the data processing system 105 can select an interface of another computing device within the threshold distance that has a lower temperature.
- the interface management component 140 can select the interface for the content item based on at least one utilization value indicating that the selected interface is the most efficient for the content item. For example, from among candidate interfaces, the interface to render the content item at the smartwatch uses the least bandwidth due as the content item is smaller and can be transmitted with fewer resources. Or the interface management component 140 can determine that the candidate interface selected for rendering of the content item is currently charging (e.g., plugged in) so that rendering of the content item by the interface will not drain battery power of the corresponding client computing device 150 . In another example, the interface management component 140 can select a candidate interface that is currently performing fewer processing operations than another, unselected interface of for example a different client computing device 150 that is currently streaming video content from the network 165 and therefore less available to render the content item without delay.
- the interface management component 140 (or other data processing system 105 component) can convert the content item for delivery in a modality compatible with the candidate interface. For example, if the candidate interface is a display of a smartwatch, smartphone, or tablet computing device, the interface management component 140 can size the content item for appropriate visual display given the dimensions of the display screen associated with the interface. The interface management component 140 can also convert the content item to a packet or other protocol based format, including proprietary or industry standard format for transmission to the client computing device 150 associated with the selected interface.

- the interface management component 140 can also select at least one candidate interface for the action data structure.
- This interface can be the same interface from which the input audio signal was obtained, e.g., a voice activated assistant service executed at a client computing device 150 .
- This can be the same interface or a different interface than the interface management component 140 selects for the content item.
- the interface management component 140 (or other data processing system 105 components) can provide the action data structure to the same client computing device 150 that originated the input audio signal for rendering as audio output as part of the assistant service.
- the interface management component 140 can also transmit or otherwise provide the content item to the selected interface for the content item, in any converted modality appropriate for rendering by the selected interface.
- the interface management component 140 can provide the action data structure as audio output for rendering by an interface of the client computing device 150 responsive to the input audio signal received by the same client computing device 150 .
- the interface management component 140 can also provide the content item for rendering by a different interface of the same client computing device 150 or of a different client computing device 150 associated with the same end user.

- the content item e.g., a text, audio, or combination content item indicating that “sunscreen is available from the convenience store near the beach”
- an interface of the same or a different computing device 150 such as an email or text message accessible by the same or a different client computing device 150 associated with the end user.
- Separating the content item from the action data structure and sending the content item as, for example, a text message rather than an audio message can result in reduced processing power for the client computing device 150 that accesses the content item since, for example, text message data transmissions are less computationally intensive than audio message data transmissions.
- This separation can also reduce power usage, memory storage, or transmission bandwidth used to render the content item.
- the data processing system 105 can process thousands, tens of thousands or more input audio signals simultaneously so the bandwidth, power, and processing savings can be significant and not merely incremental or incidental.
- the interface management component 140 can provide or deliver the content item to the same client computing device 150 (or a different device) as the action data structure subsequent to delivery of the action data structure to the client computing device 150 .
- the content item can be provided for rendering via the selected interface upon conclusion of audio output rendering of the action data structure.
- the interface management component 140 can also provide the content item to the selected interface concurrent with the provision of the action data structure to the client computing device 150 .
- the interface management component 140 can provide the content item for delivery via the selected interface within a pre-determined time period from receipt of the input audio signal by the NLP component 110 .
- the time period for example, can be any time during an active length of the conversation of session.
- the pre-determined time period can be any time from receipt of the input audio signal through the end of the weekend, e.g., the active period of the conversation.

Responsive to identifying the content item or notification, the data processing system 105 can determine whether one or more computing devices are within the threshold distance. In some instances proximity information can already stored in data processing system 105 , or broad proximity information can be used to identify that the two devices are not close enough to test more granular device proximity (e.g., sub-audible sounds). For example, the data processing system 105 can use a hierarchy of proximity detection techniques that are progressively more resource intensive to determine whether computing devices are within a threshold distance.
- the data processing system 105 can identify multiple computing devices that are linked with an account. The data processing system 105 can then identify a set of nearby devices within a threshold distance.

The data processing system 105 can determine the a user is interacting with the third computing device 504 to play a video on the second output device 506 . The data processing system 105 can determine not to provide audio content or a notification for presentation via the first computing device 404 because the third computing device 504 with which the user is engaged or interacting is greater than the threshold distance from the first computing device 404 .
- the data processing system 105 can identify one or more applications as candidate interfaces to present content or a notification. For example, the data processing system 105 can determine to leverage an application integrated with the first computing device 404 to provide the content or notification. The data processing system 105 can identify multiple applications integrated with the first computing device 404 that can provide the content or notification, de-duplicate the applications, and select a candidate interface (e.g., application) based on resource utilization values or a pre-programmed hierarchy based on a notification configuration (e.g., audio interface can rank higher than image interface which can rank higher than text-only interfaces).
- a candidate interface e.g., application
- a pre-programmed hierarchy e.g., audio interface can rank higher than image interface which can rank higher than text-only interfaces.
- the data processing system can send notification to the selected device.
- This notification can include a payload.

- a server transmits data (e.g., data packets representing action data structures or content items) to a client device (e.g., to the client computing device 150 for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device, or to the service provider computing device 160 or the content provider computing device 155 ).
- Data generated at the client device can be received from the client device at the server (e.g., received by the data processing system 105 from the computing device 150 or the content provider computing device 155 or the service provider computing device 160 ).
- the separation of various system components does not require separation in all implementations, and the described program components can be included in a single hardware or software product.
- the NLP component 110 , the content selector component 125 , the interface management component 140 , or the prediction component 120 can be a single component, app, or program, or a logic device having one or more processing circuits, or part of one or more servers of the data processing system 105 .
- references to implementations or elements or acts of the systems and methods herein referred to in the singular may also embrace implementations including a plurality of these elements, and any references in plural to any implementation or element or act herein may also embrace implementations including only a single element.
- References in the singular or plural form are not intended to limit the presently disclosed systems or methods, their components, acts, or elements to single or plural configurations.
- References to any act or element being based on any information, act or element may include implementations where the act or element is based at least in part on any information, act, or element.
- any implementation disclosed herein may be combined with any other implementation or embodiment, and references to “an implementation,” “some implementations,” “one implementation” or the like are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are intended to indicate that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the implementation may be included in at least one implementation or embodiment. Such terms as used herein are not necessarily all referring to the same implementation. Any implementation may be combined with any other implementation, inclusively or exclusively, in any manner consistent with the aspects and implementations disclosed herein.
- references to “or” may be construed as inclusive so that any terms described using “or” may indicate any of a single, more than one, and all of the described terms. For example, a reference to “at least one of ‘A’ and ‘B’” can include only ‘A’, ‘only B’, as well as both ‘A’ and ‘B’. Such references used in conjunction with “comprising” or other open terminology can include additional items.
