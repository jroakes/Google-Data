Definitions
- the present disclosure is generally directed to systems, devices, and methods relating to optical engines, for example, optical engines for laser projectors used in wearable heads-up displays or other applications.
- a projector is an optical device that projects or shines a pattern of light onto another object (e.g., onto a surface of another object, such as onto a projection screen) in order to display an image or video on that other object.
- a projector necessarily includes a light source, and a laser projector is a projector for which the light source comprises at least one laser.
- the at least one laser is temporally modulated to provide a pattern of laser light and usually at least one controllable mirror is used to spatially distribute the modulated pattern of laser light over a two-dimensional area of another object. The spatial distribution of the modulated pattern of laser light produces an image at or on the other object.
- At least one controllable mirror may be used to control the spatial distribution, and may include: a single digital micromirror (e.g., a microelectromechanical system (“MEMS”) based digital micromirror) that is controllably rotatable or deformable in two dimensions, or two digital micromirrors that are each controllably rotatable or deformable about a respective dimension, or a digital light processing (“DLP”) chip comprising an array of digital micromirrors.
- MEMS microelectromechanical system
- DLP digital light processing
- each respective laser diode may have a corresponding respective focusing lens.
- Each of the laser diodes of a laser module are typically housed in a separate package (e.g., a TO-38 package or “can”).
- the relative positions of the laser diodes, the focusing lenses, and the at least one controllable mirror are all tuned and aligned so that each laser beam impinges on the at least one controllable mirror with substantially the same spot size and with substantially the same rate of convergence (so that all laser beams will continue to have substantially the same spot size as they propagate away from the laser projector towards, e.g., a projection screen).
- a conventional laser projector it is usually possible to come up with such a configuration for all these elements because the overall form factor of the device is not a primary design consideration.
- the form factor of the laser projector is an important design element, it can be very challenging to find a configuration for the laser diodes, the focusing lenses, and the at least one controllable mirror that sufficiently aligns the laser beams (at least in terms of spot size, spot position, and rate of convergence) while satisfying the form factor constraints.
- a head-mounted display is an electronic device that is worn on a user's head and, when so worn, secures at least one electronic display within a viewable field of at least one of the user's eyes, regardless of the position or orientation of the user's head.
- a wearable heads-up display is a head-mounted display that enables the user to see displayed content but also does not prevent the user from being able to see their external environment.
- the “display” component of a wearable heads-up display is either transparent or at a periphery of the user's field of view so that it does not completely block the user from being able to see their external environment.
- a “combiner” component of a wearable heads-up display is the physical structure where display light and environmental light merge as one within the user's field of view. The combiner of a wearable heads-up display is typically transparent to environmental light but includes some optical routing mechanism to direct display light into the user's field of view.
- wearable heads-up displays include: the Google Glass®, the Optinvent Ora®, the Epson Moverio®, and the Sony Glasstron®, just to name a few.
- a wearable heads-up display The optical performance of a wearable heads-up display is an important factor in its design. When it comes to face-worn devices, users also care a lot about aesthetics and comfort. This is clearly highlighted by the immensity of the eyeglass (including sunglass) frame industry. Independent of their performance limitations, many of the aforementioned examples of wearable heads-up displays have struggled to find traction in consumer markets because, at least in part, they lack fashion appeal or comfort. Most wearable heads-up displays presented to date employ relatively large components and, as a result, are considerably bulkier, less comfortable and less stylish than conventional eyeglass frames.
- Femtosecond laser micro-machining is a direct-laser-write and rapid prototyping technique that provides great potential for optical device fabrication. Strong focusing of femtosecond laser light into transparent glass can induce positive refractive index modifications up to 0.01 refractive index units (RIU) within the material and without surface damage. Ultrafast (femto/pico-second) lasers enable flexible 3D structuring of various glasses, which may be useful in many types of optical devices (waveguides, couplers, Bragg gratings, waveplates, etc.) that can serve as building blocks for 3D optical circuits.
- optical devices waveguides, couplers, Bragg gratings, waveplates, etc.
- Direct-laser-writing uses ultrashort laser pulses to confine strong nonlinear optical interactions that may induce, for example, positive or negative refractive index changes in bulk transparent materials for creating optical waveguides (WGs).
- the mechanisms by which direct-laser-write modifications occur include, but are not limited to, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, electron-atom collisions, plasma interactions, thermal effects (e.g., diffusion, heat accumulation), energy dissipation, and material cooling leading to inhomogeneous solidification.
- waveguide performance can be tuned and optimized by, but not limited to, the writing laser's properties (e.g., pulse duration, pulse temporal shape, bandwidth and shape, pulse repetition rate, wavelength, polarization, and beam spatial shape) and the focusing conditions (e.g., lens numerical aperture, air/liquid immersion, translation direction and speeds).

- FIG. 10 is a schematic diagram of a laser writing system 1000 in accordance with the present systems, designs and methods.
- Laser writing system 1000 comprises at least writing laser 1010 , focusing optic 1012 , writeable glass 1020 and translatable mount 1030 .
- glass is used herein for convenience, any appropriate laser-writable material could be used in place of writeable glass 1020 , such as organically modified ceramics (ORMOCER), for example.
- Writing laser 1010 emits laser light 1011 .
- Laser light 1011 comprises short (femptosecond and/or picosecond length) pulses of laser light; consequently, laser light 1011 has extremely high peak instantaneous power.
- Focusing optic 1012 focuses laser light 1011 to focal point 1013 .
- Writeable glass 1020 may comprise a contiguous piece of glass or similar transparent material, which is typically transparent to the laser light 1011 emitted by the writing laser 1010 ; in other words the light emitted by the writing laser generally will not be absorbed by the glass via typical (linear) optical processes.
- the intensity of laser light 1011 is very high due to the combination of spatial focusing (focusing the beam of writing laser light 1011 to a small point 1013 ) and temporal focusing (emitting the laser light 1011 as extremely short femptosecond or picosecond pulses).
- the high intensity of light at the focal point 1013 allows nonlinear optical processes such as multiphoton absorption, avalanche ionization, Coulomb collisions (causing lattice ionization and breakdown), and heat conduction to occur in the writeable glass 1020 , absorbing the light and changing the refractive index of the glass.
- the change in refractive index may be a positive increase in refractive index.
- Writeable glass 1020 can be physically coupled to translatable mount 1030 , such as by using clamps 1021 , adhesive, or any other appropriate coupling mechanism. Such coupling mechanism is preferably removable, such that writeable glass 1020 can be detached from translatable mount 1030 after laser writing is complete. Translation of translatable mount 1030 in the X, Y, and/or Z direction will result in corresponding translation of writeable glass 1020 , moving the location of focal point 1013 within writeable glass 1020 . Translating the writeable glass 1020 relative to focal point 1013 can create a region of changed refractive index in the writeable glass 1020 . An increased refractive index in this region causes any light channeled therethrough to experience total internal reflection, thus forming waveguide 1022 . In other words, waveguide 1022 can be formed as a continuous path of increased refractive index within writeable glass 1020 created by laser light 1011 at focal point 1013 .
- the technique of FIG. 10 can be used to laser write at least one waveguide into writeable glass 1020 .

- DOE diffractive optical elements
- refractive/reflective optical elements that combine the different color beams 610 a - d or 810 a - d in order to achieve coaxial superposition.
- each waveguide in the photonic integrated circuit can be positioned relatively far from the other input facets, to receive laser light from a respective laser diode, but the output facets for each of the waveguides can be positioned relatively close together.
- a spacing between the output facets of each waveguide can be smaller than a spacing of the input facets of each waveguide.
- each waveguide can be optimized for performance with light of a corresponding wavelength, for example to ensure that each wavelength of light exits the photonic integrated circuit with the same divergence angle as each other wavelength.
- the output of each individual waveguide can be placed close enough together (on the order of 1 Os of microns) such that that the light output by each individual waveguide may still follow the same optical path through the rest of a projector, display, or WHUD assembly where the photonic integrated circuit is implemented.

- the photonic integrated circuit may be positioned directly against the cap, such that the photonic integrated circuit acts as the optical window, and laser light from the laser diodes may directly enter the input facets of the photonic integrated circuit.
- the photonic integrated circuit may be spatially separated from the cap.
- each laser diode In order for light to travel through a photonic integrated circuit, the light emitted by each laser diode should preferably be aligned with a respective input facet of the photonic integrated circuit with high precision; mis-alignment of greater than 10 micrometers may significantly reduce the efficiency of the photonic integrated circuit.
- An output facet of each laser diode may have dimensions smaller than four square micrometers; aligning such small components to such high precision presents a non-trivial technical challenge.
- each input facet of the photonic integrate circuit could be written as a grating coupler as shown in FIG. 6 , which increases the tolerances for misalignment.

- Photonic integrated circuit writing system 1200 a can be utilized to manufacture an optical engine using a process that is similar in at least some respects to method 1100 of FIG. 11 , but with photonic integrated circuit writing system 1200 a , act 1114 can be performed before act 1112 , as detailed below.
- Writeable glass 1020 is bonded to cap 720 prior to writing a photonic integrated circuit therein, using any of the bonding techniques discussed above.
- the writeable glass 1020 may comprise a contiguous piece of glass or similar transparent material that undergoes a change in refractive index when exposed to high-intensity laser light. Bonding the writeable glass to the cap includes positioning and orienting the writeable glass 1020 relative to each laser diode 710 to place the writeable glass 1020 in the path of the beam of light emitted by each laser diode 710 , such that the beam of light emitted by each laser diode 710 impinges on the writeable glass.

In this way, the input facets of the resulting photonic integrated circuit will be accurately aligned with the laser diodes, ensuring efficient incoupling of the beams of light into the photonic integrated circuit.
- Aligning the input facets of the photonic integrated circuit to the beams of light during the writing stage will be more accurate than trying to mechanically align a pre-fabricated photonic integrated circuit, due to deviations that can arise in the bonding processes of not only the pre-fabricated photonic integrate circuit, but also the laser diodes.
- the laser diodes As one example, if each of four laser diodes is randomly misaligned, it would be difficult to align a prefabricated photonic integrated circuit to match the beam of light from each diode, since not only could the photonic integrated circuit be misaligned during the bonding processes, but also the spacing between each laser diode may not match the spacing between each waveguide in the photonic integrated circuit due to the random misalignment of each of the laser diodes.
- Direct laser writing the photonic integrated circuit after all of the components have been mechanically bonded obviates these issues, by allowing the position and spacing of each laser diode relative to the writeable glass to be accounted for after bonding is complete.

- FIG. 17 shows the divergence of the light 1702 emitting from the laser diode 1700 . As shown, the light beam 1702 may diverge by a substantial amount along a fast axis 1706 (or perpendicular axis) and by a lesser amount in the slow axis 1708 (parallel axis).
- the light beam 1702 may diverge with full width half maximum (FWHM) angles of up to 40 degrees in the fast axis direction 1706 and up to 10 degrees in the slow axis direction 1708 . This divergence results in a rapidly expanding elliptical cone.
- FWHM full width half maximum
- FIGS. 18A and 18B show an exemplary collimation scheme that can be used to circularize and collimate an elliptical beam such as that shown in FIG. 17 .
- FIG. 18A illustrates an orthogonal view of the fast axis 1706 of light beam 1702 emitted from laser diode 1700 .
- FIG. 18B illustrates an orthogonal view of the slow axis 1708 of light beam 1702 emitted from laser diode 1700 .
- a first lens 1800 collimates light beam 1702 along fast axis 1706 .
- first lens 1800 is shaped so as to not substantially influence light beam 1702 along slow axis 1708 . Subsequently, as shown in FIG.
- light beam 1702 is collimated along slow axis 1708 by a second lens 1802 .
- second lens 1802 is shaped so as to not substantially influence light beam 1702 along fast axis 1706 .
- light beam 1702 is collimated along fast axis 1706 separately from slow axis 1708 .
- the collimation power applied to each axis can be independently controlled by controlling the power of lens 1800 and lens 1802 separately.
- spacing between each of laser diode 1700 , lens 1800 , and lens 1802 can be controlled to collimate light beam 1702 to a certain width in each axis separately.
- light beam 1702 can be circularized. Because light beam 1702 will typically diverge faster in the fast axis 1706 , it is generally preferable to collimate light beam 1702 along fast axis 1706 first, then collimate light beam 1702 along slow axis 1708 after. However, it is possible in certain applications to collimate light beam 1702 along slow axis 1708 first, and subsequently collimate light beam 1702 along fast axis 1706 after. This can be achieved by reversing the order of first lens 1800 with second lens 1802 , with respect to the path of travel of light beam 1702 .
- FIGS. 18C and 18D are isometric views which illustrate exemplary shapes for lenses 1800 and 1802 .
- Each of lens 1800 and 1802 can be for example a half-cylinder as in FIG. 18C , a full cylinder as in FIG. 18D , a quarter cylinder, a three-quarter cylinder, any other partial cylinder, or any other appropriate shape.
- Lenses 1800 and 1802 can be similarly shaped, or can have different shapes.
- FIGS. 19A and 19B illustrate an alternative collimation scheme.
- FIG. 19A illustrates an orthogonal view of the fast axis 1706 of light beam 1702 emitted from laser diode 1700 .
- FIG. 19B illustrates an orthogonal view of the slow axis 1708 of light beam 1702 emitted from laser diode 1700 .
- a first lens 1900 redirects light beam 1702 along fast axis 1706 , to reduce divergence of light beam 1702 along fast axis 1706 .
- first lens 1900 is shaped so as to not substantially influence light beam 1702 along slow axis 1708 .
- first lens 1900 will reduce divergence of light beam 1702 along fast axis 1706 to match divergence of light beam 1702 along slow axis 1708 . That is, first lens 1900 preferably circularizes light beam 1702 . Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B , light beam 1702 is collimated along both fast axis 1706 and slow axis 1708 by a second lens 1902 . As shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B , second lens 1902 is shaped similarly with respect to both the fast axis 1706 and the slow axis 1708 , to evenly collimate light beam 1702 .
- first lens 1900 circularizes light beam 1702 , and subsequently second lens 1902 collimates light beam 1702 along both axes.
- First lens 1900 can for example be shaped similarly to lens 1800 or lens 1802 discussed above, and shown in FIGS. 18C and 18D .
- Second lens 1902 can for example be shaped as a double convex lens as illustrated in FIG. 19C , or a single convex lens (convex on either side) as illustrated in FIG. 19D , or any other appropriate shape of collimating lens.
- collimation schemes illustrated in FIGS. 18A-18D and 19A-19D could be used in place of any of the collimation lenses described herein, including at least collimation lenses 136 a , 136 b , 136 c , 136 d.
- one or more optical fiber(s) may be used to guide light signals along some of the paths illustrated herein.
- the WHUDs described herein may include one or more sensor(s) (e.g., microphone, camera, thermometer, compass, altimeter, and/or others) for collecting data from the user's environment.
- one or more camera(s) may be used to provide feedback to the processor of the WHUD and influence where on the display(s) any given image should be displayed.
- the WHUDs described herein may include one or more on-board power sources (e.g., one or more battery(ies)), a wireless transceiver for sending/receiving wireless communications, and/or a tethered connector port for coupling to a computer and/or charging the one or more on-board power source(s).
- on-board power sources e.g., one or more battery(ies)
- wireless transceiver for sending/receiving wireless communications
- a tethered connector port for coupling to a computer and/or charging the one or more on-board power source(s).
- logic or information can be stored on any processor-readable medium for use by or in connection with any processor-related system or method.
- a memory is a processor-readable medium that is an electronic, magnetic, optical, or other physical device or means that contains or stores a computer and/or processor program.
- Logic and/or the information can be embodied in any processor-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions associated with logic and/or information.
- a “non-transitory processor-readable medium” can be any element that can store the program associated with logic and/or information for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, and/or device.
