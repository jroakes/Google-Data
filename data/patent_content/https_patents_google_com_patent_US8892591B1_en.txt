- FIG. 2 shows a portion 200 of example network environment 100 .
- computing device 104 communicates with server system 112 to display a Web page 202 of a Web site.
- server system 112 stores a plurality of resources 204 , 206 , 208 which have respective resource identifiers (Resource ID).
- Resource ID resource identifiers
- the resource 204 , 206 , 208 can each correspond to different Web pages of the same Web site, or can correspond to Web pages of different Web sites.
- the Resource ID can include, for example, a uniform resource indicator (URI) or a uniform resource locator (URL).
- a request including the Resource ID is transmitted from computing device 104 to server system 112 over network 111 .
- the server system identifies the requested resource based on the Resource ID, and transmits the resource to computing device 104 over network 111 .
- the resource may be a Web page, through which a user may access a search system.
- the Web page may include a field 205 for inputting search terms that are transmitted to the search system.
- the search system performs a search of an indexed cache, and returns a search results list to a user.
- the search results list may include, e.g., connections to content that is relevant to the search terms.
- network environment 100 includes a search system 212 that identifies resources 205 by crawling and indexing resources provided by content publishers on Web sites 204 .
- search system 212 may include an indexing engine 213 that indexes resources (e.g., Web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet, microblog posts, social networking posts and annotations).
- resources e.g., Web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet, microblog posts, social networking posts and annotations.
- Data about the resources 205 can be indexed based on the resource 205 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 205 can be stored in an indexed cache 214 .
- a refinement engine 215 (or other software) ranks the resources that match the query.
- Search system 212 also includes an inference engine 216 for inferring affinity of a user to a party based on interaction(s) with online content associated with that party, as described below with respect to FIG. 3 .
- Search system 212 may be implemented, e.g., on server system 214 as shown or on other appropriate hardware.
- search system 212 can access indexed cache 214 to identify resources 205 that are relevant to the search query.
- Search system 212 identifies resources 205 in the form of search results 218 and returns the search results to a requesting device in search results pages.
- a search result may be data generated by search system 212 that identifies a resource 205 , and that includes a link to the corresponding resource.
- An example search result can include a Web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the Web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the Web page.
- Search system 212 takes into account social affinities that the user has to others when obtaining and presenting search results to the user. For example, a user's affinity to another party may be used to change (either increase or decrease) the ranking of future search results related to that party. Such affinities may also be used to promote online connection between the party and other parties, e.g., through social networking services.
- affinity can identify the closeness of a party to a user. For example, a contact of a contact who has five common middle contacts with the user has more of an affinity with the user (e.g., is considered closer to the user) than a contact of a contact who has only one common middle contact.
- Factors in determining affinity can include, e.g.: how a contact is connected to the user (e.g., a source of a connection), which social networking site the contact is a member of, whether contact or contact of contact, and how many paths to get to the contact of a contact (e.g., common middle contacts).
- Affinity can also be based on the user's interactions with members of the social graph (e.g., the frequency of interaction, the type of interaction, and so forth). For example, a user that frequently clicks on posts by a particular contact can be considered to be closer to that contact than with other contacts where they click on respective posts less frequently. Likewise, if a user frequently “mouses-over” content by an author (e.g., a search result link), but does not select that content, the degree of affinity may be less than if the link is selected.
- an amount of time viewing content may be an indicator that one party enjoys content from another party. The amount of time viewing particular content may be an indication that one party likes only that particular type of content from the other party.
- affinity can be defined by indirect interaction between users. For example, if two users interact with the same content regularly or frequently, those two users may be considered to have an affinity with each other. In still other examples, if two users interact with the same people regularly or frequently, those two users may be considered to have an affinity with each other.
- Affinity can also be greater for particular types of interactions, for example, comments on contact's posts can result in a closer social connection than occasional endorsements. Affinity can change over time. For example, as the types or frequency of interactions change with members of the social graph, the resulting affinities can change as well.
- Users can designate particular resources as endorsed, share resources, quote URLs, or otherwise indicate an interest or liking of content, examples of which include a particular resource, Web page, or search result.
- an application, widget, or scripting can be provided in search results pages, Web pages, or within a browser application that allows a user to indicate liking, sharing, or other evaluation of an associated resource or search result.
- the user can mark the particular resource, Web site, or search results to indicate endorsement or other evaluation (e.g., through a browser control or user interface element presented with the associated content).
- a social graph is one way to represent connection between two parties, which may, or may not, be on the same social networking service.
- a social graph is an association of connections among users and content, which may be depicted graphically. Types of connections in social graphs can include, but are not limited to, other users to which a user is in direct contact (e.g., user mail or chat contact, direct contacts on social sites) and users to which the user is in indirect contact (e.g., contacts of contacts, connections of users that have a direct connection to the user).
- a direct connection may be unilateral or bilateral.
- a social graph includes content generated by individuals (e.g., blog posts, reviews) as connections to the user.
- the social graph can include connections within a single network or across multiple networks.
- Distinct social graphs can be generated for different types of connections. For example, a user can be connected with chat contacts in one social graph, email contacts in a second social graph, and connections from a particular social network in a third social graph. Each social graph can include edges to additional parties at greater degrees of separation from the user. For example, an email contact can have its own email contacts to others adding a degree of separation from the user (e.g., user ⁇ email contact ⁇ contact of email contact). These contacts can, in turn, can have additional contacts at another degree of separation from the user. Similarly, a party's connection to someone in a particular social network can be used to identify additional connections based on that person's connections. Distinct social graphs can include edges connecting one or more social graph to one or more other social graphs. Thus, a social graph can include a single social graph or multiple interconnected social graphs.
- Affinity between members of a social graph can be represented by edges, e.g., in a database that stores data for the social graph. These edges can be weighted, either in that database or elsewhere, to reflect a level of affinity between two parties connected in the social graph.
- Affinity between parties can be content specific.
- social graph data may identify specific types of content associated with an edge between parties and specific affinities for that content.
- the social graph data may specify that, between two connected parties, the first party has a first level of affinity for the second party's videos and a second, different level of affinity for the second party's written work.
- the social graph may specify that the second party has a third, different level of affinity for the first party's blogs.
- FIG. 3 is a conceptual view of an example social graph 300 .
- FIG. 3 shows sources of information for a social graph.
- the user's social graph is a collection of connections (e.g., users, resources, etc.) identified as having a relationship to the user 302 within some degree of separation.
- the user's social graph can include people and particular content at different degrees of separation.
- the social graph of a user can include contacts, contacts of contacts (e.g., as defined by a user, social graphing site, or other metric), the user's social circle, people followed by the user (e.g., subscribed blogs, feeds, or Web sites), co-workers, and other specifically identified content of interest to the user (e.g., particular Web sites).
- Diagram 300 shows a user 302 and the different connections that are possible to extend the user's social graph to people and content both within a system and across one or more external networks.
- the user can have a profile or contacts list that includes a set of identified contacts, a set of links to external resources (e.g., Web pages), and subscriptions to content of a system (e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including e-mail, chat, video, photo albums, feeds, or blogs).
- a system e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including e-mail, chat, video, photo albums, feeds, or blogs.
- blogs that include links to a user's contacts may be part of the user's social graph.
- Each of these groups can be connected to other users or resources at another degree of separation from the user.
- contacts of the user each may have their own profile that includes links to resources as well as contacts of the respective contacts.
- a user may be connected to a social networking account. That social networking account may reference an article in a newspaper. A social connection, therefore, may be established between the user and the author of the article.
- the connections to a user within a specified number of degrees of separation can be considered the social graph of the user. Membership and degree of separation in the social graph may be based on other factors, including a frequency of interaction. For example, a frequency of interaction by the user (e.g., how often the user visits a particular social networking site) or type of interaction (e.g., endorsing, selecting, or not selecting items associated with contacts). As interaction changes, the relationship of a particular contact in the social graph can also dynamically change. Thus, the social graph can be dynamic rather than static.
- FIG. 4 shows a system 400 that includes a server system 402 that communicates with a user 404 via a user device 406 .
- the server system 402 communicates with the user device over a network (e.g., the Internet).
- the user device 406 may submit a query 408 (e.g., search requests) to the server system 402 , which may be associated with a social networking service (e.g., a social networking Web site).
- the query 408 includes one or more search terms (e.g., one or more keywords) provided by the user 404 which can be used by the server system 402 to return a resource that is responsive to the query 408 .
- the query 408 may include search terms that relate to subject matter in which the user is interested (e.g., the query 408 can include one or more keywords that relate to a topic in which the user 404 is interested).
- the query 408 is received by a search engine 410 associated with the server system 402 .
- the search engine 410 can identify resources (e.g., images, audio, video, Web pages, text, documents) that are relevant to the query 408 and present information about the resources in a manner that is useful to the user 404 .
- resources e.g., images, audio, video, Web pages, text, documents
- the search engine 410 may identify one or more resources (e.g., user groups, articles, or user content postings) that satisfy the query 408 (e.g., by determining that one or more of the keywords in the query 408 match or resemble names or titles associated with the resources).
- the search engine 411 may further process the preliminary search results 411 .
- the resources that are identified can be limited to resources that the user is authorized to access, e.g., public data, and private data that the user has permission to access.
- the search engine 411 includes a refinement engine 412 .
- the refinement engine may use stored information (e.g., popularity data 414 ) to analyze the preliminary search results 411 . For example, if the preliminary search results 411 identify multiple resources that satisfy the query 408 , the refinement engine 412 may use the popularity data 414 to refine the preliminary search results 411 (e.g., to present adjusted search results 418 to the user 404 ). In some examples, the refinement engine 412 can use the popularity data 414 to determine respective popularity levels of the preliminary search results 411 .
- the refinement engine 412 may use the popularity data 414 to rank the resources in the preliminary search results 411 according to their popularity (e.g., based on a number of users associated with a resource, or a number of times the resource has been viewed, favorited, bookmarked, “liked,” or shared by users).
- the refinement engine 412 can determine the respective popularity levels of the preliminary search results 411 by calculating (or accessing) popularity scores for the resources within the preliminary search results 411 .
- Popularity scores can be, for example, a numerical score that is based on values of one or more parameters.
- Parameters can include a number of users associated with a resource (e.g., the number of users that belong to a group), or a number of times the resource has been viewed, favorited, bookmarked, endorsed, or shared by users.
- Such parameters can be stored, for example, as popularity data 414 .
- Popularity scores can also be influenced by the recency of any of the parameters (e.g., parameters can be weighted based on how recently the values for the parameters have been obtained, e.g., more recent data can be weighted favorably).
- the popularity data 414 is stored information that identifies how popular a user (or a user's profile) is within a social networking application.
- the level of popularity associated with a user profile can be influenced by a number of user profiles linked to, or associated with, the user profile in question. User profiles can be linked or associated with one another by friend status, subscriber status, follower status, or by other links and connections within a social graph or social networking service.
- the popularity data 414 is shown as being stored on the server system 402 , the data can be stored anywhere that is accessible to the search engine 410 (e.g., stored in a remote location that is accessible by the search engine 410 over one or more networks).
- the refinement engine 412 can compare popularity levels of the preliminary search results 411 with a threshold to identify resources in the preliminary search results 411 that either exceeds, or falls below, the threshold. Based on this determination, the refinement engine 412 can take one or more actions. For example, if a popularity level of a resource within a search result falls below a popularity threshold (e.g., if a comparison of the popularity level and a popularity threshold results in a determination that a user would more likely be interested in a different resource, or would unlikely be interested in the evaluated resource), the refinement engine 412 may cause the search engine 410 to search for other, more popular, resources to include in the preliminary search results 411 .
- a popularity threshold e.g., if a comparison of the popularity level and a popularity threshold results in a determination that a user would more likely be interested in a different resource, or would unlikely be interested in the evaluated resource
- the resource with the popularity level below the threshold can be excluded from the preliminary search results 411 .
- the value of the threshold can be based on user preferences (e.g., user preferences associated with an application that submits queries to the search engine 410 , default levels (e.g., a predetermined level provided by the server system 402 ), or can be variable and/or dynamic based on a number of factors (e.g., the subject matter associated with the query 408 , or information associated with the user 404 , e.g., demographic information and geographic location information).
- an aggregate popularity level can be determined for the preliminary search results 411 (e.g., an aggregate score that is based on underlying popularity values of the resources included in the preliminary search results 411 ).
- the aggregate popularity level can also be compared to a respective threshold to determine whether additional actions should be taken that are similar to those described herein with regard to individual popularity level comparisons.
- the search engine 410 may also include a query variation engine 416 .
- the query variation engine 416 may use the query 408 to determine the existence of any different queries that are associated with similar subject matter.
- the query variation engine 416 may collaborate with other components of the server system 402 (e.g., the refinement engine 412 , the search engine 410 , and the popularity data 414 ) in order to generate alternate queries.
- the query variation engine 416 can attempt to identify queries that are related to the query 408 (e.g., in regard to the subject matter of the query 408 ) but return more relevant and/or more popular results.
- the query variation engine 416 can be instructed to generate and/or identify different queries for similar subject matter that return search results that includes resources having a relevancy or popularity level that exceeds the threshold. Other conditions may also cause the query variation engine 416 to attempt to generate alternate queries.
- the query variation engine 416 can be configured to generate alternate queries anytime a query is received by the search engine 410 , or may generate alternate queries based on user preferences or settings associated with the user 404 that provided the query 408 .
- the refinement engine 412 may determine either that the level of popularity associated with the query 408 is lower than a threshold value, or is lower than the level of popularity of a second, related query. In this case, the refinement engine may instruct the query variation engine 416 to identify one or more alternate queries related to the query 408 but that are more popular queries within a given time frame than the query 408 . Stated differently, alternate related queries can be identified that are more popular than the query 408 submitted by the user 404 , and preliminary search results 411 need not be generated.
- the query variation engine 416 could identify that the query “baseball world series” is currently (e.g., within a defined time frame, such as a week, day, or hour) more popular than the query term “baseball.”
- the search engine 410 can generate the search results 418 and may provide them to the user 404 without first generating the preliminary search results 411 .
- the search results 418 are the first search results generated in connection with the query 408 , and the search results 418 are generated based on (e.g., are responsive to) an alternate query provided by the query variation engine 416 .
- the popularity of various queries can be stored, for example, as part of the popularity data 414 .
- the query variation engine 416 can be instructed to generate and/or identify different queries for similar subject matter that return search results that includes resources having a relevancy or popularity level that exceeds the threshold. Other conditions may also cause the query variation engine 416 to attempt to generate alternate queries.
- the query variation engine 416 can be configured to generate alternate queries anytime a query is received by the search engine 410 , or may generate alternate queries based on user preferences or settings associated with the user 404 that provided the query 408 .
- evaluating the popularity of a given query within a time period against the popularity of other related, previously-received queries within a similar time period can allow the user to be directed to resources which are more likely to be active (e.g., populated with, or frequented by, a desirable number of other users). For example, if a user submits a query (e.g., using the keyword “baseball”) for a group within a social networking application, the search engine 410 might return a set of search results that contain a wide variety of groups (e.g., groups associated with baseball supplies, baseball cards, baseball World Series, and baseball stadiums).
- groups e.g., groups associated with baseball supplies, baseball cards, baseball World Series, and baseball stadiums.
- the search engine 410 and its associated components may determine that presenting search results for the query “baseball World Series” would be more likely to be of interest to the user.
- the techniques presented herein may increase the frequency with which a user is presented with mainstream results (e.g., fewer obscure or fringe results are presented in favor of more active, current, and/or popular results), which may promote social interaction among users.
- the user could be directed toward social networking groups related to the World Series (which may be, for example, a popular group with many other users during a particular time period, such as during game four of the World Series).
- providing search results on a second, more popular query i.e., “baseball World Series”
- the search results may be a subset of a set of search results associated with the originally-submitted query even if preliminary search results are not generated (e.g., even if no search is performed on the original query). This may allow a user to be presented with results which are focused on popularity within a given time period (e.g., social networking groups which have large, active communities).
- search results 418 can be presented to the user 404 . While in some examples the search results 418 can be identical to the preliminary search results 411 , there may be situations (such as those described above) in which the search engine 410 has altered the preliminary search results 411 to generate the search results 418 .
- the search results 418 can include resources whose selection was triggered by the insufficiency of one or more resources associated with the preliminary search results (e.g., by one or more resources associated with the preliminary search results falling below a threshold popularity level).
- the search results 418 can then be presented on the user device 406 associated with the user 404 who submitted the query 408 .
- An example presentation of search results within a social networking application is shown in FIG. 5 .
- FIG. 5 shows a user interface 500 that displays a social networking service 501 (which, in this example, is a social website identified by the unique resource locator (URL) http://www.socialwebsite.com).
- the social networking service 501 includes a search field 504 in which a search query 506 (e.g., a text or image query) can be entered.
- the query 506 is the term “bikes”.
- the social networking service 501 may return a list of search results 502 that are responsive to the query 501 (e.g., a list of news articles, web search results, or other content).
- the type of content displayed in the list of search results 502 can be defined before or after the search is executed.
- content filter controls 508 can be activated to limit the searched content to various categories of content.
- the “all” control 509 has been activated so that all content/resources will be searched that are associated with the search term 506 (i.e., the word “baseball,” as shown) or other queries (e.g., any alternate queries, such as those described as being generated by the query variation engine 416 described above).
- the content filter controls 508 are activated before the search is executed, only the selected content might be searched.
- the list of search results 502 might be filtered to include only results from the selected category, or the search might be executed a second time.
- Other content categories that can be searched include people and pages (e.g., contacts associated with a user of the social networking Website 501 ), Web content (e.g., content available online that is not associated with the social networking Website 501 ), and other information.
- privacy and permissions rules may govern the content that a given user may access and, as a result, the search results returned for that user might only include information that the user is authorized to access.
- the first and second search results include controls 520 .
- a user to whom the first and second search results 512 , 514 are displayed can perform various actions.
- activation of the controls 520 allow a user to comment on the second search result 514 (e.g., by activating the comment control 531 ) or endorse the second search result 514 (e.g., using the endorse control 533 ).
- the second search result 514 can also include a visibility indicator 522 (e.g., “public”) which can indicate the visibility of the second search result 514 .
- a visibility indicator 522 e.g., “public”
- the visibility indicator 522 may be visible to any users of the social networking service 501 .
- Other values of the visibility indicator 522 can include “private” (e.g., visible to the user only), “friends” (e.g., visible to the user's circle of friends), “family” (e.g., visible to the user's defined set family members), and so on.
- more than one value can be displayed for the visibility indicator 522 .
- symbols can also be displayed adjacent to a value (e.g., a globe or Earth symbol displayed next to a “public” visibility indicator 522 ).
- the second search result 514 can identify the number of users in a user's group (e.g., social circles, friends, family, etc.) who endorsed the second search result 514 .
- users e.g., the user associated with the second search result 514 , a user named Alice, and a user named Betty
- the second search result 514 can be updated to include a message (e.g., “You, Alice, Betty endorsed this”).
- the search results 502 include a first result 512 , a second result 514 , as well as one or more additional postings that are not currently visible.
- the one or more search results that are not currently visible are represented by the ellipses 503 below the second result 514 .
- the additional postings represented by the ellipses 503 can be viewed, for example, by scrolling down the list of search results 502 using the scroll control 521 .
- the list of search results 502 can also be sorted according to a sort control 510 which, in this example, sorts the list of search results 502 primarily according to a popularity of the search results.
- the list of search results 502 may be sorted primarily or secondarily by one or more other factors, for example, an age of the search results (e.g., by sorting the list of search results 502 from new to old search results) or the type of search results. In some examples, whether a search result is new or old depends on a recency of the search result.
- the search results 502 includes results for the adjusted query 530 , which is the term “baseball world series.”
- This alteration in the query term may result from a situation in which, for example, the query “baseball world series” was more popular than the query “baseball” within a given timeframe (e.g., within the last hour), or the search results for the term “baseball world series” have a higher level of popularity than the term “baseball.”
- an indication of the adjusted query 530 is presented that indicates that an alternate query (i.e., “baseball World Series”) has been used to identify the search results 502 .
- a original query control 532 may also be provided that, when activated, causes the social networking service to present search results that are responsive to the original query 506 (i.e., “baseball”). This allows users to revert back to their original queries.
- alternate query suggestions may also provided to the user.
- a suggestion control 534 may be presented that, when activated, may display one or more additional queries that may be of interest to the user (e.g., in a pop-up box, an expanded field, or in some other format).
- the additional suggested queries may be, for example, variations of the query 506 entered by the user, and may have varying levels of popularity.
- alternate queries may be automatically displayed within the interface (e.g., a control would not necessarily be displayed within the interface 500 ). Selection of one or more of the suggested queries could result in the determination and presentation of alternate search results.
- Some measure of popularity may be displayed in combination with any of the queries (e.g., the original query 506 , any of the suggested queries, or the altered query 530 ).
- a popularity score, rank, or level may be graphically represented near the corresponding query (e.g., a numerical score may be provided in parenthesis next to any suggested queries after they have been rendered on the user interface 500 , e.g., upon activation of the suggestion control 534 ).
- FIG. 6 shows illustrates process 600 for providing search results.
- a first content request is received ( 602 ).
- a social networking application may receive a query that includes one or more keywords.
- the keywords may be associated with subject matter for which a user is searching within a social networking application.
- a first level of popularity of the first content request is determined ( 604 ).
- a search engine or other entity, such as the refinement engine 412 ) may determine a numerical score that represents a level of popularity of the first content request, where the numerical score is based on a frequency with which the first content request has been previously submitted within a given period of time (e.g., within the last hour).
- the first level of popularity is compared to a second level of popularity associated with a second, previously received content request ( 606 ).
- the second, previously received content request relates to similar subject matter as the first content request, and the second level of popularity is based on a similar period of time as the first content request. It is determined that the second level of popularity exceeds the first level of popularity ( 608 ). For example, it may be determined that more users have submitted the second content request than the first content request within a given time period.
- One or more search results are determined that are responsive to the second content request ( 610 ). For example, as a result of determining that the second level of popularity exceeds the first level of popularity, a search engine may determine one or more search results that are responsive to the second, more popular content request. The one or more search results are provided ( 612 ). For example, a search engine may provide the one or more search results to a social networking service for presentation to a user who submitted the first content request (e.g., within a social networking service).
- the search terms associated with the second content request can be presented along with the search results. This may indicate to the user that the search results are based on a content request that is different from the content request originally submitted by the user.
- a control may also be provided that, when activated, causes one or more search results associated with the first content request to be provided. Activation of such a control may allow a user to view search results that are based on the originally submitted content request.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by a content server.
