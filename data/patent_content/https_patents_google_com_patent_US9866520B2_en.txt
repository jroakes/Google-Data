- the terminal devices 114 in FIG. 1 can represent single-mode or multimode roaming communication devices capable of interfacing to the WANs 116 by wire or wirelessly.
- the terminal devices 114 can comprise a number of embodiments including without limitation computing devices (e.g., a laptop, desktop computer, or server), a cellular phone with single-mode or multimode capability (e.g., WiFi and cellular), and a personal digital assistant (PDA) with wireless capability.
- computing devices e.g., a laptop, desktop computer, or server
- a cellular phone with single-mode or multimode capability e.g., WiFi and cellular
- PDA personal digital assistant
- an end user of said device can be afforded the flexibility of roaming between WANs 116 of the communication system 100 .
- the WANs 116 can be coupled to a packet-switched (PS) network 118 .
- PS packet-switched
- the PS network 118 and the WANs 116 can be supported by, for example, a Tier 1 Internet Service Provider (ISP) utilizing common packet-switched routing technologies (e.g., an IP, Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode or ATM, Multi-protocol Label Switching or MPLS) for transporting packet traffic between end users that have subscribed to services of the communication system 100 .
- ICPs Internet Content Providers
- ICM Internet Content Manager
- the ICM 110 can be used for managing Internet content supplied by the ICPs 112 to subscribers of the communication system 100 .
- the Internet content supplied by the ICPs 112 can conform to any existing or future Internet protocol (e.g., XML, VXML, Session Initiation Protocol or SIP, IP Multimedia Subsystem or IMS) for the purposes of delivering content to subscribers by way of an Internet application such as an Internet browser.
- XML XML
- VXML Session Initiation Protocol
- SIP Session Initiation Protocol
- IMS IP Multimedia Subsystem
- the Internet content can comprise software applications, services (e.g., HTTP services, Voice over IP or VoIP services, IP Multimedia Subsystem or IMS services, etc.), multimedia content with visual and/or audio content, flash media, pop-up windows, advertisements, spyware, cookies, or any other form of content that can be delivered or retrieved from a terminal device 114 of a subscriber.
- the ICPs 112 can be independently operated or can be aggregated by an Internet content broker by way of a common portal.
- the ICPs 112 can represent Internet content publishers, advertisement brokers, or brokers of Internet tracking applications (e.g., spyware)—just to name a few.
- FIG. 2 depicts an exemplary method 200 operating in portions of the communication system 100 .
- Method 200 as will be described shortly can be implemented in whole or in part by ICM 110 and one or more agents of the ISP managing communication system 100 .
- method 200 begins with step 202 in which one of the ICPs 112 submits for certification Internet content to the ISP.
- the ISP screens the Internet content and can certify said content according to a certification policy established by the ISP.
- a certification policy can comprise a group of classifications that can include, for example, an age group classification, a nature of content classification, a content type classification, and an audience maturity classification.
- the foregoing classifications can be applied with any criteria defined by the ISP.
- the ISP can define an age group classification based on the appropriateness of presenting the Internet content to various audience types much like the Movie Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating system (e.g., movies rated as G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17).
- MPAA Movie Picture Association of America
- the ISP can establish criteria screening the content for any number of age group classifications. For example, the ISP can determine that Internet content is appropriate for general audiences if it avoids use of profanity, violence of any kind, and explicit or implicit sexual material or innuendos. Other criteria can be used for other age group classifications.
- the ISP can establish criteria for a nature of content classification.
- the ISP can define a variety of nature of content classifications such as mild violence, violence, extreme violence, sexually explicit or implicit content or innuendos, adult language, profanity, language and images inappropriate for children under the age of 7, etc.
- the ISP can thus define any number of nature of content classifications considered suitable for screening the Internet content.
- the ISP can also define a number of content type classifications such as educational, entertainment, gaming, gambling, pornographic, etc.
- the ISP can also define a number of audience maturity classifications which are less specific than age group classifications such as, for example, mature audiences only, not intended for young children, suitable for young children, and so on.
- the ISP can thus screen the Internet content supplied in step 202 according to criteria established for one or more of the above classifications (or other classifications conceived of by the ISP not disclosed herein).
- the certification process can be mechanized by executing one or more content screening applications by way of a computing element of the ICM 110 .
- the computing element can represent a desktop computer, or server that can execute any number of applications or steps depicted by method 200 .
- the content screening applications can search and identify characteristics of the Internet content for purposes classifying said content.
- Content screening applications can be implemented with common software and/or hardware techniques and can operate as an integral part of the ICM 110 .
- the ICM 110 can be programmed to perform image and data processing on the Internet content supplied by the ICP 112 .
- the content screening applications may be able to process the Internet content using common image processing techniques and detect therefrom visual images of violence or explicit sexual behavior (e.g., detect weaponry, nudity, sexual intercourse, or violence between individuals or animation objects or characters).
- the ICM 110 can also be programmed to screen audible or textual language (e.g., language appropriate for any audience, language requiring parental guidance—mild profanity or innuendos, language for adults only—excessive profanity, etc.).
- the content screening applications can also be programmed with the ISPs criteria for classifications. Accordingly, the ICM 110 can screen and generate recommendations to the ISP for classifying the Internet content. In more sophisticated applications, the ICM 110 can also perform the classification exclusively.
- the screening process can be combined or replaced with screening performed by an agent of the ISP.
- the agent can, for example, review the Internet content without automation, or view the results delivered by the ICM 110 as well as apply his or her own judgment for classifying the Internet content based on the criteria established by the ISP.
- the agent and/or ICM 110 can also determine in step 206 that the Internet content supplied by the ICP 112 does not conform to a submission policy defined by the ISP.
- the ICP 112 may have not complied with the submission requirements that the ISP determines are necessary to adequately screen the Internet content.
- part of the submission policy may require documentation to explain the nature of the content, how it will be invoked while a subscriber is navigating through a website of the ICP 112 , and so on.
- an agent of the ISP, or the ICM 110 certifies in step 210 the Internet content according to one or more of the classifications set forth above and notifies the ICP 112 of the results.
- the ICP 112 can then make the certified Internet content available at a website or portal if not already available.
- the ICM 110 can be programmed in step 212 to receive a request to screen certified Internet content according to one or more classifications selected by a subscriber of the communication system 100 .
- the subscriber can request that the ISP by way of the ICM 110 monitor and restrict access to any certified Internet content that has explicit sexual content.
- the ICM 110 can thus prevent a common Internet browser of the subscriber or any parties associated therewith (e.g., members of the same household, or employees of an enterprise) from accessing certified Internet content that has been classified as containing explicit sexual content.
- the subscriber can submit this request in a number of ways.
- the subscriber can log into a website of the ISP by way of the ICM 110 and select check boxes with classifications for screening certified Internet content.
- the website can, for example, provide a brief description of each classification and the impact of selecting a classification for screening purposes.
- the ICM 110 can proceed to step 214 where it detects a request for access by one of the subscriber's terminal devices 114 to Internet content of one or more of the ICPs 112 .
- the ICM 110 checks in step 216 if said content is certified by the ISP according to the process previously described. If it is not certified, the ICM proceeds to step 218 where it blocks access to the Internet content by common means such as, for example, not resolving a Domain Name Service (DNS) request, or presenting a web page notice to the subscriber's browser in step 220 indicating the site is blocked due to lack of certification of said content.
- DNS Domain Name Service
- the ICM 110 proceeds to step 222 and checks if the classification of the certified Internet content requested is in the subscriber's screening list. If it is, then the ICM 110 proceeds to steps 218 where it blocks access, and notifies the subscriber by way of the browser in step 220 that the content has been blocked in compliance with the screening list. Otherwise, the ICM 110 proceeds to step 224 where it grants the subscriber's browser access to said content.
- Method 200 provides subscribers of the IPS an alternative means to purchasing complex and expensive screening software for his or her terminal devices 114 . It benefits the ISP in competing and differentiating itself from other ISPs that do not supply such certification and screening services to its subscribers.
