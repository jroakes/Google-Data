In some embodiments, Input Method Editor engine 122 can according to Linguistic context or linguistic context 105, such as
English context or linguistic context 105a, the Chinese explanations such as context or linguistic context 105b, Korean context or linguistic context 105c combination input.
When explaining combination input according to Linguistic context or linguistic context 105, it may be determined that Linguistic context or context values 107.Based on language
It says that context or context values 107 and combination input, can identify candidate selection, and be presented to user, it is for selection.
For example, several combination inputs can be received by Input Method Editor engine 122, such as thump (keystroke).
Thump can define a series of Pinyin Inputs under Chinese context or linguistic context 105b and can define English context or language
A series of letters under the 105a of border.It correspondingly, can be the candidate selection of one or more English, such as word and one or more
Chinese candidate selection, such as chinese character are presented to the user, for selection.
In some embodiments, it can set by comparing the prefix for combining input and English words and based on this comparison
English context or context values determine English context or context values 107a.For example, combination input o-p-p-o matching words
Character string in " opportunity ".The prefix matching that can be for example identified compared with this is proportionally set above and below English
Text or context values 107a for example, context or context values may be low for combination input o-p, but input o-p- for combination
P-r-t-u may be much higher.
Can also Linguistic context or context values 107 be determined by other processing.It for example, can be by Chinese language mould
Type assesses Chinese character and sets Chinese context or context values 107b based on the assessment to determine Chinese context or linguistic context
Value 107b.For example, Chinese language model can include Chinese syntactic model.Example Chinese syntactic model can include interlocking
(serial verb) structural model, perfect (perfective) and unfinished formula (imperfective) model and other
Syntactic model.
It is inputted based on combination, such as thump, can identify Pinyin Input sequence (series).Pinyin combinations input and then can
For identifying chinese character.Chinese syntactic model can be applied to chinese character, to determine that user is want in Chinese context
Or the possibility inputted under linguistic context.For example, be full the chinese character of verb combination input string will be scored it is very low,
And the combination input string for obtaining verb and object will be scored it is higher, etc..As another example, it obtains reading as " I likes
The combination input of the Chinese character string of flower " will obtain higher Chinese context or context values 107b, and obtain reading as " bed
The combination input of the Chinese character string of ox TV " will obtain very low Chinese context or context values 107b.
Other processing can be used to determine Linguistic context or context values 107.For example, the word being rarely employed in language-specific
Context or context values will be determined relatively low, and the word being commonly used that is defined by files on each of customers (profile) or phrase
Context or context values may be determined higher.
In some embodiments, candidate selection can be determined based on Linguistic context or context values 107 and combination input
Order and selection.For example, being inputted for given combination, it can identify that for first language context or context values be 0.7
It is selected with 0.5 two candidates and the corresponding Linguistic context of second language identification or context values can be directed to as 0.6 candidates
Selection.It is thus possible to character is presented with Linguistic context or the order of context values, for example, context or the word that context values are 0.7
Symbol will come first；Context or the character that context values are 0.6 will come second；Context or context values will for 0.5 character
Come third.
In some embodiments, (normalize) Linguistic context or context values can be normalized, for example, can be
Highest Linguistic context or context values are normalized to 1.0.In some embodiments, it can be determined for each candidate characters
Linguistic context or context values 107, for example, each character can with associated Linguistic context or context values, and thereby
It can estimate that user is intended to squeeze into the possibility of specific character.In some embodiments, combination input string can be directed to determine
Linguistic context or context values 107, for example, string can indicate combination with associated Linguistic context or context values 107
The input string possibility to be applied in language-specific.
Fig. 3 is based on the first combination input 302 and Linguistic context or the example candidate of context values selection set 300.Example
Combination input o-p-p is such as received by Input Method Editor such as Input Method Editor example 103, and according to Chinese context
Or linguistic context 105b explains it with English context or linguistic context 105a.Candidate's selection 1-5 can be for example defined with highest
The Chinese character of Linguistic context or context values, and thereby show as shown in the figure.
Alternatively, combination input o-p-p may have the english language context less than Chinese language context or context values
Or context values, so as to not show English candidate selection.
Fig. 4 is another example candidate selection set 400 based on the second combination input 402.Such as pass through input method editor
Device such as Input Method Editor example 103 receives such as combination input o-p-p-o, and according to Chinese context or linguistic context 105b
It is explained with English context or linguistic context 105a.But candidate selection 1 for example defines English words " opportunity ",
And with highest Linguistic context or context values, Chinese selection 2-5 can be defined with time highest Linguistic context or linguistic context
The character of value, and thereby show as shown in the figure.
Alternatively, combination input o-p-p-o can have higher than above and below Chinese language context or the english language of context values
Text or context values, and thereby English candidate selection is shown first.
So as to which potential Linguistic context or context values are thus indicate that most probable purport with reference to determined by the description of figure 3
In inputting Chinese character.But potential Linguistic context or context values instruction user's most probable with reference to determined by the description of figure 4
It is intended to input English character " opportunity ".
