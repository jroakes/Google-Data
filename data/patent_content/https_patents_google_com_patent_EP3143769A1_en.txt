Definitions
- Many media providing services include various search functionality, for example to allow a user to find content available on the service from a particular artist, composer, producer, album, or other source. Results of such a search are often presented in a list that allows the user to play part or all of the content of each result.
- each result from a search performed at a music service may include a link that the user can select to begin playback of songs matching the user's search.
- Embodiments of the disclosed subject matter include techniques, systems, and computer readable media for caching media items prior to playback by a user.
- a list of media items to be presented to a user may be obtained and presented to the user.
- the list may be, for example, search results for a search executed at a content service by the user.
- One or more portions of one or more media items may be cached at the user's device. The duration and location of each cached portion may be determined based upon one or more caching factors.
- Example caching factors include a determined likelihood that the user will select the first media item; a timestamp when a vocal aspect of the first media item begins; a timestamp of a significant change in a waveform of the first media item; a portion of the first media item having a waveform with an amplitude above a threshold value; a rating of the media item; a play count of the media item, a number of playlists containing the media item, a tempo of the media item, a value stored in a comment field associated with the media item, a producer of the media item, a composer of the media item, and the contents of lyrics associated with the media item.
- Caching factors may be used individually or in any combination, and media items may be cached concurrently or consecutively.
- Each portion may be cached before receiving a selection of a media item for playback from the user. Upon receiving such a selection, a cached portion of the media item may be played. Additional portions of the media item may be played, such as by streaming or otherwise obtaining the remainder of the media item.
- means for receiving a list of media items to be presented to a user and for presenting the media items to the user are provided.
- Means for caching a portion of one or more media items in the list based upon one or more caching factors are provided. Also provided are means for receiving a request from a user to play a media item that has been cached, and for playing the cached portion of the media item subsequent to a selection of the media item by the user.
- Embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter may allow for media items to be played immediately upon selection by a user, without any buffering or caching that is apparent to the user. Additional features, advantages, and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter may be set forth or apparent from consideration of the following detailed description, drawings, and claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that both the foregoing summary and the following detailed description are illustrative and are intended to provide further explanation without limiting the scope of the claims.
- FIG. 1 shows an example process for caching media items according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 2 shows an example system configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 3 shows an example computing device according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter.
- the presently disclosed subject matter when a user is presented with a list of media items such as songs that the user may want to play, various portions of one or more of the items may be cached before the user selects any items for playback. Most media players will begin buffering an item as soon as a user chooses to play the content. Embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter may aggressively cache content that the user might want to play before they choose a particular item for playback, so that there is no buffering required. The portion of each item may be cached at a device of the user, based upon one or more caching factors. Similarly, the specific location within each item that is cached may be selected based upon one or more caching factors.
- a content service such as a music store
- Embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter provide improved techniques for identifying the portion and amount of media items to cache when a set of items are presented to the user, prior to the user selecting any of the items for playback.
- a user when a user performs a search, most applications will search over the corpus of artists, albums, songs, genres, playlists, and so on, and will return a set of matching results.
- the results may have basic metadata (album art, title, artist), a link to either the navigational page (in the case of an artist, album, genre or playlist), and a link to the first audio or video file.
- the interface may begin caching the first items in the results so as to make them more readily available should the user choose to play them.
- this may be inefficient, for example if the user does not select one of the initial results.
- a portion of each media file returned in the results may be cached, starting with the most relevant items.
- the portion cached may be at the beginning of a media item, or it may be located somewhere in the middle of the media item.
- the duration of each media item to be cached may be determined in several ways. For example, a technique may attempt to cache a portion of each item in the list of items, such as a list of search results, which are presented to the user. To do so, the amount of time that it takes a user to select an item in the list may be determined, such as based upon an historical average selection time for the user or for a group of users. The expected amount of time before a selection may then be divided evenly among the items in the list presented to the user. For example, if it takes a user 5 seconds on average to select an item for playback, and a list of items presented to the user includes 10 items, 500 ms may be spent caching as much of each item in the list as possible.
- the amount of each media item to be cached may be determined based upon the size of a buffer used by a media player at the user's device. Most media players will start buffering a song or video for a specific number of seconds before playback starts. An amount of each media item may be cached equal to the buffer of the media player, starting with a most relevant item and working down in terms of relevance, as disclosed in further detail herein. Thus, when one of the media items is selected, playback may begin without the initial buffering being apparent to the user. [0013] Another technique is to cache those media items that are most likely to be selected by the user.
- the likelihood of a user selecting a particular item may be determined based on, for example, users' selections of items tied to a query similar to a query that generated the list of media items presented to the user. As a specific example, if, when users search for the song "Wrecking Ball", they are 80% likely to play the Miley Cyrus song, 15% likely to play a karaoke version, and 5% likely to play an instrumental version, the corresponding versions of the song may be cached in that order. Similarly, the likelihood of a user selecting a particular song may be based upon historical actions of the individual user. For example, a user may have previously selected several media items corresponding to movie trailers.
- the search results may include a version of the song “Iron Man,” the movie “Iron Man,” and a trailer for the movie “Iron Man 2.” Based on the user's history, the trailer for "Iron Man 2" may be cached preferentially over the song and the movie.
- Another technique is to cache content while a user is completing a purchase of one or more content items. For example, if a user is buying a song or video through a content providing service, as the user is completing payment, the beginning of the content being purchased may be cached. Thus playback of the content may begin as soon as the user completes the purchase, without any delay apparent to the user.
- the specific portion of a media item to be cached may be determined based upon several factors. For example, it may be desirable to cache a portion of the media item that includes a section of the item that is believed to be interesting to a user, such as a portion of a song that includes lyrics, a particularly loud or fast portion of a song, or the like. Such portions of a media item may be identified, for example, by determining beginning and end segments of a song that include lyrics, based on an analysis of the audio content of the song, known lyrics and/or time cues within the song, or the like.
- a waveform of a media item may be analyzed to identify a portion of the item that has many changes in a short period of time or a significant change in the waveform, or that has an amplitude over a threshold such as relative to the average amplitude of the media item.
- caching factors may be used to determine the location and/or duration of a media item to cache.
- metadata related to the media item in a media service may be used, such as a rating, play count, and/or number of playlists containing the media item.
- a higher popularity or rating may indicate that the media item should be cached ahead of less popular or lower-rated items, and/or that a larger portion of the media item should be cached.
- Other metadata related to the content of the media item also may be used, such as the tempo, producer, composer, or artist of the media item, the contents of lyrics in the media item, and/or values stored in comment fields associated with the media item. For example, media items having metadata that indicate the media item is more likely to be played, based on historical user selections, may be cached earlier and/or more extensively.
- one or more caching factors may be used alone or in conjunction with other caching factors to determine the extent of, and order in which, media items in a particular list are to be cached. Different caching factors also may be used sequentially. For example, an initial portion of one or more media items may be cached based upon the likelihood that a user will select the media item. If the user has not yet selected a media item for playback when this initial caching is completed, one or more of the media items may be cached further, or additional media items may be partially or entirely cached, based upon the popularity of the items or any other caching factor.
- FIG. 1 shows an example technique for caching media items in a list of media items presented to a user, such as by a content providing service.
- a list of media items to be presented to a user may be obtained.
- the list may be, for example, a list of search results for a search performed by the user at a content providing service, or an automatically-generated list of items such as "suggested" media items, an existing playlist, or the like, that has been accessed by the user.
- the list may be presented to the user, such as via a user interface accessed by the user.
- the list may be transmitted to a device of the user, such as a mobile phone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer, or the like, on which a media player is installed or presented to the user.
- a device of the user such as a mobile phone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer, or the like
- the user may access the list and subsequent playback features via a web browser or similar application on the user's device, which is in communication with a remote content service that provides the list of media items and from which the user's device may obtain and cache content.
- a portion of one or more media items in the list may be cached.
- the media items may be cached before the list is presented to the user. However, typically the list will be presented relatively quickly, such that little or no caching may be performed before the list is presented to the user.
- one or more media items may be partially or entirely cached at a device of the user before the user selects any one of the media items for playback on the device.
- the user selects a particular media item for playback, it may begin playing on the user's device immediately, without any apparent buffering from the perspective of the user.
- the duration and location of each portion of each media item to be cached may be determined based upon multiple factors, as previously described.
- each cached portion may have a duration and a location within the media item that is selected based upon one or more caching factors.
- Example caching factors used to select the duration and position of a cached portion of a media item may include the likelihood that the user will select the media item for playback, a timestamp of a vocal aspect of the media item, a significant audio change or other change in the waveform of the media item, and a location of the media item having a waveform amplitude above a threshold amount.
- One or more caching factors may be used to select the portion of each media item for which a portion is cached, as well as the specific media items that are cached and the order in which they are cached. In some configurations, multiple media items in the list may be cached consecutively or concurrently, for example based upon the bandwidth available for caching, the duration and bitrate of the individual media items, and the like.
- a request for playback of a media item may be received from the user, such as a selection of the media item or a user interface element associated with the media item.
- the selected media item may be played, beginning with the cached portion of the media item.
- additional portions of the media item may be obtained while the cached portion is playing, and "stitched" together upon reaching the end of the cached portion, as is known in the art.
- subsequent portions of the media item may be obtained at a higher bitrate than the initial cached portion.
- FIG. 2 shows an example system according to an embodiment of the disclose subject matter.
- a user device 210 such as a smart phone, tablet, laptop computer, or the like, may communicate with a media service, such as a music and/or video store 220.
- the device 210 may communicate with the service via a network 201 such as the Internet, using any conventional protocols and network connections.
- the content service 220 may be in communication with, or may include, one or more media sources 230.
- the service 220 may make content from a variety of content producers available to user devices 210 through a marketplace or similar service.
- the media 230 may include various metadata as previously described, such as metadata describing the content, quality, audio and/or video attributes, and other attributes of media items provided by the service 220 to user devices 210.
- the user device 210 may provide an interface 240 that is capable of displaying lists of media items to the user.
- a list may include graphics and/or text that identifies each media item, as is readily understood in the art.
- Each item in the list may be selectable by the user, such as via a touch screen or conventional computer interface that allows a user to tap, click, or otherwise select each item.
- a portion of one or more of the media items may be cached. For example, if it is determined that the song
- “Symphony 1" is more likely to be played by the user than "Party Chicken,” it may be cached first, and/or a larger portion of "Symphony 1" may be cached.
- the determination of which portions of which media items to cache may be made by the user device 210, the service 220, or a combination thereof.
- the media service 220 may provide metadata as previously described, which the device 210 may use to determine which media items to cache, in what order, and/or what portions of the media items to cache.
- the media service 220 may provide an indication such as a ranking for each media item listed in the interface 240 that indicates to the device 210 which media items should be cached, in what order, and/or the portion of each media item to cache.
- a search process or other process operating on the device 210 or the service 220 may return an indication, such as a URL, of the media items in the list.
- the items may be returned in relevancy order, such as most-relevant results first, where the relevancy order is determined based upon the caching factors previously described.
- the relevancy order may indicate the likelihood that the user will select each media item in the list.
- a list of key- value pairs including pointers to the search results and portions of cached media items may be created and provided to the user device 210. If a user starts to play a song on the search results page, the cached media item, the URL to the full item, and the duration of the item may be provided to the media player.
- the media player may then stitch the cached portion together with the full media item based on the duration of the portion.
- additional portions of media items in the list may be obtained and cached at the device 210.
- the user device 210 may receive a list of media items and associated rankings and caching data that allow the device 210 to cache portions of the media items from the media service 220 before the user selects one or more of the media items for playback.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity and/or search history may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's media preferences may be generalized so that a particular purchase history of a user cannot be determined.
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a system as disclosed herein.
