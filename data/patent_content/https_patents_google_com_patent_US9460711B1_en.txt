Definitions
- Speech recognition involves translating spoken words into text.
- speech recognition is now used in a growing number of applications and services.
- voice-enabled search systems utilize speech recognition to allow a user to search the Internet or control functions of an automobile using a voice command.
- One approach for performing computerized speech recognition involves using an acoustic model to model the relationship between an acoustic feature vector and a phoneme, a basic unit of a language's phonology.
- Acoustic feature vectors are numerical representations of acoustic speech that are determined by sampling and filtering speech data.
- an acoustic model may output a statistical representation (e.g., a joint probability distribution) indicating a likelihood that the feature vector corresponds to a particular phoneme. From the likelihoods output by the acoustic model, a decoder may then be used to classify observed sequences of phonemes as one or more words.
- HMMs Hidden Markov Models

- An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feedforward neural network that receives a sequence of feature vectors as input and derives posterior probabilities over HMM states as output.
