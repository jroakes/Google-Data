The message handling system 135 of electronic information management system, this Postini
The electronic information management system is in U.S. Patent No. 6,941, describes in 348.This message handling system can be connected to one or more client 105,110 by the Internet 115.Each client is connected to the Internet 115 by Internet server 120 and fire wall 125.A plurality of terminals 130 can be connected to each Internet server 120 to communicate by letter with the Internet 115.Message handling system 135 is also connected to database 140, stores various data corresponding to client 105,110 and user in described database 140.In database 140, also store corresponding to the metadata of sending out message traffic by message handling system 135.According to an embodiment, message handling system 135 is that message data is sent out in a large amount of client's monitoring.As a result, message handling system 135 is collected in a large number about sending out the empirical data of message traffic.These data can comprise source IP address, its purpose IP address, source screen title (screen name), the purpose screen title of message, the hyperlink and the accessory information of embedding.Message handling system 135 can utilize this information, together with the information of other collections, produces the reputation score (reputation score) corresponding to particular message.The process that is used to produce reputation score is in U.S. Patent No. 6,941, describes in more detail in 348, and this U. S. application is included as a whole in this application by reference at this.These reputation scores can be used to prevent (withhold) subsequently, isolate (quarantine) or deletion particular message, perhaps take other disposal actions relevant with this message, depend on the special parameter of distributing to client or user.Be used for describing in more detail with reference to Fig. 5 A below with the process of reputation score assessment synchronization message.
[00025] as shown in fig. 1, message handling system 135 also is connected to third party's terminal 145, encrypting and authenticating authorized organization (certificate authority) 150 by the Internet 115, and at least one sends out message server 155.Sending out message server 155 is central servers, carries out specific messaging protocol (for example, Yahoo, microsoft network (MSN), America Online, Google's chat) thereon.Perhaps, scheme as an alternative, sending out message server 155 can Managing speech communication (using the VOIP agreement), video content or file-sharing are used.Send out message server 155 and safeguard the parameter list 165 that is stored in the message server 155, comprise user's current IP address, also signed the contacts list (for example " good friend " tabulation or " contact person " tabulation) of this service, and " online " notifying parameters.
[00026] in Fig. 2, described to be stored in the more detailed view of form, field and data in the message handling system database 140.Among other things, message handling system database 140 is safeguarded the customer list 205 of having signed message management services.This customer list preferably refers to have signed the tissue of message management services or group (group) but not individual's tabulation.Each client is assigned with various parameters 245, comprise client's level permission (permission) 211, client's general classes 212, sign should be done and so on screening parameter 213 to issue message, the recording parameters 214 whether describing message should be recorded and should how to be recorded, the IP address 215 of the address, address realm or the domain name that are associated with this client is described, and other associated person informations 216 that are used for this client.User's identifier (identifier) tabulation 210 also can be associated with each client in the customer list 205.In these user's identifiers 210 each identifies the user uniquely, and is which kind of sends out messaging protocol no matter the user utilized.Federation properties (federation property) tabulation 217 also can be associated with each client.When the client realizes that message system is sent out by enterprise but not during public messaging protocol, federation properties 217 is used.Outer which client of federation properties sign customer network and user can communicate by letter with the user that message system inside is sent out by this enterprise.
[00027] each user in user's identifier list 210 also is assigned with various user's level parameters 215.These user's parameters comprise and various messaging protocols (Yahoo for example, MSN, AOL, Google etc.) the screen title 220 that is associated, corresponding specific user's federation properties tabulation 222, user's level licence list 225, user's general classes or grouping (grouping) 230, sign should be done and so on screening parameter 235 to issue message, the recording parameters 240 whether describing message should be recorded and should how to be recorded, the address that is associated with this user is described, the IP address 245 of address realm or domain name, and other associated person informations 250 that are used for this user.
[00028] client's level permission 211 and the permission of user's level 225 both include and the transmission of text message and reception, employed messaging protocol, employed messenger service, the annex of whether permitting inside and/or external message, message, audio frequency (for example VOIP), video, permission that hyperlink is relevant with alternative document.Client's level parameter 245 also comprises a plurality of kinds 212, and for example the client is government organs, mechanism of the military, commercial undertaking or non-commercial mechanism.User's level parameter also comprises each group that finds in the particular customer, for example comprises management, marketing, engineering, human resources and IT.These kinds and group can be associated with various permissions, the permission that is associated with each client/user with further customization.Various screening parameters 213,235 also are associated with each client/user.What these screening parameter definition do to being identified as violation strategy or otherwise problematic message.The possible selection that is used to handle described issue message comprises and stops that (block) described message sends, send described message but with its mark (flag) for potential violation (violation), warn (warning) about policy violation to the user, notify in violation of rules and regulations to the IS keeper, and before described message can be assessed by suitable individuality, isolate described message.For each client/user, also can obtain recording parameters 214,240.Whether these parameter Indication messages should be by record (journal), files (archive) or keep a diary (log).The message of record is recorded with textual form, and is sent to the communication party by Email subsequently.The message of filing is recorded with the form of their bases, but is stored in the depots (repository) at message handling system 135 places or other suitable positions.To message keep a diary mean corresponding to the data of sending out messaging activity (dater, whose transmission, whose reception, or the like) be recorded and be stored in the depots at message handling system 135 places or other suitable positions.These features can allow the client to follow the set various data of this client and retain (retention) strategy.In voice or VOIP application, user's level parameter can comprise the telephone number corresponding to single user.In addition, these voice application can divide other basis form to be put down in writing or file with them.Client and user's parameter can also comprise IP address information 215,245, for example the scope of client/user's accurate IP address, receivable IP address, perhaps client/user's domain name.Associated person information 216,250, for example client/user's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address can be stored in client/user's parameter.At last, the screen title (220) that is associated with specific user can be stored in user's parameter 215.Each user can have various screen titles, depends on difference service and agreement that the user signs.
[00029] before using a synchronous message system, new user can set up account to message handling system 135.This can perhaps realize with the basis of carrying out individually, because various user utilizes this messenger service by IS department automatically for all users in tissue or the group realize.Described to illustrate the process flow diagram of the representative registration process of new user on message handling system 135 among Fig. 3.This process begins (305) when message handling system 135 receives initiated event (initiation event) (307).This initiated event can be any incident in the variety of event, for example receive and have notif iotaer (presence notifier) at message handling system 135 places, receive inwardly (inbound) or outwards (outbound) message at message handling system 135 places, receive the direct request that activates registration process from the user, perhaps the IS keeper from particular customer receives direct register requirement.In case receive initiated event, registration process (for example registering auto-programming (bot)) is initiated (310) at message handling system 135 places.The software application that this registration auto-programming can be carried out on message handling system 135, user direct and in user's end communicates by letter.This registration auto-programming is to sign (identification) and the e-mail address (315) of user's inquiry corresponding to this user.This information directly offers message handling system 135 from the user.Next, this registration auto-programming arrives user's IP address with e-mail address binding (bind), and with this information storage (320) in the database of message handling system 135.
[00030] this message handling system 135 uses this sign and e-mail address to set up user's archives (profile) (322).Can also point out the user to adjust various clients and user's parameter in the message handling system 135 corresponding to this client.Certainly, in other are used, can distribute the parameter setting of acquiescence to all new users of this system.According to another embodiment, only some user will have the ability to revise their parameter and permission.After suitable client and user's parameter be assigned to new user, activation key was sent to user's e-mail address (325).Can use other methods that is used to provide activation key, this message of for example sending the documents, call and conventional mail.In case receive activation key, the user provides back message handling system 135 (330) by message session (session) with this activation key.Can also use other technologies to verify (verify) user's identity, for example security website.At this point, message handling system 135 approval (approve) users send out message (332).After these steps, finish (335) at new user's registration process.
[00031] after registration, the user can activate at client terminal 130 and send out messages application synchronously, so that participate in (engage) to sending out in the messaging activity.In Fig. 4, described process flow diagram corresponding to representative client terminal activation.This process is in user's (410) beginnings (405) when messages application is sent out in the activation of client terminal place.In case activate, send out messages application and will exist notif iotaer to send to the instant message server 155 (415) of sending out from client terminal 130.This exists notif iotaer at first to arrive client's Internet server 120, and it is redirected (redirect) to message handling system 135 (420) at this.Message handling system 135 receives this and has notif iotaer, and from database 140 retrieval corresponding client/user's parameters (425).Message handling system 135 is subsequently to this user/client's application strategy, to determine the rank (level) (430) of sending out messaging activity at this client/user was permitted.Any parameter in permission, record and the combined parameters that in Fig. 2, identifies before these strategies can comprise.Further describe sending out the application of policies of message event (for example 135 pairs of receptions that have notif iotaer of message handling system) below with reference to Fig. 5.If determine that this client/user has enough permissions and uses a messages application, then message handling system 135 is replaced client terminal IP address (435) there to be the new destination address in the notif iotaer.According to an embodiment, client terminal IP address is replaced by the IP address of message handling system 135, thereby sends to this user or all synchronization messages of sending from this user will be by message handling system 135.After replacing this IP address, message handling system 135 will exist notif iotaer to be forwarded to a suitable message server 155 (440) by the Internet 115.There is notif iotaer in case receive, sends out message server 155 and at first state of user is changed into " online " (445).Send out next 165 these users' of retrieval of the customer parameter from send out message server 155 contacts list (450) of message server 155.After this, send out message server 155 and will exist notif iotaer to offer each contact person (375) of this user by the Internet 115.This exists notif iotaer to comprise the new destination address of refer message disposal system 135 rather than client terminal 130, thereby all synchronization messages of this user will be routed by message handling system 135.In addition, for each the also contact person of " online " in user's the tabulation, sending out message server 155 also provides back to the user at client terminal place by message handling system 135 and has notif iotaer (460).At this point, the user is ready to one of contact person with also " online " and sends out message (465) synchronously.Therefore client terminal activation finish (470).
[00032] as mentioned with reference to Fig. 1 before, the synchronization message disposal system may be implemented as with the client who uses enterprise to send out message system 112 and works.In such arrangement, client inside (intra-client) synchronization message is stayed in the constraint of client's fire wall 125 and by message handling system 135.Although client's inside story is not sent to the customer network outside, sends out messaging activity and still can finish by sending out message server 155 with third party's message device (messager).
[00033] described to activate client terminal among Fig. 4 A and sent out the exemplary process that message system uses with enterprise by it.This process is being used enterprise to send out client terminal 130 places in the customer network of message system 112 in the user and is being activated (410A) beginning (405A) when sending out messages application.Exist notif iotaer at first in client's fire wall 125, to be sent to enterprise and send out message system 112 (415A).Message system 112 is sent out from client and the user parameter (420A) of message handling system 135 retrievals corresponding to the user of client terminal 130 by enterprise.According to an embodiment, client and user's parameter can also be stored in enterprise and send out in the database that message system 112 is associated.Next, message system 112 is sent out to user/client's application strategy by enterprise, to determine to send out the licensed rank (425A) of messaging activity.Describe the exemplary process of application strategy among Fig. 5.If a messaging activity is sent out in strategy permission, then enterprise sends out message system 112 and changes user's state into " online " (430A), and retrieval is comprised in enterprise and sends out user's contacts list (435A) in the message system.If strategy disapproves the user and sends out message synchronously, then activation stops.Enterprise send out message system 112 next to send out from enterprise the message system 112 database retrieval to each contact person provide and have notif iotaer (440A).Because this user tabulation is the enterprise from customer network sends out that message system 112 retrieved, so this exists notif iotaer generally will be sent to user in this customer network.In addition, for each the also contact person of " online " in user's the tabulation, enterprise sends out message system and provides back to the user at client terminal place and have notif iotaer (445A).In case sending out message system 112 from enterprise provides and exists notif iotaer, user to be ready to send out message (450A) in the inter-sync of client's fire wall.
[00034],, then use extra step to activate the outside message of sending out if client/user's parameter permission and the user/client outside client's fire wall 125 send out message as further illustrating among Fig. 4 A.Yet, be not licensed (455A) if send out message with fire wall client/user outward, client terminal activation stops (460A).In order to activate the outside message of sending out for the client, enterprise sends out message system 112 user's the notif iotaer that exists is offered the outer message handling system 135 (470A) of client's fire wall 125 subsequently.Message handling system 135 is with new destination address, and preferably client terminal IP address (472A) is replaced in the address of message handling system 135 itself.By this way, to or will be routed by message handling system 135 from the synchronization message at client terminal 130 places.After replacing the address, message handling system 135 will exist notif iotaer to be forwarded to the outside message server 155 (474A) of sending out.
[00035] still with reference to Fig. 4 A, have notif iotaer in case receive, an outside message server 155 changes user's state into " online " (476A).Next, the outside contacts list (478A) of sending out message server 155 from its inner database 165 these users of retrieval.The outside message server 155 of sending out will exist notif iotaer to offer each contact person (480A) in this user's the tabulation subsequently.In addition, send out the contact person who also is indicated as " online " in the message server 155 in user's the tabulation each in this outside, the outside message server 155 of sending out also provides back to the user at client terminal 130 places by message handling system 135 and has notif iotaer (482A).At this point, the user at client terminal place is ready to the third party outer with being positioned at client's fire wall and carries out the outside operation (484A) of sending out message.This makes the client terminal activation of sending out message system at enterprise finish (460A).
[00036] as previously mentioned, can be to various message event application strategies, described message event comprise for example outwards exist the reception of notif iotaer, inwardly exist notif iotaer reception, flow into the reception of synchronization message, the perhaps outwards reception of synchronization message.Therefore, in Fig. 5, described diagram wherein to the process flow diagram of the exemplary process of specific message event application strategy.This process begins (505) when message handling system inwardly receives or outwards send out message event (510).Although Fig. 5 and following description are to be received and handle by message handling system 135 with reference to sending out message event, described incident can also be sent out message system 112 by enterprise and receive and handle.Inwardly or outwards send out message event in case receive, message handling system 135 retrievals are corresponding to the source of this message event and/or the client of purpose/user's parameter (515).After this, message handling system 135 is permitted with respect to (against) client level and is tested this message event (520).If the permission of client's level also disapproves this incident (525), then message handling system 135 can stop this incident (530).If the permission of client's level is this message event of permission, then next message handling system permits this incident (535) of testing with respect to user's level.If the permission of user's level also disapproves this message event (540), then message handling system 135 stops this incident (530).If the permission of user's level is this incident of permission, then message handling system 135 is next to this event application recording parameters (545).As previously mentioned, these recording parameterses can comprise and put down in writing, file or keep a diary sending out a message event.Next, message handling system is to this event application content screening (550).At content and the process of Filter messages is more described on message ground with reference to Fig. 5 A below.If content is unacceptable (555), then to one of described messages application screening parameter (560).These screening parameters comprise notification message keeper (560A), stop and send out message event (560B), revision (redact) this incident (560C), this incident of lining up (560D), warning user (560E) and isolate this message event (560F).If it is acceptable that the content screening process is determined this message content, then this message will be forwarded to the recipient (recipient) (565) of expectation.At this point, finish (570) to the process of sending out the message event application strategy.The process that should be noted that test permission, application records parameter and application content screening can be carried out with any order, and is not only the order of describing among Fig. 5.
[00037] in Fig. 5 A, described and has been described below the exemplary process that is used to screen the content of sending out message event.(507A) (505A) outside to inside from customer network determine to send out message event for the content screening process.If it is inside sending out message event, then can carry out following reputation scoring step.At first, metadata is cliped and pasted (scrap) (510A) from flowing into message.This metadata can comprise corresponding to the IP address of the source of this message or purpose and corresponding to the sender or the recipient's of this message screen title.Handle this metadata to determine the reputation score (515A) of this message event with certain scoring algorithm.Can send out message system 112 by message handling system 135 or enterprise to the processing of metadata and carry out, depend on this customized configuration of a message system synchronously.As calculated behind the reputation score, send out message event application client/user's reputation policies (520A) based on this reputation score to what flow into.If this message event has been violated reputation policies (525A), then will as step 560 among Fig. 5 is described, use suitable screening parameter (530A) to this message event.Do not violate reputation policies if send out message event, then next assess actual message content (535A) at policy violation.
[00038] still with reference to Fig. 5 A, the operation of test real messages content comprises that text, the assessment of assessing specialized text messages are included in the hyperlink in the actual text message, perhaps uses other qualitative tests to determine whether it violates specific policy to message content.If message content is violated a strategy (540A) really, then will as described in the step 560 of Fig. 5, use suitable screening parameter (545A) to message content.If message content is not violated strategy, then assess annex (550A) at other policy violations (for example virus, spyware, unsuitable hyperlink or other Malwares).If attachments violate the strategy (555A), then will as in the step 560 of Fig. 5 the indication to the suitable screening parameter of messages application (560A).If annex is not violated strategy, then this message event is not violated any content strategy, and will be forwarded to purpose user (565A).At this point, the content screening process is finished (570A).
[00039] in Fig. 6, described corresponding to can be by its third party at synchronously sending out message the process flow diagram of the process of activated terminals.This process is in third party user's (610) beginnings (605) when messages application is sent out in the activation of third party's terminal 145 places.In case activate a messages application in third party's terminal 145, exist notif iotaer to send to message server 155 (615) by the Internet 115.Send out message server 155 and change this third party user's state into " online " (620).Send out message server 155 subsequently from sending out this third party user's of message server database retrieval designated contact (625).These contact persons can comprise the user who comes from the customer network.After this, sending out message server 155 provides to each contact person of this third party user and has notif iotaer (630).If the user from customer network is not this third party user's contact person's a part (635), then message handling system 135 will be without any need for movable (640).On the other hand, be this third party user's contact person's part if the user from customer network is arranged, then sending out message server 155 provides to the destination address corresponding to message handling system 135 and has notif iotaer (645).Have notif iotaer in case receive, message handling system 135 is retrieved the client/user's attribute (650) corresponding to this purpose user in customer network.Next, message handling system 135 application strategies are determined the rank (655) of sending out messaging activity that this user permitted.In Fig. 5, described to be used for to the exemplary process of sending out the message event application strategy.If send out message licensed (660), then message handling system 135 is retrieved the real ip address (665) corresponding to the purpose user in customer network.After this, message handling system 135 provides to the user at client terminal place that this third party user's exist notif iotaer (670).At this point, the user at client terminal 130 places is ready to participate in the synchronous of third party user and sends out in the message (675).Yet, if the outside message of sending out is not permitted by this client/user's strategy that this inwardly exists notif iotaer to be stoped (680) by message handling system 135.
[00040] in Fig. 7, described to be used for sending the exemplary process that flows out (outgoing) message in customer network.The user of this process in customer network is from client terminal 130 (710) (705) when another user sends synchronization message.Outflow message at first is sent to client's Internet server 120, and this Internet server 120 should flow out message and be redirected to message handling system 135 (715).In case receive this outflow message, message handling system 135 retrievals are corresponding to the user's of this transmission client and user's parameter (720).If purpose user also is the user of this message handling system 135, then can also retrieve purpose user's parameter.Next, message handling system 135 application strategies are determined the rank (725) of sending out messaging activity that this client user permitted.This step can comprise the strategy test described among Fig. 5 and Fig. 5 A and in the content screening process some or own.If source user or purpose user do not have the permission (730) to synchronization message, then this message is stoped (735) by message handling system 135.On the other hand, if this user has enough permissions to outwards sending out message, then message handling system should flow out forwards to purpose user (740).At this point, flow out message process and finish (745).
[00041] in Fig. 7 A, describes to send out the process flow diagram of the exemplary process that the user of message system is sent out from enterprise corresponding to flowing out message.(710A) (705A) when the purpose user sends message from client terminal the user who is positioned at customer network for this process.Message system 112 (715A) is sent out by the enterprise that this message at first is sent in client's fire wall 125.In case receive this message, client and the user parameter (720A) of message system 112 retrievals corresponding to this client/user sent out by enterprise.This can finish from message handling system 125 or from the database that enterprise is sent out the message system 112.The rank (725A) of sending out messaging activity that next message system 112 is determined to be permitted to this user's application strategy is sent out by enterprise.This step can comprise the strategy test described among Fig. 5 and Fig. 5 A and in the content screening process some or own.If the user does not have outwards sending out the permission (730A) of message, then this outside message is sent out message system prevention (735A) by enterprise.Yet message has permission and described message is not violated any strategy if this user is really to outwards sending out, and message system 112 is sent out by enterprise should flow out forwards to purpose user (740A).At this point, send out this outflow message process of the client/user in the message system at enterprise and finish (745A).
[00042] in Fig. 8, described to be used to handle the exemplary process that flows into message according to another embodiment.This process is in third party user's (810) beginnings (805) when the client user at client terminal 130 places sends synchronization message.Because client user's destination address has been replaced corresponding to the address of message handling system 135, so this message will be delivered to message handling system 135 rather than directly be delivered to client user.In case receive this inflow message (815), message handling system 135 retrievals are corresponding to this client user's client and user's parameter (820).Next, message handling system 135 rank (825) of sending out messaging activity determining to be permitted to this messages application strategy.This step can comprise the strategy test described among Fig. 5 and Fig. 5 A and in the content screening process some or own.Do not receive inflow message (830) if this client user does not have enough permissions, then should flow into synchronization message and be stoped (835) by message handling system 135.On the other hand, if this inflow message goes through, then message handling system will flow into forwards to this to the IP address (840) corresponding to this user's client terminal 130.At this point, flow into message process and finish (845).
[00043] in Fig. 8 A, described to handle the process flow diagram of the exemplary process that flows into message corresponding to enterprise message system 112.This process is sent out message system 112 in enterprise and is received (810A) beginning (805A) when sending out the inflow message of the client/user in the news network at this enterprise.Message system 112 is sent out at first from client and the user parameter (815A) of message handling system 135 retrievals corresponding to this purpose user by enterprise.As previously mentioned, these parameters can be stored in the message handling system 135, perhaps can be stored in enterprise and send out in the database of message system 112.Next, the rank (820A) of sending out messaging activity that message system 112 is determined to be permitted to this purpose client/user's application strategy is sent out by enterprise.This step can comprise the strategy test described among Fig. 5 and Fig. 5 A and in the content screening process some or own.If this client/user does not have the enough permissions to inside message, if perhaps this inside message violates content strategy (825A), then this inflow message is sent out message system 112 by enterprise and is stoped (830A).Yet, if this client/user has really permission and this inflow message of inwardly sending out message are not violated content strategy, message system 112 is sent out by enterprise will flow into the user (835A) of forwards to client terminal 130 places to this.At this point, send out the inflow message process of message system 112 at enterprise and finish (840A).
[00044] describes among Fig. 9 corresponding to sending out the process flow diagram that transmits the exemplary process of (pass) between the message system 112 in the enterprise of associating by its message.As mentioning with reference to Fig. 1 before, each among client A105 and the client B110 can have and is arranged in the enterprise that the client divides other network and sends out message system 112.Message handling system 135 can be by collecting and uniting the message of coming convenient these enterprises to send out between the message system 112 about the information of dividing other enterprise to send out message system 112 and share.Such information is stored in the database 140 of message handling system 135.Sending out the process of sharing message between the message system 112 in the enterprise of these associatings attempts sending message (910) (905) from the purpose user of client terminal in client B110 with the source user in the client A105.Message system 112 (915) is sent out by the enterprise that message at first sends in source client's fire wall 125.This enterprise send out message system 112 will from message handling system 135 or internally database retrieval depend on specific embodiment (920) corresponding to this source user's client and user's parameter.Message system 112 is sent out by enterprise should have strategy to determine the rank (925) of sending out messaging activity of being permitted to the source user subsequently.This step can comprise the strategy test described among Fig. 5 and Fig. 5 A and in the content screening process some or own.
[00045] if the source user does not have outwards sending out enough permissions of message, if perhaps this message violates content strategy (930), then this message is sent out message system 112 by the enterprise in the user's network of source and is stoped (935).Yet, if this source user has really permission and this message of outwards sending out message are not violated content strategy, message system 112 is sent out by the enterprise in the user's network of source should flow out forwards to message handling system 135 (940).Message handling system 135 is retrieved subsequently corresponding to this source and destination user's federation policies (945).Subsequently can be by message handling system 135 to described these federation policies of outflow messages application (950).If send out message between federation properties permission client, then message handling system 135 replaces with the source IP address in the message address (955) of message handling system 135.Message handling system 135 is sent out message system 112 (960) with this forwards to purpose enterprise subsequently.Message system 112 is sent out by purpose enterprise can use its strategy subsequently, and forwards is arrived appropriate purpose user (965).At this point, be used for sending out message system 112 and send out message system 112 to another enterprise and transmit the process of message and finish (970) from the enterprise of an associating.Can use the reverse transmission return messages of same procedure.
