Definitions
- This specification relates to Internet advertising.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, such as video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles. Access to these resources has provided opportunities for advertisements to be provided with the resources.
- web pages can include advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented.
- the advertisements slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page.
- advertisement slots may be provided in different categories of publishes (e.g., entertainment related websites, news related websites, political related websites, etc.).
- This specification describes technologies relating reporting for publishers and advertisers for on-line advertisements.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this′specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing impression data describing impressions of advertisements on publisher resources, wherein for each impression of an advertisement on a publisher resource, the impression data comprises: a publisher identifier that identifies a publisher on which the advertisement was impressed and publisher category identifiers identifying categories to which the publisher belongs, an advertiser identifier that identifies an advertiser of the advertisement and advertiser vertical identifiers identifying industry verticals to which the advertiser belongs, and attribute data describing the attributes of the impression, the attribute data comprising pricing data describing cost-related attributes of the impression, and interaction data describing user interaction events of the impression; receiving benchmark specification data defining a benchmark specification for one of the publishers or the advertisers, and further defining performance metrics based on the attributes of the impressions for the publisher or the advertiser and impressions of other publishers and other advertisers; and generating reporting data for displaying a benchmark report, the reporting data defining a report of performance metrics for one of the publishers or other advertisers
- the cross vertical publisher and advertiser report data can allow for analysis of display advertising metrics and for the derivation of benchmarks from the metrics based on the advertiser vertical of the advertiser and the publisher category of webpages on which the advertisements are displayed.
- the reports can also facilitate analysis of the following aspects: auction pressure for each category that the advertisement is appearing on and advertiser performance on each publisher category by advertiser vertical.
- the reports can also facilitate the provisioning of benchmark guidance to advertisers before the advertisers launch their campaigns, and for the provisioning of feedback as to how advertisers' campaigns are performing compared to their peers and across all advertisers in general.
- the reports can also facilitate scaled analysis of the different publisher and advertiser regions and countries to compare supply and demand levels across the advertising network.
- the report data can also be joined with other data in an advertising network, due to the presence of publisher and advertiser identifiers. Such joining can facilitate advertiser/publisher segmentation within the advertisement network based on patterns of spend or targeting (e.g., defining run-of-network buyers vs. category-exclusive buyers).

- a computer network 102 such the Internet, or a combination of the Internet and one or more wired and wireless networks, may connect syndication publishers 104 - 1 , a search engine publisher 104 - 2 , advertisers 106 , a user device 108 , and an advertisement management system 110 . Only one representative entity is respectively shown for the syndication publisher 104 - 1 and the advertiser 106 . However, the online environment 100 may connect many thousands of publishers and advertisers, as indicated by the phantom figures behind the syndication publisher 104 - 1 and the advertiser 106 .
- the user device 108 is an electronic device that may be under control of a user and may be capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 108 may typically include a user application, such as a web browser or other communication software, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- Each website is one or more resource 105 associated with a domain name, and each can be hosted by one or more servers.
- a resource is any data that can be provided by the web site over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources may include HTML pages, RSS feeds, and videos, for example.
- the resources 105 are represented as web pages; however, the representations of FIG. 1 are inclusive of all types of resources that are consistent with the above definition.
- each of the publishers may be in data communication with the advertisement management system 110 and together the publishers 104 and the advertisement management system 110 may facilitate the provisioning of advertisements with the publisher resources 105 .
- the advertisement management system 110 may allow advertisers to define targeting rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to provide targeted advertisements for the users.
- publishers 104 may also have targeting and restriction requirements for serving advertisements.
- the syndication publisher 104 - 1 can be a general content web site, e.g., a sports related web site, a news related web site, a social network web site, etc.
- a user device 108 receives a resource 105 - 1 from the syndication publisher 104 - 1 , the user device can render the webpage 105 - 1 .
- the webpage 105 - 1 can include instructions that cause the user device to request advertisements from the advertisement management system 110 .
- the advertisement management system 110 can provide targeted advertisements to the particular user.
- the user device 108 can generate a request for a landing page of the advertisement, which is typically a webpage 105 - 3 of the advertiser 106 .
- the search engine publisher 104 - 2 can be a search service that provides advertisements to users with search results that are responsive to user queries. Typically, the search results can be provided in one part of the page, such as the left-hand side, and the advertisements can be provided in another part of the page, such as the right-hand side of the page.
- the search engine publisher 104 - 2 provides the search results webpage 105 - 2 to the user device 108 , the user device can render the webpage 105 - 2 .
- the webpage 105 - 2 can include instructions that cause the user device to request advertisements from the advertisement management system 110 .
- the advertisement management system 110 in turn, can provide targeted advertisements to the particular user.
- the advertisement management system 110 can include a data storage system that stores advertiser data 112 , publisher data, and performance data 116 .
- the advertiser data 112 stores, for each advertiser 106 , campaign data that can include advertisements, targeting information, and budgeting information for advertiser 106 .
- the advertiser data 112 also can store vertical information that defines, for each advertiser 106 , industry verticals that the advertiser belongs to. For example, if an advertiser is a computer manufacturer and sells personal computers, the advertiser may be determined to belong to the categories of electronics, computers, and consumer goods.
- the associations of advertisers with verticals may be provided by the advertisers themselves, may be determined by the advertisement management system 110 , or may be provided by a third party.
- the publisher data 114 can store, for each publisher 104 , publisher identifiers, and for each resource the publisher 104 serves, categories that the resource are determined to belong to. For example, if the publisher is a website for classical music, the publisher resources may be determined to belong to the categories of entertainment and classical music.
- the associations of publishers with categories may be provided by the publishers themselves, may be determined by the advertisement management system 110 , or may be provided by a third party.
- the performance data 116 can store data indicating the performance of the advertisements that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for advertisements, the number of impressions for advertisements, and the number of conversions for advertisements.
- Some of the data stored in the advertiser data 112 , publisher data 114 and the performance data 116 can be used as input parameters to an advertisement auction. For example, advertisers' bids on keywords and advertisements, targeting data for the advertisements, and the historical performance of the advertisements can be used as input parameters to an advertisement auction.
- the advertisement management system 110 in response to each request for advertisements, can conduct an auction to select advertisements that are provided in response to the request.
- the advertisements can be ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in the performance data 116 .
- the performance data 116 can include impression data describing impressions of advertisements on publisher resources.
- an impression is the providing of an advertisement for presentation on a publisher resource (such as a webpage).
- the impression data can include a publisher identifier that identifies a publisher on which the advertisement was impressed and publisher category identifiers identifying categories to which the publisher belongs.
- the publisher identifier can also identify the particular webpage of the publisher on which the advertisement was shown, and the publisher category identifiers identify categories that particular webpage belongs to.
- the impression data can also include an advertiser identifier that identifies an advertiser of the advertisement, advertiser vertical identifiers identifying industry verticals to which the advertiser belongs, and attribute data describing the attributes of the impression.
- attributes can include pricing data describing cost-related attributes of the impression (e.g., a maximum bid that and advertiser bid for the impression, and actual cost of the impression, a bid type, the advertisement formats, and the like), interaction data describing user interaction events of the impression (e.g., whether the advertisement was clicked when displayed, moused over, or other interactions), and targeting information for the advertisement, a type of the advertisement.
- Other attribute data that describe one of more attributes of the advertiser, publisher, and the advertisement that was impressed on the publisher webpage can also be stored in the impression data.
- the impression data can store a record that details information about the impression, the advertiser, and publisher.
- the advertisement management system 110 can include reporting subsystem 120 that accesses the impression data to generate different types of benchmark reports that detail the relative performance for publishers and advertisers.
- the relative performance and related performance metrics can be based on the attributes of the impressions for the publisher or the advertiser and impressions of other publishers and other advertisers.
- FIGS. 2A-2C are block diagrams example report types based on different benchmark specifications.
- a benchmark specification may define a reference by which other advertisers and/or publishers can be measured or judged.
- FIG. 2A illustrates an example report format 210 for a vertical performance specification for advertisers.
- the performance metrics may measure the performance of advertisers belonging to at least one vertical across publisher categories. These types or reports may be most useful when the advertiser objective is to measure the value of the advertisement management system 110 , or when the advertiser wants to expand its advertising into the advertisement management system 110 , or when the advertiser wants to advertise on the most effective publishers (according to particular performance metrics).
- the reports may also be informative for the entity that manages the advertisement management system, as it indicative of a macro-state of an auction.
- the impression data may be used to derive vertical performance metrics across publisher categories. Examples of such reports are shown in FIGS. 4-6 .
- FIG. 2B illustrates an example report format 220 for an advertiser performance specification for an advertiser in a vertical.
- the performance metrics may measure the performance of advertisers belonging to the vertical across publisher categories. These types of reports may be most useful when the advertiser wants to determine whether an advertisement campaign performance meets the campaign goals, or the advertiser wants to compare its campaign performance against the performance of campaigns of its competitors.
- the impression data may be used to derive advertisement performance of the advertiser across vertical benchmarks, and are optionally filtered to the campaign goals of the advertiser. Examples of such reports are shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 .
- FIG. 2C illustrates an example report format 230 for a performance aspect specification for advertisers.
- the performance metrics may measure the performance of a performance aspect of targeted advertisements of advertisers belonging to a first vertical across publisher categories. These types or reports may be most useful when the advertiser objective is to identify the effective targeting types for its advertisements and/or campaign, wants to identify effective advertisement format types, or wants to target users most effectively.
- the impression data may be used to derive advertisement performance across targeting type benchmarks, advertisement format type benchmarks, and vertical performance across publisher categories. The data can be optionally filtered by campaign types.
- the performance aspect can include geographic regions, targeting types (e.g., contextual, placement, publisher categories (or advertiser verticals), and advertisement formats, to name just a few. Examples of such reports are shown in FIGS. 9-13 .
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for generating report data for a benchmark report.
- the process 300 can be performed in the reporting subsystem 120 of FIG. 1 .
- the process 300 may access impression data describing impressions of advertisements on publisher resources ( 302 ).
- the impression data may include, for each impression, a publisher identifier that identifies a publisher on which the advertisement was impressed and publisher category identifiers identifying categories to which the publisher belongs, an advertiser identifier that identifies an advertiser of the advertisement and advertiser vertical identifiers identifying industry verticals to which the advertiser belong, attribute data describing the attributes of the impression.
- the process 300 may receive benchmark specification data defining a benchmark specification for one of the publishers or the advertisers ( 304 ). For example, data for vertical performance specification, an advertiser performance specification, or targeting specifications can be received.
- the process 300 may generate reporting data for displaying a benchmark report ( 306 ). Examples of such reports, and the underlying data, are described with reference to FIGS. 4-13 below.
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example competitor category report 400 .
- the report 400 can allow advertisers to evaluate their performance against other advertisers within the same vertical based on impression count.
- the report can be across publisher categories for performance metrics of advertisements of the advertiser belonging to the vertical and aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the vertical.
- Each record can include a field for a publisher category, competitors, the number of impressions the advertiser receives in a first geographic region (e.g., the United States), and a number of impressions the advertiser receives in a second region that is a sub-region of the first region (e.g., the state of California).
- the publisher category can correspond to the category of webpages (or, alternatively, publishers) on which respective impressions were attributed. For example, for resources that belong to the technology category, the portion of the percentage of the overall number of impressions that the advertiser's competitors received is 17.1%. Conversely, the advertiser received 13.3% of its total impressions on resources categorized as belonging to the technology category, and 5.6% of those impressions were received from client devices in the state of California.
- the data to create the report 400 can be generated by processing the impression data according to the benchmark specification.
- the benchmark specification can define aggregate performance metrics in terms of impressions for the advertiser's competitors, and aggregate performance metrics in terms of impressions of the advertiser in the United States, and the state of California.
- the sample data can indicate that the advertiser receives more impressions on entertainment related webpages than its competitors, and that the advertiser relies much more heavily on social networks as a traffic driver.
- the advertiser may decide to significantly alter its campaign strategy, to tune certain portions of its campaign strategy, or to leave the current campaign strategy largely intact.
- FIG. 5 is an illustration of an example performance differential report 500 .
- the report 500 can allow an advertiser in particular vertical to determine which publisher categories are targeted by its peers.
- the report can be across publisher categories for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to a set of verticals that include the vertical to which the advertiser belongs, and other verticals to which the advertiser does not belong (e.g., all verticals).
- the report can also include aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers that belong to the vertical.
- Each record in the report 500 can include a field for a publisher category, and one more differential comparisons that describe the targeting of publisher categories for multiple advertiser verticals relative to the particular advertiser vertical.
- an advertiser may be an automotive manufacturer, and may desire to compare the relative targeting of the publisher categories by advertisers in the automotive manufacturing vertical.
- the differential report 500 can have two example differential comparisons—an impression differential comparison and a click differential comparison.
- Each comparison can include a first column storing data for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the set of verticals, a second column storing data for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to a particular vertical, and a third column storing data for respective differences between the metrics of the first set of column and the second set of column.
- the impression differential comparison can include a field for the percentage of all advertisement impressions occurring on resources associated with the category, and the percentage of advertisement impressions that belong to advertisers of a vertical that occur on resources associated with the category.
- the final column can show the differential between the two values stored in the fields.
- advertisement click-throughs an interaction in which a user selects an advertisement.
- the sample data can indicate that automotive advertisers purchase a larger share of impressions on entertainment related sites relative to other advertisers overall.
- the overall click through rate of advertisements for automotive advertisers is nearly on par with the overall click through rate of advertisers overall for entertainment related sites. Accordingly, an advertiser can use this data to make advertising decisions.
- FIG. 6 is an illustration of an example of vertical performance report 600 .
- the report 600 can allow advertisers in a particular vertical to determine the performance of advertisers within its vertical across different publisher categories.
- the report can thus be across publisher categories for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers that belong to a vertical.
- Each record in the report 600 can include a field for a publisher category, and a set of column fields that can include and averaged leader metric for a particular performance metric, and other metrics, such as performance related metrics and cost related metrics.
- the category leader average can display the average number of a particular metric over particular time for one or more category leaders.
- the category leader average may be impressions over a weekly period.
- a category leader can be an advertiser in the particular vertical that meets the leader threshold, e.g., one of the top N advertisers in the particular vertical in terms of attributed impressions for the category.
- the performance related metrics can include the click through rate (CTR), the percentage of all impressions for the particular vertical in a publisher category attributed to the category leader, and the percentage of all clicks for the particular vertical and publisher category attributed to the category leader.
- CTR click through rate
- the cost related metrics can include the average cost per click (CPC), and the average cost per thousand impressions (CPM).
- CPC average cost per click
- CPM average cost per thousand impressions
- the vertical performance report 600 can be used to identify the most popular publisher categories were given vertical, identify high CTR or low CPC and CPM publisher categories, and can determine other characteristics of publisher categories relative to the particular vertical.
- FIG. 7 is an illustration of an example impression category report 700 .
- the report 700 can allow an advertiser belonging to a particular vertical to determine whether it is targeting the publisher categories that its competitors in the particular vertical are targeting, and how similar or different its targeting strategy is to (or from) its competitors' targeting strategy.
- the report can thus be across publisher categories for performance metrics of advertisements of an advertiser belonging to a vertical and aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the vertical.
- Each record in the report 700 can include a field for a publisher category, one or performance metrics and other performance related data aggregated for advertisements of advertisers belonging to the vertical, and one, or more performance metrics and other performance related data aggregated for the advertiser.
- the sample data can indicate that the advertiser may be underrepresented in certain publisher categories relative to its peers. Depending on the cost related metrics, the advertiser may decide to allocate additional budget to targeting in certain publisher categories.
- the sample data may also indicate where the advertiser is performing well relative to its peers in certain technology areas. For example, the sample data may indicate that the publisher category of “Local”, the advertiser is paying much less on an average cost per click and has a much higher click through rate than its competitors in the same category have. Accordingly, the advertiser may decide that no refinements to the campaign are necessary with respect to that particular publisher category.
- FIG. 8 is an illustration of an example advertiser benchmark report 800 .
- the report 800 can allow an advertiser to compare the performance of its advertisements to the performance of the advertisements of its peers within the same vertical and across publisher categories.
- Each record in the report can include a field for a publisher category, and can include a first set of fields that are specific to the advertiser, and a second set of fields that are specific to the vertical to which the advertiser belongs.
- the advertiser average and the category leader average fields respectively can display the average number of a particular metric over particular time for the advertiser and one or more category leaders.
- the advertiser may be included is a category leader, if the advertiser's performance metrics meet a category leader threshold for the particular publisher category. For example, the metrics may be an average number of impressions over a given period of time in each publisher category.
- the corresponding performance metrics can be the click through rate, the cost per click, and the cost per thousand impressions.
- the report 800 can allow an advertiser to quickly assess how its advertisements are performing relative to the advertisements of its peers in various publisher categories. Depending on performance metrics shown, the advertiser may decide whether to adjust an advertising campaign, or leave an advertising campaign intact. For example, the advertiser may identify opportunities in publisher categories in which the vertical performs relatively well and in which it is underrepresented. Likewise, the advertiser can determine best-performing publisher categories among its peers.
- FIG. 9 is an illustration of an example competitor format report 900 .
- the report 900 can allow advertisers to determine the relative performance of various advertising formats in its vertical.
- An advertising format can be a display format of a particular advertisement, e.g., text, video, image, etc.
- the report can thus be across advertisement formats for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of an advertiser belonging to the vertical and aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of other advertisers belonging to the vertical.
- the report 900 can include a first column that describes advertisement formats, a first set of columns describing aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the vertical, and a second set of columns describing aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of only the first advertiser.
- the sample data can include the click through rate, the average cost per click, and the cost per thousand impressions for each advertisement of a particular format.
- an advertiser can determine which advertisement format(s) performs the best for its vertical. Furthermore, if the advertiser is not using advertisements of the particular format, and advertisements of that particular format perform well in its vertical, then the advertiser may consider whether to include advertisements of the particular format in its campaign. For example, assume that video advertisements perform best in the particular vertical of the advertiser, but the advertiser is only using text and flash-based advertisements. A possible advertising strategy for the advertiser would be to expand its advertisements into the video format.
- FIG. 10 is an illustration of an example competitor targeting type report 1000 .
- the report 1000 allows advertisers to determine the relative performance of various targeting types in its vertical.
- a targeting type can be a targeting strategy.
- the contextual targeting strategy can target advertisements based on keywords and/or publisher categories.
- the placement targeting strategy can be a targeting strategy that involves identifying particular webpages and/or websites on which advertisements are to be impressed.
- a category targeting strategy can be a targeting strategy that is based on publisher categories.
- a targeting type can have subtypes, each of which is variations of the targeting type. As shown in court 1000 , there can be two subtypes—non-text and text.
- Non-text can refer to the targeting of non-text advertisements (e.g., videos, images, flash animations) and text can refer to the targeting of text advertisements.
- the report can be across targeting types for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of an advertiser belonging to a vertical and aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of other advertisers belonging to the vertical.
- the report 1000 can include a first set of columns 1010 storing data for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the first vertical, and a second set of columns 1020 storing data for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of only the advertiser.
- the sample data can indicate that contextual advertisements capture the vast majority of all category impressions (89%) and clicks (97%) within the vertical. Furthermore, assume that the click through rate of the contextual advertisements for the advertiser is approximately one-quarter of the click through rate of the contextual advertisements of advertisers within the vertical. This would indicate that the contextual advertisements of other advertisers in the vertical outperform the contextual advertisements of the advertiser. Accordingly, the advertiser would likely decide to adjust its keyword targeting strategy to improve its performance relative to that of its competitors.
- FIG. 11 is an illustration of an example publisher category report 1100 .
- the report 1100 can allow advertisers to identify which publisher categories attract its target audience.
- the reporting can be across publisher categories for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of an advertiser belonging to the first vertical.
- the aggregate performance metrics can be for all advertisers within the vertical of the advertiser.
- the report can include the average number of impressions over a given time, the percentage of all impressions for the vertical that the webpages belonging to the category received, the percentage of all clicks for the vertical that the advertisements shown on the webpage belonging to the category received, and other corresponding metrics, such as cost metrics.
- the categories can be sorted in descending order of impression percentages. Other sorts are also possible.
- the report can allow advertisers to better determine how optimize assets and target advertisements to categories where targeted users are found.
- FIG. 12 is an illustration of an example targeting type benchmark report 1200 .
- the report 1200 can allow an advertiser to determine the relative performance of various targeting types in its campaign to the performance of the various targeting types in its vertical.
- the report can be across targeting types of performance metrics for advertisements of the advertiser and the performance metrics of advertisements of other advertisers belonging to the vertical.
- FIG. 13 is an illustration of an advertisement format benchmark report 1300 .
- the report 1300 can allow an advertiser to determine the relative performance of various advertisement formats in its campaign to the performance of various advertisement formats in its vertical.
- the report can be across advertisement formats for performance metrics of advertisements of the advertiser and performance metrics of advertisements of other advertisers belonging to the vertical.
- the reports 1200 and 1300 can compare advertisers' performance to its vertical across multiple targeting types and advertisement formats. An advertiser can use these reports to identify the best performing targeting types in its vertical, assesses targeting strategy, identify the best performing advertising formats in its vertical, and identify new advertisement formats to use.
- the example reports described above are illustrative only, and other reports for performance metrics based on the attributes of the impressions for the publisher or the advertiser and impressions of other publishers and other advertisers across both publisher categories and advertiser verticals can also be used.

Description
- This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/422,570 titled “Cross-Vertical Publisher and Advertiser Reporting” filed Dec. 13, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- This specification relates to Internet advertising.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, such as video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles. Access to these resources has provided opportunities for advertisements to be provided with the resources. For example, web pages can include advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented. The advertisements slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page. In some cases, advertisement slots may be provided in different categories of publishes (e.g., entertainment related websites, news related websites, political related websites, etc.).
- There are many different campaign strategies that an advertiser can pursue. Some of the advertisement campaign strategies may be highly effective, while others may not. In some cases, it may be difficult for an advertiser to exploit opportunities that may exist across verticals and different publisher categories.
- This specification describes technologies relating reporting for publishers and advertisers for on-line advertisements.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this′specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing impression data describing impressions of advertisements on publisher resources, wherein for each impression of an advertisement on a publisher resource, the impression data comprises: a publisher identifier that identifies a publisher on which the advertisement was impressed and publisher category identifiers identifying categories to which the publisher belongs, an advertiser identifier that identifies an advertiser of the advertisement and advertiser vertical identifiers identifying industry verticals to which the advertiser belongs, and attribute data describing the attributes of the impression, the attribute data comprising pricing data describing cost-related attributes of the impression, and interaction data describing user interaction events of the impression; receiving benchmark specification data defining a benchmark specification for one of the publishers or the advertisers, and further defining performance metrics based on the attributes of the impressions for the publisher or the advertiser and impressions of other publishers and other advertisers; and generating reporting data for displaying a benchmark report, the reporting data defining a report of performance metrics for one of the publishers or other advertisers respectively relative to other publishers or advertisers and grouped by at least one respective publisher category or advertiser category. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. The cross vertical publisher and advertiser report data can allow for analysis of display advertising metrics and for the derivation of benchmarks from the metrics based on the advertiser vertical of the advertiser and the publisher category of webpages on which the advertisements are displayed. The reports can also facilitate analysis of the following aspects: auction pressure for each category that the advertisement is appearing on and advertiser performance on each publisher category by advertiser vertical. The reports can also facilitate the provisioning of benchmark guidance to advertisers before the advertisers launch their campaigns, and for the provisioning of feedback as to how advertisers' campaigns are performing compared to their peers and across all advertisers in general. The reports can also facilitate scaled analysis of the different publisher and advertiser regions and countries to compare supply and demand levels across the advertising network. The report data can also be joined with other data in an advertising network, due to the presence of publisher and advertiser identifiers. Such joining can facilitate advertiser/publisher segmentation within the advertisement network based on patterns of spend or targeting (e.g., defining run-of-network buyers vs. category-exclusive buyers).
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Overview
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example advertising environment in a computer network. Acomputer network 102, such the Internet, or a combination of the Internet and one or more wired and wireless networks, may connect syndication publishers 104-1, a search engine publisher 104-2,advertisers 106, auser device 108, and anadvertisement management system 110. Only one representative entity is respectively shown for the syndication publisher 104-1 and theadvertiser 106. However, theonline environment 100 may connect many thousands of publishers and advertisers, as indicated by the phantom figures behind the syndication publisher 104-1 and theadvertiser 106. - The
user device 108 is an electronic device that may be under control of a user and may be capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 108 may typically include a user application, such as a web browser or other communication software, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - The publishers 104 and, optionally, the
advertisers 106 may maintain websites. Each website is one or more resource 105 associated with a domain name, and each can be hosted by one or more servers. A resource is any data that can be provided by the web site over thenetwork 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources may include HTML pages, RSS feeds, and videos, for example. To avoid congestion in the drawings, the resources 105 are represented as web pages; however, the representations ofFIG. 1 are inclusive of all types of resources that are consistent with the above definition. - As will be described in more detail below, each of the publishers may be in data communication with the
advertisement management system 110 and together the publishers 104 and theadvertisement management system 110 may facilitate the provisioning of advertisements with the publisher resources 105. In particular, theadvertisement management system 110 may allow advertisers to define targeting rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to provide targeted advertisements for the users. Likewise, publishers 104 may also have targeting and restriction requirements for serving advertisements. - These targeted advertisements can be provided in many different properties, such as the properties of the syndication publisher 104-1 and the search engine publisher 104-2. The syndication publisher 104-1 can be a general content web site, e.g., a sports related web site, a news related web site, a social network web site, etc. When a
user device 108 receives a resource 105-1 from the syndication publisher 104-1, the user device can render the webpage 105-1. The webpage 105-1 can include instructions that cause the user device to request advertisements from theadvertisement management system 110. Theadvertisement management system 110, in turn, can provide targeted advertisements to the particular user. When a user selects an advertisement, theuser device 108 can generate a request for a landing page of the advertisement, which is typically a webpage 105-3 of theadvertiser 106. - The search engine publisher 104-2 can be a search service that provides advertisements to users with search results that are responsive to user queries. Typically, the search results can be provided in one part of the page, such as the left-hand side, and the advertisements can be provided in another part of the page, such as the right-hand side of the page. When the search engine publisher 104-2 provides the search results webpage 105-2 to the
user device 108, the user device can render the webpage 105-2. The webpage 105-2 can include instructions that cause the user device to request advertisements from theadvertisement management system 110. Theadvertisement management system 110, in turn, can provide targeted advertisements to the particular user. - The
advertisement management system 110 can include a data storage system that storesadvertiser data 112, publisher data, andperformance data 116. Theadvertiser data 112 stores, for eachadvertiser 106, campaign data that can include advertisements, targeting information, and budgeting information foradvertiser 106. Theadvertiser data 112 also can store vertical information that defines, for eachadvertiser 106, industry verticals that the advertiser belongs to. For example, if an advertiser is a computer manufacturer and sells personal computers, the advertiser may be determined to belong to the categories of electronics, computers, and consumer goods. The associations of advertisers with verticals may be provided by the advertisers themselves, may be determined by theadvertisement management system 110, or may be provided by a third party. - The
publisher data 114 can store, for each publisher 104, publisher identifiers, and for each resource the publisher 104 serves, categories that the resource are determined to belong to. For example, if the publisher is a website for classical music, the publisher resources may be determined to belong to the categories of entertainment and classical music. The associations of publishers with categories may be provided by the publishers themselves, may be determined by theadvertisement management system 110, or may be provided by a third party. - The
performance data 116 can store data indicating the performance of the advertisements that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for advertisements, the number of impressions for advertisements, and the number of conversions for advertisements. - Some of the data stored in the
advertiser data 112,publisher data 114 and theperformance data 116 can be used as input parameters to an advertisement auction. For example, advertisers' bids on keywords and advertisements, targeting data for the advertisements, and the historical performance of the advertisements can be used as input parameters to an advertisement auction. In particular, theadvertisement management system 110, in response to each request for advertisements, can conduct an auction to select advertisements that are provided in response to the request. The advertisements can be ranked according to a score that, in some implementations, is proportional to a value based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in theperformance data 116. - In some implementations, the
performance data 116 can include impression data describing impressions of advertisements on publisher resources. As used herein, an impression is the providing of an advertisement for presentation on a publisher resource (such as a webpage). For each impression of an advertisement on a publisher resource, the impression data can include a publisher identifier that identifies a publisher on which the advertisement was impressed and publisher category identifiers identifying categories to which the publisher belongs. As some publishers may provide varied content (e.g., a particular publisher may provide both sports related resources and news related resources), the publisher identifier can also identify the particular webpage of the publisher on which the advertisement was shown, and the publisher category identifiers identify categories that particular webpage belongs to. - For each impression, the impression data can also include an advertiser identifier that identifies an advertiser of the advertisement, advertiser vertical identifiers identifying industry verticals to which the advertiser belongs, and attribute data describing the attributes of the impression. Such attributes can include pricing data describing cost-related attributes of the impression (e.g., a maximum bid that and advertiser bid for the impression, and actual cost of the impression, a bid type, the advertisement formats, and the like), interaction data describing user interaction events of the impression (e.g., whether the advertisement was clicked when displayed, moused over, or other interactions), and targeting information for the advertisement, a type of the advertisement. Other attribute data that describe one of more attributes of the advertiser, publisher, and the advertisement that was impressed on the publisher webpage can also be stored in the impression data.
- Thus, for each impression of an advertisement on each publisher resource, the impression data can store a record that details information about the impression, the advertiser, and publisher. The
advertisement management system 110 can includereporting subsystem 120 that accesses the impression data to generate different types of benchmark reports that detail the relative performance for publishers and advertisers. As will be described in more detail below, the relative performance and related performance metrics can be based on the attributes of the impressions for the publisher or the advertiser and impressions of other publishers and other advertisers. - Benchmark Reports
-
FIGS. 2A-2C are block diagrams example report types based on different benchmark specifications. A benchmark specification may define a reference by which other advertisers and/or publishers can be measured or judged. There are many types of benchmark specifications, and each may define performance metrics based on the attributes of the impressions for the publisher or the advertiser and impressions of other publishers and other advertisers. - For example,
FIG. 2A illustrates an example report format 210 for a vertical performance specification for advertisers. The performance metrics may measure the performance of advertisers belonging to at least one vertical across publisher categories. These types or reports may be most useful when the advertiser objective is to measure the value of theadvertisement management system 110, or when the advertiser wants to expand its advertising into theadvertisement management system 110, or when the advertiser wants to advertise on the most effective publishers (according to particular performance metrics). The reports may also be informative for the entity that manages the advertisement management system, as it indicative of a macro-state of an auction. The impression data may be used to derive vertical performance metrics across publisher categories. Examples of such reports are shown inFIGS. 4-6 . -
FIG. 2B illustrates anexample report format 220 for an advertiser performance specification for an advertiser in a vertical. The performance metrics may measure the performance of advertisers belonging to the vertical across publisher categories. These types of reports may be most useful when the advertiser wants to determine whether an advertisement campaign performance meets the campaign goals, or the advertiser wants to compare its campaign performance against the performance of campaigns of its competitors. The impression data may be used to derive advertisement performance of the advertiser across vertical benchmarks, and are optionally filtered to the campaign goals of the advertiser. Examples of such reports are shown inFIGS. 7 and 8 . -
FIG. 2C illustrates anexample report format 230 for a performance aspect specification for advertisers. The performance metrics may measure the performance of a performance aspect of targeted advertisements of advertisers belonging to a first vertical across publisher categories. These types or reports may be most useful when the advertiser objective is to identify the effective targeting types for its advertisements and/or campaign, wants to identify effective advertisement format types, or wants to target users most effectively. The impression data may be used to derive advertisement performance across targeting type benchmarks, advertisement format type benchmarks, and vertical performance across publisher categories. The data can be optionally filtered by campaign types. - The performance aspect can include geographic regions, targeting types (e.g., contextual, placement, publisher categories (or advertiser verticals), and advertisement formats, to name just a few. Examples of such reports are shown in
FIGS. 9-13 . - Each of the report types above can also be pivoted so that publishers can receive similar data with respect to targeting, verticals and categories, and category performance. Thus, while the following description provides examples for advertiser reports, similar reports can also be provided for publishers.
-
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of anexample process 300 for generating report data for a benchmark report. Theprocess 300 can be performed in thereporting subsystem 120 ofFIG. 1 . - The
process 300 may access impression data describing impressions of advertisements on publisher resources (302). As described above, the impression data may include, for each impression, a publisher identifier that identifies a publisher on which the advertisement was impressed and publisher category identifiers identifying categories to which the publisher belongs, an advertiser identifier that identifies an advertiser of the advertisement and advertiser vertical identifiers identifying industry verticals to which the advertiser belong, attribute data describing the attributes of the impression. - The
process 300 may receive benchmark specification data defining a benchmark specification for one of the publishers or the advertisers (304). For example, data for vertical performance specification, an advertiser performance specification, or targeting specifications can be received. - The
process 300 may generate reporting data for displaying a benchmark report (306). Examples of such reports, and the underlying data, are described with reference toFIGS. 4-13 below. - Example Vertical Performance Reports
-
FIG. 4 is an illustration of an examplecompetitor category report 400. Thereport 400 can allow advertisers to evaluate their performance against other advertisers within the same vertical based on impression count. The report can be across publisher categories for performance metrics of advertisements of the advertiser belonging to the vertical and aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the vertical. Each record can include a field for a publisher category, competitors, the number of impressions the advertiser receives in a first geographic region (e.g., the United States), and a number of impressions the advertiser receives in a second region that is a sub-region of the first region (e.g., the state of California). - The publisher category can correspond to the category of webpages (or, alternatively, publishers) on which respective impressions were attributed. For example, for resources that belong to the technology category, the portion of the percentage of the overall number of impressions that the advertiser's competitors received is 17.1%. Conversely, the advertiser received 13.3% of its total impressions on resources categorized as belonging to the technology category, and 5.6% of those impressions were received from client devices in the state of California.
- The data to create the
report 400 can be generated by processing the impression data according to the benchmark specification. Here, for example, the benchmark specification can define aggregate performance metrics in terms of impressions for the advertiser's competitors, and aggregate performance metrics in terms of impressions of the advertiser in the United States, and the state of California. The sample data can indicate that the advertiser receives more impressions on entertainment related webpages than its competitors, and that the advertiser relies much more heavily on social networks as a traffic driver. Depending on the advertiser's current budget, short-term and long-term objectives, etc., the advertiser may decide to significantly alter its campaign strategy, to tune certain portions of its campaign strategy, or to leave the current campaign strategy largely intact. -
FIG. 5 is an illustration of an example performancedifferential report 500. Thereport 500 can allow an advertiser in particular vertical to determine which publisher categories are targeted by its peers. The report can be across publisher categories for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to a set of verticals that include the vertical to which the advertiser belongs, and other verticals to which the advertiser does not belong (e.g., all verticals). The report can also include aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers that belong to the vertical. - Each record in the
report 500 can include a field for a publisher category, and one more differential comparisons that describe the targeting of publisher categories for multiple advertiser verticals relative to the particular advertiser vertical. For example, an advertiser may be an automotive manufacturer, and may desire to compare the relative targeting of the publisher categories by advertisers in the automotive manufacturing vertical. - The
differential report 500 can have two example differential comparisons—an impression differential comparison and a click differential comparison. Each comparison can include a first column storing data for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the set of verticals, a second column storing data for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to a particular vertical, and a third column storing data for respective differences between the metrics of the first set of column and the second set of column. - For each publisher category, the impression differential comparison can include a field for the percentage of all advertisement impressions occurring on resources associated with the category, and the percentage of advertisement impressions that belong to advertisers of a vertical that occur on resources associated with the category. The final column can show the differential between the two values stored in the fields. A similar comparison can be provided for advertisement click-throughs (an interaction in which a user selects an advertisement).
- The sample data can indicate that automotive advertisers purchase a larger share of impressions on entertainment related sites relative to other advertisers overall. However, the overall click through rate of advertisements for automotive advertisers is nearly on par with the overall click through rate of advertisers overall for entertainment related sites. Accordingly, an advertiser can use this data to make advertising decisions.
-
FIG. 6 is an illustration of an example ofvertical performance report 600. Thereport 600 can allow advertisers in a particular vertical to determine the performance of advertisers within its vertical across different publisher categories. The report can thus be across publisher categories for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers that belong to a vertical. Each record in thereport 600 can include a field for a publisher category, and a set of column fields that can include and averaged leader metric for a particular performance metric, and other metrics, such as performance related metrics and cost related metrics. - The category leader average can display the average number of a particular metric over particular time for one or more category leaders. For example, the category leader average may be impressions over a weekly period. A category leader can be an advertiser in the particular vertical that meets the leader threshold, e.g., one of the top N advertisers in the particular vertical in terms of attributed impressions for the category.
- The performance related metrics can include the click through rate (CTR), the percentage of all impressions for the particular vertical in a publisher category attributed to the category leader, and the percentage of all clicks for the particular vertical and publisher category attributed to the category leader.
- The cost related metrics can include the average cost per click (CPC), and the average cost per thousand impressions (CPM). The values V for each cell in the cost related metrics can be determined from the underlying impression data aggregated over the vertical.
- The
vertical performance report 600 can be used to identify the most popular publisher categories were given vertical, identify high CTR or low CPC and CPM publisher categories, and can determine other characteristics of publisher categories relative to the particular vertical. - Example Advertiser Performance Reports
-
FIG. 7 is an illustration of an exampleimpression category report 700. Thereport 700 can allow an advertiser belonging to a particular vertical to determine whether it is targeting the publisher categories that its competitors in the particular vertical are targeting, and how similar or different its targeting strategy is to (or from) its competitors' targeting strategy. The report can thus be across publisher categories for performance metrics of advertisements of an advertiser belonging to a vertical and aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the vertical. - Each record in the
report 700 can include a field for a publisher category, one or performance metrics and other performance related data aggregated for advertisements of advertisers belonging to the vertical, and one, or more performance metrics and other performance related data aggregated for the advertiser. - The sample data can indicate that the advertiser may be underrepresented in certain publisher categories relative to its peers. Depending on the cost related metrics, the advertiser may decide to allocate additional budget to targeting in certain publisher categories. The sample data may also indicate where the advertiser is performing well relative to its peers in certain technology areas. For example, the sample data may indicate that the publisher category of “Local”, the advertiser is paying much less on an average cost per click and has a much higher click through rate than its competitors in the same category have. Accordingly, the advertiser may decide that no refinements to the campaign are necessary with respect to that particular publisher category.
-
FIG. 8 is an illustration of an exampleadvertiser benchmark report 800. Thereport 800 can allow an advertiser to compare the performance of its advertisements to the performance of the advertisements of its peers within the same vertical and across publisher categories. Each record in the report can include a field for a publisher category, and can include a first set of fields that are specific to the advertiser, and a second set of fields that are specific to the vertical to which the advertiser belongs. The advertiser average and the category leader average fields respectively can display the average number of a particular metric over particular time for the advertiser and one or more category leaders. The advertiser may be included is a category leader, if the advertiser's performance metrics meet a category leader threshold for the particular publisher category. For example, the metrics may be an average number of impressions over a given period of time in each publisher category. - For both the advertiser and the vertical fields, corresponding performance metrics can also displayed. In the
example report 800, the corresponding performance metrics can be the click through rate, the cost per click, and the cost per thousand impressions. Thereport 800 can allow an advertiser to quickly assess how its advertisements are performing relative to the advertisements of its peers in various publisher categories. Depending on performance metrics shown, the advertiser may decide whether to adjust an advertising campaign, or leave an advertising campaign intact. For example, the advertiser may identify opportunities in publisher categories in which the vertical performs relatively well and in which it is underrepresented. Likewise, the advertiser can determine best-performing publisher categories among its peers. - Example Performance Aspects Reports
-
FIG. 9 is an illustration of an examplecompetitor format report 900. Thereport 900 can allow advertisers to determine the relative performance of various advertising formats in its vertical. An advertising format can be a display format of a particular advertisement, e.g., text, video, image, etc. The report can thus be across advertisement formats for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of an advertiser belonging to the vertical and aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of other advertisers belonging to the vertical. - The
report 900 can include a first column that describes advertisement formats, a first set of columns describing aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the vertical, and a second set of columns describing aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of only the first advertiser. For example, the sample data can include the click through rate, the average cost per click, and the cost per thousand impressions for each advertisement of a particular format. - Based on the values, an advertiser can determine which advertisement format(s) performs the best for its vertical. Furthermore, if the advertiser is not using advertisements of the particular format, and advertisements of that particular format perform well in its vertical, then the advertiser may consider whether to include advertisements of the particular format in its campaign. For example, assume that video advertisements perform best in the particular vertical of the advertiser, but the advertiser is only using text and flash-based advertisements. A possible advertising strategy for the advertiser would be to expand its advertisements into the video format.
-
FIG. 10 is an illustration of an example competitor targetingtype report 1000. Thereport 1000 allows advertisers to determine the relative performance of various targeting types in its vertical. A targeting type can be a targeting strategy. For example, the contextual targeting strategy can target advertisements based on keywords and/or publisher categories. The placement targeting strategy can be a targeting strategy that involves identifying particular webpages and/or websites on which advertisements are to be impressed. A category targeting strategy can be a targeting strategy that is based on publisher categories. - Additionally, a targeting type can have subtypes, each of which is variations of the targeting type. As shown in
court 1000, there can be two subtypes—non-text and text. Non-text can refer to the targeting of non-text advertisements (e.g., videos, images, flash animations) and text can refer to the targeting of text advertisements. - The report can be across targeting types for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of an advertiser belonging to a vertical and aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of other advertisers belonging to the vertical. The
report 1000 can include a first set ofcolumns 1010 storing data for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of advertisers belonging to the first vertical, and a second set of columns 1020 storing data for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of only the advertiser. - The sample data can indicate that contextual advertisements capture the vast majority of all category impressions (89%) and clicks (97%) within the vertical. Furthermore, assume that the click through rate of the contextual advertisements for the advertiser is approximately one-quarter of the click through rate of the contextual advertisements of advertisers within the vertical. This would indicate that the contextual advertisements of other advertisers in the vertical outperform the contextual advertisements of the advertiser. Accordingly, the advertiser would likely decide to adjust its keyword targeting strategy to improve its performance relative to that of its competitors.
-
FIG. 11 is an illustration of an examplepublisher category report 1100. Thereport 1100 can allow advertisers to identify which publisher categories attract its target audience. The reporting can be across publisher categories for aggregate performance metrics of advertisements of an advertiser belonging to the first vertical. In some implementations, the aggregate performance metrics can be for all advertisers within the vertical of the advertiser. - For each publisher category, the report can include the average number of impressions over a given time, the percentage of all impressions for the vertical that the webpages belonging to the category received, the percentage of all clicks for the vertical that the advertisements shown on the webpage belonging to the category received, and other corresponding metrics, such as cost metrics.
- The categories can be sorted in descending order of impression percentages. Other sorts are also possible. The report can allow advertisers to better determine how optimize assets and target advertisements to categories where targeted users are found.
-
FIG. 12 is an illustration of an example targetingtype benchmark report 1200. Thereport 1200 can allow an advertiser to determine the relative performance of various targeting types in its campaign to the performance of the various targeting types in its vertical. The report can be across targeting types of performance metrics for advertisements of the advertiser and the performance metrics of advertisements of other advertisers belonging to the vertical. -
FIG. 13 is an illustration of an advertisementformat benchmark report 1300. Thereport 1300 can allow an advertiser to determine the relative performance of various advertisement formats in its campaign to the performance of various advertisement formats in its vertical. The report can be across advertisement formats for performance metrics of advertisements of the advertiser and performance metrics of advertisements of other advertisers belonging to the vertical. - The
reports - Additional Implementation Details
- The example reports described above are illustrative only, and other reports for performance metrics based on the attributes of the impressions for the publisher or the advertiser and impressions of other publishers and other advertisers across both publisher categories and advertiser verticals can also be used.
