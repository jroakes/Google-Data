Definitions
- This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for providing search results in response to an ambiguous search query provided by a user.
- WAP Wireless Application Protocol
- devices such as wireless telephones typically have a data input interface wherein a particular action by the user (e.g., pressing a key) may correspond to more than one alphanumeric character.
- WAP architechture is available at http://www1.wapforum.org/tech/documents/SPEC-WAPArch-19980439.pdf(“WAP 100 Wireless Application Protocol Architechture Specification”).
- the WAP user navigates to the search query page, and is presented with a form into which they input their search query.
- the user may be required to press multiple keys to select a particular letter.
- the user would select the letter “b” by pressing the “2” key twice, or would select the letter “s” by pressing the “7” key four times.
- the search engine receives the word or words from the user, and proceeds in much the same manner as if it had received the request from a desktop browser wherein the user employed a conventional keyboard.
- a method of providing search results to a user in response to an ambiguous search query includes generating a first index that associates (1) a first set of information of a first type with (2) documents that correspond to the first set of information.
- the first set of information is translated into a second set of information of a second type, based on mapping information.
- a second index is generated that associates, based on the mapping information, (1) the second set of information with (2) the documents.
- a search query of the second type is received, and search results are generated by comparing the search query to the second index. The user is then presented with these search results.

- a first document contains two entries—“car repair” and “car rental”—and is numbered “3” at its bottom.
- a second document contains the entry “video rental”.
- a third document contains three entries—“wine”, “champagne”, and “bar items”—and includes a link (or reference) to Document 2.
- the documents shown in FIG. 3 only contain alphanumeric strings of information (e.g., “car”, “repair”, “wine”, etc.).
- the documents could contain other types of information, such as phonetic, or audiovisual information.
- FIG. 4 a illustrates a conventional alphanumeric index, based on the documents shown in FIG. 3 .
- the first column of the index contains a list of alphanumeric terms, and the second column contains a list of the documents corresponding to those terms.
- FIG. 4 b illustrates how a conventional search engine, such as search engine 125 , would use the index illustrated in FIG. 4 a to provide search results in response to an alphanumeric search query.
- the alphanumeric query may be generated using a conventional alphanumeric keyboard or by using any conventional mechanism.
- search engine 125 receives an alphanumeric query, such as “car” (stage 410 ), and uses the alphanumeric index to determine which documents correspond to that query (stage 420 ).
- a conventional search engine 125 would use the index illustrated in FIG.
- FIG. 5 a illustrates a flow diagram, consistent with the invention, of a preferred technique for providing search results in response to a numeric search query, based on the documents and index shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 a , respectively.
- FIG. 5 a describes a particular technique for generating a numeric index based on the mapping of a standard telephone handset; but those skilled in the art will recognize that other techniques consistent with the invention may be used.
- an alphanumeric index is generated based on documents.
- the index shown in FIG. 4 a is generated based on the documents shown in FIG. 3 .
- the alphanumeric terms in the index are translated into their numeric equivalents using mapping information corresponding to a standard telephone handset, shown in FIG. 5 b .
- mapping information corresponding to a standard telephone handset, shown in FIG. 5 b .
- the letters “a”, “b”, and “c” each map to the number “1”, the letters “p”, “q”, “r”, and “s” each map to the number “7”, and so forth.
- the alphanumeric term “car” is translated into the numeric term “227” (“c” is mapped to “2”, “a” is mapped to “2”, and “r” is mapped to “7”).
- the other terms in the alphanumeric index are mapped to their numeric equivalents.
- the term “bar” also translates to “227”. “Champagne” translates to “242672463”, the term “3” translates into “3”, “items” to “48367”, “rental” to “736825”, “repair” to “737247”, “video” to “84336”, and “wine” to “8463”.
- a numeric index is generated based on the translated terms.
- An example of such a numeric index is shown in FIG. 5 c .
- the numeric term “8463” corresponds to Document 3, just as did its alphanumeric equivalent “wine”. Because the numeric index shown is more ambiguous than the alphanumeric index (due to the mapping technique used), the information derived from it may not be as precise as that derived from the alphanumeric index.
- the numeric term “227” corresponds to both Document 1 and Document 3; the alphanumeric equivalent “car”, however, only corresponds to Document 1; and the alphanumeric equivalent “bar” only corresponds to Document 3.
- a numeric search query is received, such as the query “227” or the query “8463.”
- the received numeric query is compared to the numeric index. Based on this comparison, search results are generated at stage 560 that identify documents that correspond to the numeric query. For example, the numeric index shown in FIG. 5 c reveals that Documents 1 and 3 correspond to the numeric query “227” and that Document 3 corresponds to the numeric query “8463”.
- the search results are provided to the user.
- the search results may not be as precise as with the alphanumeric index.
- the alphanumeric index shown in FIG. 4 a would yield Document 3 as a search result.
- This result is quite precise because it returns only the documents that correspond to (e.g., that contain) the term “car”.
- a user seeking the same information with an input device having the mapping shown in FIG. 5 b would obtain less precise results. If such a user sought information about “car”, the user would enter “227”, and would obtain both Documents 1 and 3 as search results.
- Document 3 is not relevant because it is unrelated to cars; it is returned only because it corresponds to the term “bar”, which also maps to “227”.
- a user entering a numeric query of “8463” (corresponding to “wine”) would receive as a search result only Document 3, which is the only relevant document. This is because no other documents contain an alphanumeric term that maps to “8463”.
- the primary index used by search engine 125 may not be an alphanumeric index, but may instead be an index based on another type of information (such as numeric, phonetic, or audiovisual information); and the secondary index generated may not be a numeric index, but may instead be an index based on another information type.
- methods and apparatus consistent with the invention could generate a single index that contains information of the same type as that employed at the user's input device. Rather than obtaining a first set of information of a first type from a primary index, for example, this single index could be created by obtaining the first set of information of a first type directly from the documents that are to be searched.
- mapping technique that is used to translate between the information type of the primary index (the “first information type”) to the information type of the secondary index (the “second information type”) be the same technique that is employed at the user's input device to map between the first Information type and the second information type. There may, however, be instances where it is preferable to use a different mapping technique for the indices than is used for user input.
- the foregoing description focuses on alphanumeric and numeric types of information, those skilled in the art will recognize that other types of information may be used consistent with the invention.
- the foregoing description describes an implementation where a separate numeric index is generated. In other implementations consistent with the invention, however, the numeric equivalents may be associated with their corresponding alphanumeric terms in a single index.
- the foregoing description is based on a client-server architecture, but those skilled in the art will recognize that a peer-to-peer architecture may be used consistent with the invention.
- the described implementation includes software, the invention may be implemented as a combination of hardware and software or in hardware alone.
