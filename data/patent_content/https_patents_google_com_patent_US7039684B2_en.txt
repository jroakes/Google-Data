Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to the field of Internet multimedia content service. More particularly, the invention provides a system and method for incorporating multimedia items into an Internet website by combining a customized publisher web page with still picture image, audio or video multimedia items.
- a multimedia item includes, by way of example only, a digital movie trailer, a piece of a digital song, a short promotional multimedia “teaser”, or even a longer multimedia item.
- Aggregators of digital content develop sites which aggregate content. However, aggregators ordinarily do not distribute or syndicate the content. Furthermore, searching for content among various sites which aggregate content can be unwieldy. Each search performed returns dozens of links to individual pieces of multimedia (related or unrelated). Sites which contain aggregated content principally are therefore destination sites.
- Streamsearch One example of a conventional business to consumer multimedia aggregator site is Streamsearch.
- Streamsearch has agreements with multimedia providers whereby it showcases the provider's audio and video content in its search engine.
- Streamsearch has a vast array of searchable multimedia content, all to be viewed at Streamsearch.com.
- Streamsearch does not distribute. It is a typical business-to-consumer site, where users can go to listen or view multimedia.
- iSyndicate one such flat content syndication site, provides text content to sites.
- iSyndicate provides sites with bundled content packages ranging from a Rollingstone.com music search box provided by Rolling Stone to a stock ticker quoting system provided by Quote.com to an article provided by the New York Times.
- iSyndicate has arrangements with over 350 content Providers and services a network of over 100,000 sites.
- iSyndicate Express is a product, in which iSyndicate provides content, and a customized hyperlink to be embedded in the Publisher website.
- Screaming Media Another conventional company in the flat content syndication market is Screaming Media.
- the company receives news articles and other proprietary content from provider sites.
- Screaming Media then distributes this content to registered subscriber websites based on a profile.
- Screaming Media charges both providers and subscriber websites for content distribution and proprietary content enhancement respectively.
- Reuters.com is an example of a specific multimedia syndicator. Their multimedia service focuses on top general-interest news, such as a Presidential summit or an earthquake. Major breaking stories are updated throughout the day. Online text news reports plus complementary multimedia content is delivered in ready-to-use, graphically designed, HTML pages, so publisher sites do not have to invest in the infrastructure or staffing of a newsroom.
- the Reuters.com service is only their news, albeit an excellent but extremely expensive service.
- VideoAXS receives generic news stories & syndicates them out to Newspaper websites.
- VideoAXS displays the video in a custom pop-up window, but the customization process is not automated and the content offering is fixed and limited.
- Another new multimedia syndication service is Lineup.com. Lineup has categories such as movies & music, but very little content. Once again (as with every service on the Internet) the content displayed on the site is the only option. There is no ability for their clients to obtain all of the audio & video they need to compliment their sites.
- the Internet multimedia subsector is still largely fragmented, highly specialized, and lacks any commercial and uniting infrastructure.
- existing sites are media specific, and require informed Users to seek out specific sites to view multimedia.
- the average User will frequent their daily newspaper or weekly magazine when on the Internet.
- One advantage of the present invention is its distribution model. Conventional sites are media specific, and require informed users to seek out specific sites to view multimedia items.
- the invention will provide publishers with an infrastructure network to readily obtain multimedia from providers that will enhance information and presentation on publisher websites.
- Another advantage of the invention is that it offers a customizable presentation of every element for seamless site integration.
- the present invention avoids the failing of the prior art by providing a flexible content management tool, customizable multimedia box, and seamless integration without requiring storage of any multimedia on the publisher server.
- a method and system for providing a computerized collection of multimedia content provided by providers, to publishers An identification of digital content to be included in the system is received, and, responsive thereto, a link to the content is stored in a multimedia item record.

- the HTML code is generated by combining the unique multimedia item number for the selected multimedia item, with the publisher's multimedia box file. This enables the selected multimedia item to be provided in the customized format preferred by the publisher. In the preferred embodiment, pressing “Select Code” selects the entire hyperlink to make it easier to copy.
- the publisher copies the selected link and pastes this link into the HTML code of his own site for example, near the review for the Multimedia item.
- the link is an icon previously specified by the publisher. The link that was pasted then will look like the video/audio icon (or the text) that publisher has specified in the Media Link information section of the registration form.
- the chosen multimedia box opens again, preferably as a small java window, playing the multimedia item, such as a video, supplied by the multimedia provider and looking as the Publisher specified in the customized multimedia box section of the registration form.
- registration 503 is required for each new provider.
- the provider visits the system Homepage, indicates that it wishes to register or “Join”, and then indicates indicate that it is a provider, e.g. “I want to distribute my multimedia through the system”.
- the system then requests registration information such as contact information, identification information, and custom selections, from the provider.
- registration information such as contact information, identification information, and custom selections, from the provider.
- information includes, for example:
- a new provider record 417 is created and this information is stored in the user database 419 .
- both publisher records and provider records are stored in a same database. This is efficient since the contact information and company information fields of the respective records have the same format. Alternatively, publisher records and provider records could be stored in separate databases.
- a provider may wish to make content 405 available to the system. This assumes that the content 405 is accessible via a network.
- the content to be added will be correlated to a multimedia item 409 .
- the provider is prompted for information relevant to the item. For example, in the preferred embodiment, the provider is prompted to fill out the following:
- each record 409 is given a unique number that will serve to identify the information used to populate the Multimedia box viewed or accessed from the Publisher's page.
- the multimedia box 507 is created by combining or merging the multimedia items 409 and the empty multimedia box, as specified by the aesthetic information in the publisher record 421 .
- the following procedures run:
- the system generates a URL for the publisher multimedia box 507 , together with the unique id number of the multimedia item.
- the system uses the information from the two databases (the multimedia item database and the multimedia box database) and to create a new multimedia box 507 record.
- this new multimedia box 507 is created after each call, such that the contents are built on the fly and are as current as possible.
- Aesthetic Information describes the qualities and appearance of a customized box, link or button.
- aesthetic information means, for example, specific font style, font colors, link colors and background colors.
- aesthetic information also includes deep linked logos, buttons and pictures from the user website.
- Deep Link The term deep link will be used to describe a direct link to a multimedia item. In the preferred embodiment, it includes media specific, HTML links.
- An example of a typical, non-deep HTML link would be: http://www.Batman.com. That link would bring an end user to the Batman.com website.
- An example of a deep link would be: http://www.Batman.com/video/scenel.ram. That deep link will access the Real Media stream for “scene 1 ” directly. Note that the end user utilizing the deep link typically would not arrive at the Batman.com website home page.
- End User refers to any person visiting a publisher website, and ultimately accessing the provide multimedia item.
- menubox refers to a container of multiple multimedia boxes corresponding to the same publisher.
- the menubox has attributes analogous to the multimedia box, but differs in that it acts as a menu for all (or a partial collection) of a particular publisher's multimedia boxes. For example, one publisher might have ten multimedia boxes, each corresponding to one of ten different bands, movies, etc.
- the menubox presents to the end user a menu of the included multimedia boxes, and simply prompts the end user to choose one of the ten. Once this choice is made, the end user is taken to the specific multimedia box of choice.
- Multimedia box refers to a window, preferably a small browser window, from which the deep linked media content is directly or indirectly accessible, and its supporting data structures.
- JavaScript causes the multimedia box to open to roughly 460 ⁇ 200 pixels and removes all toolbars and such from the browser window (much like a pop-up banner advertisement or help window). Because the multimedia box is so small relative to the site, the publisher site substantially is in full view behind it. Additionally, because the aesthetic information such as background color, font, font color and link colors have been specified by the publisher, the end user feels as if he or she has never left the publisher website. An example of what a multimedia box might offer to the end user would be a picture, an audio clip and a link back to the provider's site.
- the “Multimedia Button” is the customizable button, received at checkout, that opens the multimedia box on the publisher site.
- the system receives media from the provider, preferably in the form of links or references to the media, most preferably in the form of HTML deep links; combines the received media references with the aesthetic information supplied by the publisher and creates the multimedia box.
- Multimedia item In the context of this description, the term multimedia will be used to describe any text or non-text, internet-based media content. This includes without limitation digital still images (.jpg and .gif formats to name a few), audio (Real Media streams, Windows Media streams and mp3 downloads to name a few), and video (Real Media streams, Windows Media streams and QuickTime downloads to name a few).
- the invention is sufficiently flexible to adapt to additional internet-based media.
- the term provider refers to any web entity wishing to distribute its own multimedia content to other websites, for reasons such as to promote its own website, product, etc.
- a typical provider would be a band, movie studio, news service, TV network, etc.
- Publisher refers to any web entity wishing to receive multimedia content to be added to its current website.
- a publisher could be an online magazine, movie review, etc. which would benefit from readily referencing the content from its site. For example, an online movie review would benefit from a link to a short promotional preview of a movie.
- Example 1 (and subsequent examples) will involve the hypothetical publisher.com (a potential publisher, who among things offers weekly newspapers); and Provider.com, a provider of music and movies.
- Example 1 concerns the addition of a provider's multimedia items to a publisher's web site through the end-user access on the publisher's web site.
- the preferably open nature of the system permits it to be used in any situation involving multimedia.
- the following example will illustrate how a music venue, The Elbow Room, can accept and post audio for a local band, Adam & the Aunts, with an upcoming show.
- Every publisher that registers and contributes to the system provides a venue to distribution of content to self-targeted end users; and every provider that registers and contributes geometrically increases the usefulness of the system and attractiveness to end-users.
- ID The following are example registration forms, and are not meant to be limitative.
- the “username” and “password” protects the privacy of the publisher or provider.
- the “E-mail address” gives the system the ability to contact the publisher or provider directly.
- “State” is an example of demographic data that helps the system to track the publishers or providers for targeting advertisements, etc.
- the system may provide a menu listing, for example, “Please Select The Media You would Like to Receive”: This is preferably a dropdown menu that allows for fully customizable content. By selecting certain categories, genres and states, for example, the publisher will receive only media applicable to its website.
- the system provides the option “Only people who sign Up through my site”.
- the publisher or provider has the option to receive only media submitted via the button on its own site. This provides a specific way to receive multimedia and a definitive way of insuring that the publisher's or provider's media is applicable.
- Site Name will be included in the heading on the Main Menu Multimedia box, for example, “Welcome to the [Site Name] Multimedia Library”
- BG Color specifies the background color for the publisher's multimedia boxes.
- “Font Color” specifies the font color for the publisher's multimedia boxes.
- A-Link specifies the pre-clicked link color for the publisher's multimedia boxes.
- V-Link specifies the post-clicked link color for the publisher's multimedia boxes.
- the specified data may be applied across each of the publisher's multimedia boxes.
- FIG. 2B In a preferred “Add YOUR Media” form, FIG. 2B :
- a prompt may be provided, to specify the subcategory where the system is to place the finished Multimedia box.
- State or “Region” or similar should be included to provide the system with one of several categories in which to place the finished Multimedia box.
- the URL of the website should be indicated to provide a link back to the provider's website. Also, the URL of a related picture may be indicated to provide an address to the picture, thereby allowing the system to display the provider's picture without having to store the image locally.
- this Name of the Multimedia Item is displayed below the Multimedia box title, so that an end users knows what piece of media he or she is to hear/view.
- the URL of the multimedia item should be included to permit the system to play the provider's audio/video without having to store the media locally.
- the software for the system may be readily implemented via the commercially available FOXPRO software program.
- the databases may readily be implemented via the commercially available FOXWEB database software program.
- the system may be run on commercially available general purposes computers on conventional operating systems, such as on WINDOWS NT. Other database programs and operating systems may readily be used.
Abstract
Description
-
- The publisher process.
- The provider process.
- The creation of a multimedia box process.
-
- Contact Information (Username, password, First Name, Last Name, E-mail, Phone);
- Company Information (Company Name, Company URL, Address, City, State, Zip, Type of Site, e.g. newspaper, portal, etc. and Subcategory related to the Type of Site, e.g., weekly, daily, etc.); and
- Customize Multimedia box—aesthetic information (Font, Logo URL, Background color/URL, Call Tag, Font Color, Menu Background Color, Menu Font Color, Dropdown Color, Dropdown Font Color).
- 1. The publisher logs onto the system, preferably using its username and password. This calls a search to be performed to find and verify the publisher's record on the database.
- 2. The publisher may then select the multimedia items to appear on the publisher's site. According to the menu box option, the system displays a list of multimedia items which historically have been added to the publisher's menu box. Preferably, the system displays a default list of multimedia items. In the most highly preferred embodiment, the publisher is then brought to a publisher archive page specific to the publisher which shows every multimedia item which the publisher has ever selected and checked out. However, the listing could be done in any of a number of ways, including displaying only current multimedia items. In sum, Publishers simply select everything that they would like to appear on their site and it appears in the menu box. This step may be omitted.
- 3. The publisher then is prompted by the system to select from the list of searchable categories. Categories include, for example, art, movies, music, news, books, TV, Theater, etc. Nevertheless, it is possible that categories can be expanded by users, and could potentially encompass any or all searchable fields in the multimedia item database, such, classifieds, personal ads, etc., and thus such examples are not considered to be limitative.
- 4. Once the publisher selects a category, in the preferred embodiment, a default search is performed, resulting in a listing to the publisher of all the multimedia items in that category added to the multimedia item database. The listing could be limited in time, for example, all multimedia items added in this category in the past week. Alternatively, a publisher might be looking for something more specific, involving multiple searchable fields, such as NY>Music>Punk>Added this week. As another alternative, a publisher might be searching for one specific item. The search result information preferably lists corresponding identification information, such as in the following manner: Name, Provider, Category, State, Date. The located items may be added to the publisher's cart.
- 5. The publisher may view the multimedia box corresponding to the located item(s) if desired, by clicking the underlined Name of the multimedia item in the search result information list, which will link to the multimedia item. In the preferred embodiment, the link contains javascript that opens a small pop-up window in accordance with known methods, to run/display the multimedia item.
- 6. In the preferred embodiment, the publisher has the option to refine the search result information list and/or search by one or all of the searchable fields, such as the following: Category (e.g. Only action Movies), Date (e.g. only movies added in the past 24 hours), State (e.g., only movies from NY), Keyword (e.g., searching specifically for a keyword).
- 7. The publisher may select a multimedia item from the search result information list. To choose a multimedia item from the search result information list in the preferred embodiment, the provider checks the checkbox next to the name of the multimedia item and presses “Add to Cart”. When a publisher checks the checkbox and Adds to Cart, he is creating a new record in a shopping cart database, in the usual manner, for that publisher.
- 8. In the preferred embodiment, the publisher may search for more multimedia items within the same category, search for multimedia items in another category, view his shopping cart or simply checkout, with the multimedia item/s that he has already chosen and which are in the shopping cart. Any available shopping cart techniques or program is appropriate.
- 9. Alternatively, Publishers can simply “Checkout” all of the multimedia selected, receive the code for each multimedia item and paste them all into their site separately.
-
- Contact Information (e.g., Username, password, First Name, Last Name, E-mail, Phone);
- Company Information (e.g., Company Name, Company URL, Address, City, State, Zip, Type of site and subcategory);
- Sales Information (e.g., do you have merchandise available at any of the following ______; Do you have tickets available at any of the following ______;)
-
- Multimedia box name (e.g., Fantasia)
- Category and Subcategory (e.g., Movies>>animation)
- Site URL for the
content 405 itself (e.g., http://www.Fantasia-Movie.com) - Name of Multimedia item 1 (e.g., Trailer)
- URLs of
multimedia item 1 in one or more, potentially varied, media formats (e.g., http://www.Fantasia-Movie.com/media/trailer.ram)
-
- Find CGI-BIN folder.
- Call database program in order to locate the multimedia item(s) 409 in the
multimedia item database 407, as specified in the call to the site. - Call multimedia box procedure, in order to merge the located multimedia item(s) 409 and the user's multimedia box as specified in the
publisher record 421. - Multimedia box procedure does a search of the multimedia
item data base 407 for the unique Multimedia item ID# - Multimedia box procedure gathers stored information from the
multimedia database 407 related to the unique Multimedia item ID # - Multimedia box procedure sends this related information to populate the unique
publisher multimedia box 507.
-
- 1. Reference is made to
FIG. 1A . The system requests the publisher to register. The information which Publisher.com is requested to provide includes contact information, and company information such as addresses and type of publication. Further, the system collects information specifying how the “Add Your Media” button will look on the publisher's site, if the default appearance is not selected. - 2. Reference is made to
FIG. 1B . The system prompts Publisher.com to design the look of its multimedia box. In the present example, Publisher.com specifies its logo and font; its background color or URL and font color; its menu settings including menu background color and menu font color; and its dropdown settings, including dropdown color and dropdown font color. - 3. Reference is made to
FIG. 1C . The system allows Publisher.com to search for multimedia items to be included in the cart. Items searched for were movies, and three movies were selected: “Dr. T and the Women”, “Like Water for Chocolate”, and “Requiem for a Dream”. Note that Publisher.com may continue to add to its cart, or checkout once it has completed its selection. - 4. Reference is made to
FIG. 1D . Here, Publisher.com has checked out the contents of its cart. As illustrated, the system provides links to the selected multimedia items. Here, the links are provided as URLs which may be cut and pasted into Publisher.com's website. - 5. Publisher.com then selects, copies and pastes the links into its site at the desired location.
- 6. Reference is made to
FIG. 6 . Provider.com notices a reference on the Publisher.com weekly paper web site. It views the “Add Your Media” or “Add Your Music” (or similar)multimedia button 601. In response to the invitation to add its media, it clicks thebutton 601, alogin window 603 is displayed, and the provider arrives at the system's “Add Media” page (Step 8 below). - 7. As explained above in connection with the “Provider Process”, Provider.com provides the system with registration on a registration page, further illustrated in
FIG. 2A . Here, Provider.com inputs its user name and desired password; contact information; and company information. - 8. Reference is made to
FIG. 2B , illustrating Provider.com adding new multimedia to the system. Here, the provider is prompted for basic information (generally allowing the system to categorize the multimedia); and for multimedia information, such as a name and various URLs for the multimedia. Here, a set of multimedia content is added relating to the science fiction movie “Star Wars”, including real video format, windows video format, and Quicktime format. - 9. Reference is made to
FIG. 2C , illustrating Provider.com's multimedia archive. The archive lists all multimedia that Provider.com has added. Here, the archive include the movie “Star Wars”, and music “Novena”, “Rocket Martin”, and “The Nerve”. The multimedia items in the archive may be deleted, or information about any one of the multimedia items may be edited. - 10. Reference is made to
FIG. 2D , illustrating the filter, where a provider may specify one or more publishers which receive the provider's multimedia items. Here, Provider.com has specified that “Ulster Publishing” is authorized to receive Provider.com's multimedia items. - 11. The next time a Publisher.com end-user clicks the “View Multimedia” (or similar) button the relevant portions of the publisher and provider databases are merged. Reference is made to
FIG. 3 , showing an example. Publisher.com has a website offering an online newspaper. The newspaper includes a review of the movie “Traffic”. Utilizing the methods discussed above, Publisher.com has embedded a “WATCH A CLIP” button at a relevant spot in the movie review. When the end-user clicks the button, the system follows the link to the multimedia content location and displays the content (here, the official trailer in QuickTime).
- 1. Reference is made to
-
- 1. Adam & the Aunts (the provider) notices a reference on the ElbowRoom.com web site. They view the “Add YOUR Music” multimedia button. In response to the invitation to add their media, they click the button and arrive at the system's “Add Media” page.
- 2. As explained above in connection with the “Provider Process”, Adam & the Aunts provides the system with registration information on a registration page. Here, Adam & the Aunts input their user name and desired password; contact information; and company information.
- 3. Adam & the Aunts adding is prompted for basic information (generally allowing the system to categorize the multimedia); and for multimedia information, such as a name and various URLs for the multimedia. Adam & the Aunts adds a set of multimedia content relating to their band, including real audio format, mp3 format and a jpg photograph.
- 4. In this case the provider chooses not to activate their filter. This choice makes their music available to every member of the system.
- 5. The next time an ElbowRoom.com end-user clicks the “View Multimedia” (or similar) button, the relevant portions of the publisher and provider databases are merged.
