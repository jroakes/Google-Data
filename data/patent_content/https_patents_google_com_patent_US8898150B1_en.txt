Definitions
- This specification relates to collecting and compiling information regarding search operations.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources such as image files, audio files, video files, and web pages.
- a search system can identify resources in response to a text query that includes one or more search terms or phrases.
- the search system ranks the resources based on their relevance to the query and on measures of quality of the resources and provides search results that link to the identified resources.
- the search results are typically ordered for viewing according to the rank.
- the search system may also rank resources based on the performance of the resource with respect to the particular query. For example, some conventional search systems rank resources having a high click-through rate for the particular query higher than resources having a lower click-through rate for the particular query.
- Some conventional search systems rank resources having a high click-through rate for the particular query higher than resources having a lower click-through rate for the particular query.
- the general assumption under such an approach is that queries are often an incomplete expression of the information needed, and the user's action of selecting a particular resource is a signal that the resource is at least as responsive to, or more responsive to, the user's informational need that the other identified resources.
- This specification describes technologies relating to collecting and compiling information regarding search operations.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of accessing a query log that stores search event data items for identifiers, each search event data item including: information regarding a search event, a time stamp specifying a time and date at which the search event occurred; and an identifier associated with the search event; identifying a proper subset of the search event data items, the proper subset of search event data items being search event data items for search events related to an image search; identifying a proper subset of the plurality of identifiers, the proper subset of identifiers being identifiers associated with at least one search event data item for a search event related to an image search; and generating, for each identifier of the proper subset of identifiers, at least one image search session data object using the proper subset of search event data items, each image search session data object being for a particular time period and including information regarding image search events derived from the proper subset of search event data items that include the identifier and that occurred
- Each search event can include at least one of receiving a search query, providing search results in response to a search query, receiving information identifying an interaction with a search result provided in response to a search query, and receiving information identifying an interaction with a web browser window presenting search result provided in response to a search query.
- the information identifying an interaction with a search result provided in response to a search query can include one of information identifying a selection of a search result and information identifying a hover over a search result by a pointer element.
- the information identifying the interaction with the search result further can include a time duration value specifying a time duration of the interaction.
- Each image search session data object for an identifier can include a time ordered list of query data items.
- Each query data item can be for a particular search query received from a device associated with the identifier and can include information identifying the received search query and information identifying search results provided in the response to the received search query.
- Generating an image search session data object for an identifier can include: identifying each search event data item of the proper subset of search event data items that is associated with the identifier and further associated with an particular search query; extracting information from each identified search event data item; and generating a query data item for the particular search query using the extracted information.
- Generating an image search session data object for an identifier further can include: determining whether an identified search event data item includes information identifying an interaction with a search result provided in response to receiving the particular search query; and creating an interaction data item as part of the query data item.
- the interaction data item can identify the search result receiving the interaction.
- the interaction data item can include information identifying a type of interaction, the type of interaction being one of a selection of the search result and a hover of a pointer element over the search result.
- the interaction data item can include a location within a viewport of the search result receiving the interaction.
- the interaction data item can include a time stamp specifying a time and date at which the interaction began.
- Each query data item can include information identifying a viewport location for each provided search result.
- the viewport location defining a presentation location of the search result within a viewport.
- Each query data item can include a location value for each provided search result.
- the location value can specify a page number, column number, and row number for which the provided search result is presented.
- Each query data item can include, for each search result provided in response to the search query of the query data item, information specifying whether the search result was presented to a user.
- the information specifying whether a search result was presented to a user can be determined based on a viewport location for the search result and whether that viewport location was presented to the user.
- Each query data item comprises location information specifying a location of a pointer element when the search results were initially provided in response to the query.
- aspects can further include: identifying, using image search session data objects for the identifiers, each unique search query represented in the image search session data objects; identifying, for each unique query, each query data item associated with the unique query; and generating a query record for each identified search query, the query record including information extracted from each query data item associated with the identified search query.
- Information stored in query logs can be parsed to identify search events directed to an image search to facilitate the processing of search information for image search operations.
- Information regarding searches directed to images can be compiled into image session objects that each store a time ordered sequence of image search events associated with an identifier, thus providing image-search relevant data in a compact form to facilitate further processing.
- the information can include information describing user interactions with search results and user interfaces that present the search results to facilitate analysis of user interactions in the context of a two-dimensional display of image search results.
- the user interaction information can include information regarding a pointer element hovering over a search result and a time duration value specifying an amount of time the image was hovered. Analysis of the time durations can identity false-positive interactions, such as hovers that result of a movement of a cursor across. This information can be aggregated over a multitude of users and analyzed to improve the information provided by search results.

- a search event is data and actions related to a search operation.
- a search event handled by the search system may be receiving a query, the query itself, providing search results responsive to a received query, a search result, or a user interaction with a search result or a user interface (e.g., viewport or web browser window) presenting search results.
- the query log can store information regarding search events handled by the search system that are associated with search queries received from many different client devices. This information can include information identifying received queries, the time at which search events occur, information identifying search results provided responsive to received search queries, and information regarding interactions with search results and/or search interfaces.
- the search event information may also include information identifying a type of search operation for which the search event is associated. For example, a search system may be capable of processing search queries for general content, images, videos, news articles, maps, or other specific types of content.
- the search event information stored in the query log can also include an identifier that can uniquely associate search events with other search events. For example, the identifier may be an anonymized user identifier that identifies a user or a user device associated with the search event.
- the search system In order to process the data for image search events, for example, for use in an image ranking process, the search system generates image search session data objects that each include information regarding image search events using data stored in the query log.
- An image search session data object can include information regarding image search events associated with an identifier and occurring during a predefined time period.
- an example image search session data object may include, for an identifier, information regarding image search events associated with the identifier that occurred over a twenty-four hour period. Other time periods, such as one week, one month, and one year may also be used.
- the data stored in an image session data object may include data that identifies, for each search query for which image search results have been provided, each image search result that was presented, a location in the viewport that each image search result was presented (e.g., column and row or position in an array), which image search results received an interaction (e.g., click or hover), and/or an order in which the image search results received interactions.
- the image search session data objects include a time-ordered sequence of image search events for an identifier.
- the image search session data objects include, for each received search query in the image search session data object, a two dimensional layout (e.g., row and column) identifying the presentation of the image search results to the user.
- an image query model includes data regarding image search events aggregated over multiple users.
- an image query model is a quasi-two dimensional model having information regarding image search results provided for a particular search query, or multiple search queries.
- a quasi-two dimensional model for a particular search query may include data identifying each image search result provided for the particular search query, how many interactions (e.g., hover count and/or selection count) each provided image search result received, and data specifying the viewport position at which each image search result was presented.
- the image query model(s) can be processed to facilitate other search operations, such as relevance scoring, search result boosting or demoting, and the like.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a search system 110 provides search operations and collects information regarding search operations.
- a computer network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, a mobile phone network, or a combination thereof, connects web sites 104 , user devices 106 , and the search system 110 .
- the environment 100 may include many thousands of web sites 104 and user devices 106 .
- a web site 104 is one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example web site 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each web site 104 is maintained by a publisher (e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web site).
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided by a web site 104 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- the resources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images, and sound, and may include embedded information (e.g., meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (e.g., scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the search system 110 identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided on web sites 104 .
- Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 are stored in an indexed cache 112 .
- a user device such as user device 106 can submit a search query 109 to the search system 110 .
- the search system 110 performs a search operation that uses the search query 109 as input to identify resources 105 responsive to the search query 109 .
- the search system 110 may access the indexed cache 112 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 109 .
- the search system 110 identifies the resources 105 , generates search results 111 that identify the resources 105 , and returns the search results 111 to the user devices 106 .
- the search query 109 can include one or more search terms.
- a search term can, for example, include a keyword submitted as part of a search query 109 to the search system 110 that is used to retrieve responsive search results 111 .
- the search query 109 includes an image.
- a search result 111 is data generated by the search system 110 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 109 , and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 111 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or an image or portion thereof extracted from the web page, and a hypertext link (e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL)) to the web page.
- a hypertext link e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL)
- the search terms in the search query 109 control the search results 111 that are identified by the search system 110 .
- the actual ranking of the search results 111 varies based on the ranking algorithm used by the search system 110
- the search system 110 can retrieve and rank search results 111 based on the search terms submitted through a search query 109 .
- the search system 110 can combine the relevance score of a resource 105 with a relevance feedback score of an image embedded in the resource 105 . These combined scores are then used to present search results 111 directed to the images embedded in the resources 105 .
- the relevance scores for an image can be based on labels that are associated with the image.
- Labels are text or data flags that indicate a topic to which the image belongs.
- Labels can be explicitly associated with an image, for example, by the publisher that is providing the image. For example, a publisher can associate the text “football” with an image that includes content that is directed to football (e.g., an image of a football or a football player). Labels can also be explicitly associated with an image by users to whom the image is presented.
- the relevance feedback score for an image with respect to a search query is a score derived from data specifying interactions received for the image when that image is referenced in a search result 111 for a search query 109 .
- the relevance feedback score for an image is based on a click-through rate for the image with respect to the search query.
- the relevance feedback score for an image with respect to a search query is based on hovers over the image when the image is referenced in search results for the search query.
- Image search results are often provided as thumbnail images that are reduced-size versions of the original images, i.e., the images they represent and that are hosted on a web site 104 .
- the search system 110 may identify images that are relevant to a search query 109 received from a user device 106 and provide thumbnail versions of the identified images as search results 111 to the user device 106 .
- the images may be presented according to the rank of the images with respect to the received search query 109 .
- the images may be presented along rows and columns of a web browser window according to the ranking.
- the images also may be split between multiple pages of search results 111 according to the ranking.
- a larger version of an image provided as a search result 111 may be presented to a user in response to the user hovering a pointer element over the image, for example for at least a threshold amount of time.
- One example pointer element includes a cursor controlled by a mouse, touchpad, or other selection device.
- Another example pointer element includes a selection device, such as a finger or stylus, for selecting content displayed by a touch screen display.
- the user device 106 may detect a hover over an image and, in response, present a larger version of the hovered image to the user.
- the larger version of the image may be provided to the user device 106 along with the search results 109 or in response to the user device 106 detecting the hovering and requesting the larger version of the image from the search system 110 .
- the larger version that is provided is separate from the image that the search result references, e.g., the hovering over the image does not, in some implementations, result in an HTTP request for the image to the web site that hosts the image.
- image hover data can be used, in part, to rank images.
- the search system 110 can consider the hovers as selections in a click-through rate calculation of the relevance feedback score. For instance, images that are often hovered over when provided as a search result 111 may be ranked higher than images that are infrequently hovered over or selected.
- the general assumption under such an approach is that searching users will hover over images that are of interest to the user to determine whether to request a larger version of the image.
- hovers may be incidental, for example a cursor moving over an image en route to another image. Accordingly, in some implementations, the duration of a hover may also be considered in an image ranking process. In some implementations, hovers that have received a duration less than a threshold period of time may be filtered from image search session data objects and/or image query models, as the hovers may be considered incidental rather than a sign of interest in the images referenced by the hovered image search results. For example, a user may navigate a pointer (e.g., cursor) quickly over several image search results on a path to an image search result if interest to the user.
- a pointer e.g., cursor
- the search system 110 includes a query information subsystem 120 that, among other things, collects and compiles information regarding image searches and optionally, other types of searches. This information includes information regarding hovers and selections of images provided as search results 111 in response to search queries 109 .
- the query information subsystem 110 compiles the information so that the information can be evaluated and used to improve the ranking of images for search queries 109 .
- the query information subsystem 120 stores data regarding search events associated with one or more identifiers in query logs 114 .
- the search events logged in the query logs 114 include receiving a search query 109 at the search system 110 , providing search results 111 in response to a received search query 109 , user interactions with a search result 111 or a user interface presenting search results 111 , and respective times and/or durations of each event, if applicable.
- Other types of search events typically handled by a search system 110 can also be logged in the query logs 114 .
- data regarding search events handled by the search system 110 are stored in search event data items.
- Each search event data item can include data regarding a specific search event, such as receipt of a search query or an interaction with a search results.
- FIG. 7 is an illustration of data included in an example query log 700 .
- the example query log 700 includes several search event data items 705 , 710 , 715 , and 720 .
- the example search event data item 705 is for a received query “Beaches in Florida” that was received by a search system, such as search system 110 of FIG. 1 .
- the search event data item 705 includes a time stamp specifying that the search query was received on “Aug. 17, 2011” at “07:31:00 PM.”
- the search event data item 705 also includes an identifier (“28930918”) and information regarding several image search results provided in response to the search query.
- the search event data item 710 is for a hover event. Similar to the search event 705 , the search event 710 includes information identifying the search query “Beaches in Florida,” a time stamp specifying when the hover occurred, and an identifier. The search event data item 710 also includes information identifying a search result “Image ID 23801” that was hovered over by a pointer element and a time duration value “2930 milliseconds” specifying the duration of the hover.
- the search event data item 715 is for a selection of an additional search results page.
- the search event data item 715 includes information identifying the search query “Beaches in Florida,” a time stamp specifying when the interaction was received, and an identifier.
- the search event data item also includes information identifying the type of interaction “Select Next to Navigate to Next Results Page” and information identifying search results presented on the additional search results page.
- the search event data item 720 is for a received query “movies about superheroes.”
- the search event data item 720 includes information identifying the search query “movies about superheroes,” a time stamp specifying when the search result was selected, and an identifier (“41961521”). Note that the identifier for the search event data item 720 is different than the identified for the search event data items 705 - 715 .
- the query logs 114 can include search event data for multiple identifiers.
- the search event data item 720 also includes information identifying search results provided responsive to the received search query.
- An image search session data object is an electronic record having information regarding image search events associated with a particular identifier that have occurred during a predefined time period.
- the query information subsystem 120 includes an image session generator that generates the image search session data objects using data stored in the query logs 114 .
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of depicting an example image session generator 220 .
- the image session generator 220 can identify a proper subset of the search event data items stored in the data logs 114 .
- the proper subset of search event data items may be the search event data items identified by the image session generator 220 as being associated with a search for images.
- the proper subset of search event data items excludes search event data items directed to searches for other content other than images.
- the image session generator 220 can use the information of the proper subset of search event data items to populate the image search session data objects.
- the information stored in an image session data object can include any information stored in search event data items of the query logs 114 that is determined to be associated with an image search event and further determined to be associated with the identifier of the image search session data object.
- this information can include information identifying a received search query 109 , information identifying search results 111 provided in response to the received search query 109 , information regarding user interactions (e.g., hovers and selections) with search results 111 , information regarding user interactions with a user interface the presents the search results 111 , and other information, for example as described in section 4.0 below.
- the image session generator 220 may receive information specifying the information to include in each image search session data object.
- the specifying information may be received from an operator of the search system 110 or another human actor. For example, an operator may desire to compile certain information for analysis.
- the image session generator 220 can process the data in the query logs 114 to identify the specified information and create image search session data objects using the identified information.
- each image search session data object may include information regarding image search events that occurred during a twenty-four hour period, a week, a month, or some other appropriate time period.
- an image search session data object includes a time ordered sequence of query data items.
- Each query data item includes information regarding a particular search query 109 associated with the identifier of the image search session data object.
- the image session generator 220 can aggregate the information into a single query data item. For example, if a search query 109 is received from a user device 106 of the identifier, and one or more search results 111 are selected from search results provided in response to the received search query 109 , the query logs 114 may contain a search event data item for the received search query 109 and a search event data item for each selected search result 111 .
- the image session generator 220 can determine that the search event data items are related and aggregate the information (or a portion thereof) of each search event data item into a query data item.
- a query data item also can include one or more interaction data items having information regarding user interactions.
- the image session generator 220 may create an interaction data item for each type of interaction (e.g., hover or selection of a search result) received by at least one search result 109 provided in response to the search query 109 of the query data item.
- An interaction data item for hover events may include information specifying the search results 111 that were hovered, a hover time duration for each hovered search result 111 , a time at which each hover occurred, and presentation position information for each hovered search result 111 .
- An interaction data item for selection events may include information specifying the search results 111 that were selected, a selection time duration for each selected search result 111 , a time at which each selection occurred, and presentation position information for each selected search result 111 .
- each query data item of an image search session data object includes information identifying the search query 109 for the query data item, a time stamp specifying when the search query 109 was received, information identifying each search result 111 presented to the user, and information identifying each search result 111 for which an interaction occurred.
- FIG. 8 is an illustration of data included in an example image search session data object 800 for the identifier “2893018” and including information extracted from the example query log 700 .
- the example image search session object 800 includes a single query data item 805 for the image search query “Beaches in Florida.”
- the example query data item 805 includes general information 810 regarding the image search query, such as the query string and a time stamp specifying the date and time that the image search query was received.
- the general information 810 can also include information regarding the user interface used to submit the image search query and to view search results, spelling correction information, filter settings, search refinement information, language information, and/or geographic information.
- the query data item 805 also includes search result information 815 identifying each search result 111 presented to the user and the presentation position of each presented search result 111 .
- the search result information 815 identifies the search results 111 presented on the first page of search results and the search results 111 presented on the second page requested by the user.
- the query data item 805 also includes interaction data items 820 and 825 .
- the example interaction data item 820 includes information regarding one or more hover events, such as information identifying each search result 111 that was hovered, the hover duration for each hovered search result 111 , and the presentation position of each hovered search result 111 .
- the example interaction data item 825 includes information regarding one or more selection events, such as information identifying each selected search result 111 , the selection duration of each selected search result 111 , and the presentation position of each selected search result 111 .
- the query information subsystem 120 processes the data for each image search session data object to generate a two dimensional layout of image search results provided for the search query for which the image search session data object is created.
- a search interface may present the image search results in a row and column form, with multiple image search results included in each row and column.
- the query information subsystem 120 can recreate how the image search results were presented using the data extracted from the query logs 114 as the data includes data indicating the position at which the image search results were presented.
- This position data and layout, along with interaction data, better enables an analysis of the effects of image search result position on the likelihood that an image search result will receive an interaction based on its presentation position.
- This analysis may be used to normalize the performance of image search results based on their presentation position.
- the layout and interaction data can be used to determine more clearly how a user interacted with image search results. For example, using hover data for multiple image search results, one may be able to deduct a patch at which a pointer moved across the image search results. Additionally, this data may be used to determine whether an image search result received a hover in response to the image search result being initially presented under a pointer, rather than because a user moved a pointer to the image search result.
- an image query model includes data regarding image search events aggregated over multiple users.
- FIG. 2B is a block diagram depicting an example image query model generator 240 .
- the image query model generator 240 processes the image search session models 116 to create one or more image query models 118 .
- the image query model 118 is a quasi-two dimensional model having information regarding received search queries 109 and image search results provided in response to the search queries 109 , and the respective locations of the image search results in row and column format, where multiple rows and columns were provided.
- the query model generator 240 processes image search session data objects 116 for a multitude of identifiers to create the image query model 118 .
- An example quasi-two dimensional model for a particular query includes a two dimensional data structure having rows and columns. The intersection of each row and column includes an image search result position in which at least one search result 111 has been presented.
- the image query model can include, for each search result position, data specifying each search result 111 that has been presented in that position.
- the image query model can include an impression count specifying the number of times the search result 111 has been presented in that position for the particular query, a click count specifying the number of times the search result 111 has been selected when presented in that position for the particular search query and/or a hover count specifying the number of times the search result 111 has been hovered when presented in that position for the particular search query.
- Another example image query model includes a two dimensional data structure, such as a table having cells arranged in rows and columns. Each row may be for a particular search query 109 and each column may be for a particular search result 111 . Each cell may include an interaction value for the search query 109 of the cell and the search result 111 of the cell. In some implementations, the interaction value includes the number of times the search result 111 of the cell was selected when the search result 111 was presented with search results 111 for the search query 109 . In some implementations, the interaction value includes the sum of the selections and the hovers for the search query 109 and the search result 111 .
- Another example image query model 118 may include information identifying, for each received search query 109 , information identifying each search result 111 provided in response to the search query 109 , an impression count for each search result 111 for the search query 109 specifying the number of times the search result 111 was presented to a user in response to the search query 109 , information identifying each search result 111 that received an interaction (e.g., hover or selection), and an interaction count specifying the number of times the search result 111 received an interaction when presented as a search results 111 responsive to the query 109 .

- a search ranking system may determine that images that receive a large number of selections and hovers for a particular search query 109 should be ranked higher than images that receive fewer selections and hovers.
- the image model generator 240 evaluates information included in interaction data items to determine whether to include the interactions in the interactions counts of the image query model 118 . For example, the image model generator 240 may determine not to include short hovers (e.g., having a duration less than one second) or short clicks (e.g., having a duration less than ten seconds). These short durations may indicate that the image was not responsive to the search query 109 .
- short hovers e.g., having a duration less than one second
- short clicks e.g., having a duration less than ten seconds
