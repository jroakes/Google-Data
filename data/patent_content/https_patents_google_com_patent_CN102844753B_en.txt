Detailed description of the invention
Fig. 1 is the concept map of the example Framework for providing Real-time Feedback in information search system 100.More specifically and
Speech, this diagram depicts client device 102 (such as cell phone, PDA or the individual calculus of composition information search system 100
Machine) and search engine 104 and also illustrate the data stream 106 between client device 102 and search engine 104 and respectively
The user interface 108 of the client device 102 in the state of kind (is respectively labeled as the user interface in time sequence status " A " to " F "
108a to 108f).Along with computing capability and the storage capacity of electronic equipment have increased, occur that chance allows application, equipment
These are utilized to strengthen with the developer of system (such as client device 102 and search engine 104) so that under such as by providing
The Real-time Feedback that literary composition describes provides a user with more rich, more response and search experience that is more satisfactory and that put into.
The user of client device 102 can be by typing query and search word in the search box 110 of user interface 108
Searching for the information being stored in public or private network initiated in part or one or more complete query term
Rope.Client device 102 can also be initiated for the search of information the most explicit by the control of Selection and call search dialog
Typing query and search word, in this case, the query and search word of typing will be regarded as null value.In order to briefly, this specification will inquiry
(itself includes single character or one or more part or complete for the part of term or complete query term
Word, phrase, series of characters or expression) it is referred to as " user's typing query and search word " or is referred to as " typing query and search word ".
It is said that in general, client device 102 and search engine 104 use inquiry and response mode to come alternately, wherein client
End equipment 102 sends to search engine 104 and includes searching of one or more query and search word (such as typing query and search word)
Rope inquiry request and search engine 104 use query and search word to perform search inquiry and with identifying last set result
Information responds.This information can be formatted as HTML (HTML) document, and client device 102 processes should
Document is to show search engine results page.Using typing query and search word, search engine 104 can perform for being stored in
The search inquiry of the information on common network (such as the Internet) or private network (such as intranet server).
In addition to sending searching request to search engine 104, client device 102 can also use typing query and search
Information (such as contact database, local file, the cache number that word is locally stored on client device 102 with search
According to, historical data, subscriber profile information, configuration arrange or other data) or inquiry be installed on client device 102
The inquiry with the ability for receiving inquiry is applied.These application can communicate with search engine 104 with client device 102
To obtain similar manner and other server of search query results rather than search engine communication to obtain result.Client sets
Can also periodically send all or some information in locally stored information to search engine 104 for 102 or this locality is deposited
The index of information of storage, thus this information can be searched for by search engine 104 during performing the search inquiry of request and
Can be returned in search query results.
The state " A " of Fig. 1 illustrates user by selecting the search box 110 in user interface 108a to ask search
Inquiry.In certain embodiments, " search " for asking the purpose of search inquiry to come across on user's selection interface 108 presses
During button or user click on, tap or otherwise select search box 110 (such as Google Desktop Search or toolbar
Or the search box in crawler) time.Replace, when the query and search word execution to typing in search engine 110
During prefix search, start typing query and search word in search box 110 for asking the purpose of search inquiry to come across user
During one or more character.
In the example shown, in search box 110 the single character of typing " w " as query and search word.When to searching
When the query and search word of typing in rope frame 110 performs prefix search, may the single character of typing " w " examine as longer inquiry
First letter of rope word.Replacing, user may the single character of typing " w " and select user interface in search box
" search " button on 108.Additionally replacing, user may give an oral account " double-you ", then in speech interface
The voice command for asking search inquiry may have been given an oral account.Under any circumstance, client device 102 passes through network to searching
Index is held up 104 transmissions and is included the data 113 of typing query and search word " w ", and shows the user interface including search box 110
108a。
Client device 102 and search engine 104 can be used to itself voluntarily or be mutually combined use user's typing look into
Ask term and generate suggestion query and search word.Client device 102 or search engine 104 each can user to
Search box 110 generates after typing complete query term or phrase suggestion query and search word, can adjust user
But before their any word of typing, generate suggestion query and search word or at prefix search with search dialogue
In the case of can generate suggestion query and search word when user's typing composition query and search word or the character of phrase prefix.These
Suggestion query and search word can include that first forward direction user or other users suggestion and user or other users selected in the past
Term.
In addition to performing search inquiry, search engine 104 also includes using one or more to inquire about correction strategy
Process user's typing query and search word to generate inquiry correcting module or the application of one or more suggestion query and search word.
In one example, it is proposed that query and search word can be that search engine 104 determines use after user's typing minority alphabetic character
Family may be planned to the term keyed in.Such as, when user uses miniature keyboard, search engine 104 can be by suggestion
Allow the multiple queries term that user selects to save user's typing long query and search word or the trouble of multiple queries term.
Suggestion query and search word can also include those terms following, these terms at them by search engine 104
Other users be used for when performing search inquiry generating and use typing query and search word to generate at search engine 104 ratio
Search Results more allows those customer satisfaction system Search Results.In state " B ", when typing letter " w " in search box 110,
The suggestion query and search word that search engine 104 generates can include " weather (weather) ", " Walgreens " and " Walmart
(Wal-Mart) ", " walrus (walrus) " or other term.
If prefix search (or " incremental search ") implemented by search engine 104, then suggestion query and search word is and user
Those terms of the term coupling of typing.Utilizing prefix search, user is by discovery suggestion query and search word along with typing more
Many characters and along with suggestion query and search word becomes the most more to refine and becomes more relevant or accurate.Search engine 104 can
With in the drop-down list 116 below the user such as search box 110 in user 108b during typing query and search word generate and
Suggestion query and search word is provided.
In the example of difference inquiry correction strategy, when search engine 104, itself to be configured to directly answer some special
The inquiry of type is (such as by using query and search word " what is the height of mount Everest (Zhu Mulang
What the height at agate peak is) " to be generated Query Result " Elevation:8,848 meters (20,029 by search engine 104
FT) (height above sea level: 8,848 meters (29,029 feet)) ") time, search engine 104 can generate and provide typing is searched for term with
The desired style of special inquiry association, condition or the suggestion query and search word of form alignment of these types.Such as, if needed
Term to be putd question to " what is (what is) " directly answers the set problem of user to trigger search engine 104, then search is drawn
Holding up 104 can be when user's only typing query and search word " height of Mount Everest (height in Mountain Everest) "
Suggestion query and search word " What is the height of mount Everest (what height in Mountain Everest is) ".
In another example, the need to " define:(define :) " form provides for typing inquiry inspection to trigger search engine 104
The dictionary definition of rope word, then search engine 104 can be at user typing query and search word " what does
Lycanthropemean (lycanthrope the meaning what is) ", " (lycanthrope is fixed for lycanthrope definition
Justice) " or time " what is werewolf (what werewolf is) " suggestion query and search word " define:lycanthrope is (fixed
Justice: lycanthrope) ".
In another example, if search engine 104 needs query and search word " weather (weather) " and location name
(with this particular order) directly to answer the inquiry about the current weather in this position, then search engine 104 can be user
Typing query and search word " snow nyc (snowing in New York) ", " weather home (residence weather) ", " new york
Weather (New York weather) ", " statue of liberty fog (Statue of Liberty has mist) ", " weather 10030 (10030
Weather) " etc. time suggestion query and search word " weather New York (New York weather) "." snow nyc (snowing in New York) "
In the case of, search engine 104 can generate partial query term that suggestion query and search word " weather " enters as " under
Snow " wider version and can by access following form generate suggestion query and search word " NewYork (New York) ", this table
The partial query term " nyc " of lattice instruction typing refers to the known, popular of this city or slang abbreviation or one side
Formula.
In the similar examples of another inquiry correction strategy, search engine can be to query and search word " weather new
York (New York weather) " perform spell check and can instead generate and provide suggestion query and search word " weather New
York”.In another example, search engine 104 can " lycanthrope film (becomes based on user's typing query and search word
Lycanthropy patient's film) " generate synonym suggestion query and search word " werewolf movie (werewolf's film) ".
Search engine 104 can make with user by comparing user's typing query and search word in conventional search engine inquiry
Query and search word and the conventional search engine inquiry of other users and at client device 102 or search engine 104
Data and the user preference information indexed in place or compare with other data and generate suggestion query and search word.Such as exist
In state " B ", search engine 104 has been based on user's typing query and search word " w " and generates suggestion query and search word " weather
(weather) ", " Walgreens ", " Walmart (Wal-Mart) " and " walrus (walrus) " and to client device 102
Send back the data 114 of those suggestion query and search words of mark.Any number of inquiry correction strategy next life may have been used
Become the specific suggestion query and search word of search engine 104 mark.
Search engine 104 can generate by based on user the most movable or search engine 104 the movable of other users
Suggestion query and search word.Search engine 104 such as can identify user based on user profiles or browser cookie and make
By this information with coupling typing query and search word and user or other users frequently typing, select or find conventional phase
Close or satisfactory query and search word or Search Results.In the example shown, search engine 104 can be used based on other
Family used the degree of association of the Search Results that these query and search words obtain in the past or estimated that satisfaction generated suggestion inquiry inspection
Rope word " weather (weather) ", " Walmart (Wal-Mart) ", " Walgreens " or " walrus (walrus) ".
In addition to obtaining suggestion query and search word from search engine 104 or replace, client device 102 itself
Can also by search local information (index of the query and search word of the locally applied or recent use such as recently performed,
Contact database or following application on a client device, these application register it to client device 102
Have the ability searched) generate suggestion query and search word.Such as, user can airborne hard-drive, flash memory or other deposit
Storage equipment stores like most about one or more position, have a bookmark or favorite webpage, contact person or POI
(such as library, restaurant, previously visit, ' like most ' or the position of mark) information.In another example, about user's
The information of search or browsing histories was stored on client device 102, then for generating suggestion inquiry inspection in the past
Rope word.If for asking the purpose of search that but user not yet typing query and search word, then client device have occurred
104 can use this local information to advise following query and search word, and these query and search words identify on client device 104
The term accessed recently, the most popular typing query and search word on client device 104 or the inquiry inspection of previously suggestion
Rope word.
In the example shown, client device 102 can use query and search word " w " to identify this locality in state " B "
Local linkages people in contact database " Wally Anderson (fertile profit Anderson) " and advise the name of this contact person
As suggestion query and search word.Similarly, client device can use query and search word " w " recently to perform or near with mark
The application " Wacky Solitaire " installed and advise that this Apply Names is as suggestion query and search word.Replace,
Run on client device 102 registered this may be it has been proposed that " Wacky Solitaire " as the application that can search for
As query and search word.In addition to the shown communication between client 102 and server 104, such application is also possible to
Use query and search word " W " can use software download to alone server inquiry and may individually service from this
Device receives suggestion term " Wacky Solitaire ".
When user's typing query and search word " weather New York (New York weather) " and asked search inquiry in the past
Time, query and search word " weather New York (New York weather) " may have been stored in the search history of user, and
During term " New York (New York) " may have been stored in user preference information or arrange.Use this local information,
Client device 102 can determine when user's typing query and search word " w " in search box 110 that they may intend to repeat phase
With search inquiry and can generate and provide " weather NewYork (New York weather) " advise query and search word 111.Similar
Process can be used to generate suggestion query and search word " Weather 92067 (92067 weather) ".By using locally stored letter
Breath, can be by depending on quickly generating the most alternately and providing a user with between user and client device 102
Suggestion query and search word and without any Network Transmission Delays.Once can regard from cache access when obtaining live content
The content with these query and search word associations previously selected for live content is used for showing together with these terms.
Client device 102 can also have been generated by search engine 104 by using and receive from search engine 104
Suggestion query and search word search local information (such as user preference or the query and search word that recently uses) generate other
Suggestion query and search word.Such as, client device 102 can store configuration information or arrange (the home address of such as user
(such as postcode 92067)).When query and search word " weather (weather) " advised by search engine 102, this inquiry is examined
Rope word can be with the home address data aggregate of user to form key query and search word " weather 92067 (92067 weather) ".
In another example, user can preserve the list of stock ticker symbols interested for user.Client device 102 or
Search engine 104 can use this information to generate suggestion query and search word, and then this query and search word can be used to inquire about
And provide a user with the share price of those companies.
In additional examples, when single input character " w " may be not enough to allow client device 102 advise query and search word
During to obtain local Weather information, client device 102 can first advise query and search word " weather at search engine 104
(weather) " time suggestion query and search word " weather New York (New York weather) " or " weather 92067 (92067 days
Gas) ".In addition to technique described above, it is also possible to look into based on formerly " weather (weather) " performed before user
Ask or based on the local information (such as user preference information or current location information) being stored in client device 102
(this information instruction user may be to " New York " or interested with the position that postcode " 92067 " associates) carrys out flag
Put " New York " or " 92067 ".
As shown in user interface 108b, client device 102 shows the query and search word that client device 102 is advised
Set and/or the query and search set of words of search engine 104 suggestion.Different query and search set of words can be merged before display
Or can individually show them.As shown in user interface 108b, client device 102 has combined client device
102 and the suggestion query and search word that generates of search engine 104 and the drop-down list below search box 110 116 in show and build
View query and search word combination list.Query composition term set can include deleting the suggestion query and search word repeated or allowing
Some query and search word is more preferential than other query and search word or ranks formerly.
It is not necessarily referring to each suggestion query and search word obtain live content or attempt obtaining live content, although at some
Embodiment can be attempted by formulating the live query for all suggestion query and search words.As at state " C "
Shown in, once client device 102 has obtained suggestion query and search word, it is possible to selection can associate with live content
The subset of suggestion query and search word, wherein this subset includes that what client device 102 and/or search engine 104 generated builds
View query and search word in all or all or fewer than suggestion query and search word.Can by or search engine 104 and/
Or it is registered in the relatedness between suggestion query and search word and live content by the user of client device 102.
In the example selecting suggestion query and search word for subset, including term " weather " and location name or
The query and search word of identifier (i.e. " weather New York (New York weather) " and " weather 92067 (92067 days
Gas) ") can be chosen so as to obtain current weather information as live content.Can select to include the name of people (i.e.
" WallyAnderson (fertile profit Anderson) ") query and search word to obtain the current state for this people or positional information
As live content.Such as, it is proposed that query and search word " WallyAnderson (fertile profit Anderson) " can be by client device
102 identify as the contact person in local data base or the part that can be selected as subset.
Furthermore it is possible to select to include the inquiry inspection of the title (i.e. " Walgreens " and " Walmart (Wal-Mart) ") of enterprise
Rope word is to obtain current information or the current share prices information of looking back as live content.Such as, search engine can be public from share
The data base of the company opening transaction identifies suggestion query and search word " Walmart (Wal-Mart) " and selects this suggestion query and search
Word is as the part of subset.In a kind of alternative, in order to make computational expense minimum, will not pay make great efforts further with for
Specifically do not associate with live content other suggestion query and search word (i.e. " Wacky Solitaire ", " walrus (walrus) " and
Single word " weather (weather) ") obtain live content.Replacing, " acquiescence " processes can be occurred with such as by using
These suggestion query and search words come for these suggestion inquiry inspections to wikipedia or encyclopedia live query current information
Rope word obtains live content.Additionally replace, if will not be directed to some query and search word to obtain live content, then can be from
The cache content that cache obtains and shows together with these suggestion query and search words.
Can be at least partially based on that beyond search engine 104 (such as third-party server or service) obtain is dynamic
Information selects suggestion query and search lexon collection.Such as, user can be linked to (the such as Gmail contact of online connection people's manager
People) or social networking site (such as Facebook, Linkedln, MySpace).Then these websites and service can be inquired about
With determine suggestion query and search word (i.e. " Wally Anderson (fertile profit Anderson) ") whether as contact person, good friend or good
The good friend of friend or otherwise with the people of user-association.Then the result of this inquiry is used for determining whether should select to build
View query and search word is as suggestion query and search set of words or the part of subset.
Use third-party server or service with select subset another example in, user can with financial information or
Person manage service (such as Google Finance, Bloomberg.com, Quicken.com or user can configure bank,
Deposit, credit or other website of investing tip) association.Client device 102 or search engine 104 can compare suggestion
Query and search word and with user's information of associate of account in financial information or management service to select those suggestions to inquire about
Some query and search word in term is as the part of subset.Such as it is stored in third party's financial information or management service
Information may indicate that user has the account of " MasterCard " and has " Masco Corp. " (such as ticker title
" MAS ") stock.When user's typing query and search word " mas " in search box, search engine 104 can advise inquiry inspection
Rope word " MasterCard ", " Masco Corp. " and " Massey Ferguson " but can only select " MasterCard "
" Masco Corp. " is as the part of subset, because the information being stored in third party's financial information or management service is not
It is reflected in the contact between user and " Massey Ferguson ".
By providing data (the selected query and search word in this Data Identification subset) to come for suggestion to search engine 104
Query and search lexon collection obtains live content.Live content be search engine generate suggestion query and search word time time or
Soon the information obtained.Live content is and the information of suggestion query and search word association.Live content can be following number
According to, search engine is when generating suggestion query and search word or soon (such as at one second of generation suggestion query and search word
Or in 30 seconds) index the most in advance or otherwise store the value of these data.It practice, live content can include
The time after user typing query and search word from third party content provider take reading or at search engine at dynamic
The information updated.
Obtain live content and require that equipment or system are in response to generating suggestion query and search word or looking into generating suggestion
Ask term executed in parallel live query or dynamically update.Thus it is different from and visited in the last time of search engine or creep
(crawl) time is current content (such as cache content), unless this visit or creep comes across reception user
Typing query and search word and after generating suggestion query and search word.Such as, search engine 104 can be with regular call weather content
Provider and storage are used for the Weather information of ad-hoc location as ' recently ' Weather information.When generation relates to Weather information and is somebody's turn to do
During the suggestion query and search word of ad-hoc location, if ' recently ' weather obtaining storage before generating suggestion query and search word is believed
Breath, then it will be not intended as live state information.
If search engine 104 itself selects suggestion query and search lexon collection, then obtain real for those query and search words
The process of condition content can immediately begin to and not to the data of client device 102 exchange identification subset.When client device 102
Select suggestion query and search lexon collection time, from client device 102 to search engine 104 in whole or in part sends identify subset
Information to initiate for obtaining the process of live content.
Carry out wherein attempting obtaining an example embodiment of live content for all suggestion query and search words
In, client device 102 or search engine 104 will need not select or identify any subset of suggestion query and search word.So
And, shown in Fig. 1, subframe assumes that suggestion query and search lexon collection is at least partly selected by client device 102.At this
Under assuming, and as shown in state " C ", send data 118 (these data from client device 102 to search engine 104
The query and search word that mark suggestion query and search lexon is concentrated) to perform live query to obtain live content.Data 118 also may be used
To include that out of Memory that may be useful when obtaining relevant live content (such as includes the current location of client device 102
Or the information of the user of mark client device 102).
The live content generated for specific selected query and search word can relate to the current of the user of client device 102
Circumstances or state.Such as, when user search history or arrange do not point out other positional information time, client device 102
Current location can be used to such as by use suggestion query and search word " weather (weather) " to determine in current location
Current weather or by use suggestion term " Walgreens " with determine with " Walgreens " shop recently current away from
From obtaining live content.Therefore, in addition to the specific suggestion query and search word of mark subset, local device can also generate
Real time data and to server 104 send this real time data with in live query for obtaining live content.Such as exist
Shown in example, client device can from cell tower or according to Wi/Fi triangulation, from Airborne GPS receptor or
Determine its current location (" latitude 45.116816, longitude 93.433085 ") according to user's input and can draw to search
The data 118 holding up 104 transmissions include this information.
Generate and suggestion query and search word is provided on the drop-down list 116 of user interface 108b, then may be used
The time that can need additives amount identifies subset, passes on the suggestion of subset between client device 102 and search engine 104
The mark of query and search word, search engine 104 perform live query to obtain live content and to provide to client device 104
Live content is used for showing.As indicator, (this indicator shows carrying out attempting obtaining live content and can be short
Live content is provided in the time period on the user interface 108), can display adjacent with the suggestion query and search word of subset delay at a high speed
Deposit content and/or animation helical form arrow 120.
Helical form arrow 120 can indicate in obtaining and providing fact soon to the user of client device 102
Hold, thus allow user decide whether to wait see live content or select to point to suggestion query and search word link rather than
Wait live content (if such content by the live content type of display and is lost interest in by i.e. user's understanding).When aobvious
Specific suggestion query and search word is will not be directed to when showing live content or when client device 102 or search engine 104 determine
(such as after predetermined amount of time or after receiving null value for live content), helical form arrow is removed when obtaining live content
120.
Although in example shown in this use cued visual be animation helical form arrow, but in other example this
One cued visual can be static and can be hourglass or some other progress indicators.Furthermore, it is possible to by changing
It is used for identifying word or the size of figure, font, color, background or other characteristic any of suggestion query and search lexon collection
Visually imply the progress for obtaining live content.For example, it is possible to italic or runic represent the membership query inspection of subset
Rope word is to indicate them or will send (118) to perform live query to search engine 104.In other example,
Not shown cued visual.
Suggestion query and search word can include that user selects during the most previously inquiring about and can include elder generation
Before obtained and be cached in now the term of live content on client device 102 or server 104.As
Really user has selected suggestion query and search word " Walmart (Wal-Mart) ", then may obtain as follows in this time
Live content, this live content indicates Wal-Mart's stock share price to be per share $ 33.When search engine 104 generates suggestion inquiry again
During term " Walmart (Wal-Mart) ", specifically in response to user's typing query and search word " w ", this content is no longer considered as fact
But content is actually considered as cache content.Can obtain replace when live content other cued visual any or
Person in addition to other cued visual any also with suggestion query and search word this cache content of adjacent display.Such as at shape
In state " B ", suggestion query and search word " Walmart (Wal-Mart) " be displayed next to cache content 117 (" $ 33/ strand ") with
When obtaining current data, to user, some data are shown moment.For example, it is possible to by using different fonts or color, will
Cache content 117 is formatted into has the outward appearance different from live content, thus user does not obscures this content with live
Content.
In state " D ", search engine 104 uses suggestion query and search word itself to determine to obtain live content
The live query type, the target of live query that perform and be used for formulating query and search word the building for subset of live query
One or more query and search word in view query and search word obtains live content.As used by description, " live query " is
The inquiry for obtaining live content occurred after generating suggestion query and search word.
In some examples of live query type, if suggestion query and search word include term " weather (my god
Gas) " and position (i.e. " weather New York (New York weather) " and " weather 92067 (92067 weather) "), then search for
Engine 104 can use position to formulate the live query for being performed by weather service as query and search word, to obtain
The current weather forecast of this position.If suggestion query and search word includes the name (i.e. " WallyAnderson (Wo Lian of people
Moral is gloomy) "), then search engine 104 can use name to formulate for being performed by social networks provider as query and search word
Live query, with the current state that obtains for this people, (such as Facebook state, up-to-date chirp or chat are available
Property) or position.If query and search word includes the title (i.e. " Walgreens " and " Walmart (Wal-Mart) ") of enterprise, then
Search engine 104 can use enterprise name to formulate as search term and look into for the fact performed by business information services
Ask, to obtain current review information or current share prices information.
In other example of live query type, if suggestion query and search word include TV programme, song, film or
The title of other media content of person, title or other identifier, then search engine 104 can use title or title conduct
Query and search word can be with name to obtain for the live query performed by dispatch server (such as tvguide.com) to formulate
Claim the local projection time of association.If suggestion query and search word includes sports team or athletic title or name, then
Search engine 104 can use name referred to as query and search word formulate for by sport news service (such as espn.com,
Nfl.com) live query performed, to obtain the up-to-date score or statistics associated with sports team or athlete.If built
View query and search word includes that user has bank or the title of account provider of commercial relations, then search engine 104 therewith
The accounts information that can use user be customized for by bank or account provider server perform live query,
To obtain the current account balance of user.
Live query type, the target of inquiry and the use that user can also be performed to obtain live content by appointment
The query and search word formulating inquiry indicates and will obtain certain form of fact for certain form of suggestion query and search word
Content.Such as, user can be by specifying in the user preference being stored on client device 102 or search engine 104
The target (such as gaspricewatch.com) of live query, for formulating the query and search word of live query (such as
" lowest price " (lowest price) and the postcode of current location) and the info class that will present as live content
Type (minimum local price tolerance) arranges query and search word " gas (natural gas) " or " fuel (fuel) " will be for obtaining
Obtain local fuel price near the current location of user.
In the most shown example, it is proposed that query and search word " weather New York (New York weather) " and
" weather 92067 (92067 weather) " by search engine 104 be used for using query and search word " New York (New York) " and
" 92067 " come live query weather service with obtain represent respectively generate those suggestion query and search words time time (or
Soon) current weather in New York and at postcode 92067 live content " 55 °, the most cloudy " and " 76 °,
Fine ".Suggestion query and search word " Walgreens " and " Walmart (Wal-Mart) " is used for using enterprise name by search engine 104
Rope word " Walgreens " and " Walmart (Wal-Mart) " carry out live query business information services to obtain as query and search word
The current share prices information of the time (or soon) when generating those suggestion query and search words.At " Walgreens "
In the case of, can use without stock price information, and business information services returns current share prices "<empty>".In " Walmart (Wal-Mart) "
In the case of, business information services returns current share prices " per share $ 38 ".Suggestion query and search word " Wally Anderson (Wo Li
Anderson) " it is used for inquiring about social networks by search engine 104, this network returns following response, this response to search engine 104
Instruction " Wally Anderson (fertile profit Anderson) " is generating the shape of the time of suggestion query and search word (or soon)
State is " away (leaving) ".
Finally, although Fig. 1 illustrate use search engine 104 with use suggestion query and search word to formulate live query with
Obtain live content, but in other example embodiment, client device when being not directed to search engine 104 or with
The live query that search engine 104 is formulated combine or formulate together one or more live query in live query and
Obtain live content.
As shown in state " E ", including to the data 122 that client device 102 sends from search engine 104 or
The live content that person's mark obtains for suggestion query and search word.For example, it is possible to obtaining all suggestion inquiries for subset
In a message, data 122 are sent after the live content of term, or can be for each suggestion query and search word
Or for advising that query and search word sends data after obtaining live content in multiple message in groups.Data can include reality
Condition content itself, or search engine 104 can process live content with mark and send relate to the information of live content (such as
Icon).
Client device 102 can process again live content and remove association for each corresponding suggestion query and search word
Helical form arrow 120 and adjacent with suggestion query and search word itself or replace suggestion query and search word in user interface
The upper display of 108e relates to the information of live content.When processing live content, client device 102 can select live content
Some part or represent in live content the icon of information contained for showing.If can be used in subset without live content
Suggestion query and search word, then remove association helical form arrow to indicate to the user that without live content at hand.Such as, client
Equipment 102 based on receive data 122 (instruction of these data can be used for " Walgreens " without live content and advises query and search word) or
Person does not receives any fact from search engine 104 based on the time (such as five seconds, 30 seconds, one minute) waiting predetermined quantity
Content removes the helical form arrow adjacent with this term.
As described above, search engine 104 is for " weather New York (New York weather) " suggestion inquiry
The live content that term 111 obtains includes information " 55 °, the most cloudy ".Client device 102 or search engine 104 can
To process this information and to select representative icon (the such as sun represents fine day, when when snowing as snowflake, when cloudy being
Cloud) it is used for showing.When search engine 104 selects icon, can only send icon or live content to client device 102
For showing, or both icon and live content can be sent.
In another example, live content can be presented when pointer is hovered on suggestion query and search word by user to make
For balloon dialogue or pop-up dialogue box rather than it is displayed adjacent to relate to the information of live content with suggestion query and search word.Nothing
Which kind of mode of opinion is used for showing live content, all expects that many users will find that in drop-down list 116 itself they intend to seek
The information looked for and do not take any more action to select suggestion query and search word or to initiate another search.
As shown in state " F ", regardless of whether display live content, user can select the spy in drop-down list 116
Surely suggestion query and search word is to call and the function of specific suggestion query and search word association.Suggestion query and search word is selected to make
Client device 102 sends selected query and search word to search engine 104 or another server and uses selected inquiry with request
Term performs search inquiry.Replace, when for ad hoc inquiry term storage out of Memory, (such as unified resource is fixed
Position symbol (URL)) time, client device 102 can send, to search engine 104, the URL associated with ad hoc inquiry term.Example
As, if URL " www.walgreens.com " is stored in client device 102 for suggestion query and search word " Walgreens "
On, then select the link 118 pointing to query and search word " Walgreens " that client device 102 can be caused to search engine 104
(or another server) sends and identifies the HTTP request 130 of this URL with requested webpage.
If the most chosen suggestion query and search word including live content of user, then client device 102 can be local
Store this suggestion query and search word shortcut as live content interested before pointing to user.With regard to this point
Speech, when search dialog on user's starting client next time equipment 102, including these shortcuts updating live content
Can be shown in search box less than 110 and completely without any word of user's typing.So, by preserving sensing live content
Shortcut, search box 110 become can show the live content for any number of theme and seldom or without keying in
One class (ad-hoc) gadget especially.Once user begins typing and mates with the suggestion query and search word being associated with shortcut
Prefix, this live content is just by seniority among brothers and sisters high in the drop-down list below search box 110.
Whether the function called when client device makes a choice as user can select suggestion inquiry inspection according to user
Rope word or they whether select live content and different.Such as, if user selects the sensing on user interface 108e to retrieve
The link of word " Mr.Anderson (Mr. Anderson) ", then client device 102 can obtain and show locally stored contact
People's information.If user selects the link of the sensing term " is Away (leaving) " on user interface 108e, then client sets
Standby 102 social network page that can obtain and show the contact person for mark.
