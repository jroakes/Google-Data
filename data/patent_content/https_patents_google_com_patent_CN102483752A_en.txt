Embodiment
With detailed reference implementation example, its example illustrates in the accompanying drawings at present.Though will combine embodiment to describe the present invention, and will be appreciated that to the invention is not restricted to these specific embodiments.On the contrary, present invention resides in spirit and the scope of accompanying claims for choosing, modification and equivalent.For the thorough to the theme that represents at this is provided, many details have been set forth.But to those skilled in the art will be that it is obvious that: can put into practice this theme under the situation of these details not having.In other cases, do not describe well-known method, program, assembly and circuit in detail, in order to avoid unnecessarily blur the aspect of embodiment.
Fig. 1 illustrates the distributed system 100 of the practice that is suitable for embodiments of the invention.The U.S. Patent Application Serial Number No.10/987 of unsettled jointly, the common transfer of " Method and System for Autocompletion Using Ranked Results (being used to use the method and system of the automatic completion of ranking result) " that is to submit on November 11st, 2004; 295; The U.S. Patent Application Serial Number No.10/987 of unsettled jointly, the common transfer of " Method and System for Autocompletion for Languages Having Ideographs and Phonetic Characters (being used to have the method and system of automatic completion of the language of pictograph and phonetic characters) " of submitting on November 12nd, 2004; 769; And the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number No.12/188 of unsettled jointly, the common transfer of " Autocompletion and Automatic Input Method Correction for Partially Entered Query (the automatic completion that is used for the inquiry of part input is proofreaied and correct with input method automatically) " of submitting on August 7th, 2008; The extra details relevant with its various functional modules with distributed system are provided in 163, by reference the content whole of said application have been incorporated at this.
Like what further describe at this, system 100 is adjusted with its functional module, so that handle multilingual partial query with uniform way.System 100 is adjusted, so as with the speech encoding of the partial query that is sent to search engine 108 by client assistant 104 irrespectively, the inquiry of prediction is provided based on user's the actual input at FTP client FTP 102 places.For example use that this is particularly useful under the incorrect Input Method Editor setting at FTP client FTP 102 places has been imported the situation of partial query the user.
Some language or dialect such as Chinese mandarin and Korean have well accepted voice representation scheme between their user.For example, this scheme of Chinese mandarin is called as " phonetic ", and each Chinese character has official's voice and representes (or romanization) under special context.When the user uses phonetic plan to import Chinese character, any typing error will cause the different character set of expecting or what all not having (or possible errors message) with.But in some other language or dialect, possibly there are not extensive accepted standard or official's scheme.For example, Guangdong language is in writing, to use the Chinese character identical with mandarin, but has the Chinese dialect of significantly different pronunciations usually for identical characters.Because there is not the generally accepted scheme of people of saying Guangdong language as the quilt of phonetic in historical reasons.As a result, different people possibly represent for the selection of the identical characters in Guangdong language different voice.
For example, for Chinese character " moral ", some say that the voice of the people preference " tak " of Guangdong language represent, and some other people voice of preference " dak " are represented.In other words, even under identical linguistic context, the relation between Chinese character and its corresponding Guangdong language voice are represented is an one-to-many.The model file 128 specific to language that is used for Guangdong language is data structures, and one or more voice are represented and it is at the corresponding popularity of saying between the people of Guangdong language for Chinese phrase or single Chinese character define for it.Rely on this data structure, possible is, predicts that which corresponding Chinese character should be that the voice with user's input of Latin character string form are represented to respond, and also possible be to propose query suggestion based on the Chinese character of predicting.
With reference to figure 2A; Described according to some embodiment at this accompanying drawing; Language model makes up device 152 and how to use the data from one or more sources 154 to generate the model file 128 specific to language, and said one or more sources 154 comprise user investigation data 154-1, self-defining data 154-3 and third party's data 154-5.For the sake of simplicity, the application is used as example with Guangdong language.But the present invention is applicable to have same or similar problem, does not promptly have the people who says native language of language-specific or dialect generally to accept or other voice or the dialect of the standard romanization scheme used.
User investigation data 154-1 can collect through installing such as the software application based on the application of web.The people who says Guangdong language is invited this application of visit, and provides the voice of its preference of Chinese phrase/character to represent.Backend application is analyzed these user's inputs, and is that each phrase or character generate statistical model.Other modes of collecting the user investigation data comprise the regular email message of soliciting input to the people who says Guangdong language.Combine Fig. 2 B that the more detailed description of the embodiment of user investigation data analysis is provided below.
Sometimes, consequent statistical model possibly receive user investigation data 154-1 is made contributions those say the people's of Guangdong language population size and the demographic influence that distributes.Can use other data sources to improve specific to the quality and the completeness of the model file 128 of language such as self-defining data 154-3 and third party's data 154-5.
One type self-defining data 154-3 is Hong Kong geodata.For example, have in many places in Hong Kong as the Chinese name of " Tsim Sha Tsui " and the English name of representing as the voice for corresponding Chinese name of " Tsim Sha Tsui ".In this application, the voice of Chinese phrase in the Guangdong language or character represent also to be called as " port assembly ".Because the combination as this has been used many decades; And between the people who says Guangdong language in Hong Kong, be widely used; So when the model file 128 that generates specific to language, the weight of piecing together both increases of combination with the port is pieced together at the single port that gives in the geodata 154-3 of Hong Kong.In other words; Accord with Chinese phrase for multiword, the port is pieced together self-defining data and is generally considered to be pin-point accuracy, and in most of the cases; The people who says Guangdong language goes back the single port assembly among the preference self-defining data 154-3, even when the Chinese character of correspondence is used in other combinations.In certain embodiments, when about specific Chinese phrase or character, when self-defining data 154-3 and user investigation data 154-1 were inconsistent, language model made up device 152 and gives self-defining data 154-3 with the weights that increase usually.
Third party's data can be from obtaining via the addressable document in the Internet.In certain embodiments, such as the software application of sorter be configured to analyzing web page and searching have the table of generally acknowledged form or include in (Chinese phrase, the port is pieced together) right, for example:
Chen Dawen-＞Chan Dai Man
Big prosperous row-＞Dah Chong Hong
In certain embodiments; Sorter at first discern with a plurality of (for example; Two to five) port splicing near a plurality of (for example; Two to five) pattern of Chinese character through in the model file 128 of language (Guangdong language), searching the assembly of known port for Chinese character, confirms between the port of corresponding Chinese character and correspondence is pieced together, whether have possible mapping one to one then.
In other words, as shown in Fig. 2 A, the structure of model file can be an iterative process.Language model makes up device 152 and periodically or with other mode handles the data that receive recently with any form from data source 154, and correspondingly upgrades Guangdong language model file 128.
The example that generates statistical model is automatically pieced together to come in the port that Fig. 2 B has described the user according to the use Chinese character of some embodiment and provides.User investigation data 201 comprise that " smearing " and " jasmine " " smeared (maat) cloth " at three Chinese phrases from " the smearing " and the port of " jasmine " is pieced together about two Chinese characters of four users, appearance in " smearing (mut) kills " and " jasmine (mut) jasmine ".For the purpose of clear, each Guangdong corresponding with it in two characters is pieced together, and promptly " maat " or " mut " is associated.It is the romanization scheme of Hong Kong language association (LSHK) exploitation that Guangdong is pieced together, and it is seldom known between people of Guangdong language or use saying.In these two characters and three phrases, can find two Chinese important phenomenon.The first, same character " is smeared " can have different pronunciations under different context, is used for " rag " and " mut " is used for " obliterating " such as " maat ".The second, different characters " is smeared " and " jasmine " can have same pronunciation " mut ".
Make
(user, jp kp) piece together kp pieces together jp as Guangdong number of times for the user imports the port to ■ K; And
(user jp) pieces together the total degree as jp for the user imports any port to ■ T.
For the user with kp as the F of the frequency of jp (user, jp kp) can be defined as:
F(user，jp，kp)＝K(user，jp，kp)/T(user，jp).
Formula above using, user investigation data 201 are converted into the frequency data 203 shown in Fig. 2 B.Notice that last two row of user investigation data 201 are shrunk to last column of frequency data 203.Because model file 128 expressions and the corresponding statistical model of customer group of saying Guangdong language can spread all over different user frequency data 203 are sued for peace to obtain the relation between jp and kp, as follows:
G(jp，kp)＝[F(user1，jp，kp)+F(user2，jp，kp)+...+F(userN，jp，kp)]/N.
In other words, and G (jp, kp) indication is when corresponding Guangdong assembly is jp, Specific Port is pieced together the popularity of kp.Shown in Fig. 2 B, table 205 has two Guangdong and pieces together clauses and subclauses, and one about " maat " and another is about " mut ".In two clauses and subclauses each is pointed to respective list 205-1, the 205-3 that clauses and subclauses and its popularity score value that is associated are pieced together in port.
At last, H (C, kp), the popularity score value that promptly is used for the port assembly kp of Chinese character C is defined as follows:
H(C，kp)＝w
1G(jp
1，kp)+w
2G(jp
2，kp)+...w

MThe Guangdong that is character C is pieced together; And
■ w
1, w
2..., w
MIt is the weight of joining for the corresponding Guangdong ingredient of character C.
Shown in Fig. 2 B, table 207 has two clauses and subclauses, and one about " smearing " and another is about " jasmine ".In two clauses and subclauses each is pointed to respective list 207-1, the 207-3 that clauses and subclauses and its popularity score value that is associated are pieced together in port.For the sake of simplicity, in this example, all weight w
iThe value of being set to 1/M.In certain embodiments, the H-value standardization of kp is pieced together at the different ports that are used in specific Chinese character C, makes the summation of normalized popularity score value equal predefine constant (for example, 100 or 1).
Fig. 2 C is the block diagram that Chinese phrase and character is mapped to the example data structure of piecing together at its corresponding port according to some embodiment.It is the look-up table 209 of key that this mapping is implemented as with Chinese phrase or character, and the value of said Chinese phrase or character is (port is pieced together, popularity _ score value) right tabulation (209-1 to 209-7).
In certain embodiments, language model makes up device 152 and makes up each clauses and subclauses in the data structure through the data of different types that merges from each provenance.Based on the authenticity of the data source of correspondence, the data i of each type is given corresponding weights ri.For example, if self-defining data 154-3 obtains from the foundation data source for a long time such as Hong Kong map datum, then self-defining data 154-3 generally is given than user investigation data 154-1 and the higher weight of third party's data 154-5.

The whole popularity score value that formula above Guangdong language model construction device 152 usefulness are used is confirmed is filled specific to the data structure of the model file 128 of language.For each inquiry of identification in inquiry log 124,126, ordered set makes up device 142 and generates candidate port assembly prefix sets through the clauses and subclauses of searching in the model file 128.
In some embodiments, the model file 128 stored on as "Liu", "Germany" and "China" in Chinese characters in a single entry and on as "Andy," the Chinese phrase entries.Through doing like this, model file 128 can be pieced together about the port of specific Chinese character, and more information that depend on linguistic context are provided more.As stated, a Chinese character can have different pronunciations in different phrases.In model file 128, have with Chinese phrase and its port piece together popularity score value distribute corresponding clauses and subclauses make following easier: when character is pieced together still less popular port and this characters when being special phrase a part of.In certain embodiments, store consequent model file 128, to save storage space with compressed format.
In certain embodiments, use a model file 128 and inquiry log 124,126, ordered set makes up the one or more inquiries of device 142 structures and accomplishes table 130.As further specify below, one or more inquiry completion tables 130 are made by predictive server 112 and are used for being the partial query generation forecast.Each clauses and subclauses storing queries character string and the other information in the table 130 is accomplished in inquiry.Other information comprises the rank score value, and it can be based on the frequency in inquiry log of inquiry, date value and/or other factors of submit queries in the customer group.The value that comprises the language of indicating complete query about the other information of inquiry alternatively.The complete query of the prediction that each clauses and subclauses in the corresponding inquiry completion table 130 are represented to be associated with partial query.In addition, in certain embodiments, the complete query group of the prediction that will be associated with same prefix is stored in the inquiry completion table 130 according to frequency or the ordering of rank score value.Alternatively, the query fingerprints index of table 130 by the part search inquiry of correspondence accomplished in inquiry, and wherein the query fingerprints of each partial query generates through hash function (or other fingerprint functions) is applied to partial query.In certain embodiments, the complete query of prediction is stored in one or more inquiry completion tables 130 with its source language (for example, Chinese and English).
Fig. 3 A is a general introduction process flow diagram of piecing together the method for the one or more inquiry completion tables of generation according to the port for Chinese character of some embodiment.At first, ordered set makes up device 142 from inquiry log 302 retrieval and inquisitions 304.In certain embodiments, inquiry log 302 is stored the historical query information that is associated with specific geographic area (for example, Hong Kong).In some other embodiment, inquiry log 302 storage global history Query Informations.Ordered set makes up whether device 142 inspection inquiries are Chinese (306).(306, not), then ordered set makes up device 142 and generates general prefix clauses and subclauses (308) for this inquiry if it is not Chinese.If inquiry is Chinese (306, be), then ordered set makes up device 142 and generates general prefix clauses and subclauses (308) and port assembly prefix clauses and subclauses (310) for this inquiry.At last, ordered set makes up device 142 with in the general and/or port assembly prefix clauses and subclauses insertion inquiry completion table that is generated (312).
Fig. 3 B and 3C make up how device 142 generates the further details of port assembly prefix clauses and subclauses for Chinese Query process flow diagram according to the diagram ordered set of some embodiment.When receiving Chinese Query (320), ordered set makes up search (322) that device 142 is carried out model file 128, inquires about corresponding clauses and subclauses (324) to confirm whether model file 128 comprises with this.If in model file 128, find corresponding clauses and subclauses (324-is), then this process is retrieved its popularity score value (332) that is associated from the model file retrieval about the port assembly of this Chinese Query with from model file.For example, if the Chinese query was "Andy", the ordered set builder 142 recognition model file 128 corresponding entry (for example, in Figure 2C Table 209-1), and from the model file retrieval Hong Kong fight the epidemic and its associated degree score (332).Otherwise (324-not), ordered set makes up device 142 through query decomposition being become a plurality of subqueries (326), and search (328) to each subquery in the execution model file, comes for this inquiry (330) to be synthesized in port assembly and popularity score value.In certain embodiments, such as Fig. 3 D diagram, ordered set makes up device 142 and recursively carries out this query refinement with table is searched, up to for the clauses and subclauses in each component model of cognition file 128 of inquiring about.The port that use is discerned/synthesized is pieced together and its popularity score value that is associated, and ordered set makes up the candidate prefix of device 142 these inquiries of calculating and gathers and its corresponding popularity score value (334).For each candidate prefix (340), ordered set makes up device 142 and confirms whether its popularity score value is higher than predefine restriction (342).(342, not), then ordered set makes up device 142 and advances to next candidate prefix (if any) (340) of handling in the set if the popularity score value is not higher than the predefine restriction.If the popularity score value is higher than predefine restriction (342, be), then ordered set makes up device 142 then with this candidate prefix with about information inquiring, such as its rank score value, adds in the inquiry completion table 130 (344).Then, ordered set structure device 142 confirms whether this is the last candidate prefix (346) in the set.If current candidate prefix is not last (346, deny) in the set, then ordered set makes up device 142 and advances to next candidate prefix (340) of handling in the set.Otherwise, accomplish process about the candidate prefix set.Notice, be each candidate prefix repetitive operation 340,342,344 and 346 (under suitable situation).
As stated, for given Chinese Query, model file 128 possibly have no corresponding port to piece together.In this case, ordered set makes up device 142 this inquiry of having nothing for it but the assembly of one or more ports is synthesized.Figure 3D depicts the ordered set builder 142 How to complete Chinese query "Andy Lau movie" (352) Synthetic Hong Kong fight, fight to generate candidate Harbor prefix set, and then querying the table accordingly populate an exemplary process.As shown in Figure 3D, is not in the model file 128 and "Andy movie" corresponding to the entry (354).Therefore, the ordered set of the query builder 142 is divided into two sub-queries, "Andy" and "movie" (356).In some embodiments, the builder 142 first ordered set of the last character "shadow" dropped from the query, and to check the rest of the query "Andy electricity" in the model file has a matching entry.Ordered set builder 142 recursively subdivided execute the query until a match is found in the model file "Andy" entries (358).In this case, the ordered set builder 142 for "Andy" 362 retrieves a list of port to fight, and the rest for the query "movie" The same procedure (364).Assumptions in the model file is not for the "Movies" to find any items (364), then the ordered set builder 142 "movie" is divided into two single character (366).For each character, ordered set makes up device 142 and retrieves port assembly tabulation 372 and 374 respectively.Using three Hong Kong fight list, sort the collection builder 142 for the entire query "Andy movie" synthetic Hong Kong fight (376).
In certain embodiments, ordered set make up device 142 through the popularity score value that makes each subquery that together forms complete query 352 multiply each other carry out synthetic.Piece together because each in three subqueries all has two ports, piece together (378) so generate eight synthetic ports.Next, sort the collection builder 142 using eight synthetic Hong Kong fight and its associated popularity score to the query "Andy Lau movie" generate candidate Hong Kong fight prefix (380).For the language-specific such as Guangdong language, ordered set makes up device 142 minimum and maximum length restriction for the prefix definition.In certain embodiments, these parameters are that the user is configurable.The minimum length restriction typically is 2 or 3 characters, but in certain embodiments, can be set to be low to moderate 1.The maximum length restriction typically is 15 to 20 characters, but except that cost, not having the maximum length restriction can not be remarkable reason greater than 20 characters.In certain embodiments, ordered set makes up device 142 and at first the port is joined forms single character string through removing separator, and for example, " lau tak wah din ying " connects to " lautakwahdinying ".Suppose that the restriction of minimum and maximum length is 3 to 5 characters; Ordered set makes up summation that device 142 calculates the popularity score value of piecing together at all eight ports for candidate prefix " lau " (promptly; 1), is candidate prefix " laut " summation (that is, 0.7) of calculating the popularity score value of piecing together at preceding four ports etc. then.Then, ordered set makes up device 142 and filters out its popularity score value and be lower than predefine restriction, for example those candidate prefix (382) of 0.5.As a result, only three prefixs " lau ", " laut " and " lauta " are retained.Ordered set builder 142 and then three prefixes, Chinese query "Andy Lau movie" and its associated ranking scores 38 insert query completion table (386).
Notice that each Chinese character has specific pronunciation, the voice that therefore are associated are represented (for example, phonetic in the mandarin and the port in the Guangdong language are pieced together).The port assembly that can separate different Chinese characters with the user of port assembly input inquiry with space " ", underscore " _ ", hyphen "-" or other separators.Therefore; In certain embodiments; Remove outside the phonetic characters (for example, the port is pieced together) (for example, " laut ") in the binding shown in the table 382 of Fig. 3 D; Ordered set makes up device 142 and also will have in prefix (for example, " laut ") the insertion inquiry completion table of the predefine separator between the assembly of the port of different Chinese characters.Having the example of the port of the separator of insertion piecing together is " laut " and " lau-t ".In certain embodiments, prefix that links and the prefix with predefine separator are integrated with in the same clauses and subclauses in the inquiry completion table.In some other embodiment, prefix that links and the prefix with predefine separator are left the discrete clauses and subclauses in the inquiry completion table.In certain embodiments, the ordered set prefix that makes up the original character form that device 142 also will piece together with the port of correspondence is inserted inquiry and is accomplished in the table.According to the table 378 of Figure 3D, "Andy films" five initial character may be "ltwdy", "ltwty", "ldwdy" or "ldwty".Accordingly, such "ltw" or "ldwt" prefix can be used with Chinese query "Andy Lau movie" relative should be inserted in the table query is completed.In certain embodiments, about the prefix that links, have the prefix homologue of separator and comprise that the complete query (it is represented to accomplish table clause like inquiry) of prediction of the prefix of the original character that corresponding port is pieced together shares identical popularity score value.
With reference to figure 4A, when user input query, the input (401) of FTP client FTP 102 monitoring users.To accomplishing before inquiry sends signal, the part at least of user's inquiry is sent to search engine 108 (403) from FTP client FTP 102 user's (being called as the requestor sometimes).The part of inquiry can be several characters, query terms or more than a query terms.In certain embodiments, partial query is input as a succession of Latin character, it can be the port assembly of English expression or Chinese character.
Each clauses and subclauses in the inquiry completion table comprise the complete query of prediction and such as the frequency of the complete query of prediction or other information of rank score value.Search engine 108 uses said information to construct the complete query prediction sets (415) of ordering.In certain embodiments, this set is sorted according to frequency or rank score value.Search engine 108 returns the subclass at least of the complete query of predicting to client (419) that the complete query of the prediction that receives ordering is given in (417) then.Client advances to the subclass at least (421) of the complete query of the prediction that shows ordering.
Notice that the complete query set of the prediction of ordering can comprise multilingual inquiry, because in the query entries of the possible potential coupling of the partial query of 405 receptions corresponding to the different language in the inquiry completion table 130 of fingerprint 411.The complete query that search engine 108 can be configured to return the hybrid language prediction can be configured to maybe select which kind of language more maybe the predicted portions inquiry actually.
In certain embodiments; Perhaps the complete query of prediction is being sent to client (417) before before in the complete query of predicting is sorted (415); The inquiry that is complementary with one or more words in one or more predefine set of words to remove is filtered in the complete query set of prediction, if there is such inquiry.For example, one or more predefine set of words can comprise be considered to offensive or culture sensitive etc. English word and Guangdong language word.The system that carries out this method can comprise one or more tables (or other data structures) of the one or more predefine set of words of the identification that is stored in the storer.In some other embodiment; Sending complete query to the prediction of client (417) is integrated into the client place and is filtered by client assistant 104; To remove the inquiry that is complementary with one or more words in one or more predefine set of words, if there is such inquiry.Alternatively, a plurality of different filtrators can be used to a plurality of different users groups.In certain embodiments, filtering (carrying out in response to partial query) during the utilization and operation substitutes during the structure of inquiry completion table and filters.
Fig. 4 B illustrates the embodiment that can in the client assistant 104 of FTP client FTP 102, realize.Client assistant's 104 monitoring users are input to (431) in the text input frame with inquiry on FTP client FTP 102.User's input can be one or more characters or one or more speech (the for example character or the symbol of the neologisms of the phrase of first speech of phrase or first two words or first speech and beginning character, compound word).Client assistant 104 can discern two kinds of dissimilar inquiries.First kind, when accomplishing input of character string prior to indicating the user, client assistant 104 receives when input is identified or identification division inquiry (being described below).Second kind, client assistant 104 receives when the user has selected the prediction that represents or indicated the completion input of character string or identification user input.
When user input or when selecting to be identified as complete user and importing, this complete user input is sent to server for handling (451).Server returns search result set, and this set receives (453) by client assistant 104 or by the client application such as browser application.In certain embodiments, the part at least of browser application display of search results in webpage.In some other embodiment, client assistant's 104 display of search results.As an alternative, the transmission (451) of complete user input and can carry out by the mechanism except that client assistant 104 to the reception (453) of Search Results.For example, these operations can (for example, HTTP) browser application be carried out by using standard request and response protocol.
In many ways; During such as " searching " or " search " button in the graphic user interface (GUI) of having imported carriage return or character of equal value during the input of inquiring about as the user, having selected representing to the user; Perhaps through during the input of inquiry, selecting in the query set of the prediction that the user represents, client assistant 104 (or browser or other application) can be identified as complete user's input with user's input.Those skilled in the art will be familiar with the multiple mode that the final input of inquiry is signaled.
Before the user imported signalling to complete user, partial query can be identified.For example, partial query is discerned the input or the deletion of the character in the text input frame through detecting.In case partial query is identified, this part search inquiry promptly is transmitted to server (433).In response to this partial query, server returns the prediction of the complete search inquiry that comprises prediction.Client assistant 104 receives (435) and represents the subclass at least (437) of prediction such as (for example show, expression).
After the complete query (437) that has represented prediction to the user, if confirming in the complete query of prediction one, the user expects that with the user input is complementary, then in the user's complete search inquiry that can select to predict.In some cases, prediction can provide the other information that is not considered to the user.For example, the user can be at heart with the part of an inquiry as search strategy, but see that the complete query of prediction impels the user to change input policing.In case represented set (437), once more the input of monitoring user (431).If the user has selected in the prediction, then send user's input to server (451) as complete query (also being called as complete user's input) at this.After the request of transmitting, the input activity (431) of monitoring user once more.
In certain embodiments, client assistant 104 can be from other the predicting the outcome of server preload (each other the predicting the outcome is the complete query set of prediction) (439).Can use predicting the outcome of preload to improve the speed that user's input is responded.For example, when user input <ban >, except that about the predicting the outcome of <ban >, client assistant 104 can preload about <bana>..., and the predicting the outcome of <bank >.If the user imports a character again, for example < k>generates (part search inquiry) input <bank >, then can partial query transmission (433) do not shown predicting the outcome about <bank>under the situation of server and reception (435) prediction.
In certain embodiments, the one or more set that predict the outcome of ground buffer memory at the client place.In the current inquiry of user's modification during with in the early time part input of reflection (for example through backspace to remove some characters); The set and represent this set to the user once more of predicting the outcome that is associated with in the early time part input from client-cache retrieval, rather than part input is sent to server.
In certain embodiments; Behind the Search Results or document (453) that receive about final input; Perhaps behind the complete search inquiry (437) that shows prediction; And alternatively preload predict the outcome (439), client assistant 104 continues monitoring users inputs (431), for example stops client assistant 104 through closing the webpage that comprises client assistant 104 until the user.In some other embodiment, client assistant 104 only continues monitoring user input (431) at text input frame (being discussed with reference to figure 7A below) when being activated, and suspends during by inactivation at the text input frame and to keep watch on.In certain embodiments; When the text input frame in user interface shows in the current active window of browser application or toolbar; Text input frame is activated; And be not shown or text input frame not in the active window of browser application or toolbar the time when the text input frame, text input frame is by inactivation.
With reference to figure 4C, the example data structure of inquiry completion table 130 comprises partial query item list 470.In certain embodiments, use many known arrangement that the partial query clauses and subclauses are encoded into fingerprint.Partial query can be the English phrase of Chinese phrase or character or the part that the port is pieced together.Each partial query clauses and subclauses is pointed to the complete query tabulation (470-1 to 470-5) of prediction.For example, the forecast includes a complete list of queries 470-1 English Query (for example, "las? Vegas" and "law? Firm") and Chinese queries (eg, "Andy" and "Lau Sik Ming") both.A complete query with an associated ranking value (for example, for "las? Vegas" 120, and for the "Andy" 108).
In certain embodiments, search engine 108 can receive the inquiry of a kind of language (for example, English) with the much higher submission frequency of inquiry than other language (for example, Chinese).The results, as "Andy" Although some Chinese queries specific user groups (for example, people in Hong Kong) is very popular among, but more than match partial query "la" Many English queries at a much lower ranking score.Therefore; In certain embodiments, the rank score value or reduce with other language of the rank score value of the inquiry of different language through increasing those inquiries that write with the employed native language of customer group writes and the rank score value of few those inquiries used of customer group is adjusted.By doing so, as "Andy," the Chinese queries can predict the complete or near the top of the list of queries appears.
Fig. 4 D schematically illustrates to be used for generated query completion table and to be used for when the partial query of process user input, searching the block diagram of both processes.When the length of partial query (for example, " la ") during less than the big or small C (for example, 4) of " chunk ", for example through use hash function (or other fingerprint functions) 409 with the entire portion query mappings to query fingerprints 411 (Fig. 4 A).To the mapping of showing 482 fingerprint 411 is mapped to inquiry completion table 130-1 through fingerprint.
When the length of partial query is the big or small C of at least one chunk, partial query (for example, " lauta " or " lauda ") is resolved into prefix 484 and suffix 486, its length is by the chunk sizes regulation.For example come for prefix 484 generates fingerprint, to mapping 483-1 that shows or 483-2 this fingerprint is mapped to corresponding " chunkization " inquiry completion table 130-2 or 130-3 through fingerprint then through hash function 409 being applied to prefix 484.In certain embodiments, inquiry completion table 130-2 of each chunkization or 130-3 are the entry set in bigger inquiry completion table, and in other embodiments, the inquiry completion table of each chunkization is discrete data structure.Each clauses and subclauses 488-P or 490-q of each inquiry completion table comprise inquiry string 494, and it be the text of the complete query of corresponding language, and can comprise alternatively and be used for the popularity score value 498 that sorts in the clauses and subclauses of inquiring about the completion table.Each clauses and subclauses of the inquiry completion table of chunkization comprise the suffix of corresponding partial query.It can be the length S of any value from zero to C-1 that suffix 496 in each clauses and subclauses has, and comprises the zero or a plurality of characters in the prefix 484 that are not included in of partial query.In certain embodiments, when accomplishing table clause, in the inquiry completion table 130 of corresponding chunkization, only generate one and the corresponding clauses and subclauses of this historical query for the historical query generated query.Especially, these clauses and subclauses comprises the longest possible suffix about this historical query, and nearly C-1 character is long.In other embodiments, for the particular historical inquiry generates nearly C clauses and subclauses, each clauses and subclauses is used for each different suffix in the inquiry completion table 130 of each chunkization.
Alternatively, each clauses and subclauses in each inquiry completion table 130 comprise the language value or the designator 492 of the language that indication is associated with complete query.Yet, be stored in its source language among the embodiment in the inquiry completion table 130 at all inquiry strings, can omit language value 492.
As shown in Figure 4D, the same Chinese query "Andy" with the query completes an entry in the table 130-2 488-2 and 130-3 in the query to complete an entry in the table 490-2.Clauses and subclauses 488-2 pieces together " lau tak wah " corresponding to the port and clauses and subclauses 490-2 pieces together " lau dak wah " corresponding to the port.Therefore, respectively two partial queries " lauta " are mapped to two different inquiry completion table 130-2 and 130-3 with " lauda ".A plurality of clauses and subclauses in suffix portion of these two partial queries " a " and the respective queries completion table are complementary.In certain embodiments, predictive server 112 identification respective queries are accomplished the complete query of the coupling in the table, and according to its corresponding popularity score value they are sorted, up to the complete query that finds predefine quantity.At least the subclass of the complete query of these identifications is sent to relative client 102 as the inquiry of suggestion to be selected for the user.
In certain embodiments, search engine 108 is safeguarded a plurality of copies of the partial query that the port is pieced together in inquiry completion table, and some do not have space-separated symbol " " and some to have separator.In certain embodiments, the different copies of same partial query point to same prediction complete query tabulation (for example, 470-5).In some other embodiment, different copies is used as the different portions inquiry treats, and each has the complete query tabulation of the prediction of himself.

Corresponding with the instruction in the computer-readable recording medium that is stored in each FTP client FTP, server or other computer systems in the operation shown in the process flow diagram among Fig. 2 A, 3A-3C and the 4A-4B with other operations that in this document, are described to by execution such as FTP client FTP, server, search engines.The example of such computer-readable recording medium has been shown in Fig. 5 (storer 506) and Fig. 6 (storer 606).The software module of in this document, describing, program and/or can carry out in the function each is corresponding with the instruction in being stored in each computer-readable recording medium, and corresponding with the instruction set that is used to carry out above-mentioned functions.Institute's module identified, program and/or function (being instruction set) needn't realize as independently software program, process or module, so each subset of these modules can be combined in various embodiments or arrange again.
The schematic screen shot of the corresponding English of inquiry and web browser, the webpage that in the web browser, shows or other user interfaces of the complete query of the prediction of Chinese is pieced together at the part port that Fig. 7 A to 7G has described to provide with the user according to listing of some embodiment.
Shown in Fig. 7 A, screenshotss 710 are the webpages at the client device place.The partial query that in the text box of webpage, exists the user to import, it is made up of Latin character string " laut " 712.Remote search engines is in response to this partial query, and the complete query tabulation of the prediction of ordering is returned to client device.The subclass at least that in screenshotss 710, shows sorted lists.
In certain embodiments, the user of importation inquiry is identified as the people of Guangdong language.For example, the user can be that this expression made in Guangdong language through in submitting to the user profiles of search engine, specifying his or her first-selected language.As an alternative, search engine can be inferred user's language preference based on the IP address of the client device of submitting partial query to.In other words, the user of the partial query of the client computer in next comfortable Hong Kong indication input inquiry possibly be the people who says Guangdong language.In more another embodiment, search engine can indicate submit to specific website partial query from the people who says Guangdong language.For example, suppose that most of user of website (for example, http://www.google.com.hk) is positioned at Hong Kong or relevant with Hong Kong at least in some aspects, they more possibly import the port assembly so, because the major part among them is to say the people of Guangdong language.
In the example shown in Figure 7A, the Chinese query "Andy" 714 is shown as the highest ranking score predicted the complete query, because some of the queries "laut" is the most popular Hong Kong fight "lau? Tak? Wah" (see, for example in Figure 2C 209-1) prefix, as well as Chinese query "Andy" 714 to complete the table with the query string "laut" corresponds at the top of the list (see example in Figure 4C 470-5).The place that the complete query " lauterbrunnen " 716 of second prediction is meant in Switzerland.Although it is with the German form, partial query " laut " is the prefix of " lauterbrunnen ".In contrast, the third and fourth queries are complete English word "laughing" 718 and Hong Kong Island "Dirty," the voice said that "lantau" 720.Notice that partial query " laut " is different from four character prefixs of " laughing " 718 and " lantau " 720.In other words, embodiments of the invention can be made multilingual fuzzy prediction based on partial query.
In the example shown in Fig. 7 B, partial query is " lauta " 722, and it is more to approach the character that " lau tak wah " pieced together at the port.Result, Chinese query "Andy" 726 is still top of the list, as well as "Andy" started many other full query 728 is raised to another query on top.
In the example shown in Fig. 7 C, partial query is " laud " 730.Notice that this Latin character string is different from previous two partial queries, because the 4th character changed into " d " from " t ".However, according to the model shown in Figure 2C document, "lau? Dak? Wak" is of a lower popularity score of "Andy" fight the other port.Result, Chinese query "Andy" 736 is listed as a complete forecast of a query, even though it is on the part of the query "laud" number of other popular query 732,734 lead.In other words, embodiments of the invention can provide the complete query of one or more identical predictions in response to two partial queries, wherein between these two partial queries, have one or more differences.Obtain this dirigibility from the following fact: for same Chinese phrase or character, model file can have a plurality of ports to be pieced together.
In addition, embodiments of the invention are not provided with restriction to the different position between the kinds of characters string.For example, shown in Fig. 7 D and the 7E, two partial queries " boma " 740 differ from one another with " poma " 750 beginning characters as respectively.However, in both cases, the search engine returns one or more identical query, such as "BMW" (742 in Figure 7D, Figure 7E, 752) and "BMW Hill" (744 in Figure 7D, 7E in FIG. 754).In certain embodiments, be different in response to the position of the identical complete query of different portions inquiry, because the different portions inquiry can be pieced together corresponding to the different ports with different popularity score values.
In the example shown in Fig. 7 F and the 7G, partial query is respectively " lau ta " 760 and " ltw ".As stated, the complete query of predicting with the corresponding Chinese of these two partial queries is identical, and shares identical popularity score value with the homologue " lauta " of its binding.Therefore, in each case, the search engine returns a corresponding to "Andy" a collection of 762,766 beginning Chinese recommendations.
Although some accompanying drawing in each accompanying drawing illustrates a plurality of logical stages with particular order, the stage that does not rely on order can be resequenced, and other stages can be combined or decompose.Though specific some rearrangements or other mentioned gathers group, other rearrangement or to gather group will be conspicuous to those of ordinary skills, and therefore do not represent for the exhaustive list of selecting scheme.In addition, will be appreciated that the stage can realize with hardware, firmware, software or its any combination.
