Abstract
Systems and techniques are provided for optimizing personalized recommendations with longitudinal data and a future objective. An identifier may be received for content items. A user content item history including a list identifying a previously acquired content item may be received. Content item metadata may be received including a correlation between the previously acquired content item and a content item for which an identifier was received, and a correlation between a content item for which an identifier was received and fulfillment of a future objective. A joint probability may be determined for each content item based on the user content item history and the content item metadata, including the probability that the content item will be acquired by the user after being recommended to the user and that a future objective will be fulfilled after the content item is acquired by the user.
Description
- Users of a content ecosystem may acquire for use with their various computing devices, by downloading or requesting authorization to access, applications and other content, such as music, movies, TV shows, and electronic books. For example, a user may download and install applications on a smartphone, or gain authorization to access a music track on all computing devices to which the user is logged-in using their content ecosystem account. When a user searches through the various types of content available through the content ecosystem, he may discover several alternatives that match what he is looking for. For example, the user may wish to download a weather application to their smartphone. The content ecosystem may include several different weather applications, some of which may be free and some of which may need to be purchased.
- The content ecosystem may make recommendations to the user as to what content the user should acquire. The recommendations may be made in response to a search by the user and may be based on the user's search query and other data available about the user, or may be made whenever the user browses through the content available through the content ecosystem. It may be in the financial interests of the application ecosystem to recommend content which needs to be purchased over free content. However, only recommending content which needs to be purchased may decrease the user's trust in and satisfaction with the application ecosystem, resulting in the user downloading or requesting authorization to access fewer items of content than were recommended by the content ecosystem. This may also result in lower ratings for content that the user does purchase. For example, the content ecosystem may recommend that the user install a weather application that needs to be purchased over a free weather application. The user may not trust that the recommended weather application is better than the free weather application if the user has noticed that the content ecosystem mostly recommends applications that need to be purchased.
- According to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter an identifier may be received for two or more content items. A user content item history may be received for a user. The user content item history may include a list identifying a previously acquired content item. Content item metadata may be received including a correlation between the previously acquired content item and one of the content items for which an identifier was received, and a correlation between one of the content items for which an identifier was received and a fulfillment of a future objective. A joint probability may be determined for each of the two or more content items based on the user content item history and the content item metadata. The joint probability for one of the content items may include the probability that the content item will be acquired by the user after being recommended to the user and that a future objective will be fulfilled after the content item is acquired by the user. The content item identifier for the content item with the highest joint probability from the two or more content items may be sent to be viewed by the user.
- Fulfilling the future objective may include the user rating the content item with the highest joint probability, the user reviewing the content item with the highest joint probability, the user recommending the content item with the highest joint probability, or the user purchasing another content item different from the content item with the highest joint probability within a specified timeframe. The content item may be an application, a music track, a music album, a TV show episode, a TV show season, or a movie.
- The joint probability may be determined according to
-
P(Y=1|x 0 ,x 1 , . . . ,x t)×T xt xt+1 (1)+(1−P(Y=|x 0 ,x 1 , . . . ,x t))T xt xt+1 (0) - where x0 is a null content item, x1, . . . , xt is the user content item history, Y represents whether or not the future objective will be met, xt+1 is the content item for which the joint probability is being determined, Tx
t xt+1 (0) is a transition probability when the future objective will not be met, Txt xt+1 (1) is a transition probability when the future objective will be met, and x0=0 represents when there are no content items in the user content item history. - Tx
t dt+1 (1) may be determined according to P(Xt+1=k|Xt=j, Y=1) and Txt xt+1 (0) may be determined according to P(Xt+1=k|Xt=j, Y=0). - P(Xt+1=k|Xt=j, Y=1) and P(Xt+1=k|Xt=j, Y=0) may be determined based on the user content item history and content item metadata. P(Y=1|x0, x1, . . . , xt) may be determined according to

FIG. 4 shows a computer according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIG. 5 shows a network configuration according to an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. - Recommendations of content items made to users of a content ecosystem may be optimized using longitudinal data about the user to increase the probability that the user will not only adopt the recommended content item, but will also fulfill some future objective, for example, exhibiting some desired future behavior such as purchasing a premium version of the same or another content item. The future objective may generally be to have the user take some second action in addition to acquiring the recommended content item. The content ecosystem may be used for the distribution of applications and other content, similar to an application ecosystem. For example, a storefront for the content ecosystem may present a user with an application recommendation. The application selected for recommendation to the user may be the application that has the highest joint probability of the user choosing to install the recommended application, based on the user's previously installed applications and metadata about the applications in the content ecosystem, and choosing to purchase another application within the next two weeks after adopting the recommended application. Recommending content items with a future objective may result in user's being recommended different content items than content items selected to maximize the probability that the user would adopt the recommended content item, or to maximize the monetization of the recommended content item. Longitudinal data may be used to determine what content item to recommend to a user based on the user's history of acquiring content items and correlations between other users' acquisitions of content items and fulfillment of future objectives after content item acquisitions, which may be found in content item metadata.
- A user may use any suitable computing device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or smart television, to access the storefront for a content ecosystem. The storefront may be used by the content ecosystem for distribution of content items, including applications and other suitable content types of content items. The content items may be, for example, applications, music tracks and albums, e-books, movies, TV shows and other videos, or any other content suitable for electronic distribution. In some implementations, the content items may also be any purchasable item, including physical copies of media such as books, CD's, and DVD's, or other goods. The content items may also be recommendations, for example, for restaurants, shops, activities, travel locations, and so on. The content ecosystem may make recommendations to the user of which content items the users should acquire next. For example, the storefront displayed on the user's computing device may include a section with recommendations from among all of the content items distributed by the application system, or from different categories of the content items. For example, the storefront may display recommendations for what music the user should purchase next separately from recommendations for which applications the user should install next. The recommendations may also be linked to a search performed by the user. For example, the user may perform a search for weather applications, and search results which satisfy the search query for a weather application may be presented in a way that indicates some weather applications are being recommended over others. The content ecosystem may also use other communication channels to recommend content items to the user, for example, sending recommendations via email.
- To select a content item to recommend to the user, the content ecosystem may evaluate the content items in the content ecosystem to determine the probability that the user will both adopt a recommended content item and, at some point in the future after adopting the recommended content item, behave in a desired manner, for example, purchasing a future content item. The recommendation may take into account longitudinal data about the user. The longitudinal data may be, for example, data indicating the user's previous acquisitions of content items and the order in which those acquisitions occurred. The longitudinal data may be, for example, a content item history for the user. The recommendation may also use metadata for the content items distributed by the content ecosystem. The content item metadata may include correlations between the acquisitions of different content item by users of the content ecosystem. The content item metadata may indicate how often users followed the acquisition of a first content item with a second content item, as found in the content item histories for the users of the content ecosystem, and how often a future objective was fulfilled after users acquired the second content item. For example, the content item metadata may indicate that 15% of users who installed a specific weather application next installed a specific travel application, and 5% of those users purchased an additional application within the next two weeks. The content item metadata may allow for the determination of transition probabilities between content items.
- The recommendation made by the content ecosystem may maximize the joint probability that the user will adopt the recommended content item and that the user will behave in a desired manner in the future after adopting the recommended content item. The desired behavior may be a future objective, for example, having the user purchase a content item within the next two weeks, give a high rating to a content item, write a review of a content item, recommend a content item to a friend, or any other suitable second action on the part of the user that is in addition to the first action of the user acquiring the recommended application. Using a future objective in recommending the content item may prevent the content ecosystem from only recommending content items that the user needs to purchase, as the content ecosystem may recommend free content items which may result in increased probabilities of a future purchase by the user. This may also increase the user's satisfaction with both the content items and the content ecosystem, as users may be dissatisfied when they are mostly recommended content items that need to be purchased.
- The content item to be recommended by the content ecosystem may be determined according to:
-
i=argmaxiε{1, . . . ,N} P(Y=1,X t+1 =i|R t+1 =i,Z,X 0 ,X 1 , . . . ,X t) (1) - where Xt+1 represents the next content item that the user will acquire, Rt+1 represents the content item that will be recommended to the user, Z represents demographic data about the user, X0 may represent a null content item, X1, . . . , Xt represents the longitudinal data, or content item history, for the user, Xt represents the most recent content item acquired by the user, Y represents whether or not the future objective will be met, with a value of 1 indicting the future objective will be met and a value of 0 indicating the future objective will not be met, N represents the number of content items distributed by the content ecosystem that the recommended application will be chosen from, and i represents the content item being evaluated.
- According to (1), the content item recommended to the user by the content ecosystem may be the content item with the highest probability of being the content item that is acquired next by the user when recommended while still having the future objective fulfilled after the user acquires the recommended content item, given the user's demographic data and content item history. For example, a content item which will not result in the future objective being fulfilled may not be recommended even if the probability that the user will adopt the content item is 100%, as the content item's joint probability according to (1) would be 0% due to Y being equal to 0.
- Based on (1), for any valid content item i:
-
P(Y=1,X t+1 =i|R t+1 =i,Z,X 1 , . . . ,X t)=P(Y=1,X t+1 =R t+1 |Z,X 0 ,X 1 , . . . ,X t), (2) - which allows (1) to be simplified to
-
i=argmaxiεvalid-subset-of-{1, . . . ,N} P(Y=1,X t+1 =i|Z,X 0 ,X 1 , . . . ,X t). (3) - The joint probability on the right-hand side of (3) may be decomposed into:
-
P(X t+1 =i|Z,X 1 , . . . ,X t)×P(Y=1|Z,X 0 ,X 1 , . . . ,X t ,X t+1 =i) (4) - where the first term of the joint probability represents the probability that the user will adopt the content item i given the user's demographic data and content item history, and the second term of the joint probability represents the probability that the future objective will be fulfilled, for example, the user will take the desired second action, given the user's demographic data and content item history and given that the user has most recently acquired the recommended content item i. For any given user and content item i, the first term (4) may be the user's adoption probability for i, and the second term may be the user's future objective probability given adoption of the content item i.
- Demographic data for the user, represented by Z, may be static, and may be omitted from derivations of the joint probabilities. The term xt may be a particular value that Xt may take. The term x0 may be defined as 0, which may represent a null content item, and x1:t may be an abbreviation of the vector x1 . . . xt. Using Bayes theorem:
-
- According to the chain rule, for yε{0,1}:
-
P(x 0 ,x 1 , . . . ,x t |Y=y)=Πs=1 t P(x s |Y=y,x 0 , . . . ,x s−1) (6) - where y represents the possible outcomes for the future objective Y.
- The complexity of the probability determination may therefore be concentrated on the ratio:
-
P(x t |Y=1,x 0 , . . . ,x t−1)/P(x s |Y=0,x 0 , . . . ,x t−1) (7) - There may be a strong autocorrelation between x1, . . . , xt. For example, the content item xt may have a strong correlation with xt−1, and xt+1. The most recently acquired content item in a user's content item history, for example, the content item xt may serve as a proxy for the series of content item acquisitions previous to xt in the user's content item history, allowing for the evaluation of which content item to recommend next to be done according to:
-
P(x t |Y,x 0 . . . ,x t−1)≈P(x t |Y,x t−1) (8) - The probability may then be approximated by:
-
- where {circumflex over (P)} may be the approximate probability for the content item xt+1 that the future objective will be fulfilled. rx
t xt+1 may be evaluated based on: -
- Transition probabilities conditional on the value of Y may be evaluated according to:
-
T jk(y)=P(X t+1 =k|X t =j,Y=y) (11) - According to (11), (10) may be restated as:
-
r jk =T jk(1)/T jk(0) (12) - The transition probabilities according to (11) may be determined using content item histories from the users of the content ecosystem. For example, the number of times content items appear in sequence in the content item histories may be counted, and correlated with indications of fulfillment of the future objective. For example, the number of times a user of the content ecosystem purchased an application within two weeks of acquiring a specific application, in sequence with a specific previous application, may be counted. In the case of sparse data for content items, statistical techniques such as regularization may be used in the evaluation of the transition probabilities. (9), as evaluated using (10), (11), and (12), may be used to evaluate the future objective probability for any given user and content item.
- Users of the content ecosystem may be divided into two subsets according to the potential outcomes for Y, which may be that the future objective was or was not fulfilled. The transition probabilities, as given in (11), may be dependent on the value of Y. The adoption probability may be decomposed according to:
-
P(X t+1 |X 0 ,X 1 , . . . ,X t)=Σyε{0,1 }P(Y=y|X 0 ,X 1 , . . . ,X t)×P(X t+1 |Y=y,X 0 ,X 1 , . . . ,X t) (13) - The joint probability that a content item will both be adopted by the user when recommended and will lead to the fulfillment of the future object may then be evaluated according to:
-
P(Y=1|x 0 ,x 1 , . . . ,x t)×T xt xt+1 (1)+(1−P(Y=1|x 0 ,x 1 , . . . ,x t))T xt xt+1 (0) (14) - where P(Y=1|x0, x1, . . . ,xt) may be evaluated according to (9).
- Equation (14) may be used to evaluate the joint probabilities for any subset of the content items in the content ecosystem that are being considered for recommendation to a user. The content item with the highest joint probability may be recommended to the user. For example, a content item may be determined to have an adoption probability when recommended to a specific user of 30%, and a future objective probability of 50%. The joint probability for the content item for the specific user may be 15%. This may indicate that when the content item is recommended to the specific user, there is a 15% chance that the user will both acquire the recommended content item and that the future objective will be fulfilled.

FIG. 1 shows an example system suitable for optimizing personalized recommendations with longitudinal data and a future objective according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. Acomputing device 100 may include acontent ecosystem 120, which may include acontent recommender 110 andstorage 140. Thecomputing device 100 may be any suitable device, such as, for example, acomputer 20 as described inFIG. 4 , for implementing thecontent recommender 110 and thestorage 140. Thecomputing device 100 may be a single computing device, or may include multiple connected computing devices, and may be, for example, a server that hosts a content ecosystem. Thecontent recommender 110 may use thecontent item metadata 160 and usercontent item histories 170 to determine whichcontent item content database 150 to recommend to a user. Thestorage 140 may store thecontent database 150, thecontent item metadata 160, and the usercontent item histories 170. - The
content ecosystem 120 may be, for example, similar to an application ecosystem, and may include content items other than applications. Users may use thecontent ecosystem 120 to acquire and manage their content items, for example, downloading and installing applications on the user's computing devices and gaining access to music and other media. Content items in thecontent ecosystem 120 may be acquired by the user for free, or may require the user to purchase them. Thecontent database 150 may include content items, such as thecontent items content ecosystem 120. For example, thecontent items content ecosystem 120. - The
content item metadata 160 may include data indicating relationships between the various content items in thecontent database 150. Thecontent item metadata 160 may indicate, for example, how often a particular content item is acquired by users immediately preceding another content item. For example, thecontent item metadata 160 may indicate that 25% of users who acquire thecontent item 153 next acquire thecontent item 151. Thecontent item metadata 160 may also include indications of the fulfillment of future objectives by users after the acquisition of content items. For example, thecontent item metadata 160 may indicate how frequently users who installed an application wrote a review of the application, rated the application highly, recommended the application to a friend, or purchased another application, within two weeks of installing the application. - The user
content item histories 170 may include longitudinal data for users of thecontent ecosystem 120. The longitudinal data may include the sequences of content item acquisitions by the users of thecontent ecosystem 120. For example, the usercontent item histories 170 may include, for a specific user, a sequence indicating that the user acquired, in order, thecontent item 155, thecontent item 157, and thecontent item 151. The usercontent item histories 170 may include records of user actions with regard to content items that may be related to future objectives. For example, the usercontent item histories 170 may include each time a user wrote a review of a content item, recommended a content item, rated a content item, or purchased a content item, and how long it took the user to perform these actions after acquiring the content item. For example, the usercontent item histories 170 for a specific user may indicate that the user acquired thecontent item 151, and three days later purchased thecontent item 153. Thecontent item metadata 160 may be determined by counting the appearances of content items in sequence and instances of the fulfillment of future objectives in the usercontent item histories 170, for example, to allow for the evaluation of transition probabilities according to (11). - The
content recommender 110 may be any suitable component of thecontent ecosystem 120 for recommending one of the content items, such as thecontent items content database 150. Thecontent recommender 110 may use thecontent item metadata 160 and the usercontent item histories 170 to determine which of thecontent items -
FIG. 2 shows an example arrangement for optimizing personalized recommendations with longitudinal data and a future objective according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. Theclient device 200 may be used to access thecontent ecosystem 120 on thecomputing device 100. Theclient device 200 may be any suitable computing device for use with thecontent ecosystem 120, such as, for example, a smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer or smart television. Acontent ecosystem client 210 may be an application on theclient device 200 used to access thecontent ecosystem 120, allowing the user to view and interact with thecontent ecosystem 120, for example, to acquire content items from thecontent database 150 and perform other functions related to content items, such as removing previously acquired content items, writing reviews of content items, rating content items, and recommending content items to other users. - A user account identifier, which may identify the account of the user using the
content ecosystem client 210, may be sent to thecontent ecosystem 120 on thecomputing device 100. Thecontent recommender 110 may use the user account identifier when determining which user content item history to use from the usercontent item histories 170, in order to determine which of thecontent items content database 150. Thecontent recommender 110 may use the user content item history from the usercontent item histories 170 and thecontent item metadata 160 to evaluate the joint probabilities for any subset of the content items in thecontent database 150 according to (14). For example, thecontent recommender 110 may evaluate the joint probabilities for all of thecontent items content recommender 110 may also evaluate only a subset of the content items. For example, the user may navigate to a section of thecontent ecosystem client 210 that displays only one specific type of content, such as TV shows. Thecontent recommender 110 may then only evaluate thecontent items content items - The
content recommender 110 may determine which of the evaluated content items has the highest joint probability according to (14), and recommend that content item to the user of theclient device 200. Thecontent recommender 110 may send an identifier to theclient device 200 for the recommended content item which may be, for example, the name of the content item, an icon for the content item, or a link to a section of thecontent ecosystem client 210 where the content item can be acquired. For example, thecontent recommender 110 may determine that thecontent item 153 has the highest joint probability according to (14) of being both adopted by the user of theclient device 200, and leading to fulfillment of the future objective after being adopted by the user. Thecontent recommender 110 may send an identifier for thecontent item 153 to theclient device 200, where the identifier may be displayed to the user through thecontent ecosystem client 210. - The
content recommender 110 may also send recommendations to theclient device 200 when thecontent ecosystem client 210 is not in use. For example, thecontent recommender 110 may send an email to an email address associated with the user of theclient device 200 with content item recommendations, and may determine the appropriate user content item history based on an account associated with the email address. -
FIG. 3 shows an example of a process for optimizing personalized recommendations with longitudinal data and a future objective according to an implementation of the disclosed subject matter. At 300, a user content item history may be received. For example, thecontent recommender 110 may receive the user content item history for a user to whom a recommendation is being sent from the usercontent item histories 170. The correct user content item history may be identified based on a received user account identifier, or in any other suitable manner, such as, for example, based on an email address to which the recommendation will be sent. Thecontent recommender 110 may extract the identity of the last acquired content item from the user content item history. If the user has not acquired any content items previously, the user content item history may include a null content item which may be used as the previously acquired content item. - At 302, content item metadata may be received. For example, the
content recommender 110 may receive thecontent item metadata 160. Thecontent recommender 110 may use thecontent item metadata 160 to evaluate correlations among various content items from thecontent database 150 and between the content items and fulfillment of future objectives. - At 304, content item identifiers may be received. The
content recommender 110 may receive content item identifiers indicating which of the content items from thecontent database 150 thecontent recommender 110 will evaluate a joint probability for. The content item identifiers may allow thecontent recommender 110 to determine which data from thecontent item metadata 160 may be useful in the evaluation of the joint probability. For example, if the content recommender receives the content item identifiers for thecontent items content item 157, thecontent recommender 110 may not need any data from thecontent item metadata 160 concerning fulfillment of future objectives after the acquisition of thecontent item 157. No joint probability may be evaluated for thecontent item 157. The content item identifiers received by thecontent recommender 110 may include identifiers for all of the content items in thecontent database 150, or any subset of the content items, such as, for example, only content items that are applications. - At 306, the joint adoption and future objective probability may be determined for content items. For example, the
content recommender 110 may use data from the user content item history, for example, the identity of the last content item acquired by the user, and thecontent item metadata 160 to determine the joint probability for the content items from thecontent database 150. Thecontent recommender 110 may determine joint probabilities for all of the content items in thecontent database 150, or the subset of content items for which identifiers were received. For example, the content recommender may determine a joint probability for each of thecontent item - At 308, the content item identifier for the content item with the highest joint adoption and future objective probability may be sent. For example, the
content recommender 110 may send an identifier for the content item with the highest joint probability to theclient device 200, to be displayed to the user in any suitable manner, for example, using thecontent ecosystem client 210, via email, or via any other suitable communications channel. For example, thecontent item 151 may have a joint probability of 25%, which may be higher than the joint probabilities for thecontent items content recommender 110 may send an identifier for thecontent item 151 to theclient device 200, as recommending thecontent item 151 to the user may result in the highest likelihood that the user will acquire thecontent item 151 and that the future objective will subsequently be fulfilled, for example, by the user purchasing a different content item within two weeks. - Embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in and used with a variety of component and network architectures.
