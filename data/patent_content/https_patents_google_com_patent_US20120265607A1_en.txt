- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document.
- This document describes systems and methods for displaying content items (e.g., advertisements or ads) that use a click-to-reveal format.
- the click-to-reveal format can serve to obscure contact information associated with an ad's sponsor in ads presented for a content sponsor that do not include a landing page or web site to which the user can be directed after clicking on (or interacting with) the ad.
- content sponsor 109 for example, online advertisement management systems can initially obscure the contact information when the ad is presented.
- the content sponsor can subsequently be charged for presentation of the ad when, for example, the user (e.g., a potential customer) invokes a control to reveal the contact information, e.g., a phone number, an email address, an SMS short code, and/or a physical address associated with the sponsor. Other billing arrangements are possible.
- content items that have the click-to-reveal format can be used on publisher web pages, in mobile apps, email, etc.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a content item is provided for which at least part of the contact information associated with the content item sponsor is obscured.
- the environment 100 includes a search system 110 that provides search services and a content management system 120 that provides content items (e.g., ads) including content items that display contact information, some of which can be obscured upon initial display.
- the environment 100 includes a network 102 , e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination of them, that connects publishers 103 , user devices 106 , the search system 110 , and the content management system 120 .
- the environment 100 may include many thousands of publishers 103 , content sponsors 109 , and user devices 106 .
- the content sponsors 109 can include advertisers who may not have a significant presence on the Internet.
- some content sponsors 109 can sponsor content items (e.g., stored as click-to-reveal content items 126 ) that, instead of directing the user to a resource associated with the content, provide contact information by which the user can contact the sponsor (e.g., a business entity such as a store, restaurant, etc.) who sponsored the ad.
- Example types of contact information include telephone numbers, email addresses, SMS short messages, and physical addresses.
- an indication can be sent to the content management system 120 , e.g., for storage in revealed content items logs 128 .
- information in the revealed content items logs 128 can be used to charge content sponsors 109 , based on the indication that users have clicked or otherwise interacted with the content items to reveal the complete contact information in the content items.
- information stored in the revealed content items logs 128 including indications that users have revealed complete contact information for a content item (e.g., an ad), can be used to update a quality score for the content item (e.g., to measure effectiveness of the ad). For example, quality scores can be used to control subsequent presentations of the content item.
- a web site 104 can include one or more resources 108 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example web site is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements (e.g., scripts).
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each web site 104 can be maintained by a publisher 103 , e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web property.
- a resource 108 is any data that can be provided by the web site 104 over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources 108 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name a few examples.
- the resources 108 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds, and may include embedded information (e.g., meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (e.g., JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, e.g., a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the search system 110 can identify the resources 108 by crawling and indexing the resources 108 provided by the publishers 103 . Data about the resources 108 can be indexed based on the resource 108 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 108 are stored in a search index 112 .
- the user devices 106 submit search queries 114 to the search system 110 .
- the search system 110 accesses the search index 112 to identify resources 108 that are predicted to be relevant to the search query 114 , for example based on relevance scores that have been computed for the resources 108 .
- the search system 110 selects resources 108 , generates search results 116 that identify the resources 108 , and returns the search results 116 to the user devices 106 .
- a search result 116 is data generated by the search system 110 that references a resource 108 that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes an active link (e.g., a URL) to the resource.
- An example search result 116 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- User devices 106 receive the search results 116 and render the search results 116 , for example, in the form of one or more web pages, for presentation to users.
- the user device 106 requests the resource 108 referenced by the link.
- the web site 104 hosting the resource 108 receives the request for the resource 108 from the user device 106 and provides the resource 108 to the requesting user device 106 .
- Search queries 114 submitted during user sessions are stored in a data store such as a search log data store 118 .
- Selection data specifying user actions taken in response to search results 116 provided are also stored in a data store such as the search log data store 118 . These actions can include whether a search result was selected by a user.
- location data specifying a locality of the user device that submitted the search query can also be stored in the search log data store 118 .
- the data stored in the search log data store 118 can be used to map search queries 114 submitted during search sessions to resources 108 that were identified in search results 116 and the actions taken by users.
- the search log data store 118 can be anonymized so that the privacy of users is protected.
- quasi-unique identifiers can be associated with users, but the actual identifying information of the users is not stored in the search log data store 118 .
- any identified user preferences or user interactions can be generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user. Encryption and obfuscation techniques can also be used to protect the privacy of users.
- Search results 116 are selected to be provided to a user device 106 in response to a search query 114 based on initial result scores.
- Result scores are scores that represent a measure of relevance (e.g., a predicted relevance) of the resource 108 to a search query.
- a result score for a resource 108 can be computed based on an information retrieval (“IR”) score corresponding to the resource 108 and, optionally, a quality score of the resource 108 relative to other available resources.
- IR information retrieval
- a presentation order for the search results 116 can be selected based on the result scores.
- data that causes presentation of the search results 116 according to the presentation order can be provided to the user device 106 .
- the search results 116 can include content items, such as click-to-reveal ads, and user interactions with the ads to reveal the complete contact information can be measured (e.g., by the content management system 120 ).
- One example publisher 103 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server can submit a request for ads to an advertisement server in the content management system 120 .
- an ad request can be embedded in content from the publisher being rendered on a user device such that the user device (e.g., a browser) submits the ad request.
- the ad request can include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content
- a category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server or a client browser combines the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 .
- the combined content and ads can be sent and rendered to the user devices 106 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the ads back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- the content and ads are combined separately, for example, content can be rendered while waiting for ads to be received and incorporated into the content.
- one or more publishers 103 submit requests for ads to the content management system 120 .
- the content management system 120 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 103 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property. For example, if a publisher 103 publishes a sports-related web site, the advertising management system can provide sports-related ads to the publisher 103 .
- the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with the user, e.g., by the execution of a particular script (e.g., JavaScript) when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- a particular script e.g., JavaScript
- a mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone).
- the mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar to publishers 103 described above, the ads can be received from the content management system 120 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- the content management system 120 can include plural engines.
- a click-to-reveal content item engine 122 can provide a content item to the user device 106 responsive to a received request.
- the content item can include contact information for the content sponsor 109 associated with the content item and instructions operable to obscure at least a portion of the contact information from initial view when the content item is first displayed on the user device 106 .
- the content item can also include instructions to generate a control for displaying complete contact information.
- the click-to-reveal content item engine 122 can obtain the content items from the click-to-reveal content items 126 .
- a logging engine 124 can log one or more of transmissions of the content item, revealed information, and quality score information based on revealed content items.
- the logging engine can store the information in the revealed content items logs 128 .
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram illustrating a system 200 for displaying a content item with part of the contact information associated with a sponsor obscured.
- the system 200 can include the content management system 120 and multiple user devices 106 which can run browsers or other applications that display content items.
- a screen shot 202 shows a web page 204 on which a content item 206 and a content item 208 are displayed.
- the content item 206 includes contact information 210 that is partially obscured, e.g., a phone number in which the last four digits are replaced by other characters.

Description
- This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/IN2011/000256, filed Apr. 15, 2011.
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources such as video and audio files, web pages for particular subjects, book articles, and news articles. A search system can identify resources in response to a text query that includes one or more search terms or phrases. The search system can rank the resources based on their relevance to the query and on measures of quality of the resources and can provide search results that link to the identified resources. The search results are typically ordered for viewing according to the rank. The search results can include content items (e.g. advertisements) for business entities, such as businesses that have their own web sites.
- The Internet can also provide information about business entities that may not have web sites or other online presence. For example, a user who searches the Internet can learn about a business (e.g., a restaurant, store, etc.) for which no online web page exists.
- This specification describes technologies relating to information presentation.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for receiving a request for content from a user device; transmitting a content item for display on the user device responsive to the request; wherein the content item includes contact information associated with a sponsor and instructions to obscure at least a portion of the contact information when the content item is first displayed on the user device; receiving an indication that a user has displayed complete contact information; and logging the indication.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Logging can include charging the sponsor. Logging can include updating a quality score associated with the content item based at least in part on the indication. The content item can be a content item for which user interaction with the content item does not result in navigation to a landing page. The contact information can be a telephone number. The contact information can be an email address. The content item may not include a link to a landing page. The complete contact information can be delivered at the same time as the content item, but is obscured by execution of a script on the user device. The method can further comprise attributing the indication when evaluating a quality score for the content item for subsequent presentations of the content item.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method comprising: receiving a content item, including contact information for a content sponsor associated with the content item and instructions for obscuring at least a portion of the contact information when the content item is first displayed on a user device; displaying the content item on the user device, wherein the instructions are executed to obscure part of contact information and to provide a control for displaying complete contact information; receiving an invocation of the control by a user of the user device; displaying the complete contact information; and providing an indication that the complete contact information was displayed.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The content item may not include a link to a landing page. The invocation is selected from a group comprising: hovering, clicking, tapping, zooming, pinching, and shaking.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a content management system that provides content items responsive to received requests, the content management system including: a click-to-reveal content item engine that provides a content item to a user device responsive to a received request, wherein the content item includes contact information for a sponsor associated with the content item; wherein the content item includes instructions operable to obscure at least a portion of the contact information when the content item is first displayed on the user device; and wherein the content item includes instructions to generate a control for displaying complete contact information; and a logging engine for logging one or more of transmissions of the content item, reveal information and quality score information based on revealed content items.

- This document describes systems and methods for displaying content items (e.g., advertisements or ads) that use a click-to-reveal format. For example, the click-to-reveal format can serve to obscure contact information associated with an ad's sponsor in ads presented for a content sponsor that do not include a landing page or web site to which the user can be directed after clicking on (or interacting with) the ad. For this type of
content sponsor 109, for example, online advertisement management systems can initially obscure the contact information when the ad is presented. The content sponsor can subsequently be charged for presentation of the ad when, for example, the user (e.g., a potential customer) invokes a control to reveal the contact information, e.g., a phone number, an email address, an SMS short code, and/or a physical address associated with the sponsor. Other billing arrangements are possible. In some implementations, content items that have the click-to-reveal format can be used on publisher web pages, in mobile apps, email, etc. -
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 in which a content item is provided for which at least part of the contact information associated with the content item sponsor is obscured. Theenvironment 100 includes asearch system 110 that provides search services and acontent management system 120 that provides content items (e.g., ads) including content items that display contact information, some of which can be obscured upon initial display. Theenvironment 100 includes anetwork 102, e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination of them, that connectspublishers 103,user devices 106, thesearch system 110, and thecontent management system 120. Theenvironment 100 may include many thousands ofpublishers 103,content sponsors 109, anduser devices 106. - The
content sponsors 109 can include advertisers who may not have a significant presence on the Internet. For example, somecontent sponsors 109 can sponsor content items (e.g., stored as click-to-reveal content items 126) that, instead of directing the user to a resource associated with the content, provide contact information by which the user can contact the sponsor (e.g., a business entity such as a store, restaurant, etc.) who sponsored the ad. Example types of contact information include telephone numbers, email addresses, SMS short messages, and physical addresses. When the ad is initially displayed, for example, at least part of the contact information associated with the content item sponsor can be obscured. If the user invokes a control to display the complete contact information, for example, an indication can be sent to thecontent management system 120, e.g., for storage in revealedcontent items logs 128. In some implementations, information in the revealedcontent items logs 128 can be used to chargecontent sponsors 109, based on the indication that users have clicked or otherwise interacted with the content items to reveal the complete contact information in the content items. In some implementations, information stored in the revealedcontent items logs 128, including indications that users have revealed complete contact information for a content item (e.g., an ad), can be used to update a quality score for the content item (e.g., to measure effectiveness of the ad). For example, quality scores can be used to control subsequent presentations of the content item. - A
web site 104 can include one ormore resources 108 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example web site is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements (e.g., scripts). Eachweb site 104 can be maintained by apublisher 103, e.g., an entity that manages and/or owns the web property. - A
resource 108 is any data that can be provided by theweb site 104 over thenetwork 102 and that is associated with a resource address.Resources 108 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name a few examples. Theresources 108 can include content, e.g., words, phrases, images and sounds, and may include embedded information (e.g., meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (e.g., JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, e.g., a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - To facilitate searching of
resources 108, thesearch system 110 can identify theresources 108 by crawling and indexing theresources 108 provided by thepublishers 103. Data about theresources 108 can be indexed based on theresource 108 to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of theresources 108 are stored in asearch index 112. - The
user devices 106 submitsearch queries 114 to thesearch system 110. In response, thesearch system 110 accesses thesearch index 112 to identifyresources 108 that are predicted to be relevant to thesearch query 114, for example based on relevance scores that have been computed for theresources 108. Thesearch system 110 selectsresources 108, generatessearch results 116 that identify theresources 108, and returns the search results 116 to theuser devices 106. Asearch result 116 is data generated by thesearch system 110 that references aresource 108 that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes an active link (e.g., a URL) to the resource. Anexample search result 116 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. -
User devices 106 receive the search results 116 and render the search results 116, for example, in the form of one or more web pages, for presentation to users. In response to the user selecting a link (e.g., URL) in a search result at auser device 106, theuser device 106 requests theresource 108 referenced by the link. Theweb site 104 hosting theresource 108 receives the request for theresource 108 from theuser device 106 and provides theresource 108 to the requestinguser device 106. - Search queries 114 submitted during user sessions are stored in a data store such as a search
log data store 118. Selection data specifying user actions taken in response to searchresults 116 provided are also stored in a data store such as the searchlog data store 118. These actions can include whether a search result was selected by a user. In some implementations, location data specifying a locality of the user device that submitted the search query can also be stored in the searchlog data store 118. The data stored in the searchlog data store 118 can be used to map search queries 114 submitted during search sessions toresources 108 that were identified insearch results 116 and the actions taken by users. The searchlog data store 118 can be anonymized so that the privacy of users is protected. For example, quasi-unique identifiers can be associated with users, but the actual identifying information of the users is not stored in the searchlog data store 118. Additionally, any identified user preferences or user interactions can be generalized (for example, generalized based on user demographics) rather than associated with a particular user. Encryption and obfuscation techniques can also be used to protect the privacy of users. - Search results 116 are selected to be provided to a
user device 106 in response to asearch query 114 based on initial result scores. Result scores are scores that represent a measure of relevance (e.g., a predicted relevance) of theresource 108 to a search query. For example, a result score for aresource 108 can be computed based on an information retrieval (“IR”) score corresponding to theresource 108 and, optionally, a quality score of theresource 108 relative to other available resources. A presentation order for the search results 116 can be selected based on the result scores. In turn, data that causes presentation of the search results 116 according to the presentation order can be provided to theuser device 106. The search results 116 can include content items, such as click-to-reveal ads, and user interactions with the ads to reveal the complete contact information can be measured (e.g., by the content management system 120). - One
example publisher 103 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request. The content server can submit a request for ads to an advertisement server in thecontent management system 120. Alternatively, an ad request can be embedded in content from the publisher being rendered on a user device such that the user device (e.g., a browser) submits the ad request. The ad request can include a number of ads desired. The ad request can also include content request information. This information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc. - In some implementations, the content server or a client browser combines the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the
system 104. The combined content and ads can be sent and rendered to theuser devices 106 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system). The content server can transmit information about the ads back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScript™). In some implementations, the content and ads are combined separately, for example, content can be rendered while waiting for ads to be received and incorporated into the content. - In some implementations, one or
more publishers 103 submit requests for ads to thecontent management system 120. Thecontent management system 120 responds by sending ads to the requestingpublisher 103 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property. For example, if apublisher 103 publishes a sports-related web site, the advertising management system can provide sports-related ads to thepublisher 103. In some implementations, the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with the user, e.g., by the execution of a particular script (e.g., JavaScript) when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device. - Another
example publisher 103 is a mobile application developer. A mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone). The mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar topublishers 103 described above, the ads can be received from thecontent management system 120 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device). - The
content management system 120 can include plural engines. A click-to-revealcontent item engine 122, for example, can provide a content item to theuser device 106 responsive to a received request. The content item can include contact information for thecontent sponsor 109 associated with the content item and instructions operable to obscure at least a portion of the contact information from initial view when the content item is first displayed on theuser device 106. The content item can also include instructions to generate a control for displaying complete contact information. For example, the click-to-revealcontent item engine 122 can obtain the content items from the click-to-reveal content items 126. Alogging engine 124, for example, can log one or more of transmissions of the content item, revealed information, and quality score information based on revealed content items. For example, the logging engine can store the information in the revealed content items logs 128. -
FIG. 2A is a block diagram illustrating a system 200 for displaying a content item with part of the contact information associated with a sponsor obscured. The system 200 can include thecontent management system 120 andmultiple user devices 106 which can run browsers or other applications that display content items. For example, a screen shot 202 shows aweb page 204 on which acontent item 206 and acontent item 208 are displayed. Thecontent item 206 includescontact information 210 that is partially obscured, e.g., a phone number in which the last four digits are replaced by other characters. Thecontent item 208 includescontact information 212 that is partially obscured, e.g., an email address in which part of the email address (e.g., the domain name) is missing.Content item 206 a, which can be displayed if the user invokes acontrol 209, includes similar information as thecontent item 206, includingcomplete contact information 210 a (e.g., the entire phone number).Email form 212 a, that can appear if the user invokes thecontrol 209 in thecontent item 208, contains the full email address that is partially obscured in thecontent item 208. - In a detailed example, a user can use the web page 204 (e.g. executing on the user device 106) to search for area plumbers. The user can enter a
search query 216 for “plumbers,” for example, in asearch field 218, e.g., in a Web browser application. As a result of submitting thesearch query 216, theweb page 204 can send a request forcontent 220, e.g., requesting content items that match thesearch query 216 for “plumbers.” - The
content management system 120 can receive the request forcontent 220 from theweb page 204. In response to the request forcontent 220, thecontent management system 120 can send one ormore content items 222 to theuser device 106. Thecontent items 222 can include different types of content items for different types of content sponsors 109. For example, somecontent sponsors 109 can sponsorcontent items 222 that, upon user interaction with a particular content item, direct the user to a landing page or web page associated with the content item's sponsor. In another example, somecontent items 222 can include click-to-reveal content items (e.g., ads) that are primarily used for providing, to potential customers, contact information associated with the content item sponsor. For these types of content items (e.g., click-to-reveal ads), thecontent items 222 includeinstructions 224 that are delivered along with thecontent items 222 for obscuring at least part of the contact information associated with the content item sponsor. Some content sponsors 109 can sponsor both types ofcontent items 222. - When the
content items web page 204, theinstructions 224 are executed so that the contact information 210 (or 212) is partially obscured. In some implementations, theinstructions 222 can include an HTML script or other computer code that causes the display of a partially-obscured version of the contact information and provides thecontrol 209 that the user can invoke to display the complete contact information. User invocation of thecontrol 209 can occur, for example, by hovering, clicking, tapping, zooming, pinching or shaking, any of which can be a signal by the user to display the complete contact information. In some implementations, theselectable control 209 can be omitted, and the user can, for example, click on (or hover, tap, zoom, pinch or shake) the incomplete contact information 210 (or 212) to reveal the complete contact information. - Upon user invocation of the
control 209, the complete contact information can be displayed. For example, thecontent item 206 a shows thecomplete contact information 210 a (e.g., including the entire phone number). In another example,email form 212 a contains thefull email address 226 that is shown partially obscured in thecontact information 212. Furthermore, upon invocation of thecontrol 209, theweb page 204 can send anindication 228 to thecontent management system 120, which can log the invocation. - In some implementations, instead of displaying the
email form 212 a, the system 200 can display the entire email address of the plumbing company, and the user can copy/paste the email address into an email application as needed. - In some implementations, the obscured contact information that the user can reveal can be an SMS code and/or a product code (or some other code) that the user can use, for example, to compose and send a text message to the business entity. For example, by texting the SMS code and a product code, the user can be registered as a customer or be entered into a promotion. In some implementations, the business entity (e.g., the plumbing company) can send a text message back to the user.
- In some implementations, the obscured contact information that the user can reveal can be an address of a physical location, driving directions to the location, or a map to the location that the user can use to travel to the business entity. This type of information can be included with the
content item 222 that thecontent management system 120 sends to theuser device 106. In some implementations, obscured information in acontent item 222 can include pricing or item availability information, and in this case, an additional request can be sent to thecontent management system 120 to obtain up-to-date information (e.g., real-time price and inventory information). -

The screen shot 202 b shows theentire web page 204 updated with thecontent item 206 a, i.e., showing thecomplete contact information 210 a (e.g., including the entire phone number). In this example, the screen shot 202 b represents the display that the user can see after invoking thecontrol 209 to reveal the complete contact information. -
FIG. 2C is a block diagram illustrating a sequence ofscreen shots same content item 208 as shown inFIG. 2A . The screen shot 202 c shows theentire web page 204 updated with the email form 208 a, i.e., showing thecomplete contact information 212 a (e.g., including the email address). In this example, the screen shot 202 d represents the display that the user can see after invoking thecontrol 209 to reveal the complete contact information. -
FIG. 3 is a swim lane diagram showing an example process 300 for displaying a content item with part of the contact information associated with the content item sponsor obscured. The process 300 can be executed, for example, using aserver 302 and aclient 304. For example, theserver 302 can provide the content item and complete contact information to theclient 304 with instructions for obscuring at least part of the contact information upon initial display. Theclient 304 can display the content item and part of the contact information. Upon the invocation of a control by the user, theclient 304 can display the complete contact information and provide an indication to theserver 302 so that the interaction can be logged. - The process 300 can be implemented by components within the
environment 100, including thecontent management system 120, thesearch system 110, and theuser device 106. The process 300 can also be implemented as instructions stored on computer readable device such that execution of the instructions by data processing apparatus cause the data processing apparatus to perform the operations of the process 300.FIGS. 1 and 2A are used to provide examples for the process 300, which includes steps that can occur at theserver 302 and steps that can occur at theclient 304. - A request for content is received from a user device (306). For example, the
content management system 120 can receive the request forcontent 220 from theuser device 106, such as a request for content to fill a content item slot (e.g., an ad slot) on theweb page 204 based on thesearch query 216 for “plumbers.” - A content item that is responsive to the request is transmitted for display on a user device (308). The content item includes contact information and instructions to obscure at least a portion of the contact information from initial view when the content item is first displayed on the user device. For example, the
content management system 120 can send the content item 222 (e.g., an ad for a plumber) in response to the request forcontent 220. Thecontent item 222 can include the complete contact information for the sponsor (e.g., business entity's complete phone number or email address).Instructions 224, included with thecontent item 222, can include an HTML script or other computer code for obscuring at least part of the contact information. - The content item and instructions are received (309). For example, the
web page 204 can receive thecontent item 222 with theinstructions 224. - The content item is displayed on the user device with at least a portion of contact information obscured from initial view (310). For example, the
content item 206 can be displayed on theweb page 204 with thecontact information 210 showing only a portion of the plumbing company's telephone number. - An invocation of a control is received from a user to reveal the complete contact information (312). For example, if the user wants to see the complete contact information for the plumbing company, then the user can invoke the
control 209, e.g., by hovering, clicking, tapping, zooming, pinching, shaking or some other invocation technique. - The complete contact information is displayed (314). For example, the
complete contact information 210 a can be displayed, e.g., including the complete phone number of the plumbing company. - An indication is provided that the user revealed the complete contact information (316). For example, the web page 204 (or other component of the user device 106) can send the indication 228 (e.g., indicating that the user revealed the complete contact information) to the
content management system 120. - An indication is received that the user has displayed the complete contact information (318). For example, the
content management system 120 can receive theindication 228 from the web page 204 (or other component of the user device 106). - The indication that the user has displayed the complete contact information is logged (320). For example, the
content management system 120 can update the revealed content items logs 128 so that thecontent sponsor 109 associated with the plumbing company ad can be charged. -
