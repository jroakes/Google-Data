- Advertiser networks may each conduct an auction in which advertisers submit bids in an effort to show their advertisements on sites associated with one or more content publishers.
- the advertiser networks may belong to an advertising network exchange that includes a plurality of advertiser networks, in which each of the networks submit to the advertising network exchange at least the winning (e.g., highest) bid received by the respective advertiser network's auction.
- an advertiser associated with the advertiser network that submitted the highest bid within the network wins the top spot in the exchange.
- the advertiser wins the top spot in the advertising network exchange the amount paid by that advertiser is, typically, equal to an amount associated with (or equal to) the second-highest bid received by the advertising network exchange.
- each of the advertiser networks that conduct advertiser auctions may submit to an advertising network exchange the highest (winning) bid associated with the respective advertiser network. It is possible, however, that a single advertiser network also receives a second-highest bid price within that network's auction, which is higher than any other bid price received in any related auctions that are conducted in the other advertiser networks.
- the present application provides one or more incentives to advertiser networks to submit to an advertising network exchange more than one (i.e., first-highest) bid, and include, for example, at least the second-highest bids that are received from advertisers in connection with the advertiser networks' respective auctions. Accordingly, an advertiser network may receive a direct benefit (i.e., a payment) for submitting to the advertising network exchange the exchange's second-highest bid (in addition to the exchange's first-highest bid). In one or more embodiments, any advertiser network that does not submit more than one bid to the advertising network exchange is not penalized or otherwise negatively impacted.
- one or more incentive(s) may be calculated to include a payment that is equal to a portion of the amount received by the advertising network exchange.
- a single advertiser network that submits to the advertising network exchange the first-highest bid and the second-highest bid among all of the submitting advertiser networks is paid an amount equal to: alpha*(b_(2) ⁇ b_(3)).
- the publisher receives a payment equal to (1-alpha)*b_(2)+alpha*b_(3), where alpha>0 is a positive constant, b_(2) denotes the second-highest bid submitted to the exchange, and b_(3) denotes the third-highest bid submitted to the advertising network exchange.
- the value of alpha is selected such that an incentive is provided to the advertiser network and publishers to obtain greater payment in expectation for their inventory.
- a different form of payment calculation is provided in connection with an advertiser network that submits to the advertising network exchange the first-highest bid and the second-highest bid among all of the advertiser networks.
- the network that submitted the first and second-highest bids to the exchange receives a payment that is in accordance with an arbitrary function of the number of bids and values of the bids submitted by all the advertiser networks.
- the publisher receives a payment that is equal to the second-highest bid minus the payment received by the advertiser network.
- the alternative payment calculation described above is further modified by making a payment to the advertiser network that supplied the second-highest bid submitted to the advertising network exchange, even in the event the advertiser network that supplied the second-highest bid submitted to the exchange is different from the advertiser network that supplied the highest bid submitted to the exchange.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an example content presentation system 100 .
- one or more third party content providers such as advertisers, using content provider devices 102 can directly or indirectly enter, maintain, and log third party content information such as ad information in a content management system such as system 104 .
- the ads can be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text-only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, media ads, interactive ads, ads combining one or more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads can also include embedded information, such as links to purchase goods and/or services, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more first party content providers such as publishers, using publisher devices 106 can submit requests for third party content items such as ads to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending third party content items to the requesting publisher device 106 for placement on, or association with, one or more of the publisher's content items (e.g., web properties such as web pages).
- third party content items such as ads can be provided in a substantially similar manner in television and radio content slots (such as advertising slots), and/or print media space.
- Other entities such as users, using user devices 108 , and third party content providers such as the advertisers, using content provider devices 102 , can provide usage information to the system 104 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion (e.g., a purchase or other interaction including, for example, a request for driving directions to a location associated with a third party content item such as an ad, navigating to the location associated with a third party content item such as the ad, or walking to the location associated with a third party content item such as the ad) or a click-through related to a third party content item such as an ad (e.g., a user has selected a third party content item such as an ad) has occurred.
- a conversion e.g., a purchase or other interaction including, for example, a request for driving directions to a location associated with a third party content item such as an ad, navigating to the location associated with a third party content item such as the ad, or walking to the
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to third party content items such as ads that have been served. It should be noted that in situations where personal or identifying information is collected, users may be provided with the ability to control whether such information is collected, the extent to which such information is collected, and/or the extent to which a user can be identified based on it. For example, a user can select an option whereby any personal or identifying information is immediately aggregated with that of other users such that such information cannot subsequently be associated with or otherwise identify the individual user.
- the system 104 can perform financial transactions, for example, crediting first party content providers such as the publishers 106 and charging third party content providers such as the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connects content provider devices 102 , the system 104 , publisher devices 106 , and user devices 108 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connects content provider devices 102 , the system 104 , publisher devices 106 , and user devices 108 .
- One example publisher device 106 is a general content server that receives requests for first party content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested first party content in response to the request.
- the content server can submit a request for third party content such as ads to a content server such as an advertisement server in the system 104 .
- the third party content item request can include a number of third party content items such as ads desired.
- the third party content item request can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, or other suitable information.

- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, or other suitable information.
- the content server or a client browser can combine the requested first party content with one or more of the third party content items such as ads provided by the system 104 .
- the combined first party content and third party content items such as ads can be sent/rendered to the user devices 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the third party content items such as ads back to the content server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the third party content items such as ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- Another example publisher device 106 is a server that provides a search service.
- a search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for third party content items such as ads to the system 104 .
- the request can include a number of third party content items desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the third party content items, and/or a variety of other factors. In some implementations, the number of desired third party content items will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for third party content items can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information can include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the content management system 104 includes an auction process to select third party content items such as ads from the third party content providers such as advertisers.
- third party content providers such as the advertisers can be permitted to select, or bid, an amount they are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click of) a third party content item, e.g., a cost-per-click amount a third party content provider pays when, for example, a user clicks on a third party content item.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the third party content provider is willing to pay for each click of a third party content item based on a keyword, e.g., a word or words in a query.
- Other bid types can also be used. Based on these bids, third party content items can be selected and ranked for presentation.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the third party content items provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the user devices 108 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the third party content items, so as not to confuse the user between paid third party content items and presumably neutral search results.
- one or more publisher devices 106 can submit requests for third party content items such as ads to a content management system such as content management system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending third party content items to the publisher device 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property.
- the content management system can provide sports-related ads to the publisher device 106 .
- the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with the user 108 , e.g., by the execution of a particular script when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- an ad push model is used to provide third party content items such as ads from third party content providers such as advertisers.
- ads can be pushed to idle screens (e.g., of a mobile devices or particular applications) based on particular criteria (e.g., the user's location).
- the referenced publisher can be a mobile application developer.
- a mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone).
- the mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar to publishers, the ads can be received from the system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user device (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control the manner such information is collected with respect to programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). Users may also be informed of the accompanying limitations on the functionality of a service that may result from limiting access to such personal information.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a device identifier associated with a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.

Abstract
This specification describes technologies relating to content presentation. In general, a computer-implemented system and method is disclosed for providing an incentive to a content provider network to submit multiple bids. One or more processors executing code receive from a computing device associated with a first content provider network a first bid and a second bid. A third bid is received from a computing device associated with a second content provider network. The first bid is determined to be a winning bid based on the first bid being higher than the second bid and the third bid. A first calculation is made of a first amount to charge a first content provider associated with the winning bid, wherein the first amount is less than the amount of the first bid. A second calculation is made of a second amount to pay the first content provider network for providing the first bid and the second bid, wherein the second amount is less than the first amount.
Description
- The present disclosure relates to content presentation.
- This specification generally relates to facilitating connections and communication between users and information sources.
- Users of search engines can locate information by entering queries and receiving lists of results identified by the search engines in response to the queries. Search engine results pages may also include content related to or responsive to the queries. A portion of the content included in this situation can be provided by third-party content networks for possible inclusion with the search results. Such content can also be provided by content networks for inclusion in other network-accessible resources such as websites, applications, games and mobile versions of the foregoing.
- In many contexts, content providers have bid amounts associated with their content items, and present only highest bid content in response to requests for content, e.g., in response to an auction. It would be an improvement in the art to incentivize networks of content providers to provide additional content other than highest-bid content in response to queries for content.
- This specification describes technologies relating to content presentation.
- In general, a computer-implemented system and method is provided for providing incentive to a content provider network to submit multiple bids. A first bid and a second bid are received from a computing device associated with a first content provider network. A third bid is received from a computing device associated with a second content provider network. A determination is made that the first bid is a winning bid for being higher than the second bid and the third bid. Moreover, a first amount is to charge a first content provider associated with the winning bid, wherein the first amount is less than the amount of the first bid. A charge of the first amount is made to the first content provider, and a second amount is calculated to pay the first content provider network for providing the first bid and the second bid. Moreover, a third amount may be calculated to pay a publisher of content associated with the first bid, and payment is effected of the second amount to the first content provider network and payment of the third amount to the publisher, wherein the payment to the first content provider network is the incentive.
- In one embodiment, the content provider network is an advertising network, bids are from advertisers, and the bids are received by one or more processors associated with an advertising network exchange. In another embodiment, the content provider network relates to real estate, and the bids are from realtors and represent listings. In another embodiment, the content provider network relates to gaming, and the bids relate to computer games. In yet another embodiment, the content provider network relates to clothing and the bids relate to clothing manufacturers. Thus, it will be appreciated that for each of these and other contextual arrangements, without limiting the foregoing, all of the features and functionality provided by the present application can be enjoyed and exploited.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

- By way of overview and introduction, it can be advantageous to receive multiple bids from a single advertiser network in an advertising network exchange, which helps advertiser networks, companies, and publishers maximize their respective returns on investment. Advertiser networks may each conduct an auction in which advertisers submit bids in an effort to show their advertisements on sites associated with one or more content publishers. The advertiser networks may belong to an advertising network exchange that includes a plurality of advertiser networks, in which each of the networks submit to the advertising network exchange at least the winning (e.g., highest) bid received by the respective advertiser network's auction. In such context, an advertiser associated with the advertiser network that submitted the highest bid within the network wins the top spot in the exchange. Although the advertiser wins the top spot in the advertising network exchange, the amount paid by that advertiser is, typically, equal to an amount associated with (or equal to) the second-highest bid received by the advertising network exchange.
- In a typical arrangement, each of the advertiser networks that conduct advertiser auctions may submit to an advertising network exchange the highest (winning) bid associated with the respective advertiser network. It is possible, however, that a single advertiser network also receives a second-highest bid price within that network's auction, which is higher than any other bid price received in any related auctions that are conducted in the other advertiser networks.
- The present application provides one or more incentives to advertiser networks to submit to an advertising network exchange more than one (i.e., first-highest) bid, and include, for example, at least the second-highest bids that are received from advertisers in connection with the advertiser networks' respective auctions. Accordingly, an advertiser network may receive a direct benefit (i.e., a payment) for submitting to the advertising network exchange the exchange's second-highest bid (in addition to the exchange's first-highest bid). In one or more embodiments, any advertiser network that does not submit more than one bid to the advertising network exchange is not penalized or otherwise negatively impacted.
- In one or more implementations, one or more incentive(s) may be calculated to include a payment that is equal to a portion of the amount received by the advertising network exchange. For example and in one or more implementations, a single advertiser network that submits to the advertising network exchange the first-highest bid and the second-highest bid among all of the submitting advertiser networks is paid an amount equal to: alpha*(b_(2)−b_(3)). Further, the publisher receives a payment equal to (1-alpha)*b_(2)+alpha*b_(3), where alpha>0 is a positive constant, b_(2) denotes the second-highest bid submitted to the exchange, and b_(3) denotes the third-highest bid submitted to the advertising network exchange. In one or more implementations, the value of alpha is selected such that an incentive is provided to the advertiser network and publishers to obtain greater payment in expectation for their inventory.
- In one or more alternative implementations of the present application, a different form of payment calculation is provided in connection with an advertiser network that submits to the advertising network exchange the first-highest bid and the second-highest bid among all of the advertiser networks. In this alternative implementation, the network that submitted the first and second-highest bids to the exchange receives a payment that is in accordance with an arbitrary function of the number of bids and values of the bids submitted by all the advertiser networks. Moreover and in connection with this alternative implementation, the publisher receives a payment that is equal to the second-highest bid minus the payment received by the advertiser network.
- In yet another alternative implementation, the alternative payment calculation described above is further modified by making a payment to the advertiser network that supplied the second-highest bid submitted to the advertising network exchange, even in the event the advertiser network that supplied the second-highest bid submitted to the exchange is different from the advertiser network that supplied the highest bid submitted to the exchange.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an examplecontent presentation system 100. In some implementations, one or more third party content providers, such as advertisers, usingcontent provider devices 102 can directly or indirectly enter, maintain, and log third party content information such as ad information in a content management system such assystem 104. Though reference is made to advertising, other forms of content, including other forms of sponsored content, can be delivered by thesystem 100. The ads can be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text-only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, media ads, interactive ads, ads combining one or more of any of such components, etc. The ads can also include embedded information, such as links to purchase goods and/or services, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. - One or more first party content providers such as publishers, using
publisher devices 106 can submit requests for third party content items such as ads to thesystem 104. Thesystem 104 responds by sending third party content items to the requestingpublisher device 106 for placement on, or association with, one or more of the publisher's content items (e.g., web properties such as web pages). It should also be understood that in certain implementations, third party content items such as ads can be provided in a substantially similar manner in television and radio content slots (such as advertising slots), and/or print media space. - Other entities, such as users, using
user devices 108, and third party content providers such as the advertisers, usingcontent provider devices 102, can provide usage information to thesystem 104, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion (e.g., a purchase or other interaction including, for example, a request for driving directions to a location associated with a third party content item such as an ad, navigating to the location associated with a third party content item such as the ad, or walking to the location associated with a third party content item such as the ad) or a click-through related to a third party content item such as an ad (e.g., a user has selected a third party content item such as an ad) has occurred. This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to third party content items such as ads that have been served. It should be noted that in situations where personal or identifying information is collected, users may be provided with the ability to control whether such information is collected, the extent to which such information is collected, and/or the extent to which a user can be identified based on it. For example, a user can select an option whereby any personal or identifying information is immediately aggregated with that of other users such that such information cannot subsequently be associated with or otherwise identify the individual user. Thesystem 104 can perform financial transactions, for example, crediting first party content providers such as thepublishers 106 and charging third party content providers such as theadvertisers 102 based on the usage information. - A
network 110, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connectscontent provider devices 102, thesystem 104,publisher devices 106, anduser devices 108. - One
example publisher device 106 is a general content server that receives requests for first party content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested first party content in response to the request. The content server can submit a request for third party content such as ads to a content server such as an advertisement server in thesystem 104. The third party content item request can include a number of third party content items such as ads desired. The third party content item request can also include content request information. This information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, or other suitable information. - In some implementations, the content server or a client browser can combine the requested first party content with one or more of the third party content items such as ads provided by the
system 104. The combined first party content and third party content items such as ads can be sent/rendered to theuser devices 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system). The content server can transmit information about the third party content items such as ads back to the content server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the third party content items such as ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScript™). - Another
example publisher device 106 is a server that provides a search service. A search service can receive queries for search results. In response, the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages). Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results. - The search service can submit a request for third party content items such as ads to the
system 104. The request can include a number of third party content items desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the third party content items, and/or a variety of other factors. In some implementations, the number of desired third party content items will be from one to ten, or from three to five. The request for third party content items can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results. Such information can include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc. In some implementations, IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc. - In some implementations, the
content management system 104 includes an auction process to select third party content items such as ads from the third party content providers such as advertisers. For example, third party content providers such as the advertisers can be permitted to select, or bid, an amount they are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click of) a third party content item, e.g., a cost-per-click amount a third party content provider pays when, for example, a user clicks on a third party content item. The cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the third party content provider is willing to pay for each click of a third party content item based on a keyword, e.g., a word or words in a query. Other bid types, however, can also be used. Based on these bids, third party content items can be selected and ranked for presentation. - The search service can combine the search results with one or more of the third party content items provided by the
system 104. This combined information can then be forwarded to theuser devices 108 that requested the content. The search results can be maintained as distinct from the third party content items, so as not to confuse the user between paid third party content items and presumably neutral search results. - In some implementations, one or
more publisher devices 106 can submit requests for third party content items such as ads to a content management system such ascontent management system 104. Thesystem 104 responds by sending third party content items to thepublisher device 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property. For example, if apublisher device 106 publishes a sports-related web site, the content management system can provide sports-related ads to thepublisher device 106. In some implementations, the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with theuser 108, e.g., by the execution of a particular script when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device. - In some alternative implementations, an ad push model is used to provide third party content items such as ads from third party content providers such as advertisers. In an ad push model, ads can be pushed to idle screens (e.g., of a mobile devices or particular applications) based on particular criteria (e.g., the user's location).
- In another example the referenced publisher can be a mobile application developer. A mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone). The mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar to publishers, the ads can be received from the
system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user device (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device). - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control the manner such information is collected with respect to programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). Users may also be informed of the accompanying limitations on the functionality of a service that may result from limiting access to such personal information. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a device identifier associated with a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- Continuing with reference to
FIG. 1 , an advertising exchange network for providing third party content to apublisher 106 is shown. In thearrangement 100, a plurality ofadvertiser networks 204A-D each include a plurality ofdevices 102. At least onedevice 120 is included in eachadvertiser network 204A-D, which receives one or more bids for content such as ads (also known as “creatives”) to be provided on one or more publishers' sites. The bids received by each of thedevices 120 are evaluated in an auction and at least two of the bids received from at least one of therespective advertiser networks 204A-D are submitted todevice 202 that is associated withadvertising network exchange 202. Each content item may include one or more words, phrases, web links, and/or any other such element and/or component (e.g., images, video, audio, etc.) that are provided to one or more publisher devices 106 (e.g., banner ads, text-only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, etc.). In certain implementations, one or more keywords (not shown) are associated with one or more creatives in order to enable the identification and selection of pertinent content items for display to a user based on one or more search queries received from the user. It should also be noted that although content items are described herein as referring to individual content items, in certain implementations content items can refer to groups of content items, such as ad groups, campaigns, and/or categories.Device 202 evaluates the bids received from advertiser networks and the bids are, accordingly, ranked in an auction-style format. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , an example ranking of the bids is illustrated onexample display 210 that is provided withcomputing device 108. As shown indisplay 210, fivebids device 202 and ranked in an auction-style format. In accordance with the example shown inFIG. 2 , the twotop bids network 204B, the thirdhighest bid 226 was received fromnetwork 204C, the fourth highest bid was received fromnetwork 204D, and the fifth highest bid was received fromnetwork 204A. Thus, as shown in theexample display 210 inFIG. 2 , the two highest bids were received from a single network (204B). - It should be noted that in situations where personal or identifying information is collected, users may be provided with the ability to control whether such information is collected, the extent to which such information is collected, and/or the extent to which a user can be identified based on it. For example, a user can select an option whereby any personal or identifying information is immediately aggregated with that of other users such that such information cannot subsequently be associated with or otherwise identify the individual user.
- Additionally,
device 202 may include a content selection engine. The content selection engine can select one or more third party content items, such as content items, such as based on various determinations computed with respect to probability. It should also be understood that in some implementations the content selection engine may include one or more processors configured by code to implement the functionality of the content selection engine that is being described. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample method 300 for providing an incentive to an advertiser network to submit multiple bids, in accordance with one or more implementations. In some implementations, themethod 300 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium. For example, themethod 300 can be performed by thedevice 202 ofFIG. 2 . - In certain implementations, a first bid is received from a first of a plurality of advertiser networks, for ranked placement among a list of advertisers (305). The bid price may represent a price for favorable placement within the list in order to attract consumers. In addition, a second bid is received from the first of the plurality of advertiser networks (310). The second bid is different from the first bid. Moreover, a third bid is received from a second of the plurality of advertiser networks (315).
- Continuing with reference to
FIG. 3 , a determination is made that the first bid is a winning bid among the three received bids, for being higher than the second bid and the third bid (320). In accordance with at least one implementation, a calculation is made of a first amount to charge a first advertiser associated with the first bid (325). In one or more implementations, the amount that is charged is less than the amount of the first bid, and the charge is effected. In addition, a calculation is made of an amount to pay the first advertiser network for submitting the first and second bids (330). -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of example steps associated with calculating an amount to pay the first advertiser network for submitting the first and second bids in accordance with one or more implementations (330). Atstep 405, a determination is made that the second bid, which was received from the first advertiser network, is higher than the third bid. Thus, the first advertiser network provided the first-highest bid and the second-highest bid of all bids received by the advertising network exchange. Atstep 410, alpha is set to be greater than 0, and b_(2) is defined to be the amount of the second bid and b_(3) is defined to be the amount of the third bid. Atstep 415, the amount is calculated to be alpha*(b_(2)−b_(3)). Thereafter, atstep 420, payment is effected to the first advertiser network. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating example steps associated with an alternative implementation associated with calculating an amount to pay the first advertiser network for submitting the first and second bids (330). Atstep 505, a determination is made that the second bid, which was received from the first advertiser network, is higher than the third bid. Atstep 510, the amount to be paid to the first advertiser network is calculated to as a function of an arbitrary number of number of bids and the values of the bids submitted by the first advertiser network and the second advertiser network. Thereafter, payment, based on the calculation, is effected to the first advertiser network. - Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, while a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).

FIG. 6 shows an example of acomputing device 600 and a mobile computing device that can be used to implement the techniques described in the present specification. Thecomputing device 600 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers. The mobile computing device is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smart-phones, and other similar computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the subject matter described and/or claimed in this document. - The
computing device 600 includes aprocessor 602, amemory 604, astorage device 606, a high-speed interface 608 connecting to thememory 604 and multiple high-speed expansion ports 610, and a low-speed interface 612 connecting to a low-speed expansion port 614 and thestorage device 606. Each of theprocessor 602, thememory 604, thestorage device 606, the high-speed interface 608, the high-speed expansion ports 610, and the low-speed interface 612, are interconnected using various busses, and can be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate. Theprocessor 602 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 600, including instructions stored in thememory 604 or on thestorage device 606 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such as a display 616 coupled to the high-speed interface 608. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses can be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices can be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 604 stores information within thecomputing device 600. In some implementations, thememory 604 is a volatile memory unit or units. In some implementations, thememory 604 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Thememory 604 can also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk. - The
storage device 606 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 600. In some implementations, thestorage device 606 can be or contain a computer-readable medium, e.g., a computer-readable storage medium such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can also be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product can also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The computer program product can also be tangibly embodied in a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 604, thestorage device 606, or memory on theprocessor 602. - The high-
speed interface 608 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 600, while the low-speed interface 612 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is exemplary only. In some implementations, the high-speed interface 608 is coupled to thememory 604, the display 616 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to the high-speed expansion ports 610, which can accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, the low-speed interface 612 is coupled to thestorage device 606 and the low-speed expansion port 614. The low-speed expansion port 614, which can include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet) can be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter. - The
computing device 600 can be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it can be implemented as astandard server 620, or multiple times in a group of such servers. In addition, it can be implemented in a personal computer such as alaptop computer 622. It can also be implemented as part of arack server system 624. Alternatively, components from thecomputing device 600 can be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such as amobile computing device 650. Each of such devices can contain one or more of thecomputing device 600 and themobile computing device 650, and an entire system can be made up of multiple computing devices communicating with each other. - The
mobile computing device 650 includes aprocessor 652, amemory 664, an input/output device such as adisplay 654, acommunication interface 666, and atransceiver 668, among other components. Themobile computing device 650 can also be provided with a storage device, such as a micro-drive or other device, to provide additional storage. Each of theprocessor 652, thememory 664, thedisplay 654, thecommunication interface 666, and thetransceiver 668, are interconnected using various buses, and several of the components can be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate. - The
processor 652 can execute instructions within themobile computing device 650, including instructions stored in thememory 664. Theprocessor 652 can be implemented as a chipset of chips that include separate and multiple analog and digital processors. Theprocessor 652 can provide, for example, for coordination of the other components of themobile computing device 650, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by themobile computing device 650, and wireless communication by themobile computing device 650. - The
processor 652 can communicate with a user through acontrol interface 658 and adisplay interface 656 coupled to thedisplay 654. Thedisplay 654 can be, for example, a TFT (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) display or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. Thedisplay interface 656 can comprise appropriate circuitry for driving thedisplay 654 to present graphical and other information to a user. Thecontrol interface 658 can receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to theprocessor 652. In addition, anexternal interface 662 can provide communication with theprocessor 652, so as to enable near area communication of themobile computing device 650 with other devices. Theexternal interface 662 can provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces can also be used. - The
memory 664 stores information within themobile computing device 650. Thememory 664 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units. Anexpansion memory 674 can also be provided and connected to themobile computing device 650 through anexpansion interface 672, which can include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface. Theexpansion memory 674 can provide extra storage space for themobile computing device 650, or can also store applications or other information for themobile computing device 650. Specifically, theexpansion memory 674 can include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and can include secure information also. Thus, for example, theexpansion memory 674 can be provided as a security module for themobile computing device 650, and can be programmed with instructions that permit secure use of themobile computing device 650. In addition, secure applications can be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner. - The memory can include, for example, flash memory and/or NVRAM memory (non-volatile random access memory), as discussed below. In some implementations, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The computer program product can be a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as the
memory 664, theexpansion memory 674, or memory on theprocessor 652. In some implementations, the computer program product can be received in a propagated signal, for example, over thetransceiver 668 or theexternal interface 662. - The
mobile computing device 650 can communicate wirelessly through thecommunication interface 666, which can include digital signal processing circuitry where necessary. Thecommunication interface 666 can provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls (Global System for Mobile communications), SMS (Short Message Service), EMS (Enhanced Messaging Service), or MMS messaging (Multimedia Messaging Service), CDMA (code division multiple access), TDMA (time division multiple access), PDC (Personal Digital Cellular), WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access), CDMA2000, or GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), among others. Such communication can occur, for example, through thetransceiver 668 using a radio-frequency. In addition, short-range communication can occur, such as using a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, a GPS (Global Positioning System)receiver module 670 can provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data to themobile computing device 650, which can be used as appropriate by applications running on themobile computing device 650. - The
mobile computing device 650 can also communicate audibly using anaudio codec 660, which can receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information. Theaudio codec 660 can likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset of themobile computing device 650. Such sound can include sound from voice telephone calls, can include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and can also include sound generated by applications operating on themobile computing device 650. - The
mobile computing device 650 can be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it can be implemented as acellular telephone 680. It can also be implemented as part of a smart-phone 682, personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof.
