Abstract
Systems and methods are disclosed for selecting digital components for a user device based on data derived from connection parameters of a connection between the user device and an access point without prompting user information. The connection parameters are extracted from access point specific access point data (e.g., geographic location parameters of the access point) and translated into attributes of the user independent of requesting any personal information to submit from/about the user of the particular device. The attributes of the user are then used to generate a connection profile for the user. The connection profile may include connection parameters as well as other derived attributes of the user. Based on the connection profile, a digital component is selected to be transmitted to the user device.
Description
Background
Public "hot spots" that provide free internet access have become common in developing countries. In some cases, users are required to provide personal information they are not willing to provide when they connect through these public connections. This personal information is sometimes used to better enable the user experience and to provide personalized content to these users, for example, through a website (sometimes referred to as a captive portal) that is automatically rendered on the user's device. Because some users do not provide any information or may even provide inaccurate information, the user experience is reduced because the content served by these hotspots is irrelevant and/or generalized.
Disclosure of Invention
One way to provide a better user experience and personalized content is to use the context of the connection itself to select content that is presented to the user. That is, the system may use connection parameters (e.g., temporal and geographic location attributes) to infer information about the user of the connected device. Experience enhancement systems may be used to provide a better experience for the user. When a user device (e.g., an electronic tablet, a smartphone, a computer, or another suitable device) connects to an access point (e.g., wired or wireless) that provides internet access, the experience enhancement system receives access point data indicating that the user device has connected to the access point. The user device may be connected to a public wireless hotspot, such as a train station, an airport station, or another public place.
The experience enhancement system extracts access point-specific connection parameters (e.g., geographic location parameters of the access point) from the access point data. For example, the experience enhancement system may extract the location of the access point, an identifier of the access point, a local time or time zone in which the access point is located, and/or other suitable parameters. For example, if the user device has connected to a wireless hotspot in an airport site (e.g., near a particular gate or gates), the information is extracted (e.g., via an identifier of the access point). When extracting connection parameters, the experience enhancement system translates these parameters into attributes of the user. The experience enhancement system performs this conversion independent of requesting any personal information to be submitted by the user from/about the particular device. In some implementations, the user may approve or deny approval to use the data. Continuing with the above example, if the experience enhancement system extracts data indicating a wireless hotspot at a particular gate at which the user device has connected to an airport site, the experience enhancement system determines that the user is likely to fly to a particular destination based on the time of day and gate number (e.g., using information from an external source, such as a flight schedule for the particular gate). The attributes of the user are then used to generate a connection profile for the user. The connection profile may include connection parameters as well as other attributes of the user. For example, if the user device connects to an access point at an airport or train station (e.g., at a particular gate or track, respectively), the experience enhancement system determines the possible travel destination(s) and adds the information to the connection profile.
The experience enhancement system uses the connection profile to enhance the user experience and/or provide related content. In particular, the experience enhancement system identifies digital components to be presented at a particular user device during a connection of the particular user device to a particular access point based on a connection profile generated for the user. The experience enhancement system may compare data in the connection profile with data relating to digital components (e.g., advertisements) and select digital components that match the connection profile data.
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system uses and/or trains a neural network to select the appropriate digital component. In particular, the experience enhancement system receives connection profile data, a corresponding digital component of each profile, and data indicating whether each user corresponding to each connection profile interacts with the corresponding transmitted digital component. The experience enhancement system inputs into the neural network data for each connection profile and data indicating whether each user corresponding to each connection profile interacts with the corresponding digital component. This data is used to train the neural network. When the neural network has been trained, the experience enhancement system inputs a connection profile into the neural network; and receiving an identifier of the digital component as an output of the neural network.
During connection of a particular user device to a particular access point, the experience enhancement system communicates the identified digital components to the user device. The identified digital components transmitted to the particular user device during the connection to the particular access point are different from the digital components transmitted to at least one of a plurality of other different user devices that are also connected to the particular access point.
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system may receive data from an access point located in a travel site and convert the connection parameters to attributes in a specific manner. Based on data received from the access point (e.g., an identifier of the access point, the access point location, or other suitable data), the experience enhancement system determines that the access point is located at a travel site and uses the time of day to determine one or more travel routes for the travel site. The experience enhancement system may identify a numeric component based on one or more destinations of one or more travel routes based on the information.
Using the connection profile generated based on the user attributes and connection parameters, the experience enhancement system is able to perform a variety of other actions. In some implementations, the experience enhancement system compares the connection profiles and assigns the profiles into groups based on commonalities between the profiles. That is, the experience enhancement system may compare the user's connection profile with the connection profiles of other users assigned to a particular connection group. If the user's connection profile matches the connection profiles of other users, the enhanced experience system assigns the connection profile to a particular connection group. For example, the experience enhancement system may generate groups based on the possible travel destinations.
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system generates groups of connection profiles based on a threshold number of attributes that match between the connection profiles and targets those groups with particular digital components (e.g., advertisements, recommendations, or other suitable digital components). In particular, the experience enhancement system compares each connection profile to other connection profiles and generates connection profile groups based on the comparisons such that each connection profile group includes connection profiles having a threshold number of matching attributes. The experience enhancement system identifies a particular digital component for each connection profile group file and transmits the corresponding digital component to each connection profile group. For example, the first group of connection profiles may include matching attributes, such as a destination (e.g., based on a location at a particular gate in an airport at a particular time). Thus, the experience enhancement system may select a digital component for the first group that is associated with the destination attribute (e.g., an advertisement associated with the destination). For example, if the destination is New York City, the experience enhancement system may select content describing a hundred-Rev drama as the digital component. In another example, the second connection profile group may include matching attributes for the current location (e.g., at a particular portion of a train station). The experience enhancement system may select a digital component (e.g., a store for the current location) that is associated with the current location. The experience enhancement system then transmits the corresponding digital components to the user devices corresponding to the users in the group.
The experience enhancement system may detect that the user device reconnects to the same or a different access point, updating the connection profile based on the new connection, regardless of whether the connection is to the new access point or the original access point. Based on the updated profile, the experience enhancement system selects a new experience or content for the user. In particular, the experience enhancement system determines that a particular device has reconnected to a particular access point and identifies an updated attribute of the user (e.g., based on a new date or time or a new location relative to the access point). The experience enhancement system may make this determination based on an identifier of the access point.
Upon determining that the device has reconnected to the same access point, the experience enhancement system updates the connection profile based on the updated attributes (e.g., with the new connection date and time, the location of the device relative to the access point, and other suitable attributes). The experience enhancement system identifies new digital components based on the updated connection profile and the differences between the connection profiles. For example, if the device has reconnected to the same access point (e.g., at an airport gate), but at a different time, the experience enhancement system determines (e.g., based on the date, time, and gate) a new destination for the user and updates the profile with the destination. Based on the update, the experience enhancement system may transmit the new digital component (e.g., transmit an advertisement, destination information, or another suitable digital component to the device). If the same device connects to different access points, the experience enhancement system may analyze these changes, update the connection profile accordingly, and communicate different digital components to the device.
Experience enhancement systems provide a number of advantages. For example, the experience enhancement system enables the target device to communicate relevant information without prompting or accessing information that many users are unwilling to provide. The system will also help to retain a user disconnected from the system at the time of entry of the reminder information. These users that are not available for ad placement can now be targeted and provided with advertisements.

Detailed Description
This document discloses methods, systems, and devices that enhance a user's online experience in a privacy-preserving manner when the user connects to a particular access point. FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system 100 including components of an experience enhancement system. The system 100 includes a network 102, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Network 102 connects various system components including digital component server 104, profile database 120, profile server 122, digital component database 124, and access point 106. Network 102 may facilitate the connection of other devices (e.g., user devices 108, 110, and 112).
The digital component server 104 provides digital components for transmission to the user devices 108, 110, and 112. The digital component server 104 can receive a request for a digital component that includes data (e.g., a connection profile) identifying the digital component. The request may also include a network location (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) and a return address (e.g., an IP address for the transmission of the digital component) of the digital component server.
The digital components may be stored in a digital components database 124. Each digital component may have associated digital component metadata, sometimes referred to as distribution parameters. The experience enhancement system may compare the distribution parameters to data in the connection profile to determine a match. As used throughout this document, the phrase "digital component" refers to a discrete unit of digital content or digital information (e.g., a video clip, an audio clip, a multimedia clip, an image, text, or another unit of content). The digital components may be electronically stored in the physical memory device as a single file or collection of files, and the digital components may take the form of video files, audio files, multimedia files, image files, or text files, and include advertising information such that the advertisement is one type of digital component.
Although the digital component server 104 and the digital component database 124 are shown as distinct components, these components may be hosted by one server. In some implementations, these components may be combined into one component that receives the connection profile, compares the connection profile to the metadata of each digital component, and selects the digital component that matches, or in some implementations best matches, the connection profile.
The system 100 also includes a profile server 122. In some implementations, profile server 122 may receive connection parameters from access point 106 and generate a connection profile based on the connection parameters. Profile server 122 also accepts requests for connection profiles and sends responses to those requests. The connection profile may be stored in a profile database 120. The connection configuration file may be stored in one or more database tables along with the metadata for the connection configuration file. The metadata may include data such as creation time, update time, and other suitable data. Although profile server 122 and profile database 120 are shown as separate components, these components may be installed on one server or a collection of servers.
The experience enhancement system may be hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. In some implementations, the experience enhancement system may be configured on profile server 122. Although profile server 122 is stated as including multiple servers, profile server 122 may in some cases include one logical server that performs the actions of the experience enhancement system. Thus, the actions of fig. 2-4 may be run on one or more profile servers 122.
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system is configured on the access point 106. In these implementations, profile server 122 is configured to receive connection profiles from access points 106 and store these profiles in profile database 120. Thus, the actions of fig. 2-4 may be run on the access point 106. Access point 106 may communicate with profile server 122 to send and receive connection profiles, connection parameters, and other profile data while performing various actions. Further, the access point 106 may communicate with the digital component server 104 and/or the digital component database 124 to request and receive digital components. Although both digital component server 104 and profile server 122 are shown as multiple servers, each of these components may be a single logical or physical server.
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system may be configured on its own server (not shown). Which may communicate with access point 106 to receive connection parameters and send the generated connection profile to profile server 122 and/or profile database server 120. Further, the experience enhancement server may communicate with the digital component server to request and receive digital components. Experience enhancement server also communicates with access point 106 to communicate the identified digital components to user devices (e.g., user devices 108, 110, and 112).
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example process 200 performed by the experience enhancement system to communicate digital components to a user device. At 202, the experience enhancement system receives access point data indicating that a particular device is connected to a particular access point that provides internet access to a plurality of other different user devices. In implementations where the experience enhancement system resides on one or more profile servers 122, profile server 122 receives access point data from access point 106. Access point 106 receives some access point data from user devices (e.g., user devices 108, 110, and/or 112). Thus, the access point data may include access point data 114, 116, and/or 118.
In implementations where the experience enhancement system is configured on access point 106, the experience enhancement system receives the access point data at access point 106. The access point data may include access point data from a user device (e.g., user device 108, 110, or 112) and access point data retrieved from the access point 106. The access point data may include a location (e.g., latitude and longitude) of the access point, a type of location (e.g., a travel center such as an airport, a train station, and another suitable location), a name of the location (e.g., john kennedy international airport), a location of the user device relative to the access point, and other suitable data. The access point data may also include user device information such as operating system, device manufacturer and model, mobile network range, browser name and version, time of day, date, and other suitable data.
In implementations where the experience enhancement system is configured on its own server, the experience enhancement system receives access point data on the server from, for example, the access point 106 itself. Access point 106 may combine access point data received from one or more user devices with access point data associated with the access point itself and send the data to a server hosting the experience enhancement system.
At 204, the experience enhancement system determines one or more connection parameters for a connection of a particular user device to the access point based on the access point data. In some implementations, the connection parameters include geographic location parameters of the access point. The experience enhancement system may parse the received data to determine connection parameters. For example, the access point data may be a structured file (e.g., an XML file) that the experience enhancement system may parse according to a parsing algorithm that identifies various tags in the structured data for specific pieces of data. Thus, the connection parameters may include one or more of the above-mentioned access point data.
At 206, the experience enhancement system translates the connection parameters including the identifier of the access point and the time of day into attributes of the user. For example, the experience enhancement system may translate the location of the wireless access point to the location of the user device. If there is only one access point in the vicinity, the experience enhancement system may use angle of arrival (angle of arrival) techniques to identify the exact location of the user device. The techniques are applicable to a multi-user, multiple-input, multiple-output ("MIMO") wireless access point (which includes two or more antennas). If multiple access points are within range of the user device, the experience enhancement system may use triangulation techniques based on distance (e.g., by measuring signal strength) from each router in the vicinity. In another example, the experience enhancement system may determine the type of location (e.g., from access point data). For example, the location may be a travel center, (such as a train station, bus station, airport, or another suitable travel center).
In one example, the experience enhancement system may use the location of the access point (e.g., based on the type of location) to derive attributes of the user. Thus, if the type of location is a travel site, the experience enhancement system may send a request to the travel database for a possible destination. The request may include a site name (e.g., airport name, site number) and a substation name (e.g., gate number). Based on this information, the experience enhancement system may receive one or more destinations and store the new user attribute "destination". In another example, the experience enhancement system may query a weather database for the location of the access point and the current time to determine the "weather" user attribute. The weather user attribute may be used to identify a digital component that is relevant to a particular weather (e.g., an advertisement for umbrellas if the weather indicates rainy days, or for sunglasses if the weather indicates sunny days).
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system may derive the user attribute based on a location of the access point. For example, the experience enhancement system may determine the language of the user based on the location so that the digital components presented to the user are in the correct language. In another example, based on the time of day and the length of the connection, the experience enhancement system may add a "nutritional" attribute indicating that the user may want to eat or drink. For example, if the user device has been connected for many hours, the "nutritional" user attribute may have a positive value such that a digital component of a recommendation or advertisement (e.g., a nearby restaurant) may be identified.
When the access point is located in a travel site, the experience enhancement system may use a specific action to translate the connection parameters into attributes of the user. The experience enhancement system determines that the access point is located at a travel site based on the identifier of the access point. The experience enhancement system may use a variety of methods to make the determination. For example, the experience enhancement system may retrieve data associated with the access point. The data may include a type of location. If the type of location matches the travel site type, the experience enhancement system determines that the access point is located at a travel site. In another example, the experience enhancement system may retrieve global positioning coordinates of the access point and determine whether a travel site is present at those coordinates based on those coordinates.
In determining that the access point is located at a travel site, the experience enhancement system uses the time of day to determine one or more travel routes for the travel site. For example, the experience enhancement system may access one or more travel information databases (e.g., bus schedules, train schedules, flight schedules, and other suitable travel information). The experience enhancement system may retrieve the type associated with the travel site. The types may include train stations, bus stations, airports, and other suitable types. Further, each site may include a number of sub-sites corresponding to, for example, a track number of a train site, a gate number of an airport site, or another suitable sub-site. The experience enhancement system may retrieve a child station associated with an access point, for example, based on metadata of the access point. Thus, the record for an access point may include a station name value and a sub-station name value.
The experience enhancement system may send the time of day, the site values, and the substation values to a database to identify one or more routes for combinations of these values. For example, the experience enhancement system may receive (e.g., based on an access point located near a particular gate in an airport site) from a database one or more flights that will depart from the gate within a threshold amount of time (e.g., within two hours). Based on this information, the experience enhancement system may generate destination user attributes, and in some implementations, the type of destination (e.g., flight). Typically, the destination may be a bus route in a bus stop, a train route on a specific track of a train stop, or another suitable destination.
In a specific example, if the experience enhancement system determines that the user device is connected to a particular track adjacent to the next train to washington dc through an access point at a train station in new york city, the experience enhancement system stores the item "washington dc" as the "destination" user attribute.
Referring back to FIG. 2, at 208, the experience enhancement system generates a connection profile for the user based on the user's attributes and one or more connection parameters. For example, the experience enhancement system may generate a data structure to save the connection profile. The connection profile may include a location (e.g., latitude and longitude) of the access point, a type of location (e.g., a travel center such as an airport, a train station, and another suitable location), a name of the location (e.g., john kennedy international airport), a location of the user device relative to the access point. Further, the connection profile may include weather information for the user device (e.g., local weather). When the connection profile is associated with a travel site, the connection profile may include weather information for the destination. In some implementations, the connection profile may include device information, such as the version of the operating system, the device manufacturer and model, the mobile network range, the browser name and version, and other suitable device information. The experience enhancement system may store the profile data in a database (e.g., profile database 120).
At 210, the experience enhancement system identifies digital components to present at a particular user device based on a connection profile generated for the user. The digital components may be presented to a particular user device during connection of the particular user device to a particular access point. As described above, the experience enhancement system may send a request for digital components to the digital component server 104. The request may include one or more attributes of the user. In some implementations, the request includes a full connection profile or a partial connection profile. In some implementations, the connection profile includes or is based on a connection speed of the user device to the access point 106. Based on the connection speed, the experience enhancement system may provide different types of content (e.g., text content at slower connection speeds, and image and/or multimedia content at faster connection speeds). The experience enhancement system may send a request from the server of profile server 122. Experience enhancement system may retrieve a connection profile or a portion of a connection profile from profile database 120. In some implementations (e.g., where profile server 122 and/or profile database 120 are not present), experience enhancement system may send a request from access point 106. For example, access point 106 may store the connection profile in its memory and/or in profile database 120. The access point 106 may retrieve the complete connection profile or a portion of the connection profile from the profile database 120 or its own storage and send a request to the digital component server 104.
In one example, the experience enhancement system may store the connection profile in a profile database. The experience enhancement system may also initiate a search for digital components. For example, components of the experience enhancement system may reside on servers of the profile server 122. The component may initiate a request for the digital component to the digital component server 104. The request may include the term "washington, dc. A digital component server of the digital component servers 104 can receive the request and initiate a search for the term within metadata associated with the digital component. The search may be a database search in a database of digital components. In some implementations, the search includes a search of a database index (e.g., stored in digital component server 104 and digital component database 124). When the search returns one or more matching digital components. The one or more digital components are sent to profile server 122 and then to user devices (e.g., devices 108, 110, and/or 112) via access point 106.
At 212, the experience enhancement system communicates the identified digital component to the user device. The identified digital components are transmitted during a connection of a particular user device to a particular access point. In some implementations, the transmitted digital components are different from the digital components transmitted to at least one of a plurality of other different user devices that are also connected to a particular access point. The experience enhancement system may communicate the digital components to a user device (e.g., user devices 108, 110, and/or 112). In some implementations, the experience enhancement system receives the digital component (or in some cases multiple digital components) at profile server 122 and sends the digital component to the user device or user devices (e.g., user devices 108, 110, and/or 112) through access point 106. In some implementations (e.g., where there is no existing profile server 122), the experience enhancement system receives the digital component at access point 106 and sends the component to user devices 108, 110, and/or 122.
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system assigns a particular connection profile to a group of similar connection profiles (e.g., a group including connection profiles with similar user attributes). In particular, the experience enhancement system compares the user's connection profile with the connection profiles of other users. These connection profiles may be assigned to a connection group. If the connection profile matches one or more profiles in the connection group, the experience enhancement system assigns the connection profile to the particular connection group.
Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a process 300 for assigning connection profiles to groups. In some implementations, the experience enhancement system performs the actions of process 300 on a server of profile server 122. The experience enhancement system may perform process 300 on access point 106 or another suitable device. At 302, the experience enhancement system retrieves a set of connection profiles for a set of users. For example, the experience enhancement system may retrieve the connection profile from profile database 120 by generating a profile request. The experience enhancement system may send a profile request from a server of profile server 122. In some implementations, the experience enhancement system sends a profile request from access point 106. The experience enhancement system receives a set of connection profiles in response to the request. If the connection profile is persisted locally, the experience enhancement system may retrieve the connection profile from local storage.
Upon retrieval, the experience enhancement system may traverse the set of connection profiles to find a match. Thus, at 304, the experience enhancement system may select a previously unselected connection profile from the collection. Upon receiving the connection profile, the experience enhancement system may generate a data structure and place the connection profile in the data structure. The generated data structure may allow traversal of the items in the data structure.
At 306, the experience enhancement system compares the selected connection profile to the user's connection profile. For example, each connection profile may include a number of user attributes. The experience enhancement system may compare the corresponding attributes. Fig. 5 illustrates a data structure 500 storing connection profiles 502 and 504. The connection profile may include a profile identifier 512 that is a unique value (e.g., alphanumeric string) that identifies each profile. Each connection profile may also include an access point identifier 506. The access point identifier 506 identifies the access point to which the user device is connected. In addition, each connection profile may include a connection date/time 508 and other attributes (e.g., attribute 510). Other attributes may be user attributes, such as user attributes derived from connection parameters. The experience enhancement system may compare the corresponding attributes (as shown in fig. 5).
At 308, the experience enhancement system determines whether the selected profile matches the user's connection profile. In some implementations, if one or more user attributes or connection parameters in two profiles match, the experience enhancement system determines that the two profiles match. In some implementations, if a certain percentage of the attributes within the configuration file match, a match is found. If the profiles match, process 300 moves to 310 where the experience enhancement system assigns a connection profile to the connection group corresponding to the selected connection profile. For example, the experience enhancement system may store a group identifier with the connection profile to indicate the associated group. If the experience enhancement system determines that the selected profile does not match the user's connection profile, process 300 moves to 312.
At 312, the experience enhancement system determines whether there are any more previously unselected profiles in the connection profile set. If there are more previously unselected profiles, process 300 moves to 304 where another profile is selected for comparison. Thus, the experience enhancement system traverses the set of connection profiles. Although not shown in FIG. 3, the experience enhancement system may retrieve another set of profiles (e.g., profiles associated with different groups) and traverse it to determine if the user's connection profile matches a different group. At 314, if no group's profile matches the user's connection profile, the experience enhancement system generates a new connection group. For example, the experience enhancement system may generate a new group identifier for the new group and store the identifier with the user's connection profile.
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system assigns a connection profile to the group to communicate the same digital component to each user device in the group. Process 400 of fig. 4 illustrates a process for assigning a connection profile to a group to transfer the same digital component to user devices in the group. At 402, the experience enhancement system compares each connection profile to other connection profiles. For example, the experience enhancement system may traverse each stored connected profile and compare each profile to each other profile to identify matching attributes within those profiles. If a threshold number of attributes match, the experience enhancement system determines that two profiles should be assigned to the same group.
At 404, the experience enhancement system generates a first connection profile group and a second connection profile group based on the comparison. Each of the first connection profile group and the second connection profile group includes connection profiles having a threshold number of matching attributes. In some implementations, more than two connection profile groups may be generated based on the matching. For each profile, the experience enhancement system may store the group information along with the connection profile itself. In some implementations, the group information may be stored separately from the connection profile (e.g., in a table with identifiers of matching profiles).
At 404, the experience enhancement system identifies for the first connection profile group a first digital component to be transferred to a user device corresponding to the first group, and at 406, the experience enhancement system identifies for the second connection profile group a second digital component to be transferred to a user device corresponding to the second group. For example, the experience enhancement system may identify a representative profile for each group. The experience enhancement system may retrieve all attributes within the configuration file for each group that are the same for all or some of the connection configuration files in the corresponding group and generate a group configuration file for each group. The experience enhancement system may send each group profile in a corresponding request for a digital component. For example, the experience enhancement system may send each request including a group profile from one of the profile servers 122 to a server of the digital component server 104. In some implementations, the experience enhancement system may send a request from the access point 106. The experience enhancement system may receive one or more digital components in response to the request.
The digital component server 104 receives the request and compares the connection profile or a portion of the connection profile received in the request with the metadata of each digital component (e.g., the digital components stored in the digital component database 124). If the connection parameters match the metadata of a particular digital component, the digital component is retrieved from the digital component database 124 and sent to the requesting user device via the profile server 122 and access point 106.
At 410, the experience enhancement system transmits the first digital component to a user device corresponding to the first group and transmits the second digital component to a user device corresponding to the second group. For example, the experience enhancement system may transmit the digital components from the servers of the profile server 122 by including the corresponding device identifiers (e.g., the internet protocol addresses of the devices) in the digital components as targets of the digital components. The experience enhancement system may send the digital components through the access point 106. In some implementations (e.g., when profile server 122 is not present), experience enhancement system receives the digital component at access point 106 and sends the digital component to user devices 108, 110, and/or 112 according to the group assignment.
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system detects when a particular device has reconnected to a particular access point and updates the connection profile based on the reconnection (e.g., rather than creating a new connection profile), while also identifying new digital components for the user device. Fig. 6 illustrates a process 600 for detecting a user device reconnecting to an access point and identifying a new digital component for the user device.
At 602, the experience enhancement system determines that a particular device has reconnected to a particular access point. The experience enhancement system may make the determination by comparing the device identifier of the connected device to device identifiers stored in other connection profiles. For example, the connection profile 502 of fig. 5 may have an attribute that stores a device identifier of the connected device. Additionally, the experience enhancement system may compare the access point identifier (e.g., AP identifier 506 of fig. 5) of each connection profile to the access point identifier of the access point (e.g., access point 106) to which the user device is connected. If both the access point identifier and the device identifier match a particular connection profile, the experience enhancement system determines that a particular device has reconnected to the particular access point.
At 604, the experience enhancement system identifies updated attributes for the user based on the identifier of the access point and the new time of day. For example, if the access point is located at a particular gate in an airport site, the experience enhancement system may request flight information based on the site, gate, and time of day. In response, the experience enhancement system receives one or more possible destinations for the connection profile.
At 606, the experience enhancement system updates the connection profile based on the updated attributes. Continuing with the example above, the experience enhancement system may store the one or more new destinations in a connection profile. At 606, the experience enhancement system identifies new digital components based on the updated connection profile and the differences between the connection profiles. For example, the experience enhancement system may identify a digital component related to the new destination (e.g., if the new destination is san francisco, the identified digital component may be a commercial in san francisco).
In some implementations, the experience enhancement system identifies that the user device has connected to a new access point and identifies new digital components based on the updated connection profile. Fig. 7 is a block diagram of components used to identify that a user device has connected to a new access point and to identify new digital components based on an updated connection profile. At 702, the experience enhancement system determines that a particular device has connected to a different access point. The experience enhancement system may make the determination by comparing the device identifier of the connected device to device identifiers stored in a variety of connection profiles. For example, the connection profile 502 of fig. 5 may have an attribute that stores a device identifier of the connected device. Further, the experience enhancement system may compare the access point identifier (e.g., AP identifier 506 of fig. 5) of each connection profile to the access point identifier of the access point (e.g., access point 106) to which the user device is connected. If the device identifier matches a particular connection profile, but the access point identifiers do not match, the experience enhancement system determines that the particular device has connected to another access point.
At 704, the experience enhancement system determines additional attributes for the user based on the identifiers of the different access points and the new time of day. For example, if the access point is located at a particular gate in an airport site, the experience enhancement system may request flight information based on the site, gate, and time of day. In response, the experience enhancement system receives one or more possible destinations for the connection profile. The experience enhancement system may compare the destination data with location data of access points to which the user device has connected. If the data matches, the experience enhancement system determines that the user is traveling back to the origin. At 706, the experience enhancement system adds additional attributes to the connection profile. Continuing with the above example, the experience enhancement system may store the updated destination as a starting point in relation to destinations already present in the connection profile.
At 708, the experience enhancement system identifies new digital components based on the additional attributes and the user attributes. For example, the experience enhancement system may identify a digital component that is related to both the origin and the new destination (e.g., if the new destination is san francisco and the origin is new york, the identified digital component may be an advertisement for a chain restaurant where both new york and san francisco exist).
