Definitions
- This instant specification relates to information management.
- Video hosting systems such as YOUTUBE
- YOUTUBE can upload videos for other people to view.
- Other users can place a video provided by the video hosting system on their web page by embedding or linking to the video sourced by the video hosting system.
- the users that upload videos may or may not include a detailed description of the uploaded content.
- Some video hosting systems display content (e.g., advertising) associated with an uploaded video. Targeting advertisements (ads) to be associated with a video may be difficult if the uploaded video is not accompanied by sufficient metadata (e.g., an attending description).
- Some systems attempt to directly analyze the content of an uploaded video and select advertisements to display with the video based on this analysis.
- this document describes selecting advertisements or other content to present with media without directly analyzing the content of the media.
- a computer-implemented method includes identifying content locations that embed a selected content item, aggregating content derived from the identified content locations, and transmitting one or more advertisements (ads) that are targeted to the aggregated content for presentation with the selected content item embedded on the identified content locations.
- a computer-implemented method includes identifying electronic documents that embed non-textual media, aggregating content derived from at least two of the electronic documents that embed the media, selecting an advertisement (ad) that corresponds to the aggregated content, and transmitting the selected ad for presentation with the non-textual media embedded in the electronic documents.
- a system in another general aspect, includes a data store having information that identifies content locations that embed a content item, means for aggregating content derived from the one or more identified content locations, and an advertising system that derives keywords based on the aggregated content and uses the keywords to identify corresponding advertisements for display with the embedded content item.
- a computer-implemented method includes identifying web pages that embed a selected video, aggregating content derived from the identified web pages, and transmitting one or more advertisements (ads) that are targeted to the aggregated content for presentation with the selected video embedded on the identified web pages.
- an advertisement can be selected for display in association with a video without directly analyzing the content of the video.
- an ad associated with a video presented on web page can be selected even if the web page has minimal content.
- ads to present with videos can be selected more efficiently because textual content of web pages may be more quickly analyzed than content within a video.
- computational and storage savings can be achieved by selecting an ad to present with a video embedded in a first web page if the first web page has sufficient content to target the ad; otherwise, the ad can be selected based on content derived from multiple web pages that embed the video.
- FIGS. 1A and 1B are diagrams of an example system that gathers aggregated content derived from web sites that embed a video and transmits ads for presentation with the embedded video based on the aggregated content.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example process for selecting advertisements to associate with videos or other media.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram of an example system that retrieves content derived from web sites that embed a video, selects ads to present based on the aggregated retrieved content, and transmits the ads to the web sites.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process for determining whether to target advertising to a video based on aggregated content.
- FIG. 5 is a general computing system that can be used to implement the previously described systems and processes.
- This document describes systems, methods, computer program products and techniques for selecting advertisements (or other content) to display in association with a video based on content that is aggregated from one or more locations (e.g., web pages) that present the video.
- a system determines that several web pages include the video.
- the system aggregates content derived from the several web pages and determines which advertisements (ads) correspond to the aggregated content. This may permit targeted ads to appear with the video on the web pages even if a particular web page does not include sufficient content to determine a corresponding ad. While reference is made to presenting advertisements, other forms of content including other forms of sponsored content can be delivered by the system.
- FIG. 1A is a diagram of an example system 100 that gathers aggregated content derived from locations (e.g., web sites) that embed a video.
- system 100 includes an embedded video 102 , which is presented on several web sites including blog web sites 104 , personal or commercial web sites 106 , social networking web sites 108 , media sharing web sites 110 , and other web sites 111 .
- Some the web sites that present the embedded video 102 may include content that is related to the web site or the embedded video 102 .
- the blog commentary 112 may be related to the embedded video.
- the blog commentary 112 can include a description of what the video shows, a comment about the video, a review of the video, etc.
- the social networking web sites 104 can include profile information 116 about a social networking user.
- the social networking user may have uploaded the video to his or her profile page on the social network.
- a server outside the social network hosts the embedded video and the social networking user links to the video so that it is displayed on the user's profile page.
- the user's profile page may not include any information about the video; however, the presence of other content on the same page may provide evidence that the video is related to the other content.
- content on a page that embeds or hosts the video (where the content is not necessarily explicitly referring to the video) is aggregated with content from other pages that embed or host the video, as previously described.
- the media sharing web sites 110 can include media content 118 .
- the media content can include text, other videos, audio files, and images.
- Text on the media sharing web sites 110 can, for example, describe the media, rate the media, and refer viewers to other related media.
- the personal or commercial web sites 106 can include web site content 114 such as images, descriptive text, and metadata. Content for these web sites 106 can describe a product or service offered for sale, contact information, current news related to a company or person, web accessible email, search results, photo galleries, etc.
- web servers that host the web sites 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 , and 111 that display the embedded video 102 do not store the video 102 . Instead, another web server (not shown) hosts the video and the web sites 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 , and 111 include markup language references (e.g., hypertext markup language (HTML) references) to the embedded video so that when a browser loads one of the web sites the video is also loaded for presentation.
- markup language references e.g., hypertext markup language (HTML) references
- the system 100 also includes an advertising system 120 that stores ads in a database 122 .
- the advertising system 120 receives aggregated content 124 from the web sites 104 , 106 , 108 , and 110 .
- the advertising system can use the aggregated content 124 to determine which ads are most closely related to the aggregated content 124 .
- the advertisement system 120 can derive keywords from the aggregated content and match the derived content-based keywords with keywords associated with ads.
- the aggregated content can include content from a blog that describes NASCAR events, content from a car dealership web site that describes sports car specifications, and content from a social networking web site that describes high-performance engine tweaks to improve a car's acceleration.
- the advertising system 120 can classify the aggregated content and determine that the aggregated content is related to the keywords: muscle cars, engine modifications, and racing.
- One or more ads may be associated with the content-based keywords muscle cars, engine modifications, and racing.
- the advertising system 120 can select the related ads for display as discussed in association with FIG. 1B .
- FIG. 1B is a diagram of the system 100 that transmits ads 130 for presentation with the embedded video 102 based on the previously received aggregated content 124 from the web sites.
- the advertising system 120 can transmit the ads for display to web sites, which can include web sites that may have little content besides the embedded video.
- the advertising system 120 may have difficulty accurately targeting ads to associate with the embedded video 102 on web sites with minimal content if the advertising system 120 relied only on the minimal content. As shown in FIG. 1B , the advertising system can select ads to transmit to the web sites 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 and 111 based on the aggregated content from all or a portion of the web sites that embed the video 102 . This may permit accurately targeting ads to present with the video on the web sites 111 even though these web sites have minimal content.
- the ads may be effectively targeted to the videos on web pages with little content because other web pages that embed the video are likely to have content that is associated with the video (e.g., describes the video, rates the video, etc.).
- the advertising system 120 can select the advertisements to display with the video based on web sites that have more content. The advertising system 120 then can transmit the selected advertisements to display with the video at the web sites that have minimal content.
- an advertising system can select advertisements to display on the web pages having little content based on other web pages associated with the same domain.
- the www.i-love-car-racing.com may have dozens of web pages about car racing, but a web page that embeds a particular video may have very little content.
- the content collection server 308 can retrieve content from one or more other web pages that are associated with the domain and pass this content (which may be an aggregation of content from the web pages at the domain) to the advertising system 316 .
- the advertising system 316 can, in turn, select advertisements to present with the embedded video.
- the content collection server 308 can retrieve content from other web pages associated with a domain of the web page that embeds the video.
- the content collection server 308 can incorporate this information into the aggregated content. For example, in addition to (or instead of) receiving the media site, blog, profile, and web page content from pages that embed a particular video, the content collection server can retrieve content from other web pages that are associated with a web page that embeds the video.
- the other web pages are associated with the embedding web page because they are hosted under the same domain. In other implementations, the other web pages are associated with the embedding web page because the other web pages link to the embedding web page (e.g., via hyperlink) or because the embedding web page links to the other web pages.
- the web sites can display the selected ads in a portion of a web site that is reserved for advertising.
- the personal or commercial web sites 106 may have a portion of a web page reserved for GOOGLE ADSENSE ads. The portion can display the ads on the same web page that the video is displayed.
- the social networking web sites 108 can display the selected advertisements a banner that is displayed on a web page created by a user of the social network.
- the selected ads can be inserted in the video 102 .
- the advertising system 120 may access a server that hosts the video and insert the ad so that the ad is presented before, along with or after the video 102 is played.
- the selected advertisement is presented during the video playback.
- the ad can be a semi-transparent overlay positioned over a portion of the video so that it visible while the video plays.
- the advertising system 120 can redirect the link that embeds the video 102 so that the selected ad(s) are presented before (or after) the video 102 is played. After the ad is presented, the advertising system 120 can redirect the browser to the location originally identified by the link so that the video 102 is played.
- the selected ads are inserted in other media that is hosted on the web site that displays the video 102 .
- the media sharing web sites 110 may include several videos that are available for display in addition to the video 102 .
- the advertising system 120 can insert the selected ads in one of the other videos in addition to or instead of inserting the selected ads in the video 102 .
- the selected ads can be inserted as text (e.g., GOOGLE's ADWORDS) displayed in association with the video 102 or as images in banners on the web page.
- an ad can include a video.
- a video advertisement can be inserted for viewing before the video 102 is played.
- the selected ad can include an audio file.
- the audio file may be a voice over that is played during all or some of the video 102 .
- the selected ad can be a static image or text that is shown before or after the video 102 .
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example process 200 for selecting advertisements to associate with videos or other media.
- the process 200 can be performed, for example, by a system such as the system 100 or later described system 300 .
- a system such as the system 100 or later described system 300 .
- the description that follows uses the system 100 as the basis of an example for describing the process 200 ; however, another system, or combination of systems, can be used to perform the process 200 .
- the process 200 can begin with step 202 in which a video is received.
- a user may upload a video to a media-hosting server.
- the media-hosting server may be part of the system 100 which also includes the advertising system 120 .
- the media-hosting server may be a server associated with the YOUTUBE system.
- the user uploads the video to his or her YOUTUBE web page.
- the user may or may not have a significant amount of other content on the YOUTUBE page. If the user has content, it can include for example, a description of the video, comments about the video posted by other users, and a rating of the video.
- web sites that embed the video can be identified.
- the video can be embedded in web sites, for example, by including a uniform resource identifier (URI) for the video within HTML of a web site.
- URI uniform resource identifier
- a user may embed the video on the user's web page. More specifically, if the video is hosted by the YOUTUBE system, a user may include the following URI within the HTML of the user's web page:
- Execution of the example code displays the video whenever the web page that includes the code is loaded into, for example, an internet browser.
- a content collection server (not shown in FIG. 1 ) can identify web sites that have embedded the video.
- logs of the media-hosting server are analyzed to determine which web sites have requested playback of the video.
- the content collection server can analyze logs generated by the YOUTUBE system to determine what web sites have requested the video for playback.
- the logs may include, for example, query logs, general access request logs, resource access logs, page access logs, etc.
- web pages that were encountered in association with a search engine's functions can be analyzed.
- a search engine can index web pages in order to return web pages that correspond to search terms transmitted to the search engine.
- the search engine can cache the web pages.
- the cached web pages can include code indicating a video is embedded in the web page.
- the content collection server can analyze the cached web pages to identify which web pages have embedded the video. In other implementations, the content collection server can analyze the web pages during the indexing process whether or not the web pages are cached or discarded later.
- step 210 content from web sites having the embedded video are aggregated.
- the content collection server aggregates content from the blog web sites 104 , the social networking sites 108 , and media sharing sites 110 .
- the content collection server transmits a request to the search engine for a cached version of the content from the web sites.
- the content collection server requests the content from the web sites themselves.
- different weights can be assigned to each web site or type of web site.
- the advertising system may give more weight to content originating from blog sites relative to content from social networking sites when selecting ads from the aggregated content.
- content from news sites may be weighted more than both blog and networking sites.
- web pages with a threshold number of page views e.g., 100,000 per week
- Different weights can be assigned based on several predetermined thresholds.
- the assigned weights can be combined using a linear weighting algorithm or by a more complex learned weighting algorithm.
- the aggregated content may be an intersection of substantially similar content (e.g., words and phrases) that is found within each of the web sites.
- a first web site has content A that includes a discussion about “puppies” and “unicorns.”
- a second web site has content B that includes a description of “puppies” and “cats,” and
- a third web site has content C that includes text describing “puppies” and “hunting.”
- the aggregated content from the first, second, and third web sites can include the content related to puppies because this content is similar to all three web sites.
- the aggregated content may not include the content related to “unicorns,” “cats,” or “hunting” because these subjects are only found on one of the web sites.
- selecting content that is common to more than one of the web sites may increase a probability that the aggregated content is related to the video embedded in each of the web sites.
- the increase in probability is based on an assumption that common content found across several web sites that embed the video likely describes or is otherwise associated with the video.
- the content collection server can aggregate content that it determines is similar or related. For instance, if the third web site in the previous example had content C that included text describing “dogs” and “hunting,” the content collection server may aggregate the dog content with the puppies content because it determines that “dogs” and “puppies” are related. In some implementations, this determination is based on an index that cross-references related words, phrases, or subjects.
- the content collection server can aggregate all the content from web sites that embed the video. More specifically, the content collection server can create a virtual composite web page that includes content A, content B, and content C from the first, second, and third web sites, respectively.
- the collection server can transmit the virtual composite web page to a classifying system (not show) that determines keywords to associate with the content of web pages.
- the collection server can transmit the virtual composite web page to a classifying system such as GOOGLE's ADSENSE system.
- the aggregated content is transmitted to the advertising system.
- the content collection server can transmit the aggregated content to the advertising system 120 , which includes the previously mentioned classifier that derives the content-based keywords from the aggregated content.
- the advertising system can use the content-based keywords to select advertisements to display as discussed in association with FIG. 1B .
- ad(s) associated with the aggregated content are received.
- the content collection server can receive the ads.
- the content collection server then can transmit the ads to the web sites identified in step 204 .
- the advertising system can directly transmit the ads to the web sites identified in step 204 .
- the ads are transmitted to the identified web sites for presentation in association with the embedded video.
- the ads are displayed alongside of the embedded video.
- the video can be located in one section of the web page and the ads can be located in another section of the web page such as an area reserved for ads.
- the ads are inserted, associated with or otherwise combined with the video so that the ads are displayed in association with a presentation of the video.
- the process 200 can end.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram of an example system 300 that retrieves content from web sites that embed a video, selects ads to present based on the aggregated retrieved content, and transmits the ads to the web sites.
- the system 300 includes web servers 302 A-D that host media sharing web sites, blog web sites, social networking web sites, and personal or commercial web sites, respectively.
- each of the web sites includes an embedded video 304 and additional content 306 A-D.
- the system 300 also includes a content collection server 308 that identifies web sites that embed a video 304 and an advertising system 316 that select advertisements for display on the web sites that embed the video 364 .
- FIG. 3 includes arrows labeled “ 1 ” through “ 4 ,” which indicate an example sequence of steps that the system 300 may perform. The sequence is not intended to limit an order in which the steps may be accomplished but is provided to increase the clarity of explanation. In other implementations not shown, the steps may occur in a different order. For example, some of the steps may occur in parallel.
- the content collection server 308 retrieves content from the web sites that embed the video 304 .
- the content collection server 308 may identify the web sites using video/site linking information 310 .
- the video/site linking information 310 can include information derived from logs that identify web sites that have requested a video stream from a media hosting site, where the request initiates a presentation of the embedded video 304 when a web site is loaded by an Internet browser.
- the video/site linking information 310 can include information derived from an analysis of web pages encountered by a search engine.
- the web pages encountered by a search engine can include code which indicates that the video is embedded in the web page.
- the content collection server 308 also can include a content aggregator 312 .
- the content aggregator can process and combine all or a portion of the received content 306 A-D.
- the content aggregator 312 can generate aggregated content 314 based on an intersection of the received content 306 A-D.
- the content collection server 308 can transmit aggregated content 314 to the advertising system 316 .
- the advertising system 316 can include a content classifier 318 that analyzes the aggregated content 314 and determines keywords to associate with the aggregated content.
- the advertising system 316 can also include a keyword/ad matcher 320 that matches the keywords generated by the content classifier 318 to ads stored in a storage device 322 .
- each of the ads in the storage device 322 may be associated with advertising keywords that were submitted by an advertiser or automatically generated based on content of the ad.
- the keyword/ad matcher 320 can match the content-based keywords to the advertising keywords to determine ads that correspond to the aggregated content 314 .
- the ads can include a several media types.
- the ads may be audio ads 324 , video ads 326 , text ads 328 , or image ads 330 .
- the advertising system 316 can include an auction module 332 that runs auctions to determine which of the ads that match the aggregated content 314 are selected for display. For example, an advertiser can submit a bid associated with presenting the advertiser's ad. The ad(s) associated with the highest bid or group of highest bids are selected for presentation with the video.
- the auction module can include restrictions 334 for ads that are presented with videos.
- the restrictions 334 prevent certain ads from being eligible for display with the embedded video even if the ads correspond to the aggregated content or the highest bid.
- the restrictions 334 can include presentation restrictions for certain types of ads.
- the auction module 332 may exclude text ads from auctions where the ad will be embedded in the video.
- the auction module 332 may exclude audio ads from auctions where the ad is intended to be presented alongside the video in a section reserved for advertising.
- the auction module 332 may set different minimum bids for different media types. For example, the minimum accepted bid for a video ad may be higher than the minimum accepted bid for a text ad. In another example, the minimum accepted bid for an ad that is inserted before playback of the video may be higher than an ad that is displayed alongside the video or inserted after the video has finished playing.
- the advertising system 316 transmits the one or more selected ads 336 to the content collection server 308 , which in turn transmits the selected ads 336 to the web sites having the embedded video 304 as indicated by an arrow labeled “ 4 .”
- the web sites can present the selected ads 336 in association with the embedded video as described previously.
- the content collection server 308 and the advertising system 316 may be included in a single system or server.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an example process 400 for determining whether to target advertising to a video based on aggregated content.
- the systems 100 , 300 , or other systems not shown can perform the process 400 .
- the systems 100 , 300 are used in association with the description of process 400 .
- the process 400 can start in step 402 where a web site that embeds a video is identified.
- the content collection server 308 can use the video/site linking information 310 to determine which web sites have code indicating that the video is embedded.
- the threshold for the content indicates whether the advertising system 316 can accurately target an ad based on the content.
- the threshold can indicate that content from the identified web site must contain a minimum amount of words.
- the threshold can indicate that the content must include a minimum amount of “descriptive” words. For instance, frequently occurring words such as articles, pronouns, and common adjectives and adverbs (e.g., very) can be excluded from words counted toward the predetermined threshold. In some implementations, words counted toward the predetermined threshold are determined using term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) scoring.
- tf-idf term frequency-inverse document frequency
- the threshold can indicate content from a particular section of the web site must include a predetermined number of words.
- the threshold can indicate that the web site should have over five words in a section of the web site dedicated to describing the embedded video.
- One example of such a section is the “About this Video” section included in YOUTUBE web pages.
- step 406 an ad is targeted to the video based on content from the single identified web site (but not from other web sites that embed the video). After step 406 , the process can end.
- the process can perform optional step 408 , in which a determination is made whether an upload web page used to upload the video has sufficient content to use in targeting an ad for the video.
- a user can upload a video to the YOUTUBE system.
- the video can be accessed by viewing an upload web page hosted by the YOUTUBE system.
- the upload web page may include content that describes or is otherwise associated with the video.
- the content collection server 308 or the advertising system 316 can retrieve content information from a system that hosts the video, which in this example is the YOUTUBE system. If the upload web page on the YOUTUBE system includes a predetermined amount of content, the advertising system 316 can use that content to select an ad to display in association with the embedded video on the web site (which is different from the upload web site in this example) as indicated in step 410 . After step 410 , the process can end.
- step 412 if it is determined that the upload web page does not have sufficient content to target an ad, an ad can be selected for presentation with the video based on content that is aggregated from multiple web pages that embed the video as previously described.
- the process 400 can end.

- a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to communicate with, one or more mass storage devices for storing data files; such devices include magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and optical disks.
- Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
- semiconductor memory devices such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices
- magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks
- magneto-optical disks and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
- the processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).
- ASICs application-specific integrated circuits
- the features can be implemented on a computer having a display device such as a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device such as a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- the features can be implemented in a computer system that includes a back-end component, such as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, such as an application server or an Internet server, or that includes a front-end component, such as a client computer having a graphical user interface or an Internet browser, or any combination of them.
- the components of the system can be connected by any form or medium of digital data communication such as a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), peer-to-peer networks (having ad-hoc or static members), grid computing infrastructures, and the Internet.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- peer-to-peer networks having ad-hoc or static members
- grid computing infrastructures and the Internet.
- the computer system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a network, such as the described one.
- the relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- advertisements can be associated with other types of media as well.
- web sites may embed audio files.
- Aggregated content can be retrieved from the web sites that embed an audio file and the aggregated content can be used to select an ad to associate with the audio file.
- the selected ad can then be presented in association with the audio file.
- the selected ad can include audio that is played before the embedded audio file is played.
- the advertising content is broadly defined to include recommendations for other videos, announcements for events, and public service announcements.
- a user when a user uploads a video to a media hosting site such as the YOUTUBE system, the user may not include content that describes the video. This may make it difficult to accurately select advertising to display in association with the uploaded video.
- the previously described systems and processes can be used to select an ad to display with the uploaded video based on content from one or more web sites that embed the uploaded video.
- the systems 100 , 300 can determine whether to select ads based on aggregated content or content from a single page having an embedded video by observing if the advertising system returns a threshold number of ads based on the single page. If there are too few ads returned, the advertising system can select ads based on the aggregated content.
- the described systems and methods are not limited to identifying a content item, such as a video, embedded in content locations, such as web pages. In other implementations, other types of content items can be identified in other types of content locations.
- the described systems and methods may be used to identify radio programming that includes a selected audio recording. Content derived from the identified radio programming (e.g., by analyzing metadata associated with the radio programming or an audio-to-text recognition process) can be aggregated. Ads that are targeted to the aggregated content of the radio programming can be transmitted for presentation with the audio recording. For example, an audio ad can be played before or after the audio recording, where the audio ad is targeted to the content of a radio program that proceeds (or follows) the audio recording.
- the content location can include television programming.
- the content collection server 308 can identify television programming that includes a selected video.
- the content collection server 308 can extract content associated with the television programming (e.g., by retrieving closed caption information, program guide information, etc. for the television programming).
- the advertising system 316 can select a video advertisement for display in association with the selected video, where the selection is based on the aggregated television programming content.
- the content location can include print media, such as magazines or newspapers, and the content item can include an image or text (e.g., articles).
- a particular image may be a stock image that a magazine employee purchases from an online image repository.
- information associating the magazine and purchased image can be transmitted to the content collection server 308 .
- several magazines may purchase the stock photo.
- the content collection server 308 may include metadata associated with each of the magazines.
- metadata associated with a magazine called “Computer Power User” may specify that the magazine is related to computers, video games, gadgets, and programming.
- the purchase information may indicate that the magazine “Computer Power User” as well as five other magazines purchased the stock photo.
- the content collection server 308 can aggregate the metadata from the magazines that purchased the stock photo, and the advertising system 316 can select a text or image ad to place in one or more of the magazines using a system similar to GOOGLE'S AD WORDS for print ads.
