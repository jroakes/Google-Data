Definitions
- the present invention relates to a system for adapting the Domain Name System (DNS), which has been used for mapping names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, to a broadcast environment, such as in a broadband cable or satellite television network.
- DNS Domain Name System
- IP Internet Protocol
- the DNS as used in the environment of computer networks such as the Internet, is a tool for mapping domain names, which are short alphabetical names, to an IP address. For example, the domain name “www.gi.com” may be mapped to an IP address such as “196.0.5.93”.
- the DNS provides a hierarchical domain-based naming scheme and a distributed database system for implementing the naming scheme.
- an application program such as a web browser, calls a library procedure known as a resolver, and passes the domain name to it.
- the resolver sends a data packet to a local DNS server, which looks up the name and returns the IP address to the resolver.
- the resolver provides the IP address to the application, which can use it to establish a connection with the computer represented by the domain name, such as a server.
- a system is needed that allows a server, or a set of servers, to specify the location of content and services within a broadcast using the domain name syntax.
- the system should allow client applications, such as a web browser, to locate any information that is part of a broadcast through the means of a domain name.
- client applications such as a web browser
- the system should allow defined broadcast domain names to be used within a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to specify the location of broadcast content and services.
- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- the system should be suitable for use in a digital video environment. Additionally, the system should be suitable for use with virtually any type of broadcast or interactive network, including a satellite network and a cable television network.
- the system should organize the domain names in a domain name space, and provide information to network users in the form of a broadcast DNS message having a broadcast resource record that identifies a data source that is associated with a respective domain, where the data source can be a broadcast programming service, such as TV program, or other data, for example.
- a broadcast DNS message having a broadcast resource record that identifies a data source that is associated with a respective domain, where the data source can be a broadcast programming service, such as TV program, or other data, for example.
- the broadcast resource records should be provided to the users in a non-interactive manner though periodic transmissions, or in an interactive manner, in response to a resolver query to a name server.
- the system should allow different servers to manage different portions or zones of the domain name space.
- the present invention provides a system having the above and other advantages.
- the present invention relates to a system for adapting the Domain Name System (DNS), which has been used for mapping names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, to a broadcast environment, such as in a broadband cable or satellite television network.
- DNS Domain Name System
- IP Internet Protocol
- a method for providing a broadcast domain name system includes the step of providing at least one master file at a broadcast domain name server to define at least one node within a broadcast domain name space.
- the node is provided in an associated zone of, and corresponds to, a domain within the broadcast domain name space, and the domain has an associated domain name.
- the master file is used to form a broadcast resource record that designates at least one attribute of the node.
- a message comprising the broadcast resource record is transmitted from the broadcast domain name server to a resolver to enable a user of the broadcast domain name system to resolve the domain name.
- the domain name space may include a television-related domain, with sub-domains for different service providers (e.g., ABC, HBO), and a cable domain, with sub-domains for applications, administrative functions and operating system functions, e.g., at a set-top terminal.
- the television sub-domains may have their own sub-domains.
- “ABC” may have the sub-domains “NEWS”, “WEATHER”, “SPORTS” and so forth.
- the master files include broadcast resource records (BRRs) that identify the broadcast programming sources (e.g., “ABC”).
- the corresponding BRR information When a query for a broadcast domain name is received from a-user program, e.g., from a user application of the set-top box, the corresponding BRR information is returned to the user program via a client resolver function.
- the corresponding BRR information identifies, e.g., an Internet Protocol address, a name, or a virtual channel that are associated with a data source that contains a service, e.g., a broadcast video programming service.
- the BRRs are carried in a broadcast DNS message that is transmitted to a client resolver that a user program can access.
- the broadcast resource records may be provided to a client resolver in a non-interactive manner, such as by periodic transmissions (e.g., carouseling, or some other predetermined scheduling) of the BDNS messages.
- broadcast resource records may be provided to a client resolver in a interactive manner, such as occurs with traditional DNS resource records.
- a corresponding method for use at a resolver is also presented.

- DNS Domain Name System
- IP Internet Protocol
- the present invention describes various options for implementing a broadcast domain name system (BDNS) in broadband environments.
- Section 2 provides background information on how the Domain Name System (DNS) is currently used within the framework of the Internet.
- Section 3 describes specific configurations of the Broadcast Domain Name System (BDNS) of the present invention.
- DNS Domain Name System
- the BDNS design is intended to be an open and generic mechanism allowing applications to resolve domain names within a broadcast environment. To achieve this goal, the design outlines methods for defining broadcast domain names, and authorities for those domains. An “authority” refers to the entity that manages authoritative resource records, which are the records for each domain. The BDNS design is also intended to provide support for Advanced Television Enhancement Forum Specification (ATVEF)-compliant applications.
- ATVEF Advanced Television Enhancement Forum Specification
- the BDNS of the invention provides applications with the capability to resolve domain names within broadcast environments. Since a web browser is one of the most widely used applications that uses the traditional DNS, we briefly review how such an application accesses the DNS.
- a URL typically consists of three main elements: a protocol, a host (or server), and an absolute path, i.e.:
- Any resource request for example via a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a web browser HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request, requires resolving the location of the host where the resource resides. This is needed to establish a connection between the machine (or local host) that is making the request and the host machine where the resource resides.
- a web browser request such as “http://www.gi.com/index.html” results initially in a DNS lookup to resolve the IP address of the host (www.gi.com). In this case, once resolving the IP address, an IP connection is established with the host, and the application sends the HTTP request for the resource, including the path element.
- Another example is the request of a resource that resides on the local machine from which the request is being generated, e.g., “file:///mydir/myfile.txt”. There are three slashes after “file:”. Between the second and third slash, typically is a host domain name that needs resolving. However, since the resource. requested is on the local host, no host resolution needs to occur. Thus, a “connection” to the local host is intrinsic.
- the existing architecture of the DNS is most widely used within the Internet for resolving a domain name, represented by text, into a location (e.g.—an IP address) of a remote host.
- the host (or domain name) element within a URL reveals a syntax-that consists of a series of domain labels.
- the domain labels within a URL are presented lowest level domain first and highest level domain last, and are separated by periods.
- the Domain System follows a hierarchical tree structure consisting of node and leaf domains. At the very top of the tree structure resides a single node called the root domain. The root domain does not have a corresponding domain label. Just below the root domain resides what are considered the top-level domains, such as ‘com’, ‘net’, and ‘org’. Nodes and leafs are alike in that they both specify domains within the system and are treated accordingly throughout the system.
- DNS messages are described in further detail in section 2.2.1.
- Name Servers answer queries from resolvers by reading information from master files (authoritative resource records) that are stored and maintained on the name server's local file system.
- master files authorities and registered on the name server's local file system.
- a Name Server's master files will contain information defining the zones for which it has authority.
- section 2.2.2 describes the Question section within DNS messages
- section 2.2.3 describes Resource Records (RR)
- section 2.2.4 discusses Domain Names, and an overview of master files is provided in section 2.2.5.
- the domain name system resolves domain names using a query/response style message protocol.
- Name server accesses on the Internet are supported by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on port 53 and by User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port 53 .
- TCP Transmission Control Protocol
- DNS message Description Identification An unsigned integer used by clients to match up responses with queries. Operation A value indicating that this message is either a query or a response to a query.
- Query_type An enumerated type field that indicates the query type being delivered in this DNS_message. Query_type is set by the originator of a query message and copied in a response message. The following are valid query types: standard, inverse, completion1, completion2 Answer_authoritative Indicates whether or not the answer section is authoritative. Message_truncated Indicates that this message is truncated. Recursion_desired Indicates that recursion is desired. Recursion_available Indicates that recursion is available.
- Table 2 describes the fields within a DNS message question section:
- Query_domain_name A domain name as defined in section 2.2.4 that corresponds to this query.
- Query_type A value specifying the type of this query. For example, ‘A’ represents an Internet address type and ‘SOA’ represents a start of authority type.
- Query_class A value specifying the class of this query. For example, ‘IN’ represents the Internet class.
- the answer_section, authority_section and additional_info_section fields within a DNS_message (see Table 1) all use the same format referred to as a “resource record”.
- the elements within a resource record are described in Table 3.
- Resource_domain_name A domain name as defined in section 2.2.4 that corresponds to this resource record.
- Type A value specifying the type of this resource record. For example, ‘A’ represents an Internet address type and ‘SOA’ represents a start of authority type.
- Class A value specifying the class of this resource. For example, ‘IN’ represents the Internet class.
- Time_to_live A value TTL
- Resource_data_length A value RENGTH
- Domain names are represented as a sequence of labels. Each label within a domain name is defined as an 8-bit length field followed by a series of octets (one byte values) specifying the label name.
- a compression method is used to minimize data transmitted in DNS messages. This scheme uses a pointer mechanism to minimize repetitive domain names within a single message. Table 4 describes the fields describing a domain name.
- N represents the number of labels within this domain name.
- Length_field A value that specifies the length in bytes of this domain name.
- Label_length A value specifying the length of the label name that follows in this message
- Label A case-insensitive label that must start and end with letters and where each byte can be one of ten digits ‘0’ through ‘9’, upper case letters ‘A’ through ‘Z’, lower case letters ‘a’ through ‘z’, or a hyphen ‘-’.
- Offset A value indicating the offset (in bytes) from the start of the message where a previous instance of the same name can be found.
- End_of_name A value always equal to zero that indicates the end of a domain name.
- Master files are used by name servers to define zones within domains. Name servers obtain information about zones by reading master files and answering foreign resolver queries about the zones. Master files contain lists of resource records in text form.
- the format of master files is that of a sequence of entries, which are line-oriented and take one of the following forms:
- parentheses “( )” can be used to extend resource records across line boundaries.
- An example master file representing the domain ‘abc.xyz.com’ might contain the following entries:
- the Broadcast Domain Name System (BDNS) of the present invention provides enhancements to the existing DNS architecture to allow broadcast domain names to be defined and utilized. To support these enhancements, both host Resolvers and Name Servers are required to provide support for a new set of Broadcast Resource Records (BRR).
- BBR Broadcast Resource Records
- FIG. 1 illustrates a non-interactive Broadcast Domain Name System (BDNS) in accordance with the present invention.
- BDNS Broadcast Domain Name System
- a client 110 and a Broadcast Domain Name Server are provided.
- the client 110 includes a user program 115 , which may be an application program running on a set-top box, for example.
- the program may include a web browser, and interactive program guide function., or other function for playing games, home shopping or banking, and so forth.
- the user program 115 communicates with a BDNS capable resolver 120 , which in turn communicates with a cache 125 .
- the resolver 120 receives broadcast BDNS messages from a broadcast name server 160 of a broadcast domain-name server 150 in accordance with the present invention.
- the resolver 120 need only have a one-way, receive capability in this embodiment.
- the client 110 can be any device that desires to resolve a name into an IP address/Source ID/Frequency/Broadcast IP address, etc., and can be located essentially anywhere, such as in a set-top box or a PC.
- the BDNS 150 is operating in a broadcast (transmit)-only environment by streaming/broadcasting pre-determined (pre-canned) BDNS messages to the resolver 120 .
- pre-canned pre-determined BDNS messages
- many resolvers/user terminals can receive the messages at the same time, such as in a subscriber television network.
- the BDNS 150 includes a database or storage device 155 for storing master files that includes broadcast domain information.
- the device 155 may comprise master files and/or a cache, for example. This information is retrieved by a master file/cache handler 165 in the server 160 , and processed to provide a broadcast DNS message 170 , which includes one or more broadcast resource records 175 .
- the BDNS message 170 is then provided to a message broadcasting/carouselling engine 180 , which broadcasts the messages to the one or more resolvers including the resolver 120 .
- the messages can be broadcast periodically according to a predetermined schedule. Moreover, the messages may be broadcast in separate portions, in a piece meal manner. Any known transport scheme, such as packetized digital MPEG messages may be used.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an interactive Broadcast Domain Name System (BDNS) in accordance with the present invention.
- BDNS Broadcast Domain Name System
- a BDNS-capable resolver 120 ′ provides a query to, and receives a corresponding BDNS response message from, an interactive query and response handler 220 of the Broadcast names server 160 ′.
- the resolve 120 ′ sends queries to the server 160 using the DNS message protocol.
- the resolver 120 ′ In response to a domain query from the user program 115 ′, the resolver 120 ′ transmits a query to the server 160 ′ to obtain the desired BDNS message as a response. The response is then provided to the user program 115 ′ as a user response.
- the resolver 120 ′ can store a number of broadcast resource records in its cache 125 ′ or other memory for responding to domain queries to resolve domain names. If the requested information is not present locally at the resolver cache 125 ′, only then is it necessary for the resolver 120 ′ to send a request to the server 160 ′ to obtain the requested information. For example, the resolver 120 ′ can locally store broadcast resource records that are most commonly used by users in the network.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a Broadcast Domain Name System (BDNS) with interactive and non-interactive modes in accordance with the present invention.
- the combined broadcast name server 1601 ′′ includes the functionality of both the non-interactive server 160 of FIG. 1, and the interactive server 160 ′ of FIG. 2 .
- the BDNS may be provided as a separate entity from a traditional DNS name server, or the functionality of the two name servers can be incorporated into one name server supporting interactive queries and responses, as well as broadcast responses.
- the server 160 ′′ is shown communicating with two different resolvers, including the two-way capable (send/receive) resolver 120 ′ of FIG. 2, and the one-way capable (receive only) resolver 120 of FIG. 1 .
- a single server 160 ′′ can service a number of resolvers (associated with set-top terminals or PCs, for example) in a network, where both one-way and two-way resolvers are provided.
- the number of resolvers and broadcast name servers can be adjusted to service any number of users in a network, such as a subscriber television network. For example, it may be desired for many users to access a single resolver, e.g., at a headend, via their user programs. Or, each user may have its own local resolver. Moreover, the broadcast domain name server(s) may be located at the headend, or at some centralized upstream location that services many headends. Other variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
- FIG. 4 illustrates chained-Broadcast Domain Name System servers in accordance with the present invention.
- two broadcast name serves 420 and 430 are provided in a chained (serial) configuration, although additional servers may be provided in various configurations, including parallel paths, hub and spoke configurations, ring configurations, or any know network topology.
- server chaining The purpose of server chaining is to divide up the responsibility for providing BDNS messages for the domain name space, and/or to provide redundancy.
- a first “broadcast name server A” 420 is provided for a portion of a domain name space, termed “sub-space A”, while a second “broadcast name server B” 430 is provided for another portion of a domain name space, termed “sub-space B”.
- the subs-spaces can be disjoint, partially overlapping or fully redundant.
- the servers A 420 and B 430 can each broadcast messages to, and receive requests from, the client 410 .
- Each server can be located in a physically remote location.
- the server B 430 can be a centralized national location, while the server A 420 is at a headend of a local subscriber television network, or at a television content provider's premises (e.g. NBC), for example.
- NBC television content provider's premises
- a satellite. link may be appropriate for communications between the two servers 420 and 430 .
- the BDNS may allow for the remapping of certain data source identifiers based upon broadcast plant, frequency, and/or channel map layouts.
- the servers may be associated with one another according to the content of the domain name space, the relative priority of the domain names to each-other, proprietary control of the domain name spaces, security access control considerations or other factors.
