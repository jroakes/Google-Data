Definitions
- This specification relates to providing search results for search queries submitted to an Internet search engine.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources (e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia content) that are relevant to a user's needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user.
- Internet search engines return a set of search results in response to a user submitted query.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an original search query submitted by a user of a user device to a search engine system; determining that the original search query is similar to a first search query of a plurality of search queries previously submitted by the user, wherein determining that the original search query is similar to the first search query comprises determining that at least one term from the original query matches a term that appears in the first search query; selecting a first term that appears in the first search query and not in the original search query, wherein selecting the first term comprises determining that the first term appears in at least a threshold number of other distinct search queries of the plurality of search queries previously submitted by the user, and wherein each other distinct search query is distinct from the both the first search query and the original search query; generating a revised search query by adding the first term that appears in the first search query to the original search query; and obtaining search results for the revised search query from a search engine.
- inventions of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.
- a system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.
- One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions.
- the method can further include providing the search results for the revised search query to the user device as part of a response to the original search query.
- Generating the revised search query can include: adding an operator that identifies the first term as an optional term in the revised search query.
- the method can further include assigning a first weight to the first term in the revised search query, the first weight indicating that occurrences of the first term in a resource are given less weight than identical occurrences of terms from the original search query when generating a score for the resource in response to the revised search query.
- Two search queries can be submitted by the same user if identifiers of cookies received from respective user devices submitting the two search queries match or respective login identifiers of users submitting the two search queries match.
- the method can further include: counting appearances of the first term in the plurality of search queries, wherein counting appearances comprises counting appearances of the first term in search queries that do not include the at least one term from the original query that matches a term that appears in the first search query.
- More relevant search results can be provided to a user in response to a search query submitted by the user by revising the search query to include one or more terms from queries previously submitted by the user.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for revising a search query to include one or more terms from a previously submitted query.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for determining whether a search query is similar to a previously submitted query.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system 114 .
- the search system 114 is an example of an information retrieval system implemented as computer programs on one or more computers in one or more locations, in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- a user 102 can interact with the search system 114 through a user device 104 .
- the user device 104 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 106 , for storing instructions and data and a processor 108 for executing stored instructions.
- the memory can include both read only and writable memory.
- the user device 104 can be a computer coupled to the search system 114 through a data communication network 112 , e.g., local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks, any of which may include wireless links.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the search system 114 can be implemented on the user device 104 , for example, if a user installs an application that performs searches on the user device 104 .
- the search system 114 provides a user interface to the user device 104 through which the user 102 can interact with the search system 114 .
- the search system 114 can provide a user interface in the form of web pages that are rendered by a web browser running on the user device 104 .
- a user 102 can use the user device 104 to submit a query 110 to a search system 114 .
- a search engine 130 within the search system 114 performs a search to identify resources matching the query.
- the query 110 may be transmitted through the network 112 to the search system 114 .
- the search system 114 includes an index database 122 and the search engine 130 .
- the search system 114 responds to the query 110 by generating search results 128 , which are transmitted through the network to the user device 104 for presentation to the user 102 , e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed by a web browser running on the user device 104 .
- the term “database” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data: the data does not need to be structured in any particular way, or structured at all, and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more locations.
- the index database 122 can include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently.
- the term “engine” will be used broadly to refer to a software based system or subsystem that can perform one or more specific functions. Generally, an engine will be implemented as one or more software modules or components, installed on one or more computers in one or more locations. In some cases, one or more computers will be dedicated to a particular engine; in other cases, multiple engines can be installed and running on the same computer or computers.
- the search engine 130 identifies resources that satisfy the query 110 .
- the search engine 130 will generally include an indexing engine 120 that indexes resources, an index database 122 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 152 or other software that generates scores for the resources that satisfy the query 110 and that ranks the resources according to their respective scores.
- the search system 114 also includes or can communicate with a query revision engine 140 that revises search queries received from users before they are processed by the search engine 130 .
- a query revision engine 140 that revises search queries received from users before they are processed by the search engine 130 .
- the search engine 130 can identify resources that satisfy the revised query.
- the query revision engine 140 can revise a received search query by adding to the received search query one or more terms from a search query that had previously been submitted to the search system 114 .
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for revising a search query to include one or more terms from a previously submitted query.
- the process 200 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 200 .
- the system receives an original search query from a user of a user device (step 202 ).
- the original search query is one or more terms submitted by the user to the system, e.g., through a user interface provided by the system to the user device.
- the system determines whether the original search query is similar to one or more previously submitted search queries (step 204 ).
- the set of previously submitted search queries considered as potentially being similar to the original search query are search queries that have previously been submitted to the search system by the same user that submitted the original search query.
- the set of previously submitted queries may include a pre-determined number of queries previously submitted the user, each query submitted by the user within a recent time window, or each query previously submitted by the user that is recorded in data available to the system.
- the system can determine whether two search queries were submitted by the same user, e.g., based on a comparison of identifiers of cookies received from the user devices submitting the two search queries or on a comparison of respective login identifiers of users submitting the two queries. An example process for determining whether two search queries submitted by a user are similar is described below with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the system determines not to revise the received search query and processes the original search query conventionally (step 206 ).
- the system may revise the query to include other kinds of terms, e.g., synonyms or other word forms of terms in the original search query.
- the system If the original search query is similar to a previously submitted query, the system generates a revised search query by adding one or more terms from the previously submitted queries to the original search query (step 208 ).
- the system selects the terms to be added to the original search query from terms included in the previously submitted similar queries. For example, the system may add each term that appears in a previously submitted similar query and in at least a threshold number of other queries in the set of previously submitted queries that are distinct from one another. Two queries can be considered to be distinct from one another if they differ by at least one term that is not a pre-determined stop word. For example, the system may add each term that appears in a previously submitted query that is similar to the original query and in at least two, three, or four other queries previously submitted by the user.
- the system can disregard pre-determined stop words. That is, even if a stop word satisfies the other criteria for being added to the original query, the system can determine not to add the stop word to the query.
- the system can optionally generate the revised query by removing one or more terms from the original query. For example, the system can determine whether removing any terms from the original query yields a revised query that has search results that overlap with search results for the original query. The system can determine that two queries have search results that overlap if, e.g., a count of search results for one query that identify a resource that is also identified by a search result for the other query exceeds a predetermined threshold value. In determining whether search results for two queries overlap, the system may optionally consider only a threshold number of highest-ranked search results for each query.
- the system can determine whether the revised search query is more popular than the original search query.
- One search query can be considered more popular than another search query if it has been submitted to a search engine more frequently than the other search query. If the revised search query is more popular than the original search query, the system can determine to remove the particular term from the original search query.
- the system submits the revised query to a search engine to obtain search results for the revised query (step 210 ).
- the search engine As described above, as part of generating search results for a search query, the search engine generates scores for the resources that satisfy the query.
- the score generated by the search engine for each resource can be based in part on how many times terms from the search query occur in the resource. Different occurrences of a term may be of varying significance in determining the score for a resource, e.g., an occurrence of a term in the title of the resource can be more significant than another occurrence of the same term in a different portion of the resource.
- each term in a query is assigned a weight, with the weight for a given term indicating how significant occurrences of the term in a resource are in determining the score for the resource relative to occurrences of other terms in the query.
- the system can assign a respective weight to each term in the revised search query, with the respective weights for each of the added terms from previously submitted queries being lower than the respective weights of terms from the original query. When that is done, occurrences of the added terms in a resource would be less significant than identical occurrences of terms from the original query in generating the score for the resource.
- the system can include an operator in the revised search query that identifies the added terms as optional terms.
- An optional term is a term whose presence in a resource is not mandatory for the resource to satisfy the search query.
- the system transmits the obtained search results to the user device for presentation to the user as part of a response to the original search query (step 212 ).
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for determining whether a search query is similar to a previously submitted query.
- the process 300 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 300 .
- the system receives an original search query from a user of a user device (step 302 ).
- the system determines whether any of the terms in the original search query match a term from a query in the set of previously submitted queries (step 304 ). In determining whether any terms match, the system can disregard particular pre-determined stop words.
- the system determines that the search query is not similar to any previously submitted query (step 306 ).
- the system determines whether the original search query is linked to at least one of the previously submitted queries that have a matching term (step 308 ).
- the system can determine whether two search queries are linked by accessing data that identifies related search queries for each of a group of search queries.
- the related search queries are identified based on user selections of search results provided to the users in response to search queries.
- a selection of a search result can be, e.g., a user action made with respect to the search result that initiates a request for the resource identified by the search result.
- the user action with respect to the search result may be a “click” on the search result, a voice-based selection, or a selection by a user's finger on a presence-sensitive input mechanism, e.g., a touch-screen device, or any other appropriate selection mechanism.
- selection data may not be tethered to the identity of individual users.
- the related queries for a particular search query can be queries in response to which users have frequently selected search results that identify the same resources as search results that users have frequently selected in response to the original search query.
- the system determines that the two search queries are linked. In some implementations, the system also determines that the original search query is linked to a previously submitted search query if the data identifies the same search query as being related to each of the two search queries.
- the system determines that the original search query is not similar to any previously submitted query (step 306 ).
- the system determines that the original search query is similar to the previously submitted query (step 310 ).
- the system also compares search results for the original search query and the previously submitted search query. If the search results for the original search query and the previously submitted search query overlap, the system can determine that the two queries are similar. If the search results do not overlap, the system can determine that the two queries are not similar. The system can determine whether the search results overlap, e.g., as described above with reference to FIG. 2 .
