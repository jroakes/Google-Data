Abstract
Description
MSG_TYPE is to MIN2 | These fields are for the standard of PCH message and at IS_95A, describe in the 7.7.2.3.2.7 joint. |
COMMAND | Be " 00 " if set this field, remote unit will send RULM according to the parameter in the follow-up field. Be " 01 " if set this field, remote unit will stop to send RULM and not having follow-up field. |
SEQ_IND | Be " 01 " if set this field, next field will be that |
| 8 bit sequences that the storage of this field will be launched as RULM repeatedly by remote unit. This field only occurs when the SEQ_IND field is " 1 ". |
MSG_SETUP_SIZE | This field is the quantity of the power control group that RULM is delayed before sending RULM with increment power. |
INC_PWR | This field represents that |
MSG_SIZE | This field represents that |
MSG_PERIOD | This field represents the time that |
PWR_STEP | PWR_STEP increases the power stage (INC_PWR) of MSG_SIZE power control group above the amount of the power stage of front RULM. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, PWR_STEP=5dB. |
MAX_FULL_PWR | Before this field list was shown in and sends regulation message and stop emission, |
MAX_MSGS | The maximum quantity of the RULM of the power emission that this field represents to increase. The power emission message of each increase will be by the power stage that exceeds PWR_STEP than the power stage that increases previously. |
ACTION_TIME | This field represents that first increases the time started of power emission. Should be take 80ms as unit (mould 64) the initialization system time. |
ACTION_TIME_FRM | This field list is shown in the frame number of beginning RULM behind the system time of stipulating among the ACTION_TIME. |
REPEAT_TIMF | This field represents the time between the location response. This parameter allows base station requests |
NEW_FREQ | This field represents to send at present frequency transmission RULM or in another frequency. If this field is " 0 ", remote unit keeps present tranmitting frequency. If this field is " 1 ", remote unit switches to new frequency emission RULM. |
RULM_FREQ | This field represents tuning for CDMA Channel corresponding to the frequency that sends RULM with remote unit. If NEW_FREQ is " 0 ", this field then is the distance of zero mark degree. |
