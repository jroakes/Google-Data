It is realized in the one or more computer installations for being programmed to carry out operations described below.
Fig. 2 is the flow chart for describing to generate and provide the process 200 of animation extracts.It is true that animation takes passages maker 130
The fixed page resource for each including multiple lasting visual resources, wherein each persistently visual resources be it is each on a user device
Show the visual resources (202) shown during page resource 105.As described above, animation extracts maker 130 can be by multiple
Loading page resource detects lasting visual resources, and detects the matching degree of visual resources or instructed by handling the page
Come carry out.
Animation, which is taken passages, to abandon some lasting visual resources from for being included in the candidate during animation is taken passages.This
Kind resource may include high-frequency content, such as button, item etc..High-frequency content may be to go out in multiple pages on specific website
Existing visual resources.This height is detected using the formatting and marking of image by multiple page resources across website
Frequency content is particularly useful for the website with unique " interface appearance ".
Animation takes passages the list that maker 130 may also include " stopping image ", is very similar to " stop-word ".These
It can be the storehouse of the very common image used on multiple and different websites.When by by the image from page resource with
When image in stopping image library matches to detect, this " stopping image " is excluded to pluck without using it for generation animation
Record, even if they are other lasting visual resources.Appropriate image matching algorithm can be used.
Animation takes passages maker 130 from multiple lasting one or more animations of visual resources generation for page resource
It takes passages (204).Animation producing device 130 can be that specific webpage resource 105 creates multiple animations extracts 136.Create multiple animations
It takes passages 136 and determines to be based in part on the quantity of the visual resources, type of visual resources, the size of visual resources, visual
The theme of resource, theme of page resource etc..It is walked for for each specific animation extracts that specific webpage resource generates
Rapid 206,208 and 210.
Continue the example of hunting page resource 105a, the general theme of page resource can be hunted, and animation takes passages life
Grow up to be a useful person 130 can create the image 132a including jeep, the image 132b of lion, shooter image 132c animation take passages
136, to represent the general theme hunted.But hunting page resource 105a may also include the figure of giraffe, zebra and gazelle
Picture.Animation, which takes passages maker 130, can create lion 132b, giraffe, zebra and the animation of gazelle extracts 136, to represent
The general theme of African animal.With reference to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 discussion on definite asset topics and animation take passages theme into one
Step discusses.
For each animation, animation takes passages the subset (206) that maker selects lasting visual resources.Animation takes passages generation
Device 130 not necessarily selects all lasting visual resources.Selection can describe base based on theme, and with reference to figure 3 and Fig. 4
In the selection of theme.
Selection can also be based on " stopping image ", to exclude low frame as described above.
Selection can also the position based on lasting visual resources.For example, animation takes passages maker 130 each persistently may be used
Position on page resource of when page resource is rendered for showing lasting visual resources is determined depending on resource and persistently may be used
Depending on the position fraction of resource.How the position of position fraction representation visual resources in page resource protrudes if having.The fraction with can
Depending on the degree of approach at resource to the distance at the center for being rendered resource, and/or its edge with being rendered resource or it whether
It is proportional in by all frames in another domain.Various scoring algorithms and formula can be used.For example, with being provided positioned at the page
The image of source bottom corner is compared, and has higher position fraction in the visual resources that resource center is presented.
In some embodiments, position fraction can be binary, for example, in some border of page resource
Image resource can receive " 1 ", otherwise receive " 0 ".Animation extracts maker 130 can detect the certain edges thereof in page resource
Lasting visual resources in boundary, and be within border or outside border by the scoring of lasting visual resources.Holding in selection border
Long visual resources are taken passages with being included in animation in 136.
Position fraction may also mean that the real number for showing visual resources to the distance of the central area of page resource.Persistently may be used
Depending on resource closer to the central area of the page, position fraction is higher.In this embodiment, animation take passages maker 130 can be with
Position score threshold with the position fraction for lasting visual resources.Animation is taken passages maker 130 and is selected based on position fraction
Select lasting visual resources.For example, the lasting visual resources of position fraction of the selection with higher than position score threshold, to include
It is taken passages in animation in 136.
In some embodiments, the length-width ratio based on lasting visual resources selects lasting visual resources, dynamic to be included in
It draws in taking passages.Animation takes passages the length-width ratio that maker determines lasting visual resources for each lasting visual resources, distributes length and width
Than fraction, and the lasting visual resources are selected when length-width ratio meets one or more length-width ratio dimension standards, to be included in
In the subset of lasting visual resources.
For example, length-width ratio dimension standard may include the specific length-width ratio that lasting visual resources must are fulfilled for, and position fraction
There can be binary value.If visual resources meet specific length-width ratio threshold value, then lasting visual resources are allocated length-width ratio
Fraction 1, else if persistently visual resources are less than specific length-width ratio threshold value, then lasting visual resources are allocated length-width ratio
Fraction 0.Animation takes passages all lasting visual resources that maker 130 is 1 for length-width ratio fraction and generates animation extracts.
In some embodiments, length-width ratio fraction can be increased and increased reality with the length-width ratio of virtual resource
Number.For example, length-width ratio is bigger, length-width ratio fraction is higher.Animation, which takes passages the selection of maker 130, to be had higher than specific length and width score
The visual resources of the length-width ratio fraction of number threshold value are taken passages with being included in animation in 136.
Animation, which takes passages maker 130, to select image using the combination of position fraction, length-width ratio fraction or both
Collection is taken passages with being included in animation in 136.Other scorings and selection course, such as scheme of colour, picture format can also be used
Type etc..
Animation takes passages maker 130 as each generation picture frame (208) in selected lasting visual resources.It is right
In selected each image, frame can be the thumbnail of image or image.Frame can also be that image cuts part.

The result of page searching taken passages including animation is supplied to user apparatus.
Fig. 3 is the flow chart for describing to determine the process 300 for the subject categories that animation is taken passages.As previously combined Fig. 2 institutes
It states, animation takes passages the subset that maker 130 selects lasting visual resources, to generate the animation of page resource extracts.In figure 3,
Process 300 determines a main subject matter (or multiple main subject matters) for page resource, and generates including for selected lasting
" informationization " animation of the frame of each of visual resources is taken passages.Then, it is animation extracts is associated with general theme, and carry
For being mapped to the information-based search inquiry of general theme.
For each page resource, animation takes passages maker 130 and determines the described asset topics of the purport of page resource
(302).Referring again to hunting example, animation, which takes passages maker 130, can determine that hunting page resource 105a is included on hunting
General purport.
Determine that animation takes passages maker and be classified as and belong to resource master animation extracts 136 based on the theme of page resource
It inscribes (304).Animation, which takes passages 136, includes image 132a, the image 132b of lion and the image 132c of shooter of jeep, it
Be classified as hunt animation take passages.
Search engine 110 selects one in animation extracts 136 to be identified as by page resource in response to search inquiry
Search result shown (306).Animation is selected to take passages 136 as search result and carries out master of the display including determining inquiry
Topic.For example, some search inquiry terms can be general, and one group of the theme including wide in range description search inquiry leads to
With term (such as " safari (shooter) ").
Search engine 110 determines whether asset topics match with the theme of inquiry, and in response to determining asset topics with looking into
The theme of inquiry matches, and the animation that selection is classified as belonging to asset topics is taken passages.Therefore, generally search for looking into for hunting
Inquiry will cause search engine 110 to return to the search result for including following animation and taking passages 136, and the animation, which takes passages 136, includes jeep
Image 132a, the image 132b of lion and the image 132c of shooter.
Fig. 4 is to describe the subject categories of the visual resources in page resource and taken passages in response to search inquiry selection animation
Flow chart.It recalls, the process that Fig. 3 description generation information animations are taken passages.Fig. 4 is related to the son that specific resources are directed toward in generation
The process that the animation of theme is taken passages.For example, user can input such as " what type of transportation is
Used on a safari (the what kind of vehicles are used during hunting) " or " what animals can I see
Inquiry as on a safari (what animal can see during hunting) " etc. rather than " safari (hunting) " are such
Inquiry.Fig. 4 helps generate animation extracts that may be more information-based for the inquiry of the relatively narrow theme of direction.
For each lasting visual resources, it is described that animation takes passages the purport that maker 130 determines that visual resources are described
Theme (402).For example, it may be determined that the image 132a of the jeep in exemplary hunting page resource includes the master of jeep
Purport.Equally, the image 132b of the lion and image 132c of shooter can be determined that the master comprising lion and shooter respectively
Purport.Can by handling description image tag (being the description of picture material), by computer vision process or other are appropriate
Image Classfication Technology carries out topic detection.
It is two or more collection by lasting visual resources cluster that animation, which takes passages maker 130 based on identified theme,
Group (404).Various clustering techniques, such as k mean clusters, agglomerating cluster (agglomerative can be used
Clustering) etc..In the example of hunting page resource 105a, the first cluster can only include the jeep of shooter
Image, and belong to the subject categories of " hunting/traffic "；Second cluster can only include the image for the animal seen when hunting,
And belong to the theme of " hunting/animal " etc..
For each cluster of lasting visual resources, animation takes passages maker 130 according to the lasting visual money for belonging to cluster
Source generation animation is taken passages, and animation is taken passages (406) associated with the theme of identified cluster.It for example, can be from the first collection
Group creates the first animation and takes passages, the image of the first cluster only jeep including shooter, and is classified as belonging to " hunting/friendship
It is logical " subject categories.It is taken passages it is also possible to generate the second animation from the second cluster, the second cluster is seen when being only included in hunting
The image of the animal arrived, and it is classified as the theme for belonging to " hunting/animal " etc..
Search system 110 selects page resource to be identified by search result, and for each of page resource
Animation is taken passages, and determines relativity measurement, and relativity measurement is the degree of the correlation for the theme that inquiry is taken passages with identified animation
It measures (408).Any appropriate correlation process, such as the analysis of user's selection rate, topic relativity algorithm, term can be used
Matching, vector product etc..The theme that animation takes passages 136 is more related to inquiry, and relevance scores are higher.
For example, search engine 110 can determine the theme of inquiry, and theme will be inquired about and carried out with the theme that animation is taken passages
Compare.For example, " (it is dynamic what can see during hunting by what animals can I see on a safari for search inquiry
Object) " theme can be determined as " safaris (hunting) " and " animals (animal) ".Then by these themes and can be
The theme taken passages and identified is drawn to be compared.Any appropriate inquiry topic identification process can be used.
In some embodiments, relativity measurement can be based in part on one in the animation extracts in response to inquiry
A or multiple images user's selection rates.For example, if in response to search inquiry provides the image during animation is taken passages, then
The selection rate in response to the image of inquiry can be used to drive relativity measurement.In other embodiments, relativity measurement
The previous selection of the animation extracts in response to inquiry can be based in part on (or in response to the theme similar to the theme of inquiry
Other related inquiries).
In some embodiments, relativity measurement is also based on the mass fraction of animation extracts.The matter that animation is taken passages
Amount fraction by animation take passages in the features of visual resources determine.For example, mass fraction can the size based on visual resources, bright
Degree, contrast, color, clarity, hierarchy compression etc..The feature of visual resources is better during animation is taken passages, the quality that animation is taken passages
Fraction is higher.When determining that animation takes passages the correlation with inquiring about, search system 110 in some cases can be by mass fraction
It is combined with relevance scores.
It can also use other correlations and determine algorithm.
Search system 110 is based on relativity measurement and from multiple animations extracts animation is selected to take passages (410).Search system
110 can select animation to take passages based on the relevance scores for meeting relevance scores threshold value；For example, if none of dynamic
It draws and takes passages the relevance scores with minimum threshold is met, then do not show that animation is taken passages.Otherwise, selection is with satisfaction or super
The highest animation of relevance scores for crossing relevance scores threshold value is taken passages.
For example, in response to search inquiry, " what animals can I see on a safari (can be seen during hunting
To what animal) ", search system it was determined that belong to hunting/animal theme animation take passages compared with belong to " hunting " and
The animation of " hunting/traffic " theme, which is taken passages, has highest relevance scores.Search system 110 is in response to search inquiry " what
Animals can I see on a safari (what animal can see during hunting) " provide selected including lion, length
The animation of neck deer, zebra and gazelle image takes passages 136.
