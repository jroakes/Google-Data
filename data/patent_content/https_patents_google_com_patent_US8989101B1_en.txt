- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a system for identifying MAC addresses of a wireless access point in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a computer in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a single physical AP may generate and broadcast multiple MAC addresses, such as one or more virtual MAC addresses of virtual APs created by the single physical AP.
- a spatial index stores MAC addresses, associated locations, and signal strengths collected from mobile user devices. Two MAC addresses within a spatial proximity are selected from the spatial index and analyzed based on a signal strength score and a similarity score. The signal strength score between the selected two MAC addresses is determined and is based on the strength of wireless signals associated with a single measurement (e.g., a single scan that detected the MAC addresses) and the frequency of detection of one MAC addresses without detection of the other MAC address.
- a similarity score between the two MAC addresses is determined. If the signal strength score is below the signal strength score threshold, the selected two MAC addresses are not considered to belong to the same physical AP and the next two MAC address are selected from the spatial index.
- the similarity score is based on the location and relative distance between the selected two MAC addresses, the previously determined signal strength score, and a MAC address similarity metric that determines the heterogeneity between the two MAC addresses. If the similarity score is above a similarity score threshold, the selected two MAC addresses are considered to belong to the same physical AP.
- the selected two MAC addresses are associated with an index for the single physical AP and stored in a data structure of known MAC addresses. If the similarity score is below the similarity score threshold, the selected two MAC addresses are not considered to belong to the same physical AP and the next two MAC address are selected from the spatial index.
- FIG. 1 depicts a process 100 for identifying MAC addresses of a wireless access point in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a spatial index 102 for MAC addresses is obtained (block 104 ).
- the spatial index 102 maps a MAC address to a location (e.g., via location coordinates or other location identifiers) and supports location-based range queries.
- the term location may refer to a specific point or a location range.
- the spatial index 102 is generated from wireless network data collected from user devices. For example, mobile user devices that detect a signal from an AP may send the detected MAC address and a location to a server for inclusion in the spatial index 102 . Over a period of time, a number of MAC addresses, associated locations, and signal strengths may be collected and included in the spatial index 102 .
- other data structures having MAC addresses and associated locations may be used to provide MAC address and location data.
- a signal strength score between a selected two MAC addresses from the spatial index 102 that are within a spatial proximity and observed in the same measurement (e.g., scan) is determined (block 106 ).
- the spatial proximity is determined from the location associated with each selected MAC address in the spatial index 102 .
- the spatial proximity is a distance between two locations. In such embodiments, the distance may be 0.5 m or greater, 1 m or greater, 2 m or greater, 3 m or greater, 4 m or greater, 5 m or greater, or any other suitable distance.
- the signals strengths used for the signal strength score are based on observation points for the signal strengths of each MAC address that have a spatial and temporal coherence of a specific magnitude.
- the selected MAC address and signal strengths are selected based on observation signal strengths are obtained in a single measurement (e.g., scan) of MAC addresses within a spatial proximity. Additionally, in some embodiments the signal strength score is also based in part on the number or frequency of detections in which one of the selected MAC addresses was detected while the other was not.
- the signal strength score is compared to a signal strength score threshold (decision block 108 ). If the signal strength score is below the first threshold (line 110 ), the next pair of MAC addresses from the spatial index is processed (block 112 ), i.e., the selected two MAC addresses are not considered to belong to the same physical AP.
- a similarity score between the selected two MAC addresses is determined (block 116 ).
- the similarity score is based on the following factors: the location and relative distance between the selected two MAC addresses, the previously determined signal strength score, and a MAC address similarity metric that determines the heterogeneity between the two MAC addresses.
- a MAC address is typically a 6-byte address having a first 3 bytes for an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and a second 3 bytes that are specific to the network device.
- UTI Organizationally Unique Identifier
- the MAC address similarity metric is increased if the selected two MAC address have the same OUI, i.e., if the first 3 bytes (the first octet, second octet, and third octet) are the same. Additionally, the MAC address similarity metric is increased if the difference between the second 3 bytes (the fourth octet, fifth octet, and sixth octet) is below a threshold. For example, the difference between each fourth octet, fifth octet, and sixth octet of each the two MAC addresses may be determined and compared to a threshold. In some embodiments, the threshold is 3 bits or less, 4 bits or less, 5 bits or less, or other suitable threshold.
- the similarity score is then compared to a similarity score threshold (block 118 ). If the similarity score is below the similarity score threshold (line 120 ), the next pair of MAC addresses from the spatial index 102 is processed (block 112 ), i.e., the selected two MAC addresses are not considered to belong to the same physical AP. If the similarity score is above the similarity score threshold (line 122 ), the two MAC addresses are identified as belonging to a single physical AP (block 124 ). e.g., one or both of the selected two MAC addresses are virtual MAC addresses of virtual AP's created by a single physical AP.
- FIG. 2 depicts a process 200 for obtaining and using MAC addresses in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a mobile user device may detect a MAC address and determine or have access to the present location of the mobile user device.
- a mobile user device may determine its location using a satellite based positioning system (e.g., the Global Positioning System).
- the mobile user device may send detected MAC addresses, locations, and signal strengths to a remote server via a network.
- the MAC addresses are detected in a single measurement (e.g., scan) of Wi-Fi signals near a mobile user device.
- the MAC addresses and detected information are indicated as being detected in a single measurement.
- the received MAC addresses are stored in a spatial index 206 (block 204 ).
- the spatial index 206 maps a MAC address to a location (e.g., via location coordinates or other location identifiers) and supports location-based range queries. It should be appreciated that locations for a MAC address may be received from multiple mobile user devices, and multiple MAC addresses, locations, signal strengths may be collected over a time period.
- a MAC address similarity analysis is performed on the MAC addresses in the spatial index 206 (block 208 ).
- two MAC addresses within a spatial proximity are analyzed using a signal strength score and a similarity score to determine if the two MAC addresses are related and, thus, belong to a single physical AP.
- each unique pair of two MAC addresses in the spatial index 206 and within a spatial proximity are analyzed.
- related MAC addresses that belong to a single physical AP are associated with an index for the physical AP and stored (block 210 ), such as in data structure 212 of known MAC addresses.
- the index for the physical AP may be the MAC address of the physical AP. It should be appreciated that two, three, four or more MAC address may be associated with a physical AP.
- the data structure 212 of known MAC addresses may be used in further processing. For example, location information for a virtual MAC address may be provided based on the indexed physical AP for the MAC address (block 214 ). Thus, if a mobile user device detects a signal originating from a virtual MAC address, the data structure 212 enables determination of the location of the mobile user device based on the location of the single physical AP associated with the virtual MAC address (via the index in the data structure).
