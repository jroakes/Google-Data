Definitions
- Video compression systems employ block processing for most of the compression operations.
- a block is a group of neighboring pixels and may be treated as one coding unit in terms of the compression operations. Theoretically, a larger coding unit is preferred to take advantage of correlation among immediate neighboring pixels.
- Various video compression standards e.g., Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG)-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4, use block sizes of ⁇ 4, 8 ⁇ 8, and 16 ⁇ 16 (referred to as a macroblock (MB)).
- MPEG Motion Picture Expert Group
- MPEG-4 use block sizes of ⁇ 4, 8 ⁇ 8, and 16 ⁇ 16 (referred to as a macroblock (MB)).
- High efficiency video coding is also a block-based hybrid spatial and temporal predictive coding scheme.
- HEVC partitions an input picture into square blocks referred to as coding tree units (CTUs) as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the CTU can be as large as 64 ⁇ 64 pixels.
- Each CTU can be partitioned into smaller square blocks called coding units (CUs).
- FIG. 2 shows an example of a CTU partition of CUs.
- a CTU 100 is first partitioned into four CUs 102 .
- Each CU 102 may also be further split into four smaller CUs 102 that are a quarter of the size of the CU 102 .
- CUs 102 - 1 , 102 - 3 , and 102 - 4 are a quarter of the size of CTU 100 . Further, a CU 102 - 2 has been split into four CUs 102 - 5 , 102 - 6 , 102 - 7 , and 102 - 8 .
- Each CU 102 may include one or more blocks, which may be referred to as prediction units (PUs).
- FIG. 3 shows an example of a CU partition of PUs.
- the PUs may be used to perform spatial prediction or temporal prediction.
- a CU can be either spatially or temporally predictive coded. If a CU is coded in intra mode, each PU of the CU can have its own spatial prediction direction. If a CU is coded in inter mode, each PU of the CU can have its own motion vector(s) and associated reference picture(s).
- motion vectors are predictively coded in a spatial/temporal prediction process.
- a motion vector predictor MVP is derived from motion vectors of spatially neighboring or temporally collocated PUs of the current PU.
- the difference between the current motion vector and the MVP is then determined and coded. This reduces overhead as only the difference is sent instead of information for the current motion vector.
- a single motion vector may be applied to a group of spatially neighboring or temporally collocated PUs.
- temporal motion vector predictors may not be used. For example, for an I slice, temporal motion vector predictors are not used to encode or decode PUs of the I slice.
- FIG. 1 shows an input picture partitioned into square blocks referred to as coding tree units (CTUs).
- CTUs coding tree units

- a method determines a current picture and an I slice of the current picture.
- a flag is determined for the I slice and a value for the flag is determined for the I slice to enable or disable using temporal motion vector predictors.
- the method then encodes the value for the flag in an encoded bitstream associated with the I slice and sends the encoded bitstream to a decoder. Encoding the value for the flag allows pictures that follow the current picture in a decoding order to use temporal motion vector predictors from a picture that precedes the current picture in the decoding order when the flag for using temporal motion vector predictors is enabled.
- a method includes: receiving, by a computing device, an encoded bitstream; determining, by the computing device, a current picture in the encoded bitstream; determining, by the computing device, an I slice in the current picture; determining, by the computing device, a flag for the I slice; decoding, by the computing device, a value for the flag for the I slice to enable or disable using temporal motion vector predictors; determining, by the computing device, if the value for the flag enables using temporal motion vector predictors for the I slice; and if the value for the flag enables using temporal motion vector predictors for the I slice, allowing, by the computing device, pictures that follow the current picture in a decoding order to use temporal motion vector predictors from a picture that precedes the current picture in the decoding order when temporal motion vector predictors are enabled.
- a decoder includes: A decoder includes: one or more computer processors; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, control the one or more computer processors to be configured for: receiving an encoded bitstream; determining a current picture in the encoded bitstream; determining an I slice in the current picture; determining a flag for the I slice; decoding a value for the flag for the I slice to enable or disable using temporal motion vector predictors; determining if the value for the flag enables using temporal motion vector predictors for the I slice; and if the value for the flag enables using temporal motion vector predictors for the I slice, allowing pictures that follow the current picture in a decoding order to use temporal motion vector predictors from a picture that precedes the current picture in the decoding order when temporal motion vector predictors are enabled.
- an encoder includes: one or more computer processors; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, control the one or more computer processors to be configured for: determining a current picture; determining an I slice of the current picture; determining a flag for the I slice; determining a value for the flag for the I slice to enable or disable using temporal motion vector predictors; encoding the value for the flag in an encoded bitstream associated with the I slice; and allows pictures that follow the current picture in a decoding order to use temporal motion vector predictors from a picture that precedes the current picture in the decoding order when the flag for using temporal motion vector predictors is enabled.
- FIG. 4 depicts an example of a system 400 for encoding and decoding video content according to one embodiment.
- Encoder 402 and decoder 403 may encode and decode a bitstream using HEVC; however, other video compression standards may also be appreciated.
- Encoder 402 includes a temporal motion vector predictor (MVP) block 404 - 1 and decoder 403 includes a temporal MVP block 404 - 2 .
- Temporal motion vector predictor (MVP) block 404 - 1 and temporal MVP block 404 - 2 may perform functions associated with temporal motion vector prediction as will be described below.
- a flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag specifies whether temporal motion vector predictors can be used for inter-prediction.
- the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag may be associated with a slice of a picture.
- the slice may include one or more blocks, such as prediction units (PUs). If the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is disabled, such as equal to 0, then temporal motion vector predictors shall not be used in encoding or decoding of a current slice, or picture. If the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is enabled, such as equal to 1, then temporal motion vector predictors may be used in encoding or decoding of the current slice, or picture.
- temporal MVP blocks 404 - 1 and 404 - 2 may decide whether or not temporal motion vector predictors are used in encoding or decoding blocks of a slice. Also, when the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is not present in an encoded bitstream, then decoder 403 infers that the value of the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is disabled, or equal to 0.
- a collocated reference picture includes motion vector (MV) information that can be used in a temporal prediction process.
- a motion vector for a partition in the collocated reference picture may be used as a temporal motion vector predictor (MVP) in advanced motion vector prediction (AMVP) or as a temporal merge/skip candidate motion vector in a merge process.
- MVP temporal motion vector predictor
- AMVP advanced motion vector prediction
- a difference of the motion vector of the collocated block and the current motion vector of the current block is coded and sent from encoder 402 to decoder 403 .
- the motion vector of the collocated block is used in a merge process, the current block and the collocated block are merged and use the same motion vector of the collocated block.
- the temporal MVP or temporal merge/skip candidate MV is defined as the MV of the selected collocated block, which resides in a reference picture and has the same geometrical position as a current block in the current picture.
- an associated collocated PU can reside in a preceding or subsequent PU in time.
- the collocated PU can be used as a candidate to enable MVP and merge/skip mode for the current PU.
- a collocated block can be provided for a transform unit (TU), CU or a picture itself.
- TU transform unit
- CU a transform unit
- a slice may be one or more blocks.
- Each picture may have one or more slices.
- a block may be referenced, which may be a PU, but may also be a TU, CU, a picture, or a slice.
- Pictures may be classified in different layers. For example, when a picture is classified as a base layer picture, the picture is a reference picture with a temporal identifier (TemporalID) equal to 0.
- a base layer picture may be an I, P or B picture and can be references of other layers (e.g., the enhancement layer).
- TemporalID Temporal identifier
- all coded pictures that follow the current picture in the decoding order shall not use temporal motion vector predictors from any picture that precedes the current picture in the decoding order.
- FIG. 5A shows an example of a decoding order of pictures according to one embodiment.
- the decoding order is the order pictures are decoded and may not necessarily represent the order in which pictures are displayed in the video. It should be noted that the decoding may be performed in the encoding process in encoder 402 or the decoding process in decoder 403 .
- FIG. 5A shows a group of pictures 500 .
- a current picture is shown at 502 .
- Pictures 0, 1, and 2 are pictures that have been decoded already.
- Pictures 4, 5, and 6 are pictures that have not been decoded yet.
- a current picture is being decoded.
- current picture 3 is an I picture, which means that current picture 3 includes I slices.
- TemporalID for current picture 3 is equal to 0 meaning that current picture 3 is a base layer picture.
- the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag for an I slice included in current picture 3 is disabled, or equal to 0.
- pictures 4, 5, and 6 may use temporal motion vector predictors from current picture 3, and any pictures after current picture 3 in the decoding order. As shown, picture 4 may not use any temporal motion vector predictors because picture 3 is a I picture, picture 5 may use temporal motion vector predictors from picture 4, and picture 6 may use temporal motion vector predictors from picture 5.
- FIG. 5B depicts another example of a decoding order in which temporal motion vector predictors may be used from pictures preceding an I picture according to one embodiment.
- the same decoding order as shown in FIG. 5A is shown in FIG. 5B .
- the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag for an I slice included in current picture 3 is enabled, or equal to 1.
- the TemporalID for current picture 3 is equal to 0.
- the condition to test whether temporal MVs can be used for pictures preceding the current picture 3 is not met as the value of the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is equal to 1 and the TemporalID is equal to 0.
- pictures 4, 5, and 6 may use temporal motion vector predictors from pictures that precede current picture 3 in the decoding order.
- picture 4 may use a temporal motion vector predictor from a picture 2.
- the coding performance may be improved.
- pictures before current picture 3 may include blocks that may better predict blocks in picture 4.
- the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag was not coded for an I slice. That is, encoder 402 would not have encoded a value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag for an I slice in the encoded bitstream and decoder 403 would not have decoded a value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag from the encoded bitstream.
- the reasoning for this is that an I slice does not use temporal MVs and thus coding a flag for the I slice would be unnecessary. This also reduces overhead as fewer bits need to be encoded if the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is not coded for an I slice.
- decoder 403 When the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is not included in the encoded bitstream, then decoder 403 infers that the value is equal to 0. Thus, the value of the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag would always be inferred to be 0 for an I slice.
- encoder 402 may encode a value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag for I slices.
- the value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is equal to 1 when coding an I slice.
- the value of the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is equal to 1, temporal MVs are not used for the I slice, such as decoder 403 may choose not to use temporal MVs for the I slice.
- the effect of this is shown in FIG.
- a value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag may be coded for all slices, such as I slices, P slices, and B slices.
- encoder 402 may encode the value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag when encoder 402 determines that the value should be 1. When encoder 402 determines that the value is 0, then encoder 402 may choose not to encode the value and then decoder 403 infers that the value is 0 by default.
- FIG. 6 depicts an example of a syntax 600 according to one embodiment.
- Syntax 600 may be included in a slice header, but the syntax may apply for other headers, such as a sequence parameter set (SPS) header, picture parameter set (PPS) header, or block header.
- SPS sequence parameter set
- PPS picture parameter set
- the slice header may be associated with a slice of blocks for a picture.
- syntax 600 tests a conditional statement, such as an if statement, for a flag sps_temporal_mvp_enable_flag.
- the flag sps_temporal_mvp_enable_flag may be a flag that indicates whether temporal motion vector predictors are used for the whole sequence.
- temporal MVs are not enabled for a sequence of pictures that includes a current picture (or slice)
- the value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag does not need to be included in the encoded bitstream because temporal MVs are not enabled for any pictures for a whole sequence.
- syntax 600 may always include a value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag. That is, for I slices, P slices, and B slices, at 604 , a value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is included in the encoded bitstream if the value of the flag sps_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is 1. In other embodiments, when encoder 402 determines that the value is 0, then encoder 402 may choose not to encode the value and then decoder 403 infers that the value is 0 by default.
- FIG. 7 depicts a simplified flowchart 700 of a method for encoding video according to one embodiment.
- encoder 402 analyzes a slice, such as an I slice of an I picture. For example, encoder 402 analyzes characteristics of the video to determine, at 704 , if the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag should be enabled for the slice. For example, in some cases, encoder 402 might want to enable the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag for an I slice even though temporal MVs cannot be used for the I slice. This would allow pictures after the I slice in the decoding order to use temporal MVs from pictures preceding the I slice in the decoding order. In one example, encoder 402 determines that pictures preceding a current picture may better predict pictures occurring after the current picture in the decoding order. Then, encoder 402 enables the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag.
- temporal MVP block 404 - 1 sets the value as 1.
- encoder 402 encodes the value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag in the encoded bitstream. For example, encoder 402 encodes the value in a slice header associated with the I slice.
- temporal MVP block 404 - 1 sets the value as 0. In other embodiments, temporal MVP block 404 - 1 may not set the value as 0 and the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is not included in the encoded bitstream. As discussed above, the decoding process may then infer that this value is 0.
- encoder 402 encodes the value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag in the encoded bitstream. As discussed above, encoder 402 may always include the value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag in the encoded bitstream for all slice types. In other embodiments, encoder 402 may encode the value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag when the value is “1” for all slice types.
- FIG. 8 depicts a simplified flowchart 800 of a method for decoding video according to one embodiment.
- decoder 403 receives an encoded bitstream from encoder 402 .
- the encoded bitstream includes encoded video along with header information defined by syntax 600 in FIG. 6 .
- temporal MVP block 404 - 2 determines a value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag.
- a slice header includes an encoded value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag for an I slice currently being decoded.
- decoder 403 determines if pictures following the I slice can use temporal MVs from pictures preceding the I slice in the decoding order. For example, pictures following the I slice can use temporal MVs from pictures before the I slice when the value of the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is equal to 1 and the TemporalID is equal to 0. At 808 , if the above conditions are true, decoder 403 allows pictures that follow an I picture including the current I slice (but the current I slice does not need to) to use temporal MVs from pictures that precede the I picture in the decoding order.
- decoder 403 does not allow pictures that follow the I slice to use temporal MVs from pictures that precede the I picture in the decoding order.
- particular embodiments may add overhead to the encoded bitstream by having a value for the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag encoded for I slices (in addition to P slices and B slices). Even though overhead may be added, coding efficiency may be gained by allowing temporal MVs to be used from pictures that precede an I picture.
- the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is a slice level syntax, and therefore should be used to specify slice-level constraints. If the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag is set equal to 0 for one slice of a picture and to 1 for another slice of the same picture, decoder 403 will have problems to decide if temporal motion vector predictors shall be used or not for the picture. In one embodiment, the values of flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag for different slices within a same picture should be identical. Furthermore, the flag slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag will be used to specify whether temporal motion vector predictors shall be used for a current slice, instead of a current picture. The following semantic summarizes the above:
- Particular embodiments set the value of slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag for different slices within a same picture to be identical.
- the corresponding semantics changes for slice_temporal_mvp_enable_flag are as follows.
- temporal motion vector predictors may be used in all slices of the picture.
- encoder 402 described can be incorporated or otherwise associated with a transcoder or an encoding apparatus at a headend and decoder 403 can be incorporated or otherwise associated with a downstream device, such as a mobile device, a set top box or a transcoder.
- FIG. 9A depicts an example of encoder 402 according to one embodiment. A general operation of encoder 402 will now be described; however, it will be understood that variations on the encoding process described will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art based on the disclosure and teachings herein.
- Intra mode coding can use data from the current input image, without referring to other images, to code an I picture.
- a spatial prediction block 904 may include different spatial prediction directions per PU, such as horizontal, vertical, 45-degree diagonal, 135-degree diagonal, DC (flat averaging), and planar, or any other direction.
- the spatial prediction direction for the PU can be coded as a syntax element.
- brightness information (Luma) and color information (Chroma) for the PU can be predicted separately.
- the number of Luma intra prediction modes for all block sizes is 35.
- An additional mode can be used for the Chroma intra prediction mode.
- the Chroma prediction mode can be called “IntraFromLuma.”
- Temporal prediction block 906 performs temporal prediction.
- Inter mode coding can use data from the current input image and one or more reference images to code “P” pictures and/or “B” pictures. In some situations and/or embodiments, inter mode coding can result in higher compression than intra mode coding.
- inter mode PUs 204 can be temporally predictive coded, such that each PU 204 of the CU 202 can have one or more motion vectors and one or more associated reference images.
- Temporal prediction can be performed through a motion estimation operation that searches for a best match prediction for the PU over the associated reference images. The best match prediction can be described by the motion vectors and associated reference images.
- P pictures use data from the current input image and one or more reference images, and can have up to one motion vector.
- B pictures may use data from the current input image and one or more reference images, and can have up to two motion vectors.
- the motion vectors and reference pictures can be coded in the encoded bitstream.
- the motion vectors can be syntax elements “MV,” and the reference pictures can be syntax elements “refIdx.”
- inter mode can allow both spatial and temporal predictive coding. The best match prediction is described by the motion vector (MV) and associated reference picture index (refIdx). The motion vector and associated reference picture index are included in the coded bitstream.
- Transform block 907 performs a transform operation with the residual PU, e.
- a set of block transforms of different sizes can be performed on a CU, such that some PUs can be divided into smaller TUs and other PUs can have TUs the same size as the PU. Division of CUs and PUs into TUs 20 can be shown by a quadtree representation.
- Transform block 907 outputs the residual PU in a transform domain, E.
- a quantizer 908 then quantizes the transform coefficients of the residual PU, E.
- Quantizer 908 converts the transform coefficients into a finite number of possible values. In some embodiments, this is a lossy operation in which data lost by quantization may not be recoverable.

- CABAC context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding
- a de-quantizer 912 de-quantizes the quantized transform coefficients of the residual PU.

- Particular embodiments may be used in determining the prediction, such as collocated reference picture manager 404 is used in the prediction process to determine the collocated reference picture to use.
- a loop filter 916 performs de-blocking on the reconstructed PU, x′′, to reduce blocking artifacts. Additionally, loop filter 916 may perform a sample adaptive offset process after the completion of the de-blocking filter process for the decoded picture, which compensates for a pixel value offset between reconstructed pixels and original pixels. Also, loop filter 916 may perform adaptive loop filtering over the reconstructed PU, which minimizes coding distortion between the input and output pictures. Additionally, if the reconstructed pictures are reference pictures, the reference pictures are stored in a reference buffer 918 for future temporal prediction. Intra mode coded images can be a possible point where decoding can begin without needing additional reconstructed images.
