With reference now to Fig. 4, propose the exemplary, non-limitative flow chart of the data flow according to embodiment, it comprises the pipeline of the service 402-416 be associated with the Service Part 110 of Real-time Video Processing System 100.Each in service 402-416 is configured to perform particular procedure task.As illustrated in fig. 4, serve 402 and be first service in processing pipeline and service 416 is the last services in processing pipeline.In addition, service 404 is in service 402 downstream, and service 406 is in service 404 downstream etc.Each in service 402-414 is configured to process video and processed section stream is delivered to next downstream service for process.
On the one hand, real-time reader service 402 uses input real-time streams VID to read inlet flow from picked-up parts 104.On the other hand, real-time reader service 402 can also receive the request to process live video stream.Audio/video (A/V) demodulation multiplexer service 404 is configured to inlet flow is separated into discrete Voice & Video and purifies this inlet flow.Audio transcoder service 406 is configured to convert audio stream code to aid audio format.Video transcoder service 408 is configured to convert video flowing code to target video form.Multiplexer service 412 is configured to audio and video stream is multiplexing or combines.HLS sectionalizer service 414 obtains the video flowing of output from multiplexer and creates the HLS section form of one or more encryptions of this video flowing.HLS section is outputted to dispensing member 112 by real-time release device service 416.On the one hand, dispensing member metadata sends together with HLS section by real-time release device.This metadata can provide the information about HLS section, the real time stamp scope of such as section and/or the key in order to section to be deciphered.
On the one hand, video transcoder 408 can adopt one or more slave video code converter 410 to promote to carry out code conversion to live video stream.Subordinate code converter can provide the parallel codes conversion plan processed in real time or closely in real time promoting video flowing.According to this aspect, video flowing (or the first paragraph of live video stream or first piece) can be divided into multiple pieces and adopt one group of subordinate code converter to process each piece concurrently by video transcoder 408.Then block through code conversion can combine by video transcoder 408 by the block transformed through code combination or multiplexer 414 before multiplexing.As a result, the code conversion speed of video flowing can be increased.What can provide in subordinate code converter on same handling machine is one or more, or can provide each subordinate code converter on discrete process machine.
With reference to figure 5, propose according to the definition of embodiment illustrative instructions Figure 50 0 for the treatment of the workflow of live video stream.Instruction figure defines three different pipelines 542,546 and 548.Should be appreciated that instruction figure can define any number N pipeline, and only present three pipelines for exemplary purpose to instruction figure 500.Each in pipeline 542,546 and 548 can also comprise real-time reader 504 as first service.On the one hand, real-time reader generates the copy of the live video stream received to manage at each pipeline everywhere.On the other hand, multiple copies of live video stream are that real-time reader 504 can be accessed explicitly with Video stream information 502.According to this aspect, the copy of live video stream to be processed can be sent from real-time reader to each stream pipeline 542,546 and 548.
Each in pipeline 542,546 and 548 comprises the service being configured to the live video stream processing specific format.Such as, pipeline 542 comprises service 506-516, and pipeline 546 comprises service 518 to 528, and pipeline 548 comprises service 530-540.Each service configuration of each pipeline can be become the video flowing of process different-format.Such as, the service of pipeline 542 can process the live video stream of 720P, and the service of pipeline 546 can process the live video stream of 1080P, and the service of pipeline 548 can process the live video stream of high definition.Should be appreciated that and multiple Additional formatting output can be associated with service and pipeline according to additional embodiment.
The instruction figure of such as instruction figure 500 and so on can be describe the tangible computer instructions for the treatment of the workflow of video.On the one hand, instruction figure 500 can comprise service describing.Each service describing identifiable design is used for the service of workflow that described by instruction figure and parameter thereof or format value.On the one hand, service describing can also define relation between service and dependence.On the other hand, by the process of service execution parameter value and or dependence can be this service intrinsic.As a result, the description of this service can comprise a small number of parameters.In a particular embodiment, one or more parts of instruction figure 500 (and the workflow described) can be nonlinear.Non linear workflow can comprise and eachly has multiple dependent one or more service.Similarly, non linear workflow can be separated into two or more services (such as subordinate code converter) that can substantially run parallel to each other at one or more somes places.
With reference now to Fig. 6, propose another exemplary, non-limitative embodiment of the Real-time Video Processing System 600 according to embodiment.System 600 can comprise buffer component 602 and metadata section 604.On the one hand, buffer component and metadata section are memory units.According to this aspect, (although similarly not describing) buffer component 602 and/or metadata section 604 can be parts for memory 116 and/or processing platform 122 another memory unit addressable.Buffer component 602 is configured to the output of the service in processing pipeline is stored in provisionally the time predefined window reaching in buffer between one or more service and be associated with the process of this section.Particularly, buffer component 602 stores the example of real-time video section provisionally, because its state be present between two or more services reaches time predefined window.Therefore the buffer mentioned in this article is regarded as Windowing buffer.The Windowing buffer of system 600 promotes in response to the handling failure be associated with the service in the pipeline being suitable for real time video processing retry or again treatment mechanism.In addition, Windowing buffer provides the different disposal speed of the difference service seamlessly added owing to distributing to instruction figure and the processor be associated and means that nonsynchronous service exports in addition.Such as, the mode that different service can be fluctuated slightly consumes and produces data.Windowing buffer may be used for cushioning this change.
Be different from non-real-time video treatment system, the buffer that system 600 adopts is based on main storage.In non-real-time video treatment system, the output buffer between service by with file backup, make downstream service can when soft fault retry.This is unsuitable under arranging in real time.First, in real-time event, the beginning that (if such as event experienced more than a hour) turns back to event when why hindering in office is insignificant, because the beginning of event is processed and stream delivers to client for real-time viewing.Secondly, because real-time event is relatively long, so large memory requirement has negative effect to system restriction potentially.Finally, the buffer based on memory is more measurable than file for performance, because the performance sharing auxiliary storage usually has much higher variability (lower isolation).The performance ensured promotes when processing real-time video to keep substantially real-time progress.
Real-time Video Processing System 600 adopts Windowing Buffer Model between services.Windowing model guarantees that limited amount main storage serviced buffer uses.Term window refers to sliding window concept.Particularly, utilize Windowing buffer between theme service, along with new data are written into buffer, older data can be dropped the RAM capacity guaranteeing to be no more than buffer.System 600 adopts Windowing buffer it to be stored provisionally reach time predefined window along with the section processing live video stream between services.Time predefined window can be any time amount being suitable for real time video processing.On the one hand, this time predefined window is less than 5 minutes.On the other hand, this time predefined window is less than 3 minutes.On the other hand, this predefine window be less than one minute, 45 seconds or 30 seconds.
Owing to there being the hypothesis of restriction window, Windowing buffer realizes the new logic form being used for service retry when handling failure, and it allows service moderately to add in ongoing stream after retry event halfway.Such as, when handling failure occurs in downstream service, Real-time Video Processing System is by carrying out this service of retry from the current point service of restarting of video flowing.Handling failure can comprise any mistake in process.Such as, handling failure can be made and with the hardware fault adopting the processor of serving to be associated at this place or such as to exit or the Action Events of nuclear escalation and so on is associated.
