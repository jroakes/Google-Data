- a messaging network 140 (such as, e.g., an SMS capable network, an EMS capable network, an MMS capable network, etc.) can connect mobile users 145 who wish to provide online advertisements through using their mobile phone to the advertisement management system 104 using a messaging interface for advertisement submission 150 .
- a messaging network 140 can connect mobile users 145 who wish to provide online advertisements through using their mobile phone to the advertisement management system 104 using a messaging interface for advertisement submission 150 .
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of mobile users using the messaging interface for advertisement submission 150 .
- the advertisements can be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, etc., or any other type of electronic advertisement.
- the advertisements may also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions, such as HTML or JavaScriptTM.
- Advertisements can also be provided from the publishers 106 .
- one or more publishers 106 a and/or 106 b can submit advertisement requests for one or more advertisements to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending the advertisements to the requesting publisher 106 a or 106 b for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content).
- the advertisements can include embedding links landing pages, e.g., pages on the advertisers 102 websites, that a user is directed to when the user clicks an ad presented on a publisher website.
- the advertisement requests can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- a publisher 106 can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 .
- This combined page content 109 and advertisements can be sent to the user device 108 that requested the content (e.g., user device 108 a ) as page content 111 for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the publisher 106 can transmit information about the advertisements back to the advertisement management system 104 , including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- Publishers 106 a and 106 b can include general content servers that receive requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- content servers related news content providers, retailers, independent blogs, social network sites, or any other entity that provides content over the network 110 can be a publisher.
- Advertisements can also be provided through the use of the search engine 112 .
- the search engine 112 can receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine 112 can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- An exemplary search engine 112 is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999.
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine 112 can also submit a request for advertisements to the system 104 .
- the request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the advertisements, etc.
- the request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- the search engine 112 can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the user device 108 that requested the content as the page content 111 .
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the advertisers 102 , user devices 108 , and/or the search engine 112 can also provide usage information to the advertisement management system 104 .
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or a selection related to an advertisement has occurred.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- Such usage information can also be processed to measure performance metrics, such as a click-through rate (“CTR”), conversion rate, and other measurable performance metrics.
- CTR click-through rate
- a click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or “clicks” on a link to a content item returned by the publisher or the advertising management system.
- the CTR is a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the content item, e.g., a link to a landing page, an advertisement, or a search result, by the number of times the content item was delivered. For example, if a link to a content item is delivered 100 times, and three persons click on the content item, then the CTR for that content item is 3%.
- Other usage information and/or performance metrics e.g., cost per mile (CPM) can also be used.
- a “conversion” occurs when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, registering on a Website, etc. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- Advertisements can be submitted to the advertising management system 104 in a variety of ways.
- the advertising management system 104 can facilitate submission of advertisements through a messaging interface 150 .
- the messaging interface 150 can receive messages (e.g., SMS messages, EMS messages, MMS messages, etc.) from advertisers 145 that would like to advertise through the advertising management system 104 . Such messages can be transmitted through a messaging network 140 to the advertising management system 104 .
- the messaging interface 150 can provide instructions for submitting advertisements to the advertising managements system 104 using the messaging interface.
- Such instructions can be provided using an online interface such as, for example, a web-based interface.
- the instructions can be provided within one or more messages sent to the advertiser 145 .
- the messaging interface 150 can include an automated interactive messaging response system whereby users can send a message to the messaging interface 150 and receive a response from the messaging interface 150 based upon the content of the message. For example, an initial message to the messaging interface 150 might elicit a response message providing a menu for accessing various categories of instructions, the menu instructing the user to send a reply message with the text “1” to access instructions on the general message format to use when submitting a message, a reply message with the text “2” to receive instructions on billing, a reply message with the text “3” to receive instruction on retrieving performance statistics, etc.
- Other menu structures and/or hierarchies can be used.
- the messaging interface 150 can include a parsing component operable to parse messages received from advertisers 145 based upon the format specified by the instructions.
- the instructions might indicate separating fields for different advertisement components by a slash character (“1”) or some other delimiter.
- the fields can include, for example, an advertisement creative field (e.g., including a header/title field and a body field) as input for generating a creative, a bidding information field identifying bidding information for participation of the advertisement in auctions, and billing information from which an advertiser's account can be debited when some action is detected with respect to the advertisement (e.g., when the advertisement is served to a user, when the advertisement is selected by a user, when a conversion occurs as a result of the advertisement, etc.).
- an advertiser might want to submit an advertisement for a bicycle.
- the advertiser in this example can send a text message to the messaging interface 150 including the content: Bicycle for sale!/Folding Citizen Bike, sparingly used—Free dropoff in the Bay area/bicycle, bike, folding bike, citizen bike.
- the first field can be a title field, and in this example would be “Bicycle for sale!”
- the second field can be a creative field, and in this example would be “Folding Citizen Bike, sparingly used—Free dropoff in the Bay area.”
- the third field can include the keywords to be used for the advertisement, and in this example would be “bicycle,” “bike,” “folding bike” and “Citizen bike.”
- the text message can also include billing information for the advertiser using any of the delimiters identified above.
- the parser can determine whether any portion of the advertisement, bidding or billing information is missing and can send a text message to the advertiser requesting any of the missing information.
- the messaging interface 150 can elicit successive messages that include different elements of information describing the advertisement to be created. Following each message sent by the advertiser, the messaging interface can provide Instructions identifying what the contents of the next message sent by the advertiser 145 to the messaging interface 150 should include. For example, the messaging interface 150 can receive a first message that contains the advertisement. In this example, the messaging interface 150 can respond to the receipt of the advertisement with a request for bidding information. The advertiser 145 can then reply to the request for bidding information with the bids he/she wants to enter for the advertisement placement. After receiving the bidding information, the messaging interface 150 can send a message to the advertiser 145 requesting billing information.
- the messaging interface 150 can generate an advertisement from the initial message, and once the billing information is received, the advertisement along with associated bidding information can be released to the advertisement data store 114 for distribution using the advertising management system 104 .
- a lead capture instruction can be included with the advertisement in the advertising management system 104 .
- the lead capture instruction can provide an action to be taken as a result of the user selecting the advertisement.
- the lead capture instruction can instruct a browser to retrieve a landing page upon selection of the advertisement. Because the advertiser has submitted the advertisement through a messaging interface 150 , the messaging interface 150 can automatically generate a landing page for the advertisement. In those implementations where a landing page for the advertisement is provided, when the user selects the advertisement, he/she will be directed to the landing page.
- the landing page can provide additional information (e.g., address, coupons, etc.) for the advertiser. Such additional information can be collected, for example, based upon listings, messages received from the advertiser, etc.).
- selection of the advertisement can cause a call to be placed in those instances where the user selects the device using a mobile communications device (e.g., cellular phone) or a computer with internet telephony.
- selection of the advertisement can cause a text message to be sent to the advertiser with contact information supplied by the user.
- the advertisement can direct the user to call a number associated with the advertisement management system 104 . When a call is received, the advertisement management system 104 can record a selection of the advertisement and forward the call to the advertiser.
- a billing component included in the messaging interface 150 can track the advertisement to determine whether an advertisement account associated with the advertisement should be debited (e.g., based upon the billing paradigm (e.g., cost per click (CPC), cost per impression (CPI), etc.) associated with the advertisement).
- the billing component can charge a third party account (e.g., bank account, credit card, mobile phone, etc.) to open an advertisement account for the advertiser 145 with the advertising management system 104 . Thereby, charges from advertisement placements can be debited from the advertisement account. In other examples, the charge can be made to the third party account each time an action is taken with regard to the advertisement.
- the advertiser 145 can specify a maximum amount to be spent on the campaign.
- the maximum amount to be spent on the campaign can be managed by the amount of money placed into the advertisement account.
- the advertisement is not served again until the advertiser 145 places more money into the advertisement account.
- the user can specify a maximum amount to be debited from the third party account.
- the advertiser 145 can provide additional approval to raise the budget for the campaign.
- the messaging interface can provide performance metrics to the advertiser 145 using a messaging format (e.g., SMS, EMS, MMS, etc.).
- the performance metrics can include a number of times the advertisement has been served, a number of selections of the advertisement, a cost per impression, an average price paid for advertisement placements, most popular search terms for users that viewed and/or selected the advertisement, etc.
- the performance metrics can be used by the advertiser 145 to judge the effectiveness of the campaign.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example messaging interface for advertisement submission 150 .
- the messaging interface for advertisement submission 150 can facilitate the submission of advertisements for use in online targeted advertising using messaging formats (e.g., SMS, EMS, MMS, etc.).
- the messaging interface 150 can include an instruction component 210 , an advertisement generation component 220 , a payment component 230 , and a campaign reporting component 240 .
- the instruction component 210 can be operable to provide instructions for formatting of submissions to the messaging interface 150 .
- the instructions can provide a text messaging template to which the advertiser can reply and fill the relevant information into the correct fields of the template.
- the instructions can provide an interactive message interface whereby the user can request instructions for specific parts of the submission.
- the instruction component 210 can provide successive instructions to the advertiser 145 based upon successful submission of successive components of an advertisement. For example, the advertiser 145 can submit a title. The instruction component 210 can then provide instructions for submission of body text for the creative. Upon receiving body text for the creative, the instruction component can provide instructions for submission of target information, bidding information, billing information, etc.
- the advertisement generation component 220 can be operable to generate an advertisement based upon one or more submissions received from the advertiser 145 . Based upon the information received in one or more messages from the advertiser 145 the advertisement generation component 220 can generate an advertisement, including, e.g., one or more of an advertisement creative, a linked page, target audience, bidding information, and/or billing information. In those implementations where the advertiser submits an advertisement in a single message, the advertisement generation component 220 can parse the message to separate the component parts of the advertisement (e.g., header/title, body text, link, target information, bidding information, billing information, etc.). In such implementations, the advertisement generation component 220 can inspect the message to ensure that an advertisement can be accurately created from the message.
- the advertisement generation component 220 can inspect the message to ensure that an advertisement can be accurately created from the message.
- the advertisement generation component 220 can direct the instructions component 210 to request the advertiser resubmit the advertisement. Alternatively, the advertisement generation component 220 can direct the instructions component to send a request to the advertiser to submit only that portion of the advertisement which was not derived from one or more earlier messages.
- the advertisement generation component 220 can identify the components of the advertisement based upon the different messages received from the advertiser 145 . In such implementations, the advertisement generation component 220 can inspect each of the messages to ensure that a current message is in proper format. For example, the advertisement generation component can direct the instructions component 210 to provide instructions for submitting a next advertisement component of the advertisement if the current message is in the proper format or to provide instructions for resubmitting a current advertisement component if the current message is in an improper or unrecognized format.
- the payment component 230 can be operable to debit a user account responsive to a performance metric associated with the advertisement. For example, in those implementations where the performance metric is based upon a cost per click metric, the payment component 230 can debit an advertiser account when the advertisement is selected by a user. In further examples, a bidding system can be used to select advertisements for display to a user. In such examples, the payment component 230 can debit the advertiser's account based upon auction results associated with the presentation of the advertisement. In various implementations, the advertiser account can be a third party account, or the advertiser account can be account with the advertising management system.
- the payment component can store an advertising budget for the advertisement as provided by the advertiser.
- the payment component for example, can remove the advertisement from eligibility for targeted distribution to users based upon the budget.
- the budget for example, can be specified by the advertiser based upon the size of the advertiser's account, or can be based upon an amount provided by the advertiser 145 during submission of the advertisement.
- the campaign reporting component 240 can provide statistical metrics to the advertiser 145 regarding his/her advertising campaign.
- the statistical metrics can include, for example, the number of times an advertisement has been served, a number of times the advertisement has been selected, conversions resulting from the advertisement display, length of campaign, average cost per impression, average cost per click, etc.
- the performance metrics can be provided to the advertiser 145 using a messaging protocol.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for adjusting participation probability for a content item in a content item selection process.
- one or more messages are received.
- the one or more messages can be received, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2 ).
- an advertisement generation component e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2
- the entire advertisement is received in a single message, while in other implementations, the advertisement is received over multiple messages.
- the one or more message can include both advertisement information (e.g., a creative) and target audience information (e.g., targeted search terms, demographic information, etc.)
- an advertisement is generated based upon the one or more messages.
- the advertisement can be generated, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2 ).
- An advertisement in a single message can include delimiters operable to separate the various fields that can be requested by the messaging interface (e.g., including title/header, advertisement body, link, target audience, bidding information, billing information, etc.) Advertisements received in multiple messages can be parsed according to the order in which the messages were received.
- instructions can be provided to the advertiser to alert the advertiser as to how to format the advertisement submission.
- the advertisement can be a targeted text advertisement, a targeted graphical advertisement, a targeted video advertisement, a targeted audio advertisement, etc.
- the advertisement is provided for targeted distribution.
- the advertisement can be provided for targeted distribution, for example, by an advertising management system (e.g., advertising management system 104 of FIG. 1 ).
- the advertisement can be served with search results when search terms related to the advertisement are submitted to a search engine.
- the advertisement can be served based upon a request from a web publisher for advertisements to be included within his/her web page.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of another example process 400 for adjusting participation probability for a content item in a content item selection process.
- instructions for advertisement submission are sent to an advertiser.
- the instructions can be sent, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an instruction component (e.g., instruction component 210 of FIG. 2 ).
- the instruction component can instruct the advertiser to submit the various components of an advertisement in several different messages.
- the instruction component can instruct the advertiser to submit the various components of the advertisement in a single message, with each component marked by some delimiter.
- the decision of whether more instructions are to be provided can be made, for example, by an instructions component (e.g., instructions component 210 of FIG. 2 ).
- the instructions component provides instructions in a manner similar to an interactive message response system, whereby the advertiser sends a message to the instruction component including an identification of which instruction menu page is desired, and the instruction component responds with the requested instruction menu page.
- the instruction component provides all of the instruction pages at once, and the advertiser can navigate the pages based upon a structured order in which the instruction messages were sent.
- one or more messages can be received from the advertiser at stage 415 .
- the one or more messages can be received, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2 ).
- the entire advertisement is received in a single message, while in other implementations, the advertisement is received over multiple messages.
- the one or more message can include both advertisement information (e.g., a creative) and target audience information (e.g., targeted search terms, demographic information, etc.)
- the message is parsed.
- the message can be parsed, for example, by an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2 ).
- An advertisement in a single message can include delimiters operable to separate the various fields that can be requested by the messaging interface (e.g., including title/header, advertisement body, link, target audience, bidding information, billing information, etc.). Such a message is thereby parsed based upon the delimiters within the message. Advertisements received in multiple messages can be parsed according to the order in which the messages were received. In some implementations, instructions can be provided to the advertiser to alert the advertiser as to how to format the advertisement submission.
- the request to submit advertisement information can be sent, for example, by the instructions component (e.g., instructions component 210 of FIG. 2 ).
- the process 400 can determine whether the one or more messages include auction, billing and/or target audience information. The determination of whether the one or more messages include auction, billing, and/or target audience information can be made, for example, by the advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2 ). If the one or more messages do not include advertisement information, the process 400 can send a request to submit advertisement information at stage 440 . The request to submit advertisement information can be sent, for example, by the instructions component (e.g., instructions component 210 of FIG. 2 ).
- the process 400 can generate an advertisement at stage 445 .
- the advertisement can be generated, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g., messaging interface 150 of FIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g., advertisement generation component 220 of FIG. 2 ).
- the advertisement generated can be a targeted text advertisement, a targeted graphical advertisement, a targeted video advertisement, a targeted audio advertisement, etc.
- the advertisement is provided for targeted distribution.
- the advertisement can be provided for targeted distribution, for example, by an advertising management system (e.g., advertising management system 104 of FIG. 1 ).
- the advertisement can be served with search results when search terms related to the advertisement are submitted to a search engine.
- the advertisement can be served based upon a request from a web publisher for advertisements to be included within his/her web page.
- spam detection processes are used to identify spam messages that may be sent by use of the messaging interface. Messages classified as spam messages are ignored and not processed further. Such techniques can include comparing sending addresses (e.g., numbers) of the received message to a list of known spam addresses. If the sending address of the received message is on the spam address list, then the message is classified as spam. Another technique includes comparing the received messages to other received messages that are received within a time window. If a number of messages are highly similar, then the messages are classified as spam. Other spam detection processes can also be used.

The generated advertisement can be provided for targeted distribution to users.
Description
- This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/157,054, titled “Messaging Interface for Advertisement Submission,” filed Mar. 3, 2009, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
- This document relates to content submission.
- The rise of the Internet has enabled access to a wide variety of content items, e.g., video and/or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, news articles, etc. Such access to these content items has likewise enabled opportunities for targeted advertising. For example, content items of particular interest to a user can be identified by a search engine in response to a user query. The query can include one or more search terms, and the search engine can identify and, optionally, rank the content items based on the search terms in the query and present the content items to the user (e.g., according to the rank). This query can also be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide targeted advertisements to the user. Another form of online advertising is advertisement syndication, which allows advertisers to extend their marketing reach by distributing advertisements to additional partners. For example, third party online publishers can place an advertiser's text or image advertisements on web pages that have content related to the advertisement. As the users are likely interested in the particular content on the publisher webpage, they are also likely to be interested in the product or service featured in the advertisement. Accordingly, such targeted advertisement placement can help drive online customers to the advertiser's website.
- However, some advertisers still lack the ability to submit advertisements to publishers based upon a lack of Internet access, a lack of comfort with the advertisement submission process, etc. Such advertisers would benefit from additional mechanisms for submitting advertisements that go beyond traditional advertisement submission mechanisms.
- In general, the subject matter of this application relates to providing a messaging interface operable to receive advertisements submissions. In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method for receiving advertisement submissions. The method can include the actions of: receiving one or more messages in a messaging format from a device associated with an advertiser, the one or more messages including advertising information and target audience information; generating an advertisement based upon the message; and providing the advertisement for targeted distribution based upon the target audience information. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding methods, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Various optional advantages and features can include increasing the ability of business owners to participate in online advertising. Another optional advantage can include providing targeted advertising based upon an expected audience associated with many online publishers and/or search queries. Other optional advantages can include an instruction menu provided in a messaging format and a prepay billing plan. These various optional advantages and features can be separately realized and need not present in any particular embodiment.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- In general, the subject matter of this specification relates to providing a messaging based interface for advertisement submission. A message can be received from an advertiser and parsed to identify advertisement information included in the message. The advertisement information can be used to generate an online advertisement. The online advertisement can be distributed to users, for example, through a network of publishers and/or included with search results provided by a search engine.
- For example, a business owner who does not have an internet presence might be unable to submit an advertisement through online submission process due to being unsophisticated or unfamiliar with internet technology or lack of availability of an internet connection. Such business owners could benefit from online advertising, but are unable to participate. However, in many countries text messaging (e.g., short message service (SMS), enhanced messaging service (EMS), and multimedia messaging service (MMS), among others) is widely used and is very popular. An interface can be constructed whereby such business owners can submit advertisements for inclusion in online advertising mechanisms.
- Although various examples are described with reference to advertisements, the systems and methods described in this specification can also facilitate the identification and serving of other types of content items having measurable performance or quality parameters, such as videos, articles, reviews, etc.
- The subject matter of this specification can be implemented in an online environment, such as the example
online environment 100 shown inFIG. 1 . Theonline environment 100 can facilitate the identification and serving of content items, e.g., web pages, advertisements, etc., to users. Acomputer network 110, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connectsonline advertisers advertisement management system 104,publishers user devices search engine 112. Although only two online advertisers (102 a and 102 b), two publishers (102 a and 102 b) and two user devices (108 a and 108 b) are shown, theonline environment 100 may include many thousands of advertisers, publishers and user devices. - In some implementations, a messaging network 140 (such as, e.g., an SMS capable network, an EMS capable network, an MMS capable network, etc.) can connect
mobile users 145 who wish to provide online advertisements through using their mobile phone to theadvertisement management system 104 using a messaging interface foradvertisement submission 150. Although only onemobile user 145 is shown, theonline environment 100 may include many thousands of mobile users using the messaging interface foradvertisement submission 150. - In the
online environment 100, one ormore advertisers advertising management system 104. In some implementations, the advertisements can be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, etc., or any other type of electronic advertisement. The advertisements may also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions, such as HTML or JavaScript™. - A user device, such as
user device 108 a, can submit apage content request 109 to a publisher or thesearch engine 112. In some implementations, thepage content 111 can be provided to theuser device 108 a in response to therequest 109. The page content can include advertisements provided by theadvertisement management system 104, or can include executable instructions, e.g., JavaScript™, that can be executed at theuser device 108 a to request advertisements from theadvertisement management system 104. Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, television set-top boxes, etc. - Advertisements can also be provided from the publishers 106. For example, one or
more publishers 106 a and/or 106 b can submit advertisement requests for one or more advertisements to thesystem 104. Thesystem 104 responds by sending the advertisements to the requestingpublisher - In some implementations, a publisher 106 can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the
system 104. This combinedpage content 109 and advertisements can be sent to the user device 108 that requested the content (e.g.,user device 108 a) aspage content 111 for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system). The publisher 106 can transmit information about the advertisements back to theadvertisement management system 104, including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScript™). -
Publishers network 110 can be a publisher. - Advertisements can also be provided through the use of the
search engine 112. Thesearch engine 112 can receive queries for search results. In response, thesearch engine 112 can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages). Anexemplary search engine 112 is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999. Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results. - The
search engine 112 can also submit a request for advertisements to thesystem 104. The request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the advertisements, etc. The request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results. - The
search engine 112 can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by thesystem 104. This combined information can then be forwarded to the user device 108 that requested the content as thepage content 111. The search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results. - The advertisers 102, user devices 108, and/or the
search engine 112 can also provide usage information to theadvertisement management system 104. This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or a selection related to an advertisement has occurred. Thesystem 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information. Such usage information can also be processed to measure performance metrics, such as a click-through rate (“CTR”), conversion rate, and other measurable performance metrics. - A click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or “clicks” on a link to a content item returned by the publisher or the advertising management system. The CTR is a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the content item, e.g., a link to a landing page, an advertisement, or a search result, by the number of times the content item was delivered. For example, if a link to a content item is delivered 100 times, and three persons click on the content item, then the CTR for that content item is 3%. Other usage information and/or performance metrics (e.g., cost per mile (CPM)) can also be used.
- A “conversion” occurs when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. A conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, registering on a Website, etc. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- Advertisements can be submitted to the
advertising management system 104 in a variety of ways. In some implementations, theadvertising management system 104 can facilitate submission of advertisements through amessaging interface 150. Themessaging interface 150 can receive messages (e.g., SMS messages, EMS messages, MMS messages, etc.) fromadvertisers 145 that would like to advertise through theadvertising management system 104. Such messages can be transmitted through amessaging network 140 to theadvertising management system 104. - In some implementations, the
messaging interface 150 can provide instructions for submitting advertisements to theadvertising managements system 104 using the messaging interface. Such instructions, for example, can be provided using an online interface such as, for example, a web-based interface. In other examples, the instructions can be provided within one or more messages sent to theadvertiser 145. - In those examples using messaging to distribute instructions to
advertisers 145, themessaging interface 150 can include an automated interactive messaging response system whereby users can send a message to themessaging interface 150 and receive a response from themessaging interface 150 based upon the content of the message. For example, an initial message to themessaging interface 150 might elicit a response message providing a menu for accessing various categories of instructions, the menu instructing the user to send a reply message with the text “1” to access instructions on the general message format to use when submitting a message, a reply message with the text “2” to receive instructions on billing, a reply message with the text “3” to receive instruction on retrieving performance statistics, etc. Other menu structures and/or hierarchies can be used. - In some implementations, the
messaging interface 150 can include a parsing component operable to parse messages received fromadvertisers 145 based upon the format specified by the instructions. For example, the instructions might indicate separating fields for different advertisement components by a slash character (“1”) or some other delimiter. In such implementations, the fields can include, for example, an advertisement creative field (e.g., including a header/title field and a body field) as input for generating a creative, a bidding information field identifying bidding information for participation of the advertisement in auctions, and billing information from which an advertiser's account can be debited when some action is detected with respect to the advertisement (e.g., when the advertisement is served to a user, when the advertisement is selected by a user, when a conversion occurs as a result of the advertisement, etc.). In one example, an advertiser might want to submit an advertisement for a bicycle. The advertiser in this example can send a text message to themessaging interface 150 including the content: Bicycle for sale!/Folding Citizen Bike, sparingly used—Free dropoff in the Bay area/bicycle, bike, folding bike, citizen bike. The first field can be a title field, and in this example would be “Bicycle for sale!” The second field can be a creative field, and in this example would be “Folding Citizen Bike, sparingly used—Free dropoff in the Bay area.” The third field can include the keywords to be used for the advertisement, and in this example would be “bicycle,” “bike,” “folding bike” and “Citizen bike.” In some implementations, the text message can also include billing information for the advertiser using any of the delimiters identified above. The parser can determine whether any portion of the advertisement, bidding or billing information is missing and can send a text message to the advertiser requesting any of the missing information. - In some implementations, the
messaging interface 150 can elicit successive messages that include different elements of information describing the advertisement to be created. Following each message sent by the advertiser, the messaging interface can provide Instructions identifying what the contents of the next message sent by theadvertiser 145 to themessaging interface 150 should include. For example, themessaging interface 150 can receive a first message that contains the advertisement. In this example, themessaging interface 150 can respond to the receipt of the advertisement with a request for bidding information. Theadvertiser 145 can then reply to the request for bidding information with the bids he/she wants to enter for the advertisement placement. After receiving the bidding information, themessaging interface 150 can send a message to theadvertiser 145 requesting billing information. - The
messaging interface 150 can generate an advertisement from the initial message, and once the billing information is received, the advertisement along with associated bidding information can be released to theadvertisement data store 114 for distribution using theadvertising management system 104. - In some implementations, a lead capture instruction can be included with the advertisement in the
advertising management system 104. The lead capture instruction can provide an action to be taken as a result of the user selecting the advertisement. In some implementations, the lead capture instruction can instruct a browser to retrieve a landing page upon selection of the advertisement. Because the advertiser has submitted the advertisement through amessaging interface 150, themessaging interface 150 can automatically generate a landing page for the advertisement. In those implementations where a landing page for the advertisement is provided, when the user selects the advertisement, he/she will be directed to the landing page. The landing page can provide additional information (e.g., address, coupons, etc.) for the advertiser. Such additional information can be collected, for example, based upon listings, messages received from the advertiser, etc.). In other implementations, selection of the advertisement can cause a call to be placed in those instances where the user selects the device using a mobile communications device (e.g., cellular phone) or a computer with internet telephony. In further implementations, selection of the advertisement can cause a text message to be sent to the advertiser with contact information supplied by the user. In still further implementations, the advertisement can direct the user to call a number associated with theadvertisement management system 104. When a call is received, theadvertisement management system 104 can record a selection of the advertisement and forward the call to the advertiser. - When an advertisement is served, a billing component included in the
messaging interface 150 can track the advertisement to determine whether an advertisement account associated with the advertisement should be debited (e.g., based upon the billing paradigm (e.g., cost per click (CPC), cost per impression (CPI), etc.) associated with the advertisement). In some examples, the billing component can charge a third party account (e.g., bank account, credit card, mobile phone, etc.) to open an advertisement account for theadvertiser 145 with theadvertising management system 104. Thereby, charges from advertisement placements can be debited from the advertisement account. In other examples, the charge can be made to the third party account each time an action is taken with regard to the advertisement. - In some implementations, the
advertiser 145 can specify a maximum amount to be spent on the campaign. In those examples where theadvertiser 145 maintains an advertising account with theadvertising management system 104, the maximum amount to be spent on the campaign can be managed by the amount of money placed into the advertisement account. When the account has been exhausted, the advertisement is not served again until theadvertiser 145 places more money into the advertisement account. In those examples where a third party account is debited each time an action is taken with regard to an advertisement, the user can specify a maximum amount to be debited from the third party account. In some examples, theadvertiser 145 can provide additional approval to raise the budget for the campaign. - In some implementations, the messaging interface can provide performance metrics to the
advertiser 145 using a messaging format (e.g., SMS, EMS, MMS, etc.). The performance metrics, for example, can include a number of times the advertisement has been served, a number of selections of the advertisement, a cost per impression, an average price paid for advertisement placements, most popular search terms for users that viewed and/or selected the advertisement, etc. The performance metrics can be used by theadvertiser 145 to judge the effectiveness of the campaign. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example messaging interface foradvertisement submission 150. The messaging interface foradvertisement submission 150 can facilitate the submission of advertisements for use in online targeted advertising using messaging formats (e.g., SMS, EMS, MMS, etc.). In some implementations, themessaging interface 150 can include aninstruction component 210, anadvertisement generation component 220, apayment component 230, and acampaign reporting component 240. - The
instruction component 210 can be operable to provide instructions for formatting of submissions to themessaging interface 150. In some implementations, the instructions can provide a text messaging template to which the advertiser can reply and fill the relevant information into the correct fields of the template. In other implementations, the instructions can provide an interactive message interface whereby the user can request instructions for specific parts of the submission. In still other implementations, theinstruction component 210 can provide successive instructions to theadvertiser 145 based upon successful submission of successive components of an advertisement. For example, theadvertiser 145 can submit a title. Theinstruction component 210 can then provide instructions for submission of body text for the creative. Upon receiving body text for the creative, the instruction component can provide instructions for submission of target information, bidding information, billing information, etc. - The
advertisement generation component 220 can be operable to generate an advertisement based upon one or more submissions received from theadvertiser 145. Based upon the information received in one or more messages from theadvertiser 145 theadvertisement generation component 220 can generate an advertisement, including, e.g., one or more of an advertisement creative, a linked page, target audience, bidding information, and/or billing information. In those implementations where the advertiser submits an advertisement in a single message, theadvertisement generation component 220 can parse the message to separate the component parts of the advertisement (e.g., header/title, body text, link, target information, bidding information, billing information, etc.). In such implementations, theadvertisement generation component 220 can inspect the message to ensure that an advertisement can be accurately created from the message. If theadvertisement generation component 220 is unable to generate the advertisement from the message, theadvertisement generation component 220 can direct theinstructions component 210 to request the advertiser resubmit the advertisement. Alternatively, theadvertisement generation component 220 can direct the instructions component to send a request to the advertiser to submit only that portion of the advertisement which was not derived from one or more earlier messages. - In those implementations where the advertiser submits the advertisement in several different messages, the
advertisement generation component 220 can identify the components of the advertisement based upon the different messages received from theadvertiser 145. In such implementations, theadvertisement generation component 220 can inspect each of the messages to ensure that a current message is in proper format. For example, the advertisement generation component can direct theinstructions component 210 to provide instructions for submitting a next advertisement component of the advertisement if the current message is in the proper format or to provide instructions for resubmitting a current advertisement component if the current message is in an improper or unrecognized format. - The
payment component 230 can be operable to debit a user account responsive to a performance metric associated with the advertisement. For example, in those implementations where the performance metric is based upon a cost per click metric, thepayment component 230 can debit an advertiser account when the advertisement is selected by a user. In further examples, a bidding system can be used to select advertisements for display to a user. In such examples, thepayment component 230 can debit the advertiser's account based upon auction results associated with the presentation of the advertisement. In various implementations, the advertiser account can be a third party account, or the advertiser account can be account with the advertising management system. - In some implementations, the payment component can store an advertising budget for the advertisement as provided by the advertiser. In such implementations, the payment component, for example, can remove the advertisement from eligibility for targeted distribution to users based upon the budget. The budget, for example, can be specified by the advertiser based upon the size of the advertiser's account, or can be based upon an amount provided by the
advertiser 145 during submission of the advertisement. - The
campaign reporting component 240 can provide statistical metrics to theadvertiser 145 regarding his/her advertising campaign. In various implementations, the statistical metrics can include, for example, the number of times an advertisement has been served, a number of times the advertisement has been selected, conversions resulting from the advertisement display, length of campaign, average cost per impression, average cost per click, etc. The performance metrics can be provided to theadvertiser 145 using a messaging protocol. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of anexample process 300 for adjusting participation probability for a content item in a content item selection process. Atstage 310, one or more messages are received. The one or more messages can be received, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g.,messaging interface 150 ofFIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g.,advertisement generation component 220 ofFIG. 2 ). In some implementations, the entire advertisement is received in a single message, while in other implementations, the advertisement is received over multiple messages. The one or more message can include both advertisement information (e.g., a creative) and target audience information (e.g., targeted search terms, demographic information, etc.) - At
stage 320, an advertisement is generated based upon the one or more messages. The advertisement can be generated, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g.,messaging interface 150 ofFIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g.,advertisement generation component 220 ofFIG. 2 ). An advertisement in a single message can include delimiters operable to separate the various fields that can be requested by the messaging interface (e.g., including title/header, advertisement body, link, target audience, bidding information, billing information, etc.) Advertisements received in multiple messages can be parsed according to the order in which the messages were received. In some implementations, instructions can be provided to the advertiser to alert the advertiser as to how to format the advertisement submission. In various implementations, the advertisement can be a targeted text advertisement, a targeted graphical advertisement, a targeted video advertisement, a targeted audio advertisement, etc. - At
stage 330, the advertisement is provided for targeted distribution. The advertisement can be provided for targeted distribution, for example, by an advertising management system (e.g.,advertising management system 104 ofFIG. 1 ). In some implementations, the advertisement can be served with search results when search terms related to the advertisement are submitted to a search engine. In other implementations, the advertisement can be served based upon a request from a web publisher for advertisements to be included within his/her web page. -
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of anotherexample process 400 for adjusting participation probability for a content item in a content item selection process. Atstage 405, instructions for advertisement submission are sent to an advertiser. The instructions can be sent, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g.,messaging interface 150 ofFIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an instruction component (e.g.,instruction component 210 ofFIG. 2 ). In some implementations, the instruction component can instruct the advertiser to submit the various components of an advertisement in several different messages. In other implementations, the instruction component can instruct the advertiser to submit the various components of the advertisement in a single message, with each component marked by some delimiter. - At
stage 410, a decision is made whether there are more instructions to provide to the advertiser. The decision of whether more instructions are to be provided can be made, for example, by an instructions component (e.g.,instructions component 210 ofFIG. 2 ). In some implementations, the instructions component provides instructions in a manner similar to an interactive message response system, whereby the advertiser sends a message to the instruction component including an identification of which instruction menu page is desired, and the instruction component responds with the requested instruction menu page. In other implementations, the instruction component provides all of the instruction pages at once, and the advertiser can navigate the pages based upon a structured order in which the instruction messages were sent. - If there are more instruction pages to send, the
process 400 returns to stage 405. However, if there are no more instruction pages to send, one or more messages can be received from the advertiser atstage 415. The one or more messages can be received, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g.,messaging interface 150 ofFIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g.,advertisement generation component 220 ofFIG. 2 ). In some implementations, the entire advertisement is received in a single message, while in other implementations, the advertisement is received over multiple messages. The one or more message can include both advertisement information (e.g., a creative) and target audience information (e.g., targeted search terms, demographic information, etc.) - At
stage 420, the message is parsed. The message can be parsed, for example, by an advertisement generation component (e.g.,advertisement generation component 220 ofFIG. 2 ). An advertisement in a single message can include delimiters operable to separate the various fields that can be requested by the messaging interface (e.g., including title/header, advertisement body, link, target audience, bidding information, billing information, etc.). Such a message is thereby parsed based upon the delimiters within the message. Advertisements received in multiple messages can be parsed according to the order in which the messages were received. In some implementations, instructions can be provided to the advertiser to alert the advertiser as to how to format the advertisement submission. - At
stage 425, a determination is made whether advertisement information is included in the one or more messages. The determination can be made, for example, by the advertisement generation component (e.g.,advertisement generation component 220 ofFIG. 2 ). If the one or more messages do not include advertisement information, theprocess 400 can send a request to submit advertisement information atstage 430. The request to submit advertisement information can be sent, for example, by the instructions component (e.g.,instructions component 210 ofFIG. 2 ). - If advertisement information is included in the one or more messages, the
process 400 can determine whether the one or more messages include auction, billing and/or target audience information. The determination of whether the one or more messages include auction, billing, and/or target audience information can be made, for example, by the advertisement generation component (e.g.,advertisement generation component 220 ofFIG. 2 ). If the one or more messages do not include advertisement information, theprocess 400 can send a request to submit advertisement information atstage 440. The request to submit advertisement information can be sent, for example, by the instructions component (e.g.,instructions component 210 ofFIG. 2 ). - If the auction, billing and/or target audience information is included in the one or more messages, the
process 400 can generate an advertisement atstage 445. The advertisement can be generated, for example, by a messaging interface (e.g.,messaging interface 150 ofFIG. 2 ) in conjunction with an advertisement generation component (e.g.,advertisement generation component 220 ofFIG. 2 ). In various implementations, the advertisement generated can be a targeted text advertisement, a targeted graphical advertisement, a targeted video advertisement, a targeted audio advertisement, etc. - At
stage 450, the advertisement is provided for targeted distribution. The advertisement can be provided for targeted distribution, for example, by an advertising management system (e.g.,advertising management system 104 ofFIG. 1 ). In some implementations, the advertisement can be served with search results when search terms related to the advertisement are submitted to a search engine. In other implementations, the advertisement can be served based upon a request from a web publisher for advertisements to be included within his/her web page. - In some implementations, spam detection processes are used to identify spam messages that may be sent by use of the messaging interface. Messages classified as spam messages are ignored and not processed further. Such techniques can include comparing sending addresses (e.g., numbers) of the received message to a list of known spam addresses. If the sending address of the received message is on the spam address list, then the message is classified as spam. Another technique includes comparing the received messages to other received messages that are received within a time window. If a number of messages are highly similar, then the messages are classified as spam. Other spam detection processes can also be used.
