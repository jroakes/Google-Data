- Social media networks enable members to update their followers in real time with information. Similar to an open journal or diary, individual members maintain a social media network property, which they use to immediately communicate information to their users.
- Social media networks are open to both individuals and businesses, and thus a business/advertiser (“advertiser”) may have an account on a social network and maintain a social network property. Many advertisers maintain social network properties, and often update these properties on a daily, hourly, or even minute-by-minute basis.
- campaigns are also used to connect users and advertisers for customer service operations, increasing brand recognitions, and other objectives of a campaign.
- campaigns that are managed on social networks are not fully integrated with campaigns on other properties, such as web search properties and publisher properties.

- the keywords may be supplied by the advertiser, or suggested by the advertisement management system 110 and accepted by the advertiser.
- the keywords can be obtained by analyzing the social media content from the social media property of the advertiser.
- the advertisement management system includes a key word engine 214 that analyzes the social media content from the social media site of the advertiser to obtain keywords. Once obtained, the advertisement management system stores the keyword data in a keyword data store 216 .
- a client device 108 causes keywords to be sent to the advertisement management system.
- the client device 108 may request search results from a search engine publisher, and when the client device renders the search results page, the page may cause the client device to send an advertisement requests that includes one or more keywords to the advertisement management system.
- the advertisement management system stores information advertising campaigns of the advertiser in a campaign data store 224 .
- An example campaign specifies advertising budgets for advertisements, and specifies when, where and under what conditions particular advertisements may be served for presentation.
- the advertisement management system includes and advertisement engine 222 .
- the advertisement engine compares the keywords to the keywords in the keyword data store 216 to identify relevant social media content.
- the comparison can include one or more data models that predict advertisement performance, and can take into account the predicted performance, quality scores, and auction bids to determine which advertiser will have advertisements shown.
- the advertisement engine combines campaign information with the social media data to create a tailored advertisement.
- the advertisement engine may provide multiple advertisements, some specific to the campaign (e.g., an advertisement with a pre-generated creative and image) and some generated from social media content.
- the advertisement engine 222 determines if the keyword or advertisement request is associated with the social network property of the advertiser. If the keyword or advertisement request is not associated with the social network property of the advertiser, then the advertisement selected may be from an existing advertisement or advertisement templates specified for the campaign.
- An existing advertisement may be, for example, an existing banner advertisement, image, flash application, or other conventional advertisement.
- An advertisement template may be, for example, an advertisement in which the advertisement engine 222 may personalize the advertisement for the recipient based on information provided by the user device.
- the advertisement engine 222 may include a local address where the advertised good or service may be acquired. The user may have identified himself to the service and the advertisement may be personalized with the user's reported name or user identifier.
- the advertisement engine 222 creates an advertisement from the social media data and provides it to the client device for display.
- the advertisement may be an image, text, html, or any other form of presentable data that was recently posted by the advertiser on the social network property, e.g., within the last five minutes.
- the advertisement engine may filter the social media data based on the keyword in order to obtain more relevant information. For example, suppose the advertiser has a social network property related to sports apparel and sports gear, and the advertiser is posting entries and RSS feed data related to the release of a spring line of apparel and the introduction of new mountaineering equipment. Assuming the keywords for the advertisement request are “compression shorts,” then only data related to the release of the spring line of apparel will be considered for inclusion in the advertisements, as compression shorts are more relevant to apparel than to mountaineering equipment.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing how content from a social media property may be incorporated into advertisements.
- a social media property page 300 includes social media content 302 a - e for an advertiser.
- the content may be combined in different ways to create different advertisements.
- the social media property page 300 is a page in which the advertiser can post short messages and the posts can be automatically sent to other users that have elected to receive the posts from the advertiser as they are posted.
- Other social media property page 300 pages can also be used, however.
- the advertiser “LapCo,” is illustratively a provider of mobile devices and laptops, and uses the social media property page 300 to announce new developments, product releases, and general posts that may be of interests to consumers.
- advertisement 304 a single entry from the social network property, here “Activate your mobile broadband today” 302 a , may be turned directly into an advertisement 304 in response to an advertisement request that includes the keywords “mobile broadband.”
- the advertisement includes additional information identifying the source of the content.
- an HTML link embedded in the entry is transposed and embedded in the advertisement. If the text of the HTML link is too long to fit into the advertisement, the displayed link text may be abbreviated.
- advertisement 306 content from several entries may be combined to form a single advertisement for a request that includes the keyword “laptops.”
- social media content 302 c and 302 e related to the sale of a new laptop computer systems are grouped together.
- social media content may be grouped based on their content (for example, phrases such as “save” and “free” may indicate that the social media content are associated with a limited time sale).
- content on the social media network property may be integrated with existing marketing campaign, e.g., a marketing campaign that offers free memory upgrades.
- existing advertising campaigns may be associated with social media content on the social media network property.
- the existing campaign may be associated with keywords, which are used to select social media content that may be combined to create new advertisements.
- keywords may be identified from the text of the advertisement campaign itself.
- FIGS. 4A and 4B show other examples of keywords submitted by a client device affecting the resulting advertisement.
- keywords submitted by the client device may affect not only which advertiser's advertisements are presented, but also which social media content from a social media property are incorporated into advertisements.
- a client device 400 submits the keywords “Computer Sale” to the advertising management system.
- the advertising management system creates advertisements 404 , 406 from the social media network property social media content related to the computer sales.
- a client device 420 submits the keyword broadband to the advertisement management system.
- the advertisement management system creates an advertisement 424 (“Activate your mobile broadband today”) related to broadband.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram showing prioritization of social media content.
- multiple different social media content may by appropriate to transform into advertisements.
- the content may be prioritized based on the popularity of the content.
- Many social media properties 502 have mechanisms by which a user of the social media may rate or indicate popularity of particular content. For example, users may indicate their acceptance of a particular post on a Likert scale, e.g., a rating from 1-5 stars.
- peering content is the act of a user propagating content that the user receives, and includes a user re-sending content that is received, e.g., by forwarding or re-posting the content. For example, users may re-send microblog posts that they receive from an advertiser. Content that is repeated by many different users are more likely to make high performing advertisements than content that is not.
- the advertisement management system 504 may interact with the social media property 502 to determine which social media content is most popular, e.g., by receiving statistics related to particular content provided by the advertiser.
- the advertisement management system prioritizes the social media content that is more popular over social media content that is less popular
- an advertisement 506 based on the free memory content post is given higher preference than an advertisement 508 based on the $400 discount content post.
- FIGS. 6A-C illustrate exemplary user interfaces for delivering advertisements based on social media content.
- a user has entered the search query “computer” in a search text box 600 , and initiated a search by a search engine, which provided search results presented in to search results text area 602 .
- the user interface displays advertisements in an advertisement area 604 .
- an advertisement 606 from an advertising campaign by the advertiser is presented in the same region of the user interface as an advertisement 608 based on the social media content.
- the advertisements generated from the social media content of the advertiser can include one or more commands 610 and 612 .
- the commands may be conditioned on whether the user that is viewing the advertisement has an account with the social network property from which the content was collected, i.e., whether the commands are specific to users of the social network. For example, suppose a user that is viewing the advertisement 608 also has an account with the same social network from which the content of the advertiser's account was collected and included in the advertisement 608 . Provided the user is logged into the account of the social network (or a corresponding account of the advertisement management system) so that the user can be identified as having an account, a command specific to social network members may be embedded in the advertisement.
- the social network may have a “fan” status, and fans of a particular account may automatically receive content as it is posted to that account. Accordingly, if the user is not a fan of the advertiser, a command 610 that, upon selection, causes the user's social network account to be associated with the advertisers social network account, can be included with the advertisement.
- the commands also need not be specific to users of the social network. For example, if the advertiser has more than one social network property, icons 612 that link to the advertiser's social network properties can also be shown in the advertisement, regardless of whether the user of the user device has an account on any of the social networks.
- selection of the advertisement 608 causes the user device of the user to request the resource at the social network property of the advertiser, e.g., to request a page of the advertiser at the social network property, request a text stream, or other associated resource.
- the advertiser can specify specific landing pages that are different from the social network property.
- the actions of the users taken in response to the advertisement can also be tracked and used to update the popularity or quality of particular content that is used in the advertisements. For example, assume advertisements that include the content “Design your own 17 inch laptops” have a very low click through rate relative to advertisements that include the content “Save up to $400 on select laptop models.” As a result of the disparity, the content “Save up to $400 on select laptop models” will be selected more often than the content “Design your own 17 inch laptops”, absent other selection parameters.
- actions taken by users can also result in charges to the advertisers that are in additional to standard auction fees. For example, and advertiser may bid a cost per action based on every 10 followers or fans that result from the advertisement 608 , e.g., $20 for every 10 social network users that select command 610 .
- a user enters the search “computer” in a search text box 620 .
- the user interface displays advertisements in an advertisement area 624 , 626 .
- an advertisement from an advertisement campaign by the advertiser is presented in a region 624 separate from the advertisements based on the social media content 626 .
- a user enters the search “computer” in a search text box 640 .
- the user interface displays advertisements in an advertisement area 644 .
- an advertisement from advertisement campaign by the advertiser is presented in a highlighted position at the top of the page 644 .
- Social media information for the advertiser is present in the same region and off to the side 646 .
- Other advertisements are presented in a separate region without presenting social media advertisements 648 .
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of an example process for creating advertisements based on social media content on a social media property.
- the process 700 can, for example, be implemented in the advertising management system 110 of FIG. 1 , or in some other processing system.
- the process associates keywords with a social media network property of an advertiser ( 702 ).
- the keywords are provided by the advertiser.
- the keywords are determined from content on the social media network property.
- keywords are determined from content on the social media network property are re-determined periodically (for example, hourly or daily). In some implementations, only a portion of the social media network content is used to determine keywords. For example, older content may be ignored in favor of newer content. In some implementations, content that is older than one week is ignored. Other time constraints can also be used.
- the process receives keywords for an advertisement request ( 704 ).
- the keywords are sent directly from the user device to the advertisement management system.
- the keywords may be identified from the context in which the user device is operating. For example, keywords may be derived from the content being displayed on the user device.
- the process determines that the received keyword is one of the keywords associated with the social media network property ( 706 ). Keywords received from the user device are compared to keywords stored by the advertisement management system to determine the advertiser and the social media property associated with the keyword.
- the process obtains content posted on the social media network property by the advertiser ( 708 ). Advertisers update their social media network property.
- the advertising management system obtains the social media content from the social media network property.
- the advertising management system may obtain the social media content by accessing an application programming interface provided by the social media network, or by accessing the webpage associated with the social media network property.
- social media content are obtained on a regular basis (for example, every 20 minutes) and stored by the advertising management system.
- the social media content are obtained from the social media network in response to receiving keywords and advertisement request.
- the process generates an advertisement from the content ( 710 ).
- the generated advertisement includes at least some of the content from the social media site.
- the advertisement management system prioritizes which content to display as part of an advertisement. The prioritization may be based on a determination of the relevance of the content to the supplied keyword and/or by a measure of the popularity of the content. Content may be considered more popular if the content has resulted in advertisements that resulted in a number of positive user interactions, if the content has been repeated on the social media network, or if users of the social media network have voted favorably for the content.
- the process provides the advertisement for display on the user device ( 712 ).
- the advertisement may include instruction that causes the user device to render the advertisement, for example as a portion of a web page.
- advertisements based on the social media property are integrated with advertisements as part of a formal advertising campaign.
- Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus.
- the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus.
- a computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them.
- a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal.

Description
- This application is a continuation application of, and claims priority to, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/086,562, titled “SOCIAL MEDIA ENABLED ADVERTISING,” filed on Apr. 14, 2011, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/324,647, titled “SOCIAL MEDIA ENABLED ADVERTISING,” filed Apr. 15, 2010. The disclosure of the foregoing applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
- This specification relates to on-line advertising.
- The Internet enables access to a wide variety of content items, e.g., video and/or audio files, web pages for particular subjects, news articles, etc. Such access to these content items likewise enables opportunities for targeted advertising. For example, advertisements can be provided with search results in response to a search query provided by a user; provided by third party online publishers that place the advertisement on web pages that have content related to the advertisement; or provided in response to a specific request from a user, such as when a user requests information for particular products or services.
- Social media networks enable members to update their followers in real time with information. Similar to an open journal or diary, individual members maintain a social media network property, which they use to immediately communicate information to their users. Social media networks are open to both individuals and businesses, and thus a business/advertiser (“advertiser”) may have an account on a social network and maintain a social network property. Many advertisers maintain social network properties, and often update these properties on a daily, hourly, or even minute-by-minute basis.
- Often advertisers do marketing and branding broadcasts on social network properties and media streams (e.g., videos, blogs posts and/or messages) generated from the social network properties. These campaigns are also used to connect users and advertisers for customer service operations, increasing brand recognitions, and other objectives of a campaign. Typically, however, the campaigns that are managed on social networks are not fully integrated with campaigns on other properties, such as web search properties and publisher properties.
- This specification describes technologies relating to on-line advertising.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of associating, by the data processing apparatus, keywords with a social media network property of an advertiser; receiving a keyword for an advertisement request for a user device; determining that the received keyword is one of the keywords associated with the social media network property and in response to the determination: obtaining, by the data processing apparatus and from the social media network property, content on the social media network property by the advertiser; generating, by the data processing apparatus, an advertisement responsive to the request, the advertisement including at least some of the content obtained from the social media network property; and providing the advertisement for display on the user device. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of associating, by the data processing apparatus, keywords with a social media network property of an advertiser; periodically obtaining, by the data processing apparatus and from the social media network property, content on the social media network property by the advertiser; receiving a keyword for an advertisement request for a user device; determining that the received keyword is one of the keywords associated with the social media network property and in response to the determination generating, by the data processing apparatus, an advertisement responsive to the request, the advertisement including at least some of the content obtained from the social media network property; and providing the advertisement for display on the user device. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of associating a keyword with a social media network property of an advertiser; storing the keyword in a datastore; receiving an advertisement request including one or more keywords; comparing the received one or more keywords of the advertisement request to the stored keywords in the database/data store to identify relevant social media network property and in response to the identification; retrieving, by the data processing apparatus and from the social media network property, content on the social media network property by the advertiser; creating, by the data processing apparatus, an advertisement responsive to the request, the advertisement including at least a subset/portion of the content retrieved from the social media network property; and providing the advertisement for display on the user device.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving an advertisement request from a user device; determining if the advertisement request is associated with social network property of an advertiser; upon determining that the advertisement request is associated with social media network property of an advertiser: obtaining, by the data processing apparatus and from the social media network property, content on the social media network property by the advertiser; and generating, by the data processing apparatus, an advertisement responsive to the request, the advertisement including at least a subset/portion of the content obtained from the social media network property; and upon determining that the advertisement request is not associated with social network property of the advertiser: obtaining, by the data processing apparatus, an advertisement; and presenting the advertisement for display on the user device.
- The foregoing and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features, alone or in combination. The keywords may be provided by the advertiser. Associating keywords with a social media network property may include determining keywords based on the content on the social media network property. The methods may also include the actions of prioritizing content based on statistics that measure repeating of content by users on at least one social media network. Content may be filtered based on the keywords. Generating an advertisement responsive to the request may include generating an advertisement that includes content from an advertising campaign and content from the social media network property separate from the advertising campaign. Generating an advertisement responsive to the request may include determining whether the user device is associated with an account on the social media network; in response to determining that the user device is not associated with an account on the social media network, generating an advertisement that includes only content from the social media network property; and in response to determining that the user device is associated with an account on the social media network, generating an advertisement that includes content from the social media network property and one or more social network commands specific to two or more users of the social network. The content may include blog posts. The content may include RSS feed data. The content may include images. Generating an advertisement responsive to the request may include determining whether the user device is associated with an account on the social media network; in response to determining that the user device is not associated with an account on the social media network, generating an advertisement that includes only content from the social media network property; in response to determining that the user device is associated with an account on the social media network, generating an advertisement that includes content from the social media network property and one or more social network commands specific to two or more users of the social network. Obtaining an advertisement may include identifying an application template; generating an advertisement based on the application template and information provided by the user device.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Advertisements can include the most current information provided by the advertiser on a social network site. Advertisements may reflect content that the audience finds the most interesting. Advertisements may be integrated with social media networks. Advertisement creation may be simplified.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which advertisements can be targeted to users. Acomputer network 102, such the Internet, or a combination of Internet and one or more wired and wireless networks, connects one or more social media network publishers 104-1, a search engine publisher 104-2, one or more syndication publishers 104-3, one or more advertisers 104-4, auser device 108, and anadvertisement management system 110. For clarity, only three publishers and one advertiser are shown; however, theonline environment 100 includes many thousands of publishers and advertisers. - The
user device 108 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 108 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser or other communication software, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - The publishers and, optionally, the advertisers 104 maintain websites that are one or more resource 105 associated with a domain name, and each web site is hosted by one or more servers. A resource is any data that can be provided by the web site over the
network 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources include HTML pages, RSS feeds, blog posts, and video, for example. To avoid congestion in the drawings, the resources 105 are represented as web pages; however, the representations ofFIG. 1 are inclusive of all types of resources that are consistent with the above definition. - As will be described in more detail below, each of the publishers are in data communication with the
advertisement management system 110 and together the publishers and theadvertisement management system 110 facilitate the provisioning of advertisement with the publisher resources 105. In particular, theadvertisement management system 110 allows advertisers to define targeting rules that take into account attributes of the particular user to generate targeted advertisement offers for the users. - These targeted advertisements can be provided in many different properties, such as the properties of the social media network publisher 104-1, the search engine publisher 104-2, and the syndication publisher 104-3. For example, the search engine publisher 104-2 is a search service that provides advertisements to users with search results that are responsive to user queries. Typically, the search results are provided in one part of the page, such as the left-hand side, and the advertisements are provided in another part of the page, such as the right-hand side of the page. When the search engine publisher 104-2 provides the search results webpage 105-2 to the
user device 108, the user device renders the webpage 105-2. The webpage 105-2 includes instructions that cause the user device to request advertisements from theadvertisement management system 110. The request will include a user identifier and other data regarding the search, such as the user query, and theadvertisement management system 110 can provide targeted advertisements to the particular user. - The syndication publisher 104-3 is a general content web site, e.g., a sports related web site, a news related web site, etc. When a
user device 108 receives a resource 105-3 from the syndication publisher 104-3, the user device renders the resource 105-3. As with the search results page, the webpage 105-3 includes instructions that cause the user device to request advertisements from theadvertisement management system 110. The request will include a user identifier and other data that describes the content of the webpage 105-3, and theadvertisement management system 110 can provide targeted advertisements to the particular user. - Like the syndication publisher 104-3, the social media network publisher 104-1 can also provide resources on which advertisements are rendered. However, the
advertising management system 110 also facilitates the collection of content that has been posted on the social media network publisher 104-1 property of a particular advertiser for inclusion in advertisements on other properties, such as the search engine publisher 104-2 and other syndication publishers 104-3. In general, an advertiser that maintains an account at both the advertisement management system and the social media network publisher 104-1 can specify that, under one or more conditions, content from the social media network property 104-1 be included in advertisements for the advertiser. - For example, the advertiser may specify that certain keywords that are used in search queries or collected from web pages on which advertisements are to be rendered be associated with the content of its corresponding social network property. For advertisements that are generated in response to those keywords, the advertisements can include text, streams, or other data collected from the social network property.
-
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an exemplary environment in which theadvertisement management system 110 may operate in conjunction with a social media network. Represented byprocess arrow 200, anadvertiser 202 maintains one or moresocial media properties 204. Generally, the social media properties are hosted by a social media network; however, in some circumstances, the social media property may be hosted by the advertiser. Represented byprocess arrow 206, the advertiser registers the social media network account with the advertisement management system 208. By doing so, the advertiser allows theadvertisement management system 110 to access the advertiser's data and content at the socialmedia network property 204. For example, theadvertisement management system 110 may have an application program interface (API), or some other instrument, that allows theadvertisement management system 110 to access the socialmedia network property 204. - As indicated by the
process arrow 210, the advertisement management system accesses thesocial media properties 204 of the advertiser to obtain information posted on the social media property by the advertiser. In some embodiments, the content from the social media property is stored by the advertisement management system in a socialmedia data store 212 for rapid retrieval. In some implementations, the content is periodically obtained, e.g., hourly, by the advertisement management system so that recent content can be included in advertisements. In other implementations, the information from the social media property is accessed by the advertisement management system in response to an advertisement request, the latter of which is described in more detail below. - The advertisement management system associates information from the advertiser and the advertiser's social media properties with one or more keywords. The keywords may be supplied by the advertiser, or suggested by the
advertisement management system 110 and accepted by the advertiser. In some implementations, the keywords can be obtained by analyzing the social media content from the social media property of the advertiser. For example, the advertisement management system includes akey word engine 214 that analyzes the social media content from the social media site of the advertiser to obtain keywords. Once obtained, the advertisement management system stores the keyword data in akeyword data store 216. - Represented by
process arrow 218, aclient device 108 causes keywords to be sent to the advertisement management system. For example, theclient device 108 may request search results from a search engine publisher, and when the client device renders the search results page, the page may cause the client device to send an advertisement requests that includes one or more keywords to the advertisement management system. - The advertisement management system stores information advertising campaigns of the advertiser in a
campaign data store 224. An example campaign specifies advertising budgets for advertisements, and specifies when, where and under what conditions particular advertisements may be served for presentation. - The advertisement management system includes and
advertisement engine 222. The advertisement engine compares the keywords to the keywords in thekeyword data store 216 to identify relevant social media content. The comparison can include one or more data models that predict advertisement performance, and can take into account the predicted performance, quality scores, and auction bids to determine which advertiser will have advertisements shown. - The advertisement engine combines campaign information with the social media data to create a tailored advertisement. Alternatively, the advertisement engine may provide multiple advertisements, some specific to the campaign (e.g., an advertisement with a pre-generated creative and image) and some generated from social media content.
- For example, assume that the
advertiser 202 wins at least one advertisement slot in the auction, or otherwise is selected to have an advertisement shown in response to the advertisement request. Theadvertisement engine 222 determines if the keyword or advertisement request is associated with the social network property of the advertiser. If the keyword or advertisement request is not associated with the social network property of the advertiser, then the advertisement selected may be from an existing advertisement or advertisement templates specified for the campaign. An existing advertisement, may be, for example, an existing banner advertisement, image, flash application, or other conventional advertisement. An advertisement template may be, for example, an advertisement in which theadvertisement engine 222 may personalize the advertisement for the recipient based on information provided by the user device. For example, theadvertisement engine 222 may include a local address where the advertised good or service may be acquired. The user may have identified himself to the service and the advertisement may be personalized with the user's reported name or user identifier. - Conversely, if the keyword or advertisement request is associated with the social network property of the advertiser, then the
advertisement engine 222 creates an advertisement from the social media data and provides it to the client device for display. For example, the advertisement may be an image, text, html, or any other form of presentable data that was recently posted by the advertiser on the social network property, e.g., within the last five minutes. - In some embodiments, the advertisement engine may filter the social media data based on the keyword in order to obtain more relevant information. For example, suppose the advertiser has a social network property related to sports apparel and sports gear, and the advertiser is posting entries and RSS feed data related to the release of a spring line of apparel and the introduction of new mountaineering equipment. Assuming the keywords for the advertisement request are “compression shorts,” then only data related to the release of the spring line of apparel will be considered for inclusion in the advertisements, as compression shorts are more relevant to apparel than to mountaineering equipment.
-
FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing how content from a social media property may be incorporated into advertisements. In this example, a socialmedia property page 300 includes social media content 302 a-e for an advertiser. The content may be combined in different ways to create different advertisements. Assume that the socialmedia property page 300 is a page in which the advertiser can post short messages and the posts can be automatically sent to other users that have elected to receive the posts from the advertiser as they are posted. Other socialmedia property page 300 pages can also be used, however. - The advertiser, “LapCo,” is illustratively a provider of mobile devices and laptops, and uses the social
media property page 300 to announce new developments, product releases, and general posts that may be of interests to consumers. - As shown with
advertisement 304, a single entry from the social network property, here “Activate your mobile broadband today” 302 a, may be turned directly into anadvertisement 304 in response to an advertisement request that includes the keywords “mobile broadband.” The advertisement includes additional information identifying the source of the content. In some scenarios, an HTML link embedded in the entry is transposed and embedded in the advertisement. If the text of the HTML link is too long to fit into the advertisement, the displayed link text may be abbreviated. - As shown with
advertisement 306, content from several entries may be combined to form a single advertisement for a request that includes the keyword “laptops.” Here,social media content - As shown in
advertisement 308, content on the social media network property may be integrated with existing marketing campaign, e.g., a marketing campaign that offers free memory upgrades. Existing advertising campaigns may be associated with social media content on the social media network property. In some embodiments, the existing campaign may be associated with keywords, which are used to select social media content that may be combined to create new advertisements. In this example, an existing campaign suggesting customers “Design your own laptop” is integrated with a social media entry “Laptops put everything at your fingertips” 302 b. In other embodiments, keywords may be identified from the text of the advertisement campaign itself. -
FIGS. 4A and 4B show other examples of keywords submitted by a client device affecting the resulting advertisement. As described above, keywords submitted by the client device may affect not only which advertiser's advertisements are presented, but also which social media content from a social media property are incorporated into advertisements. For example, referring toFIG. 4A , as represented byprocess arrow 402, aclient device 400 submits the keywords “Computer Sale” to the advertising management system. As a result the advertising management system createsadvertisements - Similarly, referring to
FIG. 4B , represented byprocess arrow 422, aclient device 420 submits the keyword broadband to the advertisement management system. In response, the advertisement management system creates an advertisement 424 (“Activate your mobile broadband today”) related to broadband. -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram showing prioritization of social media content. As described above, multiple different social media content may by appropriate to transform into advertisements. For example, referring toFIG. 5 , when selecting between multiple different social media content 500 a-e, the content may be prioritized based on the popularity of the content. Manysocial media properties 502 have mechanisms by which a user of the social media may rate or indicate popularity of particular content. For example, users may indicate their acceptance of a particular post on a Likert scale, e.g., a rating from 1-5 stars. - Another signal of popularity is repeating the content. As used herein, “repeating content” is the act of a user propagating content that the user receives, and includes a user re-sending content that is received, e.g., by forwarding or re-posting the content. For example, users may re-send microblog posts that they receive from an advertiser. Content that is repeated by many different users are more likely to make high performing advertisements than content that is not.
- The
advertisement management system 504 may interact with thesocial media property 502 to determine which social media content is most popular, e.g., by receiving statistics related to particular content provided by the advertiser. The advertisement management system prioritizes the social media content that is more popular over social media content that is less popular Here, assume the entry “Free memory upgrades on selected computer systems” 500 e is more popular than the entry “Save $400 on select desktop models” 500 c. Therefore anadvertisement 506 based on the free memory content post is given higher preference than anadvertisement 508 based on the $400 discount content post. -
FIGS. 6A-C illustrate exemplary user interfaces for delivering advertisements based on social media content. Referring toFIG. 6A , in this example, a user has entered the search query “computer” in asearch text box 600, and initiated a search by a search engine, which provided search results presented in to searchresults text area 602. The user interface displays advertisements in anadvertisement area 604. In this example, anadvertisement 606 from an advertising campaign by the advertiser is presented in the same region of the user interface as anadvertisement 608 based on the social media content. - In some implementations, the advertisements generated from the social media content of the advertiser can include one or
more commands advertisement 608 also has an account with the same social network from which the content of the advertiser's account was collected and included in theadvertisement 608. Provided the user is logged into the account of the social network (or a corresponding account of the advertisement management system) so that the user can be identified as having an account, a command specific to social network members may be embedded in the advertisement. For example, the social network may have a “fan” status, and fans of a particular account may automatically receive content as it is posted to that account. Accordingly, if the user is not a fan of the advertiser, acommand 610 that, upon selection, causes the user's social network account to be associated with the advertisers social network account, can be included with the advertisement. - The commands also need not be specific to users of the social network. For example, if the advertiser has more than one social network property,
icons 612 that link to the advertiser's social network properties can also be shown in the advertisement, regardless of whether the user of the user device has an account on any of the social networks. - In some implementations, selection of the
advertisement 608 causes the user device of the user to request the resource at the social network property of the advertiser, e.g., to request a page of the advertiser at the social network property, request a text stream, or other associated resource. In other implementations, the advertiser can specify specific landing pages that are different from the social network property. - The actions of the users taken in response to the advertisement, e.g., click throughs and conversions, can also be tracked and used to update the popularity or quality of particular content that is used in the advertisements. For example, assume advertisements that include the content “Design your own 17 inch laptops” have a very low click through rate relative to advertisements that include the content “Save up to $400 on select laptop models.” As a result of the disparity, the content “Save up to $400 on select laptop models” will be selected more often than the content “Design your own 17 inch laptops”, absent other selection parameters.
- Additionally, actions taken by users can also result in charges to the advertisers that are in additional to standard auction fees. For example, and advertiser may bid a cost per action based on every 10 followers or fans that result from the
advertisement 608, e.g., $20 for every 10 social network users that selectcommand 610. - Referring to
FIG. 6B , in this example, a user enters the search “computer” in asearch text box 620. Along with search results presented in to search results text area 622 the user interface displays advertisements in anadvertisement area 624, 626. In this example, an advertisement from an advertisement campaign by the advertiser is presented in aregion 624 separate from the advertisements based on the social media content 626. - Referring to
FIG. 6C , in this example, a user enters the search “computer” in asearch text box 640. Along with search results presented in to searchresults text area 642 the user interface displays advertisements in anadvertisement area 644. In this example, an advertisement from advertisement campaign by the advertiser is presented in a highlighted position at the top of thepage 644. Social media information for the advertiser is present in the same region and off to theside 646. Other advertisements are presented in a separate region without presentingsocial media advertisements 648. -
FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of an example process for creating advertisements based on social media content on a social media property. Theprocess 700 can, for example, be implemented in theadvertising management system 110 ofFIG. 1 , or in some other processing system. - The process associates keywords with a social media network property of an advertiser (702). In some implementations, the keywords are provided by the advertiser. In other implementations the keywords are determined from content on the social media network property. In some implementations, keywords are determined from content on the social media network property are re-determined periodically (for example, hourly or daily). In some implementations, only a portion of the social media network content is used to determine keywords. For example, older content may be ignored in favor of newer content. In some implementations, content that is older than one week is ignored. Other time constraints can also be used.
- The process receives keywords for an advertisement request (704). In some implementations, the keywords are sent directly from the user device to the advertisement management system. In other implementations, the keywords may be identified from the context in which the user device is operating. For example, keywords may be derived from the content being displayed on the user device.
- The process determines that the received keyword is one of the keywords associated with the social media network property (706). Keywords received from the user device are compared to keywords stored by the advertisement management system to determine the advertiser and the social media property associated with the keyword.
- The process obtains content posted on the social media network property by the advertiser (708). Advertisers update their social media network property. The advertising management system obtains the social media content from the social media network property. The advertising management system may obtain the social media content by accessing an application programming interface provided by the social media network, or by accessing the webpage associated with the social media network property. In some implementations, social media content are obtained on a regular basis (for example, every 20 minutes) and stored by the advertising management system. In other embodiments, the social media content are obtained from the social media network in response to receiving keywords and advertisement request.
- The process generates an advertisement from the content (710). The generated advertisement includes at least some of the content from the social media site. In some embodiments, the advertisement management system prioritizes which content to display as part of an advertisement. The prioritization may be based on a determination of the relevance of the content to the supplied keyword and/or by a measure of the popularity of the content. Content may be considered more popular if the content has resulted in advertisements that resulted in a number of positive user interactions, if the content has been repeated on the social media network, or if users of the social media network have voted favorably for the content.
- The process provides the advertisement for display on the user device (712). The advertisement may include instruction that causes the user device to render the advertisement, for example as a portion of a web page. In some embodiments, advertisements based on the social media property are integrated with advertisements as part of a formal advertising campaign.
