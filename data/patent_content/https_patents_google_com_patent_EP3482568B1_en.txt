- a computer device comprises a processor and a processor readable storage medium (which may be a non-transitory storage medium, although the implementation is not limited to this) storing instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to perform operations comprising any one of the implementations described herein.
- Online content is content shared via an Internet connection.
- Traditional content sharing technology may require a network connection with a large bandwidth in order to stream online content.
- the capabilities of the computing networks are limited and they often have low bandwidth, are unreliable, or unavailable.
- Some conventional content sharing systems enable content sharing but often provide unrestricted reproduction and access to the shared content, which may be undesirable for the content creators and/or providers and may be challenging to monitor for enforcement of copyright protection.
- the content sharing system may provide a centralized access control for media content distributed to the user devices.
- the centralized access control can be enabled using one or more digital rights management (DRM) schemes to control the use, modification, and distribution of media content.
- DRM digital rights management
- a content creator and/or content provider can therefore achieve wide distribution of their content even in regions where high speed data infrastructure and/or mobile network infrastructure is poor and/or expensive, while still retaining the ability to control distribution and protect copyright of copyright media content.
- the content sharing system may include a media server that provides media items (e.g., videos, audio) to the satellite broadcast system, and user devices can download the media items from the satellite broadcast system.
- the user devices may be mobile devices such as phones, tablets, or laptops and may be capable of storing the media items locally. Each user device may download the media items from the satellite broadcast system using a direct connection with the satellite broadcast system.
- the media server can encrypt the media items, create a data package that includes the encrypted media items, and send the data package to a satellite broadcast system.
- the media server can send the data package to a satellite broadcast system via a high-speed Internet connection.
- the user device can establish a direct connection with a satellite device (e.g., satellite set top box) of the satellite broadcast system, and download one or more of the encrypted media items in the data package from the satellite device.
- a satellite device e.g., satellite set top box
- the direct connection between the user device and the satellite device can be, for example, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, a Bluetooth® connection, or an IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi®) connection.
- the user device can download the encrypted media items via the direct connection to the satellite device, rather than having to establish a high-speed Internet connection with the media server.
- the download of the one or more encrypted media items via the direction connection between the user device and the satellite device is performed as a low-bandwidth data transfer.
- the encrypted media items downloaded to the user device are stored locally but the user device is restricted from playing the encrypted media items until the user device receives authorization from the media server.
- the user device can send a request to the media server for authorization to decrypt the encrypted media items.
- the user device can establish a low-bandwidth communication connection, using a communication protocol such as Short Message Service (SMS) messaging, with the media server for sending the request to the media server.
- SMS Short Message Service
- the user device can use SMS messaging to communicate with the media server, rather than having to establish a high-speed Internet connection with the media server.
- the media server can then perform an authorization check to ensure that the user device is authorized to view the media item.
- the media server can respond, via the low-bandwidth communication, to the user device with one or more keys to enable the user device to decrypt and play the one or more corresponding media items.
- the technology disclosed herein is advantageous because it enhances media item sharing by utilizing a direct connection between the satellite broadcast system and user devices that may have limited or no Internet access, and also providing a central mechanism to manage and monitor access to the shared media items.
- the technology may decrease the amount of bandwidth necessary to share media items, which may be beneficial to the media server, intermediate networking infrastructure (e.g., Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and user devices and may be particularly beneficial in emerging markets.
- ISPs Internet Service Providers
- each of the user devices typically had to access the media item from the media server via a high-speed Internet connection.
- the technology of the present disclosure allows users to access the media item from a satellite broadcast system and only have to contact the media server to receive authorization to view the media item.
- Such an authorization is received via a low-bandwidth connection because the amount of network traffic required to obtain the authorization from the media server may be orders of magnitude less than the traditional amount of network traffic or bandwidth required to stream or download the media item directly from the media server.
- Implementations of the present disclosure often reference videos for simplicity and brevity.
- teachings of the present disclosure are applied to media items generally and can be applied to various types of content, including for example, video, audio, text, images, program instructions, etc.

- Content-sharing platforms and their corresponding websites and mobile applications ("apps") enable user devices to share and play online streaming content, such as online streaming music and video. Streaming content may require a large amount of bandwidth and some connections may not provide the bandwidth necessary to stream content. For example, there are regions that have limited broadband access, where costs for high speed data connections are expensive relative to the region's average household income, and/or where high speed data infrastructure and/or mobile network infrastructure is poor. For example, a region may have network infrastructure for 2G networks, and delivering data and videos via the 2G networks is generally very slow.

US 2007/0265970 discloses a method and apparatus for conditionally authorising content delivery at receivers, the content being delivered by satellite. - The following presents a simplified summary of various aspects of this disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such aspects. Its purpose is to present some concepts of this disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
- In an aspect of the present disclosure, a processing device of a media server selects a media item to be provided for user consumption via a satellite broadcast system, transmits the media item encrypted using an encryption key to the satellite broadcast system via a first communication protocol, receives a request from a user device for authorization to decrypt the encrypted media item obtained by the user device via a direct connection with the satellite broadcast system. The request is received by the media server via a second communication protocol that is different from the first communication protocol. The processing device determines whether the user device is authorized to decrypt the encrypted media item and transmits a key for decrypting the encrypted media item in response to the user device being authorized to decrypt the encrypted media item.
- In one implementation, the second communication protocol is Short Message Service (SMS) messaging, Multimedia Message Service (MMS) messaging, or voice and data cellular networking. In one implementation, the key, or a response containing the key, is transmitted by the media server to the user device via at least one of SMS, messaging or MMS messaging, or voice and data cellular networking. In one implementation, prior to transmitting the encrypted media item to the satellite broadcast system, the processing device creates mapping data that associates the key with the encrypted media item, and stores the mapping data locally at the media server. In one implementation, the key is an asymmetric key.
- In one implementation, the processing device determines whether the user device is authorized to decrypt the media item by extracting a media identifier and geographic data of the user device from the request, determining whether the media identifier and the geographic data satisfy one or more criteria, and determining that the user device is authorized to decrypt the encrypted media item if the media identifier and the geographic data satisfy the one or more criteria.
- In one implementation, the processing device selects the media item based on at least one of a geographic location for consuming the media item, a device platform for consuming the media item, an operating system for consuming the media item, a ranking of the media item, a rating of the media item, a duration of the media item, a language associated with the media item, or content of the media item.
- In an aspect of the present disclosure, a processing device of a user device establishes a direct connection with a device of a satellite broadcast system. The device stores encrypted media items provided by a media server. The processing device of the user device receives, via the direct connection, the encrypted media items from the device of the satellite broadcast system, sends, via a low-bandwidth communication connection between the user device and the media server, a request to the media server for authorization to decrypt the encrypted media items. and receives, via the low-bandwidth communication connection, a response from the media server indicating whether the user device is authorized to decrypt the encrypted media items.
- In one implementation, the processing device of the user device determines a subset of the encrypted media items to receive from the device of the satellite broadcast system. The determining is based on user input indicating a selection of the subset of the encrypted online media items. In one implementation, the device is a satellite set top box. In one implementation, the direct connection between the user device and the satellite set top box is a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, a Bluetooth® connection, or an IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi®) connection. In one implementation, the processing device of the user device extracts keys from the response, and decrypts the encrypted media items using the keys. In one implementation, the request is sent to the media server via Short Message Service (SMS) messaging, Multimedia Message Service (MMS) messaging, or voice and data cellular networking. In one implementation, the processing device of the user device sends the request by determining geographic data of the user device, and sending the geographic data of the user device as part of the request.
- An apparatus to provide online media content via a satellite broadcast system is also described. In one implementation, the apparatus includes means for selecting a media item to be provided for user consumption via a satellite broadcast system, means for transmitting the media item encrypted using an encryption key to the satellite broadcast system via a first communication protocol, means for receiving a request from a user device for authorization to decrypt the encrypted media item obtained by the user device via a direct connection with the satellite broadcast system. The request is received by the apparatus via a second communication protocol that is different from the first communication protocol. The apparatus includes means for determining whether the user device is authorized to decrypt the encrypted media item and means for transmitting a key for decrypting the encrypted media item in response to the user device being authorized to decrypt the encrypted media item.
- In one implementation, the second communication protocol is Short Message Service (SMS) messaging, Multimedia Message Service (MMS) messaging, or voice and data cellular networking. In one implementation, key, or a response containing the key, is transmitted by the media server to the user device via at least one of SMS, messaging or MMS messaging, or voice and data cellular networking. In one implementation, the apparatus includes means for creating mapping data that associates the key with the encrypted media item prior to transmitting the encrypted media item to the satellite broadcast system, and means for storing the mapping data locally at the media server. In one implementation, the key is an asymmetric key.
- In one implementation, the apparatus includes means for determining whether the user device is authorized to decrypt the media item by extracting a media identifier and geographic data of the user device from the request, means for determining whether the media identifier and the geographic data satisfy one or more criteria, and means for determining that the user device is authorized to decrypt the encrypted media item if the media identifier and the geographic data satisfy the one or more criteria.
- In one implementation, the apparatus includes means for selecting the media item based on at least one of a geographic location for consuming the media item, a device platform for consuming the media item, an operating system for consuming the media item, a ranking of the media item, a rating of the media item, a duration of the media item, a language associated with the media item, or content of the media item.
- In an aspect of the present disclosure, an apparatus includes means for establishing a direct connection with a device of a satellite broadcast system. The device of the satellite broadcast system stores encrypted media items provided by a media server. In one implementation, the apparatus includes means for receiving, via the direct connection, the encrypted media items from the device of the satellite broadcast system, means for sending, via a low-bandwidth communication connection between the apparatus and the media server, a request to the media server for authorization to decrypt the encrypted media items, and means for receiving, via the low-bandwidth communication connection, a response from the media server indicating whether the apparatus is authorized to decrypt the encrypted media items.
- In one implementation, the apparatus includes means for determining a subset of the encrypted media items to receive from the device of the satellite broadcast system. The means for determining is based on user input indicating a selection of the subset of the encrypted online media items. In one implementation, the device is a satellite set top box. In one implementation, the direct connection between the apparatus and the satellite set top box is a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, a Bluetooth® connection, or an IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi®) connection.

FIG. 6 depicts a block diagram of an example computing device operating in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. - Aspects and implementations of the present disclosure are directed to technology for sharing online media content with users via a satellite broadcast system. Online content is content shared via an Internet connection. Traditional content sharing technology may require a network connection with a large bandwidth in order to stream online content. In many emerging markets, the capabilities of the computing networks are limited and they often have low bandwidth, are unreliable, or unavailable. Some conventional content sharing systems enable content sharing but often provide unrestricted reproduction and access to the shared content, which may be undesirable for the content creators and/or providers and may be challenging to monitor for enforcement of copyright protection.
- Aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by providing a content sharing system that allows users to share and watch online media content without requiring a network connection with a large bandwidth (via a satellite broadcast system, rather than Internet connections) while still allowing a content creator and/or content provider to control distribution of the shared online media content. In particular, the content sharing system may provide a centralized access control for media content distributed to the user devices. The centralized access control can be enabled using one or more digital rights management (DRM) schemes to control the use, modification, and distribution of media content. A content creator and/or content provider can therefore achieve wide distribution of their content even in regions where high speed data infrastructure and/or mobile network infrastructure is poor and/or expensive, while still retaining the ability to control distribution and protect copyright of copyright media content.
- In one example, the content sharing system may include a media server that provides media items (e.g., videos, audio) to the satellite broadcast system, and user devices can download the media items from the satellite broadcast system. The user devices may be mobile devices such as phones, tablets, or laptops and may be capable of storing the media items locally. Each user device may download the media items from the satellite broadcast system using a direct connection with the satellite broadcast system.
- The media server can encrypt the media items, create a data package that includes the encrypted media items, and send the data package to a satellite broadcast system. The media server can send the data package to a satellite broadcast system via a high-speed Internet connection. The user device can establish a direct connection with a satellite device (e.g., satellite set top box) of the satellite broadcast system, and download one or more of the encrypted media items in the data package from the satellite device.
- The direct connection between the user device and the satellite device (e.g., set top box) can be, for example, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, a Bluetooth® connection, or an IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi®) connection. The user device can download the encrypted media items via the direct connection to the satellite device, rather than having to establish a high-speed Internet connection with the media server. The download of the one or more encrypted media items via the direction connection between the user device and the satellite device is performed as a low-bandwidth data transfer.
- The encrypted media items downloaded to the user device are stored locally but the user device is restricted from playing the encrypted media items until the user device receives authorization from the media server. The user device can send a request to the media server for authorization to decrypt the encrypted media items. The user device can establish a low-bandwidth communication connection, using a communication protocol such as Short Message Service (SMS) messaging, with the media server for sending the request to the media server. The user device can use SMS messaging to communicate with the media server, rather than having to establish a high-speed Internet connection with the media server. The media server can then perform an authorization check to ensure that the user device is authorized to view the media item. The media server can respond, via the low-bandwidth communication, to the user device with one or more keys to enable the user device to decrypt and play the one or more corresponding media items.
- The technology disclosed herein is advantageous because it enhances media item sharing by utilizing a direct connection between the satellite broadcast system and user devices that may have limited or no Internet access, and also providing a central mechanism to manage and monitor access to the shared media items. The technology may decrease the amount of bandwidth necessary to share media items, which may be beneficial to the media server, intermediate networking infrastructure (e.g., Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and user devices and may be particularly beneficial in emerging markets. In the past, each of the user devices typically had to access the media item from the media server via a high-speed Internet connection. In contrast, the technology of the present disclosure allows users to access the media item from a satellite broadcast system and only have to contact the media server to receive authorization to view the media item. Such an authorization is received via a low-bandwidth connection because the amount of network traffic required to obtain the authorization from the media server may be orders of magnitude less than the traditional amount of network traffic or bandwidth required to stream or download the media item directly from the media server.
- Implementations of the present disclosure often reference videos for simplicity and brevity. However, the teachings of the present disclosure are applied to media items generally and can be applied to various types of content, including for example, video, audio, text, images, program instructions, etc.
-
FIG. 1 illustratesexample system architecture 100, in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure. Thesystem architecture 100 includes one or more media servers (e.g., media server 120), one or more user devices (e.g., user device 140), one or more satellite broadcast systems (e.g., satellite broadcast system 101), networks (e.g.,network 115, network 150), and one or more data stores (e.g., data store 160). -
Media server 120 may host content, such asmedia items 127 and supplemental media items 129. For brevity and simplicity, onemedia item 127 may be used as an example throughout this document.Media items 127 and supplemental media items 129 may be digital content chosen by a user, digital content made available by a user, digital content uploaded by a user, digital content chosen by a content provider, digital content chosen by a broadcaster, etc. Examples ofmedia items 127 and supplemental media items 129 include, and are not limited to, digital video, digital movies, digital photos, digital music, website content, social media updates, electronic books (ebooks), electronic magazines, digital newspapers, digital audio books, electronic journals, web blogs, real simple syndication (RSS) feeds, electronic comic books, software applications, etc. -
Media server 120 may be one or more computing devices (such as a rackmount server, a router computer, a server computer, a personal computer, a mainframe computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, etc.), data stores (e.g., hard disks, memories, databases), networks, software components, and/or hardware components that may be used to provide a user with access tomedia items 127 and/or provide themedia items 127 to the user via asatellite broadcast system 101.Media server 120 may be a part of a content sharing platform that may allow users to consume, upload, share, search for, approve of ("like"), dislike, and/or comment onmedia items 127. The content sharing platform may also include a website (e.g., a webpage) or application back-end software that may be used to provide a user with access to themedia items 127. - The
satellite broadcast system 101 can sharemedia items 127, provided by themedia server 120, to users of user devices (e.g., user device 140). For brevity and simplicity, one user device 140 may be used as an example throughout this document. The user device 140 can include anapplication 148 for playing themedia items 127. User devices (e.g., user device 140) may each include computing devices such as personal computers (PCs), laptops, mobile phones, smart phones, tablet computers, netbook computers, network-connected televisions, etc. In some implementations, a user device 140 may also be referred to as a "client device." -
Media items 127 and supplemental media items 129 may be consumed via the Internet and/or via a mobile device application (e.g., application 148). For brevity and simplicity, an online video (also hereinafter referred to as a video) may be used as an example of amedia item 127 throughout this document. As used herein, "media," media item," "online media item," "digital media," "digital media item," "content," and "content item" can include an electronic file that can be executed or loaded using software, firmware or hardware configured to present the digital media item to an entity. In one implementation, the content sharing platform may store themedia items 127 using thedata store 160. In one example,media item 127 may be a video identified by a user of user device 140 and supplemental media item 129 may be an advertisement selected bymedia server 120 to be presented before, during or after presentingmedia item 127 on one or more of the user devices (e.g., user device 140). -
Data store 160 can be a memory (e.g., random access memory), a drive (e.g., a hard drive, a flash drive), a database system, or another type of component or device capable of storing data.Data store 160 can include multiple storage components (e.g., multiple drives or multiple databases) that may span multiple computing devices (e.g., multiple server computers).Data store 160 can include a media cache that stores copies ofmedia items 127 that are received from themedia server 120. - The
media server 120 can include asatellite distribution component 123 for communicating with thesatellite broadcast system 101. Thesatellite distribution component 123 can select a subset ofmedia items 127 that are to be provided to users via thesatellite broadcast system 101. The selection of the subset ofmedia items 127 is described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 2 . The subset ofmedia items 127 can be selected, for example, based on geography of where the subset ofmedia items 127 may be played, and/or a popularity ranking of the subset ofmedia items 127. For example, thesatellite distribution component 123 may select a subset being the current 50 most popular media items 127 (e.g., videos, audio, etc.). - The
media server 120 can include acontrol access component 125 for implementing and enforcing digital rights management (DRM) of themedia items 127. Thecontrol access component 125 can control which user devices (e.g., user device 140) can play themedia items 127. Thecontrol access component 125 can encrypt themedia items 127 that are to be provided to users via thesatellite broadcast system 101 to limit the playback of themedia items 127 only to those user devices that are authorized to play themedia items 127, as described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 2 . - The
satellite distribution component 123 can transmit and/or create one or more group identifiers (IDs) and can associate one or more group IDs with each of themedia items 127 in the selected subset ofmedia items 127. The group IDs can be based on attributes of the media items, such as, for example, language, type (e.g., music videos, sports videos, etc.) of content of themedia items 127, ratings (e.g., Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating, TV Parental Guidelines ratings, user ratings, critics ratings, etc.) of the media items, etc. For example, there may be a group identifier for a particular language (e.g., Tamil) andsatellite distribution component 123 can associate the particular language group identifier withmedia items 127 that are in the particular language. - The
satellite distribution component 123 can transmit and/or create metadata for each of themedia items 127 in the selected subset ofmedia items 127, andschedule data 153 for the selected subset ofmedia items 127, as described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 2 . The metadata for eachmedia item 127 can include, for example, a media item identifier, a description of themedia item 127, a creator or owner of themedia item 127, a thumbnail for themedia item 127, one or more ratings for themedia item 127, a duration for themedia item 127, statistics (e.g., number of likes, number of dislikes, number of shares, etc.) for themedia item 127, and/or a publish date for themedia item 127. For example, metadata for a video may include a title of the video as a media identifier, creator of the video, thumbnail for the video, and duration for the video. In one implementation, one or more group identifiers can be included as part of the metadata for each of themedia items 127 in the selected subset ofmedia items 127. Theschedule data 153 can include, for example, one or more satellite channels of thesatellite broadcast system 101 and one or more time slots which thesatellite broadcast system 101 is to use to provide the selected subset ofmedia items 127 to users. Theschedule data 153 can be configurable and/or user-defined (e.g., media server owner, media server system administrator). Theschedule data 153 can be based on, for example, content of the media items, rankings of the media items, ratings of the media items, preferences of creators/owners of the media items, etc. - The
satellite distribution component 123 can send theschedule data 153 and/or the metadata for the selectedmedia items 127 directly to the user device 140 vianetwork 150.Network 150 can include infrastructure to provide low-bandwidth communication connections between themedia server 120 and the user device 140. Low-bandwidth communication protocols can include, for example, Short Message Service (SMS) messaging, Multimedia Message Service (MMS) messaging, and voice and data cellular networking. For example, thesatellite distribution component 123 can send a SMS message that contains theschedule data 153 and/or the metadata for the selectedmedia items 127 to the user device 140. - The
satellite distribution component 123 can create adata package 121 that includes theencrypted media items 127 and the metadata for each of theencrypted media items 127. In one implementation, thedata package 121 includes theschedule data 153 for theencrypted media items 127. In another implementation, theschedule data 153 for theencrypted media items 127 is in a separate data package created by themedia server 120. - In one implementation, the
data package 121 includes one or more supplemental media items 129, for example selected by themedia server 120, to be presented in association with (e.g., before, during or after) the presentation ofmedia item 127 on one or more of the user devices (e.g., user device 140). In one implementation, the one or more supplemental media items 129 are encrypted by thecontrol access component 125. - In one implementation, the
data package 121 includes wrapped cryptography keys for theencrypted media items 127. In cryptography, a key is a piece of information (a parameter) that determines the functional output of a cryptographic algorithm. Key wrapping is a cryptographic construct that encapsulates key material and can be used to protect keys, for example, being transmitted over networks The wrapped cryptography key can be an encryption key that is protected using a key wrapping algorithm. Thecontrol access component 125 can wrap the encryption keys used to encrypt themedia items 127, as described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 3 . - The
satellite distribution component 123 can send thedata package 121 to one or more content servers (e.g., content server 103) of thesatellite broadcast system 101 vianetwork 115. In one implementation, thedata package 121 that is sent to thesatellite broadcast system 101 includesschedule data 153. In another implementation, thesatellite distribution component 123 sends an additional data package that includes theschedule data 153.Network 115 can be a high-speed Internet connection, such as a Fiber connection. Thecontent server 103 can send thedata package 121 to one or more head end servers (e.g., head end server 105) via one or more satellites and satellite dishes of thesatellite broadcast system 101. Thecontent server 103 can be an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server and can receive content from multiple content providers and multiple media servers. Thehead end server 105 can transmit thedata package 121 to one or more satellite devices, such as, satellite set top boxes (e.g., satellite set top box 110) of thesatellite broadcast system 101 via satellite communication links. - The
content server 103 andhead end server 105 can be one or more computing devices (such as a rackmount server, a router computer, a server computer, a personal computer, a mainframe computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, etc.), data stores (e.g., hard disks, memories, databases), networks, software components, and/or hardware components that may be used to provide thedata package 121 to one or more satellite devices. Thehead end server 105 can include hardware, such as, modulators, amplifiers, combiners, etc. for beaning content (e.g., data package 121) to satellite dishes of thesatellite broadcast system 101. - Satellite broadcasting is the distribution of multimedia content or broadcast signals over or through a satellite network. The broadcast signals can be sent via a satellite uplink (uploaded) to a geo-stationary artificial satellite for redistribution or retransmission to other predetermined geographic locations. Downlinks are then received by base stations such as small home satellite dishes or by base stations owned by the local cable network for redistribution to one on more satellite devices (e.g., satellite set top box 110).
- A satellite set top box (STB) 110 or set top unit (STU) is an information appliance device of the
satellite broadcast system 101. The satellite set top box 110 can contain a TV-tuner input and can display output to a display device 117 (e.g., television set). The satellite set top box 110 can store the data package(s) 121 that include theencrypted media items 127, metadata, and/orschedule data 153 in one or more local data stores (e.g., hard disk, cache memory) of the satellite set top box 110. - The user device 140 can include a
satellite interface component 145 that cooperates with (or is part of) anapplication 148 to enable a user to select one or more media items 127 (e.g., videos) for downloading from the satellite set top box 110. A user of the user device 140 can use theapplication 148 to select which of theencrypted media items 127 to download from the satellite set top box 110. Theapplication 148 can provide a user interface (UI) that displays information about themedia items 127 that are available for download. Theapplication 148 can extract information from theschedule data 153 and/or metadata received from themedia server 120 vianetwork 150, and populate and display the UI with the extracted information on the user device 140. For example, the UI may display the current 50 mostpopular media items 127 as being available for download, and the user may select to download only the top 10 mostpopular media items 127. - The user device 140 can be associated with one or more group identifiers. The user device 140 can be assigned one or more group identifiers based on, for example, attributes of the user device 140 and/or user (e.g., end-user) input. The attributes of the user device 140 can include, for example, language, region, and rating restrictions. The user input can include, for example, user preferences of type (e.g., music videos, sports videos, etc.) of content, preferred ratings (e.g., Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating, TV Parental Guidelines ratings, user ratings, critics ratings, etc.), language, etc. For example, the user device 140 can be associated with a group identifier for a particular language (e.g., Tamil). The one or more group IDs for the user device 140 can be stored in configuration data on a data store of the user device 140. In one implementation, the
application 148 assigns the one or more group IDs for the user device 140 to the user device 140, for example, as part of the installation of theapplication 148 on the user device 140. - In one implementation, the UI on the user device 140 can display the channel(s) and/or time slot(s) for the
media items 127 that are available for download. For example, the UI may indicate that a video titled "Summer Song" for "Rock-Band-XYZ" is available for download from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM Pacific Standard Time on satellite channel "1003". In one implementation, themedia items 127 that are available for download are themedia items 127 that have one or more group IDs that match the one or more group IDs of the user device 140. Theapplication 148 can determine whichmedia items 127 have group IDs that meet one or more group criteria for the user device 140. If the user device 140 is assigned multiple group IDs, the group criteria can specify whether the group IDs of themedia items 127 should match one or more the group IDs of the user device 140. For example, the user device 140 may be assigned the group ID for Tamil and the group ID for a "G" (general audience) rating, and the group criteria for the user device 140 may specify thatonly media items 127 that match both group IDS should be made available for download for the particular user device 140. In another example, the user device 140 may be assigned the group ID for Tamil, the group ID for a "G" rating, the group ID for a "PG" rating, and the group ID for a "R" rating. The group criteria for the user device 140 may specify thatonly media items 127 that match the group ID for Tamil and any of the group IDs for the ratings should be made available for download for the particular user device 140. - In another example, the user can use an input device 119 (e.g., a satellite set top box remote control) to select which of the
encrypted media items 127 to download from the satellite set top box 110. Theinput device 119 can establish a connection (e.g., infrared connection, Bluetooth® connection) with the satellite set top box 110. The satellite set top box 110 can display information about themedia items 127 that are available for download in a satellite UI presented on a display device 117 (e.g., television) that is coupled to the satellite set top box 110. In one implementation, the satellite set top box 110 receives the one or more group IDs of the user device 140 from the user device 140 and displays information about themedia items 127 that have one or more group IDs that match the one or more group IDs of the user device 140. The satellite set top box 110 can extract information from theschedule data 153 and/or metadata received from themedia server 120 vianetwork 115 and populate the satellite UI with the extracted information. The user may select, via theinput device 119, whichencrypted media items 127 to download. - The information displayed in the UI of the
application 148 on the user device 140 and in the satellite UI can include information for eachencrypted media item 127 that is available for download, such as, a title, a brief description, one or more ratings, a duration, statistics (e.g., number of views, number of likes, numbers of dislikes), reviews, and/or comments. - The user device 140 can establish a
direct connection 180 with the satellite set top box 110, and send data, via thedirect connection 180, indicating the selection of which of theencrypted media items 127 are to be downloaded for the user to the user device 140.Connection component 143 can establish the direct communication connection between the user device 140 and the satellite set top box 110. The connection between the satellite set top box 110 and the user device 140 can be based on any wireless or wired communication technology. The wireless communication technology can include Bluetooth®, Wi-Fi® (IEEE 802.11), infrared, ultrasonic or other technology. The wired communication may include universal serial bus (USB), or other wired connection. - The satellite set top box 110 can make the
encrypted media items 127 available for download at the schedule time slot(s) via the assigned satellite channel(s) according to theschedule data 153. Thesatellite broadcast system 101 can assign one or more satellite channels to one ormore media servers 120 of the content sharing platform. For example, themedia server 120 may be assigned satellite channel "1003". The satellite broadcast system 110 can assign themedia server 120 one or more time slot(s) of other satellite channels that are not assigned to themedia server 120. For example, the satellite channel "2223" may be assigned to a different content provider, but may have available time slot(s) that can be assigned to themedia server 120. - In one implementation, the
media server 120 designates one or more channels and/or one or more time(s) for sharing groups ofmedia items 127. The groups ofmedia items 127 can be based on attributes of the media items, such as, for example, language, type (e.g., music videos, sports videos, etc.) of content of themedia items 127, ratings (e.g., Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating, TV Parental Guidelines ratings, user ratings, critics ratings, etc.) of the media items, etc. For example, themedia server 120 may groupmedia items 127 that have ratings of TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, G, PG, and/or PG-13 as a subset ofmedia items 127, and may specify via theschedule data 153 that this particular subset ofmedia items 127 should be made available via a particular satellite channel that is assigned to themedia server 120 and/or to particular time slot(s) that are assigned to themedia server 120. In another example, themedia server 120 may groupmedia items 127 that are in a particular language (e.g., French), and may specify via theschedule data 153 that this particular subset ofmedia items 127 should be made available via the particular satellite channel(s) and/or time slot(s) that are assigned to themedia server 120. - The satellite set top box 110 can output, at the scheduled time(s) and on the specified satellite channel(s), generic data (e.g., blue screen image, black screen image, blank screen image, etc.) on the display device 117 (e.g., television), and concurrently send, via the
direct connection 180, the files for the selectedencrypted media items 127 to the user device 140. Data can be transmitted from the set top box 110 to the user device 140 using, for example, media transfer protocol (MTP). In one implementation, at the scheduled time(s), the satellite set top box 110 may be tuned to a satellite channel that is not specified in theschedule data 153 and is not assigned to themedia server 120, and the set top box 110 can display the appropriate content for that satellite channel, and concurrently send, via thedirect connection 180, the files for the selectedencrypted media items 127 to the user device 140. For example, at the schedule time(s), the satellite set top box 110 may be tuned to a satellite Sports Network channel that is not specified in theschedule data 153 and is not assigned to themedia server 120, and the set top box 110 can display the appropriate sports content for that Sports Network channel, and concurrently send in the background, via thedirect connection 180, the files for the selectedencrypted media items 127 to the user device 140. After the scheduled time slots(s), the satellite set top box 110 can remove the files pertaining to the subset ofencrypted media items 127 from its local data store (e.g., memory). The local data store is then available to store new files. - In one implementation, if satellite set top box 110 is directly connected to the user device 140 at the schedule time slot(s) and if no user selection of media items is made, the satellite set top box 110 can send all of the encrypted media items for the scheduled time slot(s), and the corresponding data (e.g., metadata, wrapped keys, etc.) to the user device 140. In another implementation, if satellite set top box 110 is directly connected to the user device 140 at the schedule time slot(s), the satellite set top box 110 can send all of the encrypted media items for the scheduled time slot(s), and the corresponding data (e.g., metadata, wrapped keys, etc.) to the user device 140. The
application 148 on the user device 140 can delete the encrypted media items, which the user did not select, and the corresponding data, from the user device 140. The user device 140 can store the downloadedencrypted media items 127 in a local data store (e.g., data store 149).Data store 149 may be a memory (e.g., random access memory), a drive (e.g., a hard drive, a flash drive), or another type of component or device capable of storing data.Data store 149 may include a media cache that stores copies of media items that are received from a device (e.g., satellite set top box 110) of thesatellite broadcast system 101. - In another example, the user device 140 may not have a
direct connection 180 at the scheduled time(s) for which the selectedencrypted media items 127 are being made available for download by the satellite set top box 110, and the satellite set top box 110 can store, at the scheduled time slot(s), the files for the selectedencrypted media items 127 in a data store on the satellite set top box 110. When the user device 140 establishes adirect connection 180 with the satellite set top box 110, the satellite set top box 110 can transfer, via thedirect connection 180, the files for the selectedencrypted media items 127 from the data store on the satellite set top box 110 to the user device 140. The satellite set top box 110 can then remove the files pertaining to the subset ofencrypted media items 127 from its local data store (e.g., memory), and the memory is then available for use. - The user device 140 is restricted from playing the downloaded
encrypted media items 127 until the user device 140 receives the decryption keys from themedia server 120. The user device 140 can include anauthorization component 147 that has functionality to enable the user device 140 to receive the decryption keys and decrypt anencrypted media item 127. Theauthorization component 147 can send arequest 152 to themedia server 120 for authorization to decrypt theencrypted media items 127. The request for authorization is described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 4 . The user device 140 can establish a low-bandwidth communication connection vianetwork 150 with themedia server 120 for sending the request to themedia server 120. - The
control access component 125 in themedia server 120 can prevent unauthorized access to themedia item 127. Thecontrol access component 125 can receive therequest 152 for authorization and perform an authorization check to determine whether the user device 140 is authorized to decrypt and view themedia items 127. The authorization check is described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 5 . If the user device 140 is authorized, thecontrol access component 125 can send aresponse 154, via the low-bandwidth communication connection, to the user device 140 with one or more decryption keys to enable the user device 140. - The
authorization component 147 in the user device 140 can then use the one or more decryption keys to decrypt themedia items 127, as described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 2 andFIG. 5 . The user device 140 can include a media viewer (e.g., application 148) that allows users to view decryptedmedia items 127. The media viewer may present images, videos, audio, web pages, documents, etc. The media viewer may render, display, and/or present the content of themedia items 127 to a user. The media viewer may also display an embedded media player. According to aspects of the disclosure, the media viewer may be a content sharing platform application for users to share, record, edit, and/or upload content to the content sharing platform. The media viewer may be provided to user device 140 bymedia server 120. For example, the media viewer may be a mobile application that is installed and executed on user device 140. - The
authorization component 147 can perform a data integrity check of the decryptedmedia items 127 prior to the decryptedmedia items 127 being played. For example, theauthorization component 147 can perform a checksum function using data of the frames of a decryptedmedia item 127 as input to verify the data integrity of the decryptedmedia item 127. In another example, theauthorization component 147 can perform a hash function using data of the frames of a decryptedmedia item 127 as input. The hash can be, for example, a Verifying Integrity of PERipherals (VIPER) hash. Data integrity is described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 4 . - In general, functions described in one implementation as being performed by the content sharing platform can also be performed on the user device 140 in other implementations, if appropriate. In addition, the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. The content sharing platform and
media server 120 can also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through appropriate application programming interfaces, and thus is not limited to use in websites. Although implementations of the disclosure are discussed in terms of a media server and a content sharing platform, implementations may also be generally applied to any type of social network providing digital content and connections between users. - In implementations of the disclosure, a "user" may be represented as a single individual. However, other implementations of the disclosure encompass a "user" being an entity controlled by a set of users and/or an automated source. For example, a set of individual users federated as a community in a social network may be considered a "user."
- In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether the content sharing platform collects user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the content sharing platform.

FIG. 2 depicts a flow diagram of amethod 200 for sharing online media content with users via a satellite broadcast system, in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure. Themethod 200 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one implementation, the method is performed by asatellite distribution component 123 and/or acontrol access component 125 in amedia server 120 ofFIG. 1 , while in some other implementations one or more blocks ofFIG. 2 may be performed by another machine. In one implementation, a processing device of a media server computing machine (e.g.,media server 120 inFIG. 1 ) performsmethod 200. - At
block 220, the processing device selects a media item to be provided for user consumption via a satellite broadcast system. The processing device can select more than one media item to be provided to one or more users via the satellite broadcast system. The processing device can select the media item based one or more factors, such as, a geographic location, a device platform for consuming the media item, an operating system for consuming the media item, rankings of the media item, language associated with the media item, duration of the media item, rating of the media item, and content of the media item. The processing device can be coupled to one or more platforms (e.g., a recommendation platform, a content sharing platform, a search platform, a social network platform, etc.) to receive data for determining which of the media item(s) to select for sharing with users via a satellite broadcast system. - The media item can be encrypted using an encryption key to generate an encrypted media item. The encryption of the media item is described in greater detail below in conjunction with
FIG. 3 . In one implementation, the processing device of the media server encrypts the media item. In another implementation, a processing device of a different server (e.g., encryption server) encrypts the media item. Atblock 230, the processing device transmits the encrypted media item to the satellite broadcast system via a first communication protocol. The first communication protocol can be a high-speed Internet protocol. An example of broadband technology that provides high-speed Internet access is Fiber networks. The processing device creates a data package that contains the encrypted media item and other information (e.g., metadata, schedule data, supplemental media items), and sends the data package to the satellite broadcast system, as described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 3 . The processing device can also send schedule data for the encrypted media item to the user device via a different network (e.g.,network 150 inFIG. 1 ) using a second communication protocol (e.g., SMS messaging, MMS messaging, and voice/audio and data cellular networking). - At
block 240, the processing device receives a request from a user device via a second communication protocol for authorization to decrypt the encrypted media item. The second communication protocol is a low bandwidth protocol, such as, for example, SMS messaging or MMS messaging, and voice/audio and data cellular networking. For example, the request can be received as a SMS message from the user device. - At
block 250, the processing device determines whether the user device is authorized to decrypt the encrypted media item. The processing device can make the determination based on one or more factors, such as, geographic locations for playing the media item, authorization by the owner to play the media item, device platform (e.g., mobile device, desktop device) for playing the media item, operating system of the device playing the media item, credentials of a user, or a combination of such, as described in greater detail below in conjunction withFIG. 5 . - At
block 260, the processing device transmits a key for decrypting the encrypted media item in response to the user device being authorized to decrypt the encrypted media item. The processing device can transmit the key to the user device via SMS, messaging or MMS messaging, and/or voice/audio and data cellular networking. For example, the processing device can send a SMS message that contains the key, and/or a MMS message that contain the key to the user device. In another example, the processing device can encode they key into audio data, and send the response as audio data to the user device over a voice call. -
FIG. 3 depicts a flow diagram of amethod 300 for providing a data package for sharing online media items with users via a satellite broadcast system, in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure. Themethod 300 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one implementation, the method is performed by asatellite distribution component 123 and/or acontrol access component 125 in amedia server 120 ofFIG. 1 , while in some other implementations one or more blocks ofFIG. 2 may be performed by another machine. In one implementation, a processing device of a media server computing machine (e.g.,media server 120 inFIG. 1 ) performsmethod 300. - At
block 302, the processing device encrypts a media item using an encryption key to generate an encrypted media item. The media item can be a file in a raw media format. For example, for video, the media item can be a file in a raw video file format. Examples of raw video file formats include, Apple QuickTime Movie (.MOV extension), Moving Pictures Expert Group 4 (MPEG4 extension, .MP4 extension), Audio Video Interleave (.AVI extension), and Windows Media Video (.WMV extension). For example, the media item may be for a video titled "Summer Song" for "Rock-Band-XYZ." The video may be in a raw AVI (Audio Video Interleave) video file format. - The processing device can generate an encryption key for the media item. The encryption key can include a piece of information that determines the functional output of a cryptographic function and can be used to encrypt the media item. The processing device can generate the encryption key using a random number generator, a pseudorandom number generator, a key derivation function, other mechanism, or a combination thereof. The processing device can seed the key generation using information of the media server, such as a media server identifier, a time stamp, an IP address, a MAC address, other information, or a combination thereof.
- The processing device can use the encryption key to encrypt the raw media file (e.g., raw video file) for the media item. For example, the processing device can use the encryption key to encrypt the raw AVI file for the "Summer Song" video. The processing device can use the encryption key to encrypt one or more media items. In one example, each media item may be encrypted using a different encryption key. In another example, multiple (e.g., all) media items can be encrypted using the same encryption key.
- In one implementation, the processing device encrypts the media item using a symmetric key cryptography system that uses a single shared key, such as, Data Encryption Standard (DES) or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). In other implementation, the processing device also or alternatively encrypts the media item using an asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography system that uses a pair of keys (e.g., public key and a private key), such as, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA).
- At
block 304, the processing device creates metadata for the encrypted media item. The metadata for the media item can include a media item identifier, a description of the media item, a creator or owner of the media item, a thumbnail for the media item, one or more ratings for the media item, a duration for the media item, statistics (e.g., number of likes, number of dislikes, number of shares, etc.) for the media item, and/or a publish date for the media item. The ratings can include, for example, film review aggregator ratings, MPAA film rating, TV Parental Guidelines ratings, or user ratings, or any combination of such. In one implementation, the processing device encrypts the metadata using the encryption key of the media item. - At
block 306, the processing device determines whether there is additional data for the media item. The additional data can be, for example, a wrapped cryptography key for the media item, one or more supplemental media items (e.g., advertisement content) for the media item, and/or schedule data for the media item. The processing device can make the determination based configuration data that is stored in a data store (e.g.,data store 160 inFIG. 1 ) that is coupled to the media server. The configuration data can be configurable and/or user-defined (e.g., system administrator defined). If there is no additional data for the media item, the processing device determines whether to encrypt another media item atblock 310. - If there is additional data for the media item, the processing device determines the additional data at
block 308. The processing device can create the additional data for the media item. For example, the processing device can wrap the encryption key using a media server key to create a wrapped cryptography key as the additional data for the media item. The media server key can be a public key that is generated by the media server. The processing device can use the media server key along with a key encapsulation mechanism to secure the encryption key. In one example, the processing device may use a symmetric key cryptography system to encrypt the media item and may use an asymmetric cryptography system to wrap the encryption key. As discussed above, the asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography system may be the same or similar to RSA - In another example, the processing device can determine advertisement data as the additional data for the media item at
block 308. The processing device can be coupled to a recommendation platform and/or a promotion platform that can provide the processing device with advertisement data for the media item. The advertisement data can include one or more digital images (e.g., JPEGS) and/or one or more audio clips to create an advertisement that can be presented before, during or after presenting the media item on one or more of the user devices (e.g., user device 140 inFIG. 1 ). - At
block 310, the processing device determines whether to encrypt another media item. The processing device can select a subset of the media items that are stored on the media server to encrypt for sharing with users via a satellite broadcast system. The processing device can select the subset of the media items based on one or more factors, such as, a geographic location for consuming the media items, a geographic location associated with the satellite device that provides the media items to users, a device platform for consuming the media items, an operating system for consuming the media items, content of the media item, language associated with the media item, duration of the media items, ratings of the media items, and rankings of the media item. For example, the processing device may select a subset being the current 20 most popular media items (e.g., videos, audio, etc.), and the processing device can determine whether all of the selected subset of media items have been encrypted. - If there is another media item in the subset of media items to be encrypted, the processing device returns to block 302 to encrypt the other media item using an encryption key to generate another encrypted media item. In one example, the processing device can use the same encryption key to encrypt multiple (e.g., all) media items of the subset of media items. In another example, each media item in the subset of media items may be encrypted using different encryption keys.
- If there is not another media item in the subset of media items to be encrypted, the processing device creates a data package for the encrypted media items at
block 312. The data package can be in a video file format, such as MP4. The processing device can encode the encrypted raw media files (e.g., encrypted raw video files) for the subset of media items in the data package (e.g., MP4 file). The processing device can also encode the metadata for the subset of media items in the data package. In one implementation, the processing device encodes the wrapped cryptography keys for the encrypted media items in the data package. In one implementation, the processing device encodes the advertisement data for the for the encrypted media items in the data package. - In one implementation, the processing device creates schedule data for the subset of media items and encodes the schedule data in the data package. The processing device can create the schedule data based on configuration data that is stored on a data store coupled to the media server. The schedule data can include, for example, one or more satellite channels of the satellite broadcast system, and one or more time slots for which the satellite broadcast system is to use to provide the selected subset of media items in the data package to users.
- At
block 314, the processing device determines whether to create state data for the encrypted media items. The state data can include a mapping of decryption keys that can be used for decrypting the encrypted media items to the media identifiers of the encrypted media items. The processing device can make the determination of whether to create state data based on configuration data stored in the data store that is coupled to the media server. In one implementation, the configuration data indicates that a wrapped cryptography key is being sent with the corresponding encrypted media item to the satellite broadcast system. When the wrapped cryptography keys are sent with the encrypted media items, the processing device does not create state data for the encrypted media items. - In another implementation, the configuration data indicates that no wrapped cryptography keys are being sent with the corresponding encrypted media items to the satellite broadcast system. When no wrapped cryptography keys are being sent with the encrypted media items, the processing device makes a determination to create state data for the encrypted media items.
- At
block 316, the processing device creates the state data for the encrypted media item(s). The state data can be a data structure that includes an entry for each encrypted media item. Each entry can map a media identifier for the encrypted media item to a decryption key for the encrypted media item, and/or an identifier for the cryptography algorithm that is used to encrypt the media item. The processing device can generate decryption keys for the corresponding encrypted media items and populate the data structure with the decryption keys. The processing device can store the state data in a data store that is coupled to the media server. - At block 318, the processing device transmits the data package to the satellite broadcast system. The data package can be a video format file (e.g., MP4 file) that contains the encrypted raw media file for each media item and metadata for each encrypted raw media file. In one implementation, the data package (e.g., MP4 file) contains a wrapped cryptography key for each encrypted raw media file. In one implementation, the data package contains schedule data for the encrypted raw media files. The data package can be for media items that are scheduled for a particular time period (e.g., a particular day, a particular week).
- The processing device can establish a high-speed Internet connection, such as a Fiber connection, with the satellite broadcast system, and sends the data package to the satellite broadcast system via the high-speed Internet connection. In one implementation, the processing device sends the data package to a content server in the satellite broadcast system. The processing device can also send schedule data for the encrypted media item(s) to the user device using a low-bandwidth communication protocol (e.g., SMS messaging, MMS messaging, and voice/audio and data cellular networking).
-
FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of amethod 400 for obtaining online media content via a satellite broadcast system, in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure. Themethod 400 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one implementation, the method is performed by aconnection component 143, asatellite interface component 145, and/or anauthorization component 147 in a user device 140 ofFIG. 1 . In one implementation, a processing device of a user device (e.g., user device 140 inFIG. 1 ) performsmethod 400. - At
block 410, the processing device establishes a direct connection with a device of a satellite broadcast system. The device can store encrypted media items that are provided by a media server (e.g.,media server 120 of a content sharing platform inFIG. 1 ). The device can be a satellite set top box (e.g., satellite set top box 110 inFIG. 1 ). The direct connection can be, for example, a USB connection, a Bluetooth® connection, or a Wi-Fi® connection. - At
block 420, the processing device receives, via the direct connection, the encrypted media items from the device of the satellite broadcast system. In one implementation, the processing device receives multiple (e.g., all) of the encrypted media items that are available for download. For example, there may be 20 encrypted media items (e.g., videos, audio, etc.) on the satellite device (e.g., satellite set top box) that are available for download, and the processing device may receive all 20 of the encrypted media items. The encrypted media items can be made available for download on particular satellite channel(s) at particular time slot(s) as specified by schedule data that is associated with the encrypted media items. - In another implementation, a user selects a subset of the encrypted media items to download, and the processing device can receive the selected subset of the encrypted media items, for example, based on user input specifying which encrypted medias item should be downloaded. For example, there may be 20 encrypted media items on the satellite device that are available for download, and the processing device may receive 10 encrypted media items.
- Prior to the processing device receiving the encrypted media items from the satellite device (e.g., satellite set top box), the satellite device can receive a command indicating which of the encrypted media items should be transferred to the user device. The satellite device can receive the command from an application (e.g.,
application 148 inFIG. 1 ) on the user device, or from an application on the satellite device. For example, the satellite device can run an application to display a satellite system UI, which includes information about the encrypted media items that are available for download, on a television set. A user can use an input device (e.g., remote control) (e.g.,input device 119 inFIG. 1 ) to select, from the satellite UI, which encrypted media items to download. The satellite device can receive a command that indicates which encrypted media items to download from the application on the satellite device. In another example, the user device runs an application (e.g.,application 148 inFIG. 1 ) to display a UI, which includes information about the encrypted media items that are available for download, on a display of the user device. The user can use an input device (e.g., touch screen, mouse, keyboard, selection device, etc.) to select encrypted media items to download. - The satellite device can receive, from the user device via a direct connection with the user device, a command that indicates which encrypted media items to download from the application on the user device. The command can include media identifiers, satellite channel identifiers, and/or time slot(s) for the selected encrypted media items to be transferred to the user device.
- In one implementation, the user device is coupled to the satellite device (e.g., satellite set top box), via a direct connection, at any point in time during the scheduled time slot(s) that the encrypted media items are made available for download, and the processing device receives the encrypted media items during the scheduled time slot(s).
- In another implementation, the user device is not coupled to the satellite device (e.g., satellite set top box) at any time during the scheduled time slot(s) that the encrypted media items are made available for download, and the satellite device stores the encrypted media items, which the user has selected for download, to a local data store on the satellite device. When user device is coupled to the satellite device (e.g., satellite set top box), via a direct connection, outside of the scheduled time slot(s), the processing device can download the encrypted media items from the data store on the satellite device.
- In one implementation, the satellite device stores one data package that contains multiple encrypted raw media files (e.g., encrypted raw video files). The data package can be file that is encoded in a digital multimedia container format, such as MPEG-4 (also known as MP4). The MP4 file can contain multiple encrypted raw media files, and the corresponding metadata for the encrypted raw media files. In one implementation, the data package includes a wrapped cryptography key for each encrypted media item. For example, the MP4 file contains 20 encrypted video files, the corresponding metadata for the 20 encrypted video files, and optionally, 20 wrapped cryptography keys. The satellite device can decode the data package (e.g., MP4 file) in order to access the individual encrypted raw media files (e.g., 20 encrypted video file), the corresponding metadata, and optionally, wrapped cryptography keys. The satellite device can select the subset of the encrypted raw media files (e.g., 20 encrypted video file), which the user has selected, the corresponding metadata, and optionally, wrapped cryptography keys, and send those particular files, metadata, and optionally, wrapped cryptography keys to the user device.
- In another implementation, the satellite device stores a data package (e.g., MP4 file) for each encrypted raw media file, and the satellite device sends multiple data packages (e.g., MP4 files) to the user. The processing device can receive a data package (e.g., MP4 file) for each of the selected encrypted media items. Each file (e.g., MP4 file) can contain an encrypted raw media (e.g., video, audio) file, metadata for the encrypted raw media file, and optionally, a wrapped cryptography key. For example, the data package (e.g., MP4 file) for a video titled "Summer Song" for "Rock-Band-XYZ" may include a raw video file, for example, in AVI video file format, for the video that is encrypted using, for example, a symmetric cryptography key, metadata that includes the title and name of the rock band, and optionally, a wrapped cryptography key.
- At
block 430, the processing device sends, via a low-bandwidth communication connection, a request to a media server for authorization to decrypt the encrypted media items. The low-bandwidth communication connection can be a Short Message Service (SMS) messaging connection. The request can be sent to the media server while the processing device is receiving the encrypted media items from the satellite device, after the processing device has received the encrypted media items, and/or when a user attempts to play a downloaded media item. - The request can include a small amount of data to be sent over the low-bandwidth communication connection. The processing device can send one or more requests to the media server. Each request can include data for one or more encrypted media items that have been downloaded to the user device. For example, the processing device can send a single request that includes data for all of the downloaded encrypted media items. In another example, the processing device can send a request for each encrypted media item as it is being downloaded. In another example, the processing device can send a request for an encrypted media item when a user attempts to play the encrypted media item.
- In one implementation, the processing device receives one or more data packages (e.g., MP4 files) that contain individual encrypted raw media files, the corresponding metadata, and optionally, the corresponding wrapped cryptography keys. The processing device can decode the downloaded data packages (e.g., MP4 files) to access individual encrypted raw media files, the corresponding metadata, and optionally, the corresponding wrapped cryptography keys. In another implementation, the processing device directly receives individual encrypted raw media files, the corresponding metadata, and optionally, the corresponding wrapped cryptography keys from the satellite device.
- The processing device then extracts the media identifiers from the metadata for the encrypted media items, and includes the media identifiers in the request that is sent to the media server. In one implementation, the processing device includes the corresponding wrapped cryptography keys in the request. The processing device can extract other information from user device, such as, geographic information for the user device, and can include the geographic information in the request. The user device can include global positioning system (GPS) receivers, and the processing device can obtain geographic information from the GPS receivers and include, for example, GPS data in the request.
- At
block 440, the processing device receives, via the low-bandwidth communication connection, a response from the media server indicating whether the user device is authorized to decrypt the encrypted media items. In one implementation, the response is received via the same type of low-bandwidth communication connection that was used to send the request. For example, the processing device may send the request as a SMS message, and the received response may also be a SMS message. In another implementation, the response is received via a different type of low-bandwidth communication connection than which the request was sent. For example, the processing device may send the request as a SMS message, and the received response may be a MMS message. - The response can indicate that the user device is authorized to decrypt one or more of the encrypted media items and/or is not authorized to decrypt one or more of the encrypted media items. The response is described in greater detail below in conjunction with
FIG. 5 . For example, the response may indicate that the user device is authorized to decrypt seven of the ten encrypted media items that were downloaded to the user device. The response can include a decryption key for each of the encrypted media items that the user device is authorized to decrypt. For example, the response may include seven decryption keys. The processing device can use a decryption key for a particular encrypted media item to decrypt the encrypted raw media file for the particular encrypted media item. If the response is received via a voice call, which includes decryption key encoded in audio, the processing device can decode the encoded audio of the encryption key into a byte key. - In one implementation, the response includes advertisement data for the media items. The advertisement data can include one or more digital images (e.g., JPEGS) and/or one or more audio clips to create an advertisement that can be presented before, during or after presenting the media items on the user device.
- Upon decrypting a media item, the processing device can perform a data integrity check of the decrypted media item prior to the decrypted media item being played. The processing device can perform a checksum function or a hash function (e.g., VIPER hash) using data of the frames of the decrypted media item as input to verify the data integrity of the decrypted media item. In one implementation, the metadata of the media item include checksum results or hash results for the frames. The processing device can perform the checksum functions and/or hash functions and compare the result(s) to the checksum results and/or hash results in the metadata. In one implementation, the metadata does not include the checksum results and/or hash results for the frames and the processing device receives the checksum results and/or hash results for the frames in the response received at
block 440. - In one implementation, if the data integrity check of the decrypted media item fails, the processing device deletes the decrypted media item from the user device. In one implementation, when the encrypted media item is available for download from a satellite device (e.g., satellite set top box), the processing device downloads the encrypted media item from the satellite device, decrypts the encrypted media item, and performs a data integrity check of the decrypted media item. In one implementation, the processing device can continue to delete the decrypted media item, download and decrypt the encrypted media item, and perform a data integrity check of the decrypted media item until the data integrity check fails or an attempt threshold is met. In one implementation, the processing device notifies a user if the data integrity check fails.

FIG. 5 depicts a flow diagram of amethod 500 for controlling access to online media content being shared with users via a satellite broadcast system, in accordance with one implementation of the present disclosure. Themethod 500 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one implementation, the method is performed by acontrol access component 125 in amedia server 120 ofFIG. 1 , while in some other implementations one or more blocks ofFIG. 5 may be performed by another machine. In one implementation, a processing device of a media server computing machine (e.g.,media server 120 inFIG. 1 ) performsmethod 500. - At
block 501, the processing device receives a request from a user device for authorization to decrypt one or more encrypted media items. Atblock 503, the processing device extracts data from the request and determines whether the extracted data satisfies one or more criteria atblock 505. The processing device can extract one or more media identifiers from the request and locate the one or more criteria associated with the media identifiers. The criteria for each media item can be stored as part of configuration data in a data store that is coupled to the processing device. The criteria can be specified by the owner of the media item. The criteria may be based the content of the media item, geographic locations, licensing constraints, and/or copyright constraints associated with the media item. The criteria can include, for example, geographic locations for playing the media item, authorization by the owner of the media item, device platform (e.g., mobile device, desktop device) for playing the media item, operating system of the device playing the media item, credentials of a user, or a combination of such. - For example, the media item owner of Video-XYZ may set a criterion that owner permission should be granted in order for the Video-XYZ to be decrypted and played. The processing device can create and store attribute data for the encrypted media items indicating whether the owners of each of the encrypted media items have granted permission for the corresponding encrypted media items to be decrypted and played. For example, the attribute data can have an entry for the media identifier for Video-XYZ indicating that the owner has granted permission for Video-XYZ to be decrypted. The media item owner of Video-XYZ may later decide that the media item (e.g., Video-XYZ) should not be decrypted and/or played because of a copyright violation, and the entry in the attribute data for Video-XYZ can be changed to indicate that the owner has does not grant permission for Video-XYZ to be decrypted.
- When the processing device receives the request, the processing device may extract the media item identifier for Video-XYZ that is included in the request, and may determine at
block 505, that the entry for media item identifier for Video-XYZ in the attribute data indicates that the owner has does not grant permission for Video-XYZ to be decrypted, and that the one or more criteria is not satisfied. If one or more criteria are not satisfied atblock 505, the processing device can send a response indicating that the user device is not authorized to decrypt the media item atblock 507. - In another example, the criteria for a media item may include one or more geographic regions that are approved for playing the media item. For example, the criteria for Video-XYZ may be that Video-XYZ can be played only in Australia. When the processing device receives the request, the processing device may extract geographic information (e.g., GPS data) that is included in the request, and may determine at
block 505, that the geographic information satisfies the criterion of being a geographic location in Australia. - If the one or more criteria are satisfied at
block 505, the processing device can determine a key for decrypting the media item atblock 509. In one implementation, the processing device determines the decryption key by extracting a wrapped cryptography key that is included in the request, and unwrapping the wrapped cryptography key. The unwrapped key can be used to decrypt the encrypted media item. Unwrapping the encryption key can involve a similar cryptographic system that was used to wrap the encryption key and may utilize a private key associated with the media server key. - In one implementation, there is no wrapped cryptography key in the request, and the processing device determines the decryption key by using the media identifier from the request to look up the decryption key in state data on the media server. The state data can have an entry corresponding to the media identifier, and the entry can include the decryption key and/or the cryptography algorithm used to encrypt the media item. If the entry does not include the decryption key, the processing device can determine the decryption key using the cryptography algorithm in the entry. For example, if the cryptography algorithm is a symmetric algorithm, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the processing device can determine that the decryption key may be the same key used to encrypt the media item, or a slightly transformed version of the key used to encrypt the media item. In another example, if the cryptography algorithm is an asymmetric algorithm that, for example used a public key to encrypt the media item, the processing device can determine that the decryption key is a corresponding private key.
- At
block 511, the processing device prepares a response that includes the key for decrypting the media item. Atblock 513, the processing device determines whether to send additional data to the user device. The additional data can be supplemental media items, such as advertisement data and/or recommended media items (e.g., recommended videos). The processing device can make the determination based on configuration data that specifies whether additional data should be sent for the encrypted media item, whether additional data was already sent with the encrypted media items as part of a data package sent to a satellite broadcast system, and/or whether additional data should be sent for the encrypted media item if the user device is authorized to decrypt the media item. - If additional data should not be sent to the user device, the processing device decides whether to determine authorization for another media item at
block 519. If additional data should be sent to the user device, the processing device determines the additional data atblock 515. The request from the user device can include geographic information (e.g., GPS data) of the user device, a device platform (e.g., mobile device, desktop device) identifier for user device, operating system of the user device, credentials of a user, or a combination of such. The processing device can determine advertisement data based on data in the request. The processing device can be coupled to a recommendation platform and/or a promotion platform that can provide the processing device with advertisement data for the media item based on data in the request. The advertisement data can include one or more digital images (e.g., JPEGS) and/or one or more audio clips to create an advertisement that can be presented before, during or after presenting the media item on one or more of the user device. In one implementation, the processing device encrypts the additional data. - At
block 517, the processing device adds the additional data for the encrypted media item to the response. Atblock 519, the processing device decides whether to determine authorization for another media item. The request received atblock 501 can be for authorization to decrypt multiple encrypted media items and can include multiple media identifiers. If the processing device should determine authorization for another encrypted media item, the processing device returns to block 503 to extract data for the other encrypted media item from the request. If the processing device does not determine authorization for another encrypted media item, the processing device sends the response, which includes the decryption key(s) and/or additional data for the encrypted media item(s), to the user device atblock 521. - The processing device can send the response via SMS messaging, MMS messaging, and/or voice/audio and data cellular networking. For example, the processing device can send one or more SMS messages that contain the key(s) and/or additional data (e.g., advertising data), and/or one or more MMS messages that contain the key(s) and/or additional data (e.g., advertising data) to the user device. In another example, the processing device can encode they key(s) and/or additional data (e.g., advertising data) into audio data, and send the response as audio data to the user device over a voice call.
