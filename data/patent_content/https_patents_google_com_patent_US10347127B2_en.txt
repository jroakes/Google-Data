Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in transporting passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself
- the present application discloses embodiments that relate to detection of nearby aggressive drivers and adjustment of driving modes.

For instance, the computing device may be configured to take into account that the motorcycle may split lanes, and not conform to the lanes marked on the road. Lane splitting may refer to a two-wheeled vehicle moving between lanes of vehicles that are proceeding in the same direction. Thus, a given motorcycle that is splitting lanes may be moving between lanes at a speed greater than surrounding traffic. In this instance, the computing device may be configured to modify the control strategy to achieve a more defensive driving behavior than if the second vehicle is a car, for example.
- a given control strategy may comprise a program or computer instructions that characterize actuators controlling the first vehicle (e.g., throttle, steering gear, brake, accelerator, or transmission shifter).
