Definitions
- the disclosure generally relates to personal badges for social networks.
- a social network can be an online system that provides a forum for geographically separated users to interact with one another, where those users have defined a relationship between one another. Users can control who can view their information by identifying particular relationships with other users, and can also find new user from the group of other people who are “friends” of their own friends. Social networks can be aimed at different types of social interaction, such as friendship and business networking.
- a user of a social network can have a profile page (e.g., a web page on the social network) that provides information about the user to other users of the social network.
- a profile can include information regarding a user's acquaintance relationships (e.g., friends, colleagues, schoolmates, etc.) on the social network.
- a badge is a digital image that may be earned or unlocked by checking into various venues. Once a badge is earned by a user, it will remain on that user's profile indefinitely. Operators of social networks are typically secretive about how to unlock badges. Some introductory badges may be earned as milestones in usage. Some badges are tied to venue “tags” and the badge earned depends on the tags applied to the venue. Other badges may be specific to a city, venue, event, or date. Some badges use identical icons, but are earned differently. Accordingly, a need exists in the art for an improved solution for badges for social networks.

- FIG. 9 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- a method for personal badges in a social network includes receiving a badge from a user, and determining a degree of similarity between the badge and one or more other badges owned by one or more users connected to the user. The method also includes, when the degree of similarity is less than a predetermined amount, crediting the badge to particular ones of the one or more users as designated by the user. Badges credited to a user may be displayed in a profile page of the user.
- Example embodiments of the present disclosure provide a solution for personal badges for social networks, wherein a user imports or creates a badge comprising a digital image and then credits the badge to users connected to the user, based on criteria set by the user.
- a badge may be displayed as a mark of office, membership, achievement, or activity. Badges are checked to determine whether they are too similar to existing badges being used by users connected to the user. Badges credited to a user may be displayed in a profile page of the user.
- a badge in a network of users connected to one another, may have one or more owners.
- An owner of a badge is a user that determines which users in the network of users are credited with the badge. This determination can be made either alone or in combination with other owners (“co-owners”) of the badge.
- a user can be an owner with respect to badges the user owns, and the same user can be credited with badges owned by other users.

- the determining comprises determining a degree of similarity between a content of the badge and content of the one or more other badges.
- the content of the badges may be compared using any known badge comparison method.
- an application is made to an owner of the particular one of the one or more other badges having a degree of similarity greater than the predetermined amount, to be a new owner of the particular one of the one or more other badges.
- the user may ask the owner of the similar badge make the user the new owner of the similar badge. If the current owner agrees to make the user the new owner of the similar badge, the user would determine who is credited with the similar badge in the future.
- an application is made to an owner of the particular one of the one or more other badges having a degree of similarity greater than the predetermined amount, to be a co-owner of the particular one of the one or more other badges.
- the user may ask the owner of the similar badge to be a co-owner of the similar badge. If the owner of the similar badge agrees to the co-ownership, both co-owners would determine who is credited with the similar badge. The determination may be made by one or more of the co-owners, either alone or in combination with other co-owners.
- a user may obtain a badge from a variety of sources.
- the badge is uploaded by the user.
- the uploaded image may be a picture taken or created by the user, or a picture taken or created by someone other than the user ( 110 ).

- the one or more criteria comprises having a particular hobby.
- a user that owns a badge may require that a user connected to the user have a gardening hobby before receiving a “gardener” badge owned by the user.
- a user that owns a badge may require that a user connected to the user have a woodworking hobby before receiving a “woodworking” badge owned by the user.
- the one or more criteria comprises an achievement associated with the badge.

- the method further comprises verifying that the one or more users connected to the user meet the one or more criteria. For example, when a user connected to the user requests an online game “high score” badge owned by the user, the user may verify that the user connected to the user obtained the minimum required score before crediting the badge to the user connected to the user. This may be done by searching an online “High Scores” list for the online game.

- the transportation tag recommendations system is exemplary of the present disclosure, but the present disclosure is not so limited.
- the various functions of the different modules and units can be combined or segregated as hardware and/or software stored on a computer-readable medium as above as modules in any manner, and can be used separately or in combination.
- implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof.
- ASICs application specific integrated circuits
- These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.
- the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor
- a keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- the systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”), a wide area network (“WAN”), peer-to-peer networks (having ad-hoc or static members), grid computing infrastructures, and the Internet.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- peer-to-peer networks having ad-hoc or static members
- grid computing infrastructures and the Internet.
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network.
- the relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
