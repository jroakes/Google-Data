Definitions
- the invention generally relates to manipulated articles. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and systems for identifying manipulated articles.
- a search engine or search engine program is a widely used mechanism for allowing users to search vast numbers of documents for information.
- Automated search engines locate websites by matching terms from a user entered search query to an indexed corpus of web pages.
- a conventional network search engine such as the GoogleTM search engine, returns a result set in response to the search query submitted by the user.
- the search engine performs the search based on a conventional search method. For example, one known method, described in an article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a document, such as a web page, based on the link structure of the web page.
- the processor 110 executes computer-executable program instructions stored in memory 108 .
- Such processors may include a microprocessor, an ASIC, and state machines.
- Such processors include, or may be in communication with, media, for example computer-readable media, which stores instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform the steps described herein.
- Embodiments of computer-readable media include, but are not limited to, an electronic, optical, magnetic, or other storage or transmission device capable of providing a processor, such as the processor 110 of client 102 a , with computer-readable instructions.
- server device 104 may comprise a single physical or logical server, and the cluster processor 130 and manipulation processor 132 may be located external to the search engine 120 .
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to explain the exemplary methods shown in FIG. 2 .
Abstract
Description
-
- The text of the document—whether the text appears to be normal English (or other language) text or text generated by a computer, such as containing a large number of keywords and not containing any sentences;
- Meta tags—whether the document has meta tags and whether the meta tags contain a large number of repeated keywords;
- Redirect—whether there is any script in the document such as JavaScript or HTML script that redirects a user to another document upon access; Similarly colored text and background—whether there is a large amount of text in the document that is the same color as the background of the document (Systems and methods for detecting hidden text and links in articles are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/726,483, filed Dec. 4, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by this reference);
- A large number of random links—whether the document contains a large number of unrelated links;
- History of the document—whether the text of the document, the link structure of the document, or the ownership of the website on which the document appears has changed recently (Systems and methods for using historical information in information retrieval are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/507,617, filed Sep. 30, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by this reference);
- Anchor text—whether there are a lot of links on the page and there is little or no text that is not anchor text.
