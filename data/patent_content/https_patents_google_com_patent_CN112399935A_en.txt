Description
Background
Vehicles (vehicles), such as automobiles, motorcycles, aircraft, and watercraft, may include one or more computing systems for performing functions and providing information, entertainment, assistance, and/or environmental control to occupants of the vehicle. For example, an automobile may include an entertainment system for playing music, video, or other content, a navigation system for providing information and navigation assistance, a temperature control system for heating or cooling the interior cabin of the vehicle, a control system for adjusting various components or features of the vehicle such as skylights or curtains, or an "infotainment system" that performs some or all of these aforementioned functions. Modern vehicles are equipped with an Infotainment Head Unit (IHU) having a display device (e.g., a presence-sensitive display) and a compute engine configured to execute an operating system and one or more applications.
Disclosure of Invention
In general, this application describes techniques for performing seamless authentication of a driver of a vehicle using an in-vehicle camera and a trusted mobile computing device communicatively coupled to the vehicle. The trusted mobile computing device may initially perform an enrollment process to capture data (e.g., facial feature data associated with captured images) of a known user's face in various different poses. The trusted device may assign each group of data of a known user to a respective one of the group of gesture buckets (tip buckets). The trusted device registers data by associating the data of the known user with a user account of the known user. The trusted device may then receive authentication data (e.g., calculated test data, such as calculated facial feature information) of an unknown user located inside the vehicle, where the authentication image is captured using an in-vehicle camera of the vehicle, and where the calculated data (e.g., feature data) is acquired from the image and used by the trusted device. The trusted device may authenticate the unknown user by comparing the authentication characteristics of the unknown user with the enrollment characteristics of the known user. Based on the comparison, the trusted device sends the results of the authentication process to the vehicle, which may then perform a login operation tailored to the authenticated user (e.g., based on the user's profile and/or account information) at the infotainment head unit of the vehicle. As a result, the various described techniques enable seamless and reliable authentication of the driver of the vehicle while also storing only enrollment feature data of authorized users on trusted devices to protect the security of such user data. In some cases, the trusted mobile computing device may send the enrollment feature data to the vehicle computing system, which may then be configured to perform authentication of the unknown user in the vehicle by comparing the authentication feature data of the unknown user to the received enrollment feature data of the known user.
In one example, a method comprises: establishing, by a mobile computing device, a connection with a vehicle computing system of a vehicle; and after establishing the connection, receiving, by the mobile computing device from the vehicle computing system, first feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a user of the vehicle, wherein the at least one image of the face of the user of the vehicle is captured by an image capture device connected to at least a portion of the vehicle. The example method further includes: determining, by the mobile computing device, a match between the user of the vehicle and a previously registered user of the mobile computing device based on a comparison between the first feature data and second feature data associated with at least one image of a face of the previously registered user; authenticating, by the mobile computing device, a user of the vehicle based on the matching; and transmitting, by the mobile computing device, authentication data for a user of the vehicle to the vehicle computing system, wherein the authentication data indicates the match.
In another example, a computer-readable storage medium stores instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor to: establishing a connection with a vehicle computing system of a vehicle; after establishing the connection, receiving, from the vehicle computing system, first feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a user of the vehicle, wherein the at least one image of the face of the user of the vehicle is captured by an image capture device connected to at least a portion of the vehicle; determining a match between the user of the vehicle and a previously registered user of the mobile computing device based on a comparison between the first feature data and second feature data associated with at least one image of a face of the previously registered user; authenticating a user of the vehicle based on the matching; and transmitting authentication data for a user of the vehicle to the vehicle computing system, wherein the authentication data indicates the match.
In another example, a mobile computing device includes at least one processor and at least one computer-readable storage device. The at least one computer-readable storage device stores instructions that, when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to: establishing a connection with a vehicle computing system of a vehicle; after establishing the connection, receiving, from the vehicle computing system, first feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a user of the vehicle, wherein the at least one image of the face of the user of the vehicle is captured by an image capture device connected to at least a portion of the vehicle; determining a match between the user of the vehicle and a previously registered user of the mobile computing device based on a comparison between the first feature data and second feature data associated with at least one image of a face of the previously registered user; authenticating a user of the vehicle based on the matching; and transmitting authentication data for a user of the vehicle to the vehicle computing system, wherein the authentication data indicates the match.
In another example, a method comprises: establishing, by a vehicle computing system of a vehicle, a connection with a mobile computing device, wherein the vehicle computing system comprises an infotainment head unit; determining, by the vehicle computing system, that a user is present inside the vehicle; and after determining that the user is present inside the vehicle, capturing, by the vehicle computing system, at least one image of the user's face using an image capture device connected to at least a portion of the vehicle. The example method further includes: determining, by a vehicle computing system, first feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a user; receiving, by the vehicle computing system, authentication data for the user, wherein the authentication data indicates a match between the user and a previously registered user based on a comparison between the first feature data and second feature data associated with at least one image of a face of the previously registered user; and accessing, by the vehicle computing system, the user account information to log the user into the infotainment head unit based on the authentication data for the user.
In another example, a computer-readable storage medium stores instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor to: establishing a connection with a mobile computing device; determining that a user is present inside a vehicle; after determining that the user is present inside the vehicle, capturing at least one image of the user's face using an image capture device connected to at least a portion of the vehicle; determining first feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a user; receiving authentication data for a user, wherein the authentication data indicates a match between the user and a previously registered user based on a comparison between the first feature data and second feature data associated with at least one image of the face of the previously registered user; and accessing user account information to log the user into the infotainment head unit based on the authentication data for the user.

Detailed Description
As described above, modern vehicles are equipped with an Infotainment Head Unit (IHU) having a display device (e.g., a presence-sensitive display) and a compute engine configured to execute an operating system and one or more applications. IHUs enable users to have a rich, personalized experience while driving, and applications provided by IHUs may enable users to listen to preferred music, browse emails, or pick favorite and/or frequented destinations, to name a few examples. A personalized experience for a user may be achieved by having a user-specific profile stored in a per-user account on the IHU.
In some cases, a key fob or external device (e.g., mobile phone) paired with the vehicle at the time the account was initially created may identify the user and log them into the IHU. However, the mere presence of a key fob or external device does not necessarily enable authentication of a particular, known or previously identified user of the vehicle. In some cases, the IHU may further prompt the user of a known, trusted device to enter a personal password or passcode on the user's device to enable explicit permission to log in to the IHU. However, this approach may potentially negate the user's desire for a seamless "enter and drive" experience.
Modern cars support different levels of autonomous driving. Some automobiles use an in-vehicle camera to monitor the driver's attention or to determine safe switching to and from autonomous mode. One approach is to utilize an in-vehicle camera to provide face-based recognition, similar to a face unlock feature on a personal mobile device. However, such face-based authentication processes will typically involve a registration step that may involve the user moving the user's face in a directional pattern so that the camera captures the user's face/biometric features in different poses. Each gesture may be associated with a different set of faces or other biometric features associated with the gesture. Performing the check-in directly in the vehicle using the vehicle's own camera may have certain challenges, as the user may not receive any visual or other indication from the vehicle to move the user's head while looking at the camera facing the driver.
Techniques are described for performing seamless authentication of a driver of a vehicle using an in-vehicle camera and a trusted mobile computing device communicatively coupled to the vehicle. These techniques may provide a reliable authentication mechanism and a seamless user experience while also ensuring user privacy of the facial image information. The trusted mobile computing device may initially perform an enrollment process to capture image data (e.g., calculated data such as facial feature data) of a known user's face in various different poses. As used herein, the term "image data" refers to data (e.g., feature data) that is calculated or otherwise determined from a captured image of, for example, a user's face. The trusted device may assign each set of image data of a known user to a respective one of the sets of gesture buckets. The trusted device registers the image data by associating the image data of the known user with a user account of the known user. The trusted device may then receive authentication image data (e.g., test image data, such as calculated facial feature data associated with the image) of an unknown user located inside the vehicle, where the authentication image was captured using an in-vehicle camera of the vehicle, and where the calculated image data (e.g., feature data) was acquired from the image and used by the trusted device. The trusted device may authenticate the unknown user by comparing the authentication characteristics of the unknown user with the enrollment characteristics of the known user. Based on the comparison, the trusted device sends the results of the authentication process to the vehicle, which may then perform a login operation at the IHU that is customized for the authenticated user (e.g., based on the user's profile and/or account information). In some cases, the trusted mobile computing device may send the enrollment feature data to a vehicle computing system, which may then be configured to perform authentication of the unknown user in the vehicle by comparing the authentication feature data of the unknown user to the received enrollment feature data of the known user.
In some examples, the computing device may determine a pose bucket associated with authentication feature data of a face of an unknown user, select feature data of the known user included in the same pose bucket as the pose bucket associated with the authentication feature data, and compare the selected feature data to the authentication feature data to determine whether the unknown user is a known user. As another example, the computing device may compare the authentication characteristic data to each of the set of enrollment characteristic data to determine which of the enrollment characteristic data of the known user is most similar to the authentication characteristic data of the unknown user. The computing device may determine whether the unknown user is a known user based on the most similar enrollment feature data of the known user, regardless of the gesture bucket.
By registering feature data included in several different pose buckets, the trusted device can more accurately perform facial recognition to authenticate unknown users, such as a current user of the vehicle. For example, registering feature data of known users included in several gesture buckets may increase the probability that a gesture bucket associated with authenticated feature data (e.g., gestures of an unknown user's face) is similar to a gesture bucket including registered feature data of known users (e.g., gestures of a known user in registered feature data). Increasing the probability that the pose of the authentication feature data of the unknown user is similar to the pose of the one or more enrollment feature data of the known user may reduce the probability of falsely rejecting the unknown user when the unknown user is actually a known, authorized user. In some cases, increasing the probability that the pose of the authentication feature data of the unknown user is similar to the pose of one or more enrollment feature data of known users may reduce the probability of erroneously accepting the unknown user when the unknown user is not a known, authorized user. In this manner, the computing device may more accurately authenticate the feature data of the unknown user regardless of the pose of the unknown user.
Fig. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a side view of an interior of a vehicle (e.g., an automobile) that includes an example vehicle computing system 100. FIG. 1 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the vehicle interior in addition to the components of the vehicle computing system 100. The vehicle computing system 100 is configured to detect and process user input.
The vehicle illustrated in fig. 1 may be an automobile, but aspects of the present disclosure may also be applicable to other types of vehicles, including trucks, motorcycles, airplanes, boats, trains, or other vehicles. In fig. 1, a driver 150 may generally occupy a seat 152. The seat 152 of the automobile may be positioned directly behind the steering wheel 154 of the vehicle such that an occupant of the seat 152 may physically control the steering wheel 154. The seat 152 is positioned beneath a canopy 158 in the vehicle illustrated in fig. 1. The steering wheel 154 may protrude from a dashboard 156. At least one front passenger seat may be positioned laterally adjacent to the seat 152. Other passenger seats may be positioned behind the seat 152 or in front of the seat 152.
Also shown in fig. 1 is a collection of devices, components, and modules that may all be included in a vehicle computing system 100. Vehicle computing system 100 may include, but is not limited to, presence-sensitive panel 102 and camera 104, as well as display 112 and control unit 106. One or more components of the vehicle computing system 100, such as the presence-sensitive panel 102 and the camera 104, may be directly and physically accessed by occupants seated in front driver and front passenger seats of the automobile, and may be located within the central console 101, near the central console 101, or on the central console 101. Such components may be within the reach of such occupants, and may also or alternatively be positioned in another passenger region of the vehicle, such as a rear seat. In some examples, the components may be within reach if the vehicle occupant does not need to change his or her seat position in order to reach the components with an extended arm. In other words, for many drivers, for example, the general positions of the steering wheel, gear selector and center console may be considered to be within the reach of the driver. As described further below, presence-sensitive panel 102 and camera 104 may serve as input devices for vehicle computing system 100. In some examples, one or more components of the vehicle computing system 100 (such as, in some examples, the display 112 and the control unit 106) that may not necessarily require physical access by an occupant of the vehicle may be positioned in or on the dashboard 156 or integrated into the dashboard 156. Such components may be integrated as part of a dashboard and/or console of a vehicle facing or in the vicinity of an occupant of the vehicle. As further described in this disclosure, the vehicle computing system 100 may include a display 112 that may output a graphical user interface. In some cases, additional cameras may be provided within the vehicle. For example, as shown in fig. 1, steering wheel 154 may include a camera 111 facing the user. In some cases, additional user-facing cameras may be positioned on other elements or components of the vehicle, such as on the dashboard 156, the headliner 158, the console 101 or panel 102, and/or the display 112. In some cases, the additional camera may be positioned on a rear view mirror or windshield of the vehicle. Generally, an in-vehicle camera (e.g., 104/111) may be mounted or otherwise connected to one or more portions or components of a vehicle.
Sitting on seat 152 is user 150. User 150 may be a driver, but user 150 may also be a passenger or other vehicle occupant. Although in fig. 1 user 150 is shown in a position that may often be considered a front seat (e.g., characterized by steering wheel 154 and instrument panel 156), user 150 may be seated in another position within the vehicle, including a rear seat.
In the example of fig. 1, user 150 may navigate or operate the vehicle, may interact with one or more components of the vehicle, and/or may provide input at an input device or presence-sensitive panel 102 or camera 104. In fig. 1, user 150 is shown interacting with presence-sensitive panel 102.
Presence-sensitive panel 102 may detect one or more taps, gestures, and/or other user inputs at the location of presence-sensitive panel 102. Such taps, gestures, or other inputs may come from one or more fingers of the user 150, or may come from a stylus or other device used by the user 150. Such input may be on the surface of presence-sensitive panel 102 or within a threshold distance of the surface of presence-sensitive panel 102. In the illustration of fig. 1, the threshold distance may extend above presence-sensitive panel 102 toward ceiling 158.
In response to detecting one or more inputs at the location of presence-sensitive panel 102, presence-sensitive panel 102 may output an indication of the inputs detected by presence-sensitive panel 102 to UI module 108. In some examples, UI module 108 may determine information about the input based on the indication of the input. Such information may, for example, indicate one or more lines, characters, or shapes corresponding to the input. UI module 108 may output information about the input to one or more application modules 110. In response to the information about the input, the one or more application modules 110 may determine an operation corresponding to the input and/or perform the operation. In some examples, and in response to information about the input, one or more application modules 110 may output information about the input, the operation, or the operation to be performed to display 112.
As described and illustrated, some or all of the vehicle computing system 100 may be housed within an instrument panel 156, which in some examples may be constructed of plastic, vinyl, rubber, aluminum, steel, or any other suitable material. The control unit 106 may include at least one processor and/or at least one memory device, and may be housed within an enclosure 105, which may also be constructed of plastic, vinyl, rubber, aluminum, steel, or any other suitable material. In some examples, the enclosure 105 may also be a rigid housing that encloses and otherwise protects one or more electronic components that provide functionality for the vehicle computing system 100. In some examples, the housing 105 may be affixed, mounted, or otherwise integrated with a dashboard or console of a vehicle.
The control unit 106 may provide an operating environment or platform for one or more modules, such as a combination of hardware, firmware, and software, as further illustrated in fig. 4. For example, the control unit 106 may include one or more processors and storage devices that may execute instructions and store data for one or more modules. Control unit 106 may also be operatively coupled to one or more other software and/or hardware components, including presence-sensitive panel 102, camera 104, and display 112, to control the components, configure the components, and/or communicate information with the components, to name a few example operations.
The display 112 may serve as an output device, such as a display device, using any one or more of the following: a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a dot matrix display, a Light Emitting Diode (LED) display, an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display, electronic ink, or similar monochrome or color display capable of outputting visible information to a user or vehicle occupant. In some examples, the display 112 may also function as an input device, such that it functions as both an input device and an output device. In such examples, display 112 may include an integrated presence-sensitive input device and display device. For example, display 112 may function as a presence-sensitive input device using a presence-sensitive screen, such as a resistive touch screen, a surface acoustic wave touch screen, a capacitive touch screen, a projected capacitance touch screen, a pressure-sensitive screen, an acoustic pulse recognition touch screen, or another presence-sensitive screen technology. Based on the user input, display 112 may present output to the user. For example, the display 112 may present various user interfaces of applications (e.g., navigation applications) executing at the vehicle computing system 100. An occupant of the vehicle, such as a driver, may provide user input to interact with one or more of such applications.
The vehicle computing system 100 may operate to assist, notify, entertain, or perform other tasks that require a user to interact with an occupant of the vehicle. In some examples, the vehicle computing system 100 may be referred to as an Infotainment Head Unit (IHU), an infotainment system, or a subcomponent thereof. For example, the vehicle computing system 100 may include one or more application modules 110 that perform functions or process information on behalf of one or more occupants of the vehicle. For example, the vehicle computing system 100 may provide a navigation service that provides directions to a destination. The vehicle computing system 100 may also provide information retrieval services that provide information in response to queries and/or as a preemptive aid or recommendation. The vehicle computing system 100 may also provide vehicle data about the vehicle, or multimedia such as audio or video. Only a few examples of the functionality that may be provided by the vehicle computing system 100 are mentioned, and the vehicle computing system 100 may provide many additional capabilities. In this and other ways, the vehicle computing system 100 may improve the driving or riding experience of one or more occupants of the vehicle.
In some examples, vehicle computing system 100 may be controlled by inputs detected by presence-sensitive panel 102, by inputs detected by camera 104, and/or by inputs detected by a combination of presence-sensitive panel 102 and camera 104. The vehicle computing system 100 may also be controlled by input detected by one or more additional input devices (e.g., a microphone, a physical button or switch, or other type of input device).
In some examples, presence-sensitive panel 102 may simply serve as an input device for touch input provided by user input that may occur directly and physically at presence-sensitive panel 102. For example, presence-sensitive panel 102 may function as a multi-touch presence-sensitive input device that uses presence-sensitive devices, such as a resistive touchscreen or touch panel, a surface acoustic wave touchscreen or touch panel, a capacitive touchscreen or touch panel, a projected capacitive touchscreen or touch panel, a pressure-sensitive screen or touch panel, an acoustic pulse recognition touchscreen or touch panel, or another presence-sensitive screen or touch panel technology. In some examples, presence-sensitive panel 102 may detect an object at and/or near or within range of a presence-sensitive component associated with presence-sensitive panel 102. As one example range, presence-sensitive panel 102 may detect an object, such as a finger or stylus within 2cm or less of presence-sensitive panel 102. Presence-sensitive panel 102 may determine the location (e.g., (x, y) coordinates) of the presence-sensitive input device that detected the object. In another example range, presence-sensitive panel 102 may detect objects that are 6 inches or less from presence-sensitive panel 102; other ranges are also possible. Presence-sensitive panel 102 may detect a user's finger, stylus, or the like using capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques.
In the example illustrated in fig. 1, presence-sensitive panel 102 may be positioned in center console 101 above camera 104, and center console 101 may be transparent to camera 104, such that camera 104 may capture images directly above presence-sensitive panel 102 even if presence-sensitive panel 102 physically obstructs the lens or field of view of camera 104. For example, camera 104 may be an infrared camera that captures images by receiving infrared light, and presence-sensitive panel 102 may be transparent to infrared light, such that camera 104 is capable of receiving infrared light originating between ceiling 158 and presence-sensitive panel 102. In other examples, camera 104 may not be positioned directly below presence-sensitive panel 102, and camera 104 may be positioned elsewhere within the vehicle. For example, as shown in fig. 1, steering wheel 154 may include a camera 111 facing the user. In some cases, additional user-facing cameras may be positioned on other elements or components of the vehicle, such as on the dashboard 156, the headliner 158, the console 101 or panel 102, and/or the display 112.
In some examples, presence-sensitive panel 102 may function as both an input device and an output device. In such examples, presence-sensitive panel 102 may include an integrated presence-sensitive input device and display device, and may be any one or more of the following: a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a dot matrix display, a Light Emitting Diode (LED) display, an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display, electronic ink, or similar monochrome or color display capable of outputting visible information to a user or vehicle occupant. In other examples where presence-sensitive panel 102 includes both input device and output device functionality, presence-sensitive panel 102 may be implemented by two separate components: a presence-sensitive input device for receiving input and a display device for providing output. In examples where presence-sensitive panel 102 includes both input device and output device functionality, presence-sensitive panel 102 may still be positioned in central console 101 above camera 104, and central console 101 may still be transparent to camera 104, such that camera 104, even if positioned below presence-sensitive panel 102, may capture images directly above presence-sensitive panel 102.
The camera 104 may be configured to capture the movement of an occupant, such as a driver, of the vehicle as the occupant moves an arm, wrist, hand, stylus, and/or finger as he or she gestures in the field of view, and may be configured to capture an image of the face of the user 150.
As described above, the vehicle computing system 100 may include a User Interface (UI) module 108 and an application module 110. The UI module 108 and the application module 110 may perform the operations described herein using software, hardware, firmware, or a mixture of both hardware and software, as well as firmware that resides in the vehicle computing system 100 and is executed by the vehicle computing system 100 or at one or more other remote computing devices. Thus, UI module 108 and application module 110 may be implemented as hardware, software, and/or a combination of hardware and software. The vehicle computing system 100 may execute the UI module 108, the application module 110, or one or more other modules as or within a virtual machine executing on the underlying hardware. UI module 108 and application module 110 may be implemented in various ways. For example, UI module 108 and application module 110 may be implemented as downloadable or pre-installed applications or "apps". In another example, UI module 108 and application module 110 may be implemented as part of an operating system of vehicle computing system 100.
The application module 110 may include functionality to perform any of a variety of operations on the vehicle computing system 100. For example, the application modules 110 may include a navigation application, a weather application, a phone dialer application, an information retrieval application, a multimedia application, a vehicle information application, an email application, a text messaging application, an instant messaging application, a social networking application, a weather application, a stock market application, an emergency alert application, a sports application, to name a few. In general, the vehicle computing system 100, whether through the application module 110 or otherwise, may be configured to perform operations including operations related to: climate control systems (e.g., heating and air conditioning), audio or infotainment systems, seats, windows, sun shades or windshield wipers, cruise control, in-cabin display systems, steering wheel controls, headrests, armrests, side or rear view mirrors, crash sensors. Such operations may be controlled by one or more application modules 110, or may be controlled by other systems within the vehicle. In some examples, such operations may be limited to non-safety features of the vehicle. In other examples, such operations may include one or more features of the vehicle that may be considered safety-related (e.g., turning on turn lights, adjusting mirrors, adjusting or tightening/breaking seatbelts, adjusting cruise control features, accelerating, braking).
Although shown as being operable within the control unit 106 of the vehicle computing system 100, one or more of the application modules 110 may be operable by a remote computing device (e.g., mobile computing device 170) communicatively coupled to the vehicle computing system 100. In such examples, an application module executing at the remote computing device may cause the remote computing device to transmit the content and intent information using any suitable form of data communication (e.g., wired or wireless network, short-range wireless communication such as near field communication or bluetooth, etc.). In some examples, the remote computing device may be a computing device separate from the computing devices included in the vehicle computing system 100. For example, the remote computing device may be operatively coupled to the vehicle computing system 100 through a network. Examples of remote computing devices may include, but are not limited to, servers, smart phones, tablet computing devices, smart watches, and desktop computers. In some examples, the remote computing device may or may not be an integrated component of the vehicle computing system 100. As shown in fig. 1, one such example remote device is a mobile computing device 170, which mobile computing device 170 may include a display device 172 and one or more image capture devices 173, and may execute one or more applications 174. Examples of mobile computing device 170 may include, but are not limited to, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, a portable gaming device, a portable media player, an electronic book reader, a wearable device (e.g., a watch, a wrist-worn computing device, a head-worn computing device), or other type of mobile computing device. The mobile computing device 170 may be or include one or more processors. Fig. 1 also illustrates a mobile, wearable device 107 (e.g., a smart watch) that is worn by the user 150 and that may be communicatively coupled (e.g., via one or more wireless connections) to the mobile computing device 170 and/or the system 100. IHU system 100 may communicate with wearable device 107 and/or mobile computing device 170 using a wireless communication protocol (e.g., bluetooth, WIFI, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)). When the mobile computing device 170 and/or the wearable device 107 is mated with the IHU system 100, such device may be identified as a trusted device with respect to the IHU system 100 and assigned a unique identifier by the IHU system 100. This trusted device and its corresponding unique identifier are associated by the IHU system 100 with the user 150 of the vehicle and any profile and/or account information of the user 150.
The UI module 108 of the vehicle computing system 100 may also receive, from the camera 104, one or more indications of user input detected by the camera 104. Generally, each time camera 104 detects a user gesture or movement, UI module 108 may receive an indication of or information about the user input from camera 104. The UI module 108 may aggregate the information received from the cameras 104 into a set of one or more events, such as a sequence of movement or gesture events. Each gesture event in the sequence may include data or components representing parameters characterizing the presence, gesture, and/or movement captured by the camera 104 within the field of view (e.g., when, where in three-dimensional space, direction of origin, direction in three-dimensional space, hand or arm orientation or pose). Each gesture event in the sequence may include a location component corresponding to a three-dimensional location within the field of view, a time component related to when the camera 104 detected a user input within the three-dimensional space, an action component related to what type of gesture was made, and/or one or more images captured by the camera 104.
Additionally, in some examples, the arrangement and/or placement of presence-sensitive panel 102 and camera 104 within the vehicle may provide an ergonomic and comfortable way for a driver (or other vehicle occupant) to interact with vehicle computing system 100. While presence-sensitive panel 102 and camera 104 may detect different types of inputs, the positioning of presence-sensitive panel 102 and camera 104 in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure may be such that inputs detected by presence-sensitive panel 102 may be perceived by vehicle occupants as a natural extension of inputs detected by camera 104. Similarly, input detected by camera 104 may be perceived by the occupant as a natural extension of input detected by presence-sensitive panel 102. In other words, such a system may provide a particularly natural or easy user interface for use by vehicle occupants. In some cases, vehicle occupants may find interaction with the vehicle computing system 100 relatively instinctive.
As described further below, according to various examples, a mobile computing device (e.g., mobile computing device 170, wearable device 107) may establish a connection with the vehicle computing system 100 of the vehicle illustrated in fig. 1. After establishing the connection, the mobile computing device may receive, from the vehicle computing system 100, first feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a user 150 of the vehicle. At least one image of the face of the user 150 of the vehicle is captured by an image capture device (e.g., camera 104/111) connected to at least a portion of the vehicle. The mobile computing device may determine a match between the user of the vehicle and a previously registered user of the mobile computing device based on a comparison between the first feature data and second feature data associated with at least one image of a face of the previously registered user, as further described below with reference to fig. 3. The mobile computing device authenticates the user 150 of the vehicle based on the match. The mobile computing device sends authentication data for the user 150 of the vehicle to the vehicle computing system 100, where the authentication data indicates the match.
According to various examples, the vehicle computing system 100 may establish a connection with a mobile computing device (e.g., mobile computing device 170, wearable device 107), where the vehicle computing system includes an infotainment head unit, and determine that a user is present inside the vehicle. After determining that the user is present inside the vehicle, the vehicle computing system 100 may capture at least one image of the user's face using an image capture device (e.g., camera 104/111) connected to at least a portion of the vehicle and determine first feature data associated with the at least one image of the user's face. The vehicle computing system 100 may receive authentication data for a user, where the authentication data indicates a match between the user and a previously registered user based on a comparison between the first feature data and second feature data associated with at least one image of a face of the previously registered user. The vehicle computing system 100 may then access user account information based on the authentication data for the user to log the user into the infotainment head unit.
In some cases, the vehicle computing system 100 may send first feature data associated with at least one image of the user's face to the mobile computing device. After sending the first characteristic data, the vehicle computing system 100 receives authentication data for the user from the mobile computing device.
In other alternative cases, the trusted mobile computing device may send the enrollment feature data to the vehicle computing system 100, which the vehicle computing system 100 may then be configured to perform authentication of the unknown user in the vehicle by comparing the authentication feature data of the unknown user to the received enrollment feature data of known users. In these cases, the vehicle computing system 100 receives second feature data associated with at least one image of a previously registered user's face from the mobile computing device and compares the first feature data and the second feature data. The vehicle computing system 100 then determines a match between the user and the previously registered user based on the comparison, wherein the authentication data includes an indication of the match.
Throughout this disclosure, examples are described in which a computing device and/or computing system analyzes information (e.g., facial image information, etc.) associated with the computing device and a user of the computing device only when the computing device receives permission from the user of the computing device to analyze the information. For example, in the scenario discussed below, before a computing device or computing system is able to collect or can make use of information associated with a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to provide input to control whether programs or features of the computing device and/or computing system can collect and make use of user information (e.g., information about the user's current location, current speed, etc.) or to specify whether and/or how the device and/or system can receive content that may be relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used by the computing device and/or computing system, such that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that personally identifiable information cannot be determined about the user, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized (such as to a city, zip code, or state level) if location information is obtained such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may control how information about the user is collected and used by the computing device and computing system.
Fig. 2 is a conceptual diagram illustrating further details of the interior of a vehicle in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. In fig. 2, the portion of steering wheel 154 from fig. 1 is shown, and a finger of user 150 is interacting with panel 102 of console 101. In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure, camera 104 has obtained facial images of user 150 and provided information associated with these images to mobile computing device 170. The mobile computing device 170 has authenticated the user 150 based on a comparison of the received facial feature data with authorized, stored facial feature data of known users stored by the mobile computing device 170 to identify a match with the stored facial feature data of the user 150. The mobile computing device 170 sends authentication data for the user 150 to the system 100. The system 100 may send feature data to the mobile computing device 170, the mobile computing device 170 including actual image information, or in various examples, feature data (e.g., feature vector data) for various features of an image of the user 150 captured by the image capture device 173.
In some examples, such authentication data may include a unique identifier associated with the user 150 and/or the mobile computing device 170. The system 100 may use such received authentication data to access user profiles, user preferences, login credentials, and/or account data for the user 150 stored in the system 100 (e.g., for logging the user 150 into the IHU system 100). The system 100 may then display the personalized or customized data display 112 of the system 100 for the user 150 based on the accessed information (e.g., preferences) specific to the user 150. Such personalization information may include user interface elements 208 and 204. The cursor 206 may overlap one of the user interface elements 204. When cursor 206 is over one of user interface elements 204, presence-sensitive panel 102 may detect one or more taps or inputs at presence-sensitive panel 102, and based on this input, system 100 may determine that the input corresponds to a selection of user interface element 204 that is overlapped by cursor 206.
In some examples, display 112 may be a presence-sensitive panel that operates as both an input device and an output device. In such an example, display 112 may detect one or more inputs at or near the location on display 112 where display 112 presents user interface element 204. The system 100 may identify, based on the input, a selected user interface element 204 corresponding to the input. In response to the input selecting user interface element 204, system 100 may perform operations that may include displaying information or updating a graphical user interface at display 112. In some examples where presence-sensitive panel 102 also serves as a display, computing device 200 may additionally or alternatively display information at presence-sensitive panel 102 or update a graphical user interface displayed at presence-sensitive panel 102.
The display 112 of the IHU system 100 may be configured to display personalized or customized information for any particular user authenticated by a mobile computing device 170 communicatively coupled to the system 100. Thus, if a variety of different authorized users, including user 150, use the vehicle, display 112 may be configured to display different customized information for each user depending on the settings of each user's user profile or account authenticated by mobile computing device 170. In some cases, the system 100 may also customize various other settings of the vehicle (e.g., temperature settings, radio settings, vehicle environment settings, etc.) associated with operation of the vehicle and/or the IHU system 100.
Fig. 3 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example computing device 310 performing a face registration operation in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Computing device 310 may be one example of mobile computing device 170 shown in fig. 1 configured to hold enrollment image data for an authorized user. As used herein, the term "image data" refers to data (e.g., feature data) that is calculated or otherwise determined from a captured image of, for example, a user's face.
The computing device 310 may be a mobile device, such as a smartphone, tablet computer, laptop computer, computerized watch, computerized eyewear, computerized gloves, or any other type of portable computing device. Additional examples of computing device 310 include other mobile and non-mobile devices, such as desktop computers, televisions, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), portable and non-portable gaming systems, digital media players or micro-consoles, electronic book readers, mobile television platforms, automobile navigation and entertainment systems, or any other type of wearable and non-wearable, mobile or non-mobile computing device.
As shown in fig. 3, computing device 310 includes a presence-sensitive display (PSD)312, one or more image capture devices 314, a Facial Recognition Module (FRM)322, and enrollment information 328. Registration information 328 may include a data store. FRM322 may perform the described operations using software, hardware, firmware, or a mixture of hardware and software, as well as firmware resident in computing device 310 and/or executing at computing device 310. Computing device 310 may execute FRM322 with multiple processors or multiple devices. Computing device 310 may execute FRM322 as a virtual machine executing on the underlying hardware. FRM322 may execute as one or more services of an operating system or computing platform. FRM322 may execute at the application layer of the computing platform as one or more executable programs.
The PSD 312 of the computing device 310 may serve as a corresponding input device and/or output device for the computing device 310. The PSD 312 may be implemented using various techniques. For example, PSD 312 may function as an input device using a presence-sensitive input screen, such as a resistive touch screen, a surface acoustic wave touch screen, a capacitive touch screen, a projected capacitance touch screen, a pressure-sensitive screen, an acoustic pulse recognition touch screen, or another presence-sensitive display technology. PSD 312 may detect input from a user of computing device 310. For example, PSD 312 may detect one or more gestures performed above or within a threshold distance of PSD 312 (e.g., a user touching PSD 312 with a finger or a stylus or moving a finger or stylus within a threshold distance of a surface of PSD 312).
The PSD 312 may also function as an output (e.g., display) device using any one or more display devices, such as a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a dot matrix display, a Light Emitting Diode (LED) display, an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display, electronic ink, or similar monochrome or color display capable of outputting visible information to a user of the computing device 310. PSD 312 may output (e.g., to a user) information as a user interface (e.g., a graphical user interface) that may be associated with functionality provided by computing device 310. For example, PSD 312 may display various user interfaces related to application modules or other features of a computing platform, operating system, application, and/or service executing at computing device 310 or accessible from computing device 310.
The image capture device 314 may be one example of the image capture device 173 (fig. 1) and may include one or more cameras, such as a digital camera, a still camera, a motion picture camera, and so forth. The image capture device 314 may include any other device capable of capturing and storing still images or moving images. In some examples, the image capture device 314 may be capable of digitally recording images via an electronic image sensor. The image capture device 314 may be configured to generate data indicative of an image in response to detecting visible light (e.g., human visible light, having a wavelength between about 380 nanometers and about 740 nanometers) or Near Infrared (NIR) light (e.g., light adjacent to the visible light spectrum, such as light at a wavelength between about 750 nanometers and about 3400 nanometers). In some examples, computing device 310 includes an image capture device 314 configured to generate data indicative of a two-dimensional image. In another example, the computing device 310 includes a plurality of image capture devices 314 configured to generate data indicative of a three-dimensional image. In this manner, the plurality of image capture devices 314 may generate data indicative of two-dimensional images, three-dimensional images, or both.
In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure, FRM322 may perform facial recognition to authenticate a user of computing device 310. In general, FRM322 may perform an enrollment process (e.g., once, such as during initial setup of computing device 310) and periodically perform an authentication process to determine whether an unknown user is actually a known user. During the enrollment process, image capture device 314 may determine one or more feature data 330A-330H (collectively, "feature data 330" or, more generally, "image data 330") of a known user 338 (e.g., a user logged into an associated user account), and PSD 312 may output a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that includes one or more images 333 of known user 338. The known user 338 may also be referred to as a registered user. In some examples, each of feature data 330 may be associated with a particular pose of user 338 (e.g., feature data 330A for "pose a" of user 338, feature data 330B for "pose B" of user 338). The known user 338 may be able to view the image 333 within the GUI as data is captured by the image capture device 314, and may adjust his or her head and/or the computing device 310 to enable the image capture device 314 to capture the image 333 of the face of the known user 338 in a variety of different poses. Image capture device 314 may output data associated with image 333 to FRM 322. As one example, the user 338 may face the image capture device 314 and press a button (e.g., a physical button or a graphical button displayed by the PSD 312) to cause the image capture device 314 to capture the image 333. As another example, the image capture device 314 may automatically capture the image 333 in response to a user facing the image capture device 314.
The FRM322 analyzes the data received from the image capture device 314 and assigns each of the calculated feature data 330 to one or more pose buckets 332AA-332EE (collectively pose buckets 332). Feature data 330 includes features or characteristics of image 333. Each gesture bucket 332 is associated with a range of pitch angles (also referred to as tilt angles) and yaw angles (also referred to as pan angles) of the user's face. As used herein, pitch angle refers to the angle of a user's face relative to a horizontal axis and yaw angle refers to the angle of a user's face relative to a vertical axis perpendicular to the horizontal axis. For example, each of the attitude buckets 332 may be associated with a respective yaw and pitch range. In the example of fig. 3, the size of each of the gesture buckets 332 is equal (e.g., 10 degrees). For example, each of the attitude buckets 332 is associated with a 10 degree range of pitch angles and a 10 degree range of yaw angles. However, in some examples, the size of the gesture barrel 332 may be different. For example, an attitude bucket may be associated with an 8 degree range of pitch angle (and/or an 8 degree range of yaw angle) and another attitude bucket may be associated with a 10 degree range of pitch angle (and/or a 10 degree range of yaw angle).
For purposes of illustration, gesture barrel 332 is shown in FIG. 3 as part of table 331. As illustrated in the example of fig. 3, the yaw and pitch angles shown in table 331 represent the center of each respective attitude bucket 332. For example, the center of attitude bucket 332AA has a yaw of-20 degrees and a pitch of 20 degrees. In other words, attitude bucket 332AA may represent a yaw of-15 to-25 degrees and a pitch of 15 to 25 degrees. Similarly, in the example of fig. 3, the center of attitude bucket 332AN has a yaw of 20 degrees and a pitch of 20 degrees, such that attitude bucket 332AN represents a yaw of 15 to 25 degrees and a pitch of 15 to 25 degrees. Although table 331 includes 25 gesture buckets 332, in some examples, table 331 may include a different number of gesture buckets 332. While gesture bucket 332 is illustrated as part of table 331 to aid in understanding, gesture bucket 332 may not be stored in a table. Gesture buckets 332 may be stored in any data structure and may be organized in any manner.
FRM322 may determine which of pose buckets 332 is associated with feature data based on characteristics or landmarks (landmark) of the face of known user 338 included in the data of image 333. For example, FRM322 may detect landmarks in image 333 of the user's face, such as the user's eyes, nose, and mouth, and may determine the yaw and pitch angles of the user's face based on the landmarks. For example, FRM322 may determine that feature data 330A associated with a particular pose (e.g., "pose a") should be included in pose bucket 332CC based on the yaw and pitch angles of the user's face in feature data 330A and the range yaw and pitch angles associated with pose bucket 332 CC. For example, FRM322 may determine that the yaw angle of the user's face in feature data 330A is 0 degrees and the pitch angle of the user's face is known to be 0 degrees. FRM322 may determine that attitude bucket 332CC is associated with a range of yaw angles from-5 degrees to 5 degrees and a range of pitch angles from-5 to 5 degrees (e.g., attitude bucket 332CC centered at 0 degrees yaw and 0 degrees pitch). In such examples, FRM322 may determine that pose bucket 332CC includes feature data 330A in response to determining that the yaw and pitch angles of the user's face in feature data 330A fall within the range of yaw and pitch angles associated with pose bucket 332 CC.
As another example, FRM322 may determine that the yaw angle of the user's face in feature data 330B is 0 degrees (e.g., center in the left-right direction) and the pitch angle of the user's face is 23 degrees (e.g., it is known that the user is looking up). FRM322 may determine that attitude bucket 332AC is associated with a range of yaw angles from-5 degrees to 5 degrees and a range of pitch angles from 15 degrees to 25 degrees (e.g., attitude bucket 332CC centered at 0 degrees yaw and 20 degrees pitch). In such examples, FRM322 may determine that pose bucket 332AC includes feature data 330B in response to determining that the yaw and pitch angles of the user's face in feature data 330B fall within the range of yaw and pitch angles associated with pose bucket 332 AC.
FRM322 may determine feature data 330 and determine whether a threshold number of pose buckets 332 include one of feature data 330. For example, FRM322 may determine the number of pose buckets 332 that include feature data 330 for the face of a known user. In the example of fig. 3, FRM322 determines that feature data 330 is included within 19 of the 25 possible pose buckets 332 (e.g., 332AB, 332AC, 332BA, 332BB, 332BC, 332BD, 332BE, 332CA, 332CB, 332CC, 332CD, 332CE, 332DB, 332DC, 332DD, 332DE, 332EB, 332EC, and 332 ED). In some examples, FRM322 determines whether the number of pose buckets that include feature data 330 satisfies (e.g., is greater than or equal to) a threshold number (e.g., 15 pose buckets, 17 pose buckets, 19 pose buckets, etc.; or 65% of pose buckets 332, 75% of pose buckets 332, 85% of pose buckets, etc.). For example, FRM322 may determine that a number of pose buckets 332 that include feature data 330 satisfies a threshold number of pose buckets in response to determining that feature data 330 is included within at least 75% of pose buckets 332. Determining that the number of gesture buckets 332 that include feature data 330 satisfies the threshold number of gesture buckets may indicate that feature data 330 represents a known user's face at different gestures sufficient to more accurately authenticate the user.
In response to determining that the number of pose buckets that include feature data 330 does not satisfy the threshold number of pose buckets, image capture device 314 may capture one or more images 333 for use in the enrollment process. For example, FRM322 may output a graphical user interface instructing known user 338 to move his or her head to capture images 333 of different angles of the face of known user 338.
In response to determining that the number of pose buckets that include feature data 330 satisfies the threshold number of pose buckets, FRM322 may associate feature data 330 with a user account of known user 338. In some examples, the feature data 330 may include an image template (also referred to as embedding) for each respective image. As one example, the image template may generally correspond to a statistical model of one or more features (e.g., biometric features) of the user's face. For example, FRM322 may generate an image template that includes a vector having a plurality of element values (e.g., 50 values, 100 values, 500 values, etc.). In some examples, each element value of the vector corresponds to a feature of the user's face (e.g., distance between eyes, nose shape, etc.). Alternatively or additionally, the element values of the vector may be generated by, for example, a non-linear machine learning model trained to generate an output indicative of facial characteristics (facial identity). For example, FRM322 may apply the trained facial recognition model to the plurality of feature data 330 and output an image template (e.g., embedded) for each respective feature data 330 as a vector. In some examples, FRM322 associates feature data 330 with a user account by assigning data to image template identifiers and associating respective image template identifiers with user account identifiers for user accounts of known users 338.
FRM322 may be imaged with the feature data in enrollment information 328, which enrollment information 328 contains a data store including feature data 330 associated with image 333 of user 338. In some examples, FRM322 encrypts feature data 330 before storing it in registration information 328. In some examples, the registration information 328 may be stored locally on the computing device 310 such that the information is not transmitted over a network to any other device (e.g., not to the system 100 of the vehicle of fig. 1). Additionally, the computing device 310 may provide the user with an opportunity to delete one or more portions of the feature data 330 stored in the enrollment information.
FRM322 may perform an authentication process for an unknown user (e.g., user 150 of the vehicle of fig. 1) after completing the registration process for known user 338. In other words, FRM322 may receive a request to authenticate an unknown user 150 of the vehicle of fig. 1 based on the characteristic data of user 150 determined from an image 333 captured by one of the cameras in the vehicle (e.g., cameras 104 and/or 111) and transmitted by IHU system 100 to computing device 310, which computing device 310 may be one example of mobile computing device 170 of fig. 1. The system 100 may send the feature data 330 to the computing device 310, the computing device 310 including feature vector data for various features of the image of the user 150, for example, captured by the image capture device 173.
In response to receiving or determining the feature data associated with the authentication image, FRM322 may determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338. In some examples, FRM322 determines whether unknown user 150 is known user 338 based on a comparison of feature data of an authentication image indicative of the face of unknown user 150 and feature data 330 of image 333 indicative of the face of known user 338. For example, FRM322 may use a pose-independent (also referred to as pose-invariant) technique or a pose-dependent technique to compare feature data of an authentication image indicative of the face of unknown user 150 with feature data 330 calculated or determined from image 333 of the face of known user 338.
In some examples, in the pose correlation technique, FRM322 determines whether unknown user 150 is a known user 338 based on the authentication feature data and feature data 330 associated with the face of known user 338 in a pose closest to the pose of the unknown user's face in the authentication image of user 150. In one example, FRM322 determines a pose bucket of pose buckets 332 associated with authentication feature data of unknown user 150. For example, FRM322 may determine a pose bucket associated with feature data of unknown user 150 based on characteristics or landmarks of the unknown user's face in a manner similar to determining a pose bucket associated with feature data 330. For example, FRM322 may determine yaw and pitch angles of the face in the authentication feature data of user 150. In response to determining the yaw and pitch angles of the face in the authentication feature data, FRM322 may determine which of pose buckets 332 includes the yaw and pitch angles of the face in the authentication feature data. For example, FRM322 may determine that the yaw and pitch angles of the face in the feature data are 20 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. FRM322 may determine that attitude bucket 332CD is associated with a range of yaw angles from 15 degrees to 25 degrees and a range of pitch angles from-5 degrees to 5 degrees. In such cases, FRM322 may determine that the authentication feature data of unknown user 150 is associated with pose bucket 332CD in response to determining that the yaw and pitch angles of the face in the authentication feature data are included within the range of yaw and pitch angles associated with pose bucket 332 CD.
FRM322 may determine feature data included within the pose bucket associated with feature data of the face of unknown user 150 from feature data 330 of the face of known user 338. In other words, FRM322 may determine which of feature data 330 has the closest pose to the pose of the authentication feature data of user 150. In one example, FRM322 determines that the feature data of user 150 is associated with gesture bucket 332CD and selects the feature data of feature data 330 included within gesture bucket 332CD (e.g., feature data 330 of gesture G). FRM322 may determine whether user 150 is a known user 338 by determining a similarity score for selected feature data 330G that indicates a similarity between feature data 330G and authentication feature data.
In response to determining the similarity score of the selected feature data 330G (e.g., the feature data included in the pose bucket 332CD associated with the image or images of the unknown user 150), in some examples, FRM322 determines whether the similarity score of the feature data 330G satisfies (e.g., is greater than or equal to) a threshold similarity score. FRM322 may determine that unknown user 150 is a known user 338 in response to determining that the similarity score of feature data 330G satisfies the threshold similarity score, and may determine that unknown user 150 is not a known user in response to determining that the similarity score of feature data 330G does not satisfy the threshold similarity score.
In some examples, FRM322 determines whether unknown user 150 is known user 338 regardless of the gesture. In other words, in some examples FRM322 utilizes a gesture-invariant technique to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338. For example, FRM322 may determine a respective similarity score for each of feature data 330, where the respective similarity score indicates a similarity between the corresponding feature data of feature data 330 and the authentication feature data of unknown user 150.
In one scenario, FRM322 selects feature data of feature data 330 based on the respective similarity scores of feature data 330 to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338. FRM322 selects the feature data with the feature data 330 indicating a similarity score that most closely matches the authentication feature data. The score indicating the closest match may be the lowest similarity score or the highest similarity score.
In some scenarios, FRM322 selects two or more of feature data 330 based on respective similarity scores to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338. In one scenario, FRM322 determines a composite similarity score for two or more feature data 330. For example, FRM322 may determine a composite similarity score based on an average of respective similarity scores of two or more of feature data 330 and compare the composite similarity score to a threshold similarity score to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338.
As another example, FRM322 may compare each respective similarity score of two or more feature data to a threshold similarity score. In such examples, FRM322 may determine that unknown user 150 is known user 338 in response to determining that a threshold number (e.g., 100%, 80%, 60%, etc.) of the selected feature data has a similarity score that satisfies a threshold similarity score. For example, if the set of selected feature data includes three of feature data 330 with the highest similarity scores, then in some examples FRM322 determines that unknown user 150 is known user 338 in response to determining that the similarity scores of two of the three selected feature data satisfy the threshold similarity score.
In response to determining that the unknown user 150 is a known user 338, the computing device 310 may send authentication data to the IHU system 100 of the vehicle. For example, the computing device 310 may transmit data indicating a successful authentication of the unknown user 150 as the known user 338, thereby indicating the authentication of the user 150. In some cases, computing device 310 may send user profile and/or account information to system 100 that is customized or personalized for user 338 (e.g., authenticated user 150). In some cases, the computing device 310 may also transmit the unique identifier of the user 338 and/or the computing device 310 to the system 100 of the vehicle.
In some cases, computing device 310 may also store one or more models 329. As described above, for example, in some cases, computing device 310 may utilize a deep learning model to extract facial landmarks that are useful for identifying individuals. These models may be adapted (tailor) to execute on a dedicated neural engine or processor of the personal device. As described above, in some examples, the image template may generally correspond to a statistical model of one or more features (e.g., biometric features) of the user's face. For example, FRM322 may generate an image template that includes a vector having a plurality of element values (e.g., 50 values, 100 values, 500 values, etc.). In some examples, each element value of the vector corresponds to a feature of the user's face (e.g., distance between eyes, nose shape, etc.). Alternatively or additionally, the element values of the vector may be generated by, for example, a non-linear machine learning model trained to generate an output indicative of facial traits. For example, FRM322 may apply the trained facial recognition model to image 333 and output an image template (e.g., embedded) of the corresponding feature data 330 as a vector. Alternatively or additionally, the element values of the vector may be generated by a non-linear machine learning model trained to generate an output indicative of facial traits. As one example, the enrollment module may apply the trained facial recognition model to the image 333 and output an image template (e.g., vector) for the corresponding feature data 330. Such image templates may be represented as vectors and may be generated by a trained facial recognition model. The vector may include a plurality of element values, where each element value corresponds to a respective feature of the user's face (e.g., distance between eyes, nose shape, etc.).
Although the computing device 310 is described as registering the characteristic data 330 of the known user 338 and authenticating the unknown user 150, in some examples, one or more remote computing devices may perform all or a subset of the functionality described herein. In certain alternative examples, the computing device 310 may send the enrollment feature data to a vehicle computing system (e.g., vehicle computing system 100), which may then be configured to perform authentication of the unknown user in the vehicle by comparing the authentication feature data of the unknown user to the received enrollment feature data of known users.
In some examples, a computing device (e.g., computing device 310 or another computing device) may utilize user data associated with a user of computing device 310 only when the computing device receives permission from the user of the computing device to utilize the data. For example, before a computing device or computing system is able to collect or can utilize information associated with a user, the user may be provided with an opportunity to provide input to control whether programs or features of the computing device and/or computing system are able to collect and utilize the user information. In addition, certain information may be processed in one or more ways before it is stored or used by the computing device and/or computing system, such that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, the identity of the user may be processed such that no personally identifiable information can be determined about the user. For example, the computing device may store feature data and/or image templates for the image without storing the image itself, and may associate the feature data and/or image templates with a user identifier that is not associated with any other user information. Thus, the user may control how information about the user is collected and used by the computing device and computing system.
In this manner, techniques of this disclosure may enable computing device 310 to capture feature data of known users 338 included within several different gesture buckets. By capturing and registering feature data in several different gesture buckets, computing device 310 may increase the number of gesture buckets that include feature data of known user 338, which may enable computing device 310 to more accurately authenticate feature data of an unknown user (e.g., user 150) regardless of the gesture bucket of the authenticated feature data of the unknown user. For example, increasing the number of gesture buckets that include enrollment feature data may increase the probability that the gesture bucket associated with the authentication feature data of the unknown user is similar to the gesture bucket of one or more of the groups that include enrollment feature data of known user 338, which may reduce the probability of falsely rejecting the unknown user when the unknown user is actually a known, authorized user, thereby potentially improving the user experience. In addition, reducing the probability of false denials may reduce the number of authentication attempts (e.g., facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, PIN or password, etc.) for the computing device to enter an increased access mode, which may reduce the amount of processing cycles utilized by the processor and improve battery life. In some cases, the described techniques may reduce the probability of the unknown user being incorrectly authenticated when the unknown user is not a known, authorized user, which may improve the security of the computing device 310.
Fig. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an example computing system 410 in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. In some cases, the computing system 410 may be a more detailed example of the computing device 310 of fig. 3, the mobile computing device 170 of fig. 1, and/or the vehicle computing system 100 of fig. 1. Fig. 4 illustrates only one particular example of computing system 410, and many other examples of computing system 410 may be used in other instances and may include a subset of the components included in example computing system 410 or may include additional components not shown in fig. 4. As used herein, "image data" refers to data (e.g., feature data) that is calculated or otherwise determined from a captured image of, for example, a user's face.
As shown in the example of fig. 4, computing system 410 includes PSD 412, one or more image capture devices 414, one or more processors 430, one or more input components 442, one or more output components 444, one or more communication units 446, and one or more storage devices 448. Storage 448 of computing system 410 includes FRM422 and registration information 428.
The image capture device 414 may include one or more cameras, such as a digital camera, still camera, motion picture camera, and the like. The image capture device 414 may include any other device capable of capturing and storing still images or moving images. In some examples, the image capture device 414 may be capable of digitally recording images via an electronic image sensor. The image capture device 414 may include one or more devices configured to detect visible light (e.g., a visible light camera), one or more devices configured to detect near-infrared light (e.g., a near-infrared camera), or a combination thereof. In some examples, image capture device 414 may generate image data indicative of a two-dimensional image, data indicative of a three-dimensional image, or a combination thereof. In this manner, the plurality of image capture devices 414 may capture visible light, near infrared light, or a combination thereof, and may generate image data indicative of a two-dimensional image, a three-dimensional image, or both.
One or more communication units 446 of computing system 410 may communicate with external devices by transmitting and/or receiving data. For example, the computing system 410 may use one or more of the communication units 446 to transmit and/or receive radio signals over a radio network, such as a cellular radio network. In some examples, communication unit 446 may transmit and/or receive satellite signals over a satellite network, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) network. Examples of communication unit 446 include a network interface card (e.g., such as an ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a GPS receiver, or any other type of device capable of sending and/or receiving information. Other examples of communication units 446 may include short wave radios (e.g., NFC, bluetooth (including BLE)), GPS, 3G, 4G, 5G, and WIFI radios, as well as Universal Serial Bus (USB) controllers, among others, present in mobile devices.
One or more input components 442 of computing system 410 can receive input. Examples of inputs are tactile, audio, kinetic, and optical inputs, to name a few. In one example, the input component 442 of the computing system 410 includes a mouse, keyboard, voice response system, camera, button, control pad, microphone, or any other type of device for detecting input from a human or machine. In some examples, input component 442 may be a presence-sensitive input component, which may include a presence-sensitive screen, a touch-sensitive screen, and/or the like.
One or more output components 444 of computing system 410 may generate output. Examples of outputs are tactile, audio and video outputs. In some examples, output component 444 of computing system 410 includes a presence-sensitive screen, a sound card, a video graphics adapter card, a speaker, a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), or any other type of device for generating output to a human or machine. The output components may include display components such as a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a Light Emitting Diode (LED), or any other type of device for generating tactile, audio, and/or visual outputs.
In some examples, PSD 412 of computing system 410 may include the functionality of input component 442 and/or output component 444. In the example of fig. 4, PSD 412 may include a presence-sensitive input component 464, such as a presence-sensitive screen or a touch-sensitive screen. In some examples, presence-sensitive input component 464 may detect an object at and/or near the presence-sensitive input component. As one example range, presence-sensitive input component 464 may detect an object, such as a finger or stylus within two inches or less of presence-sensitive input component 464. Presence-sensitive input component 464 may determine a location (e.g., (x, y) coordinates) of the presence-sensitive input component at which the object was detected. In another example range, presence-sensitive input component 464 may detect an object that is two inches or less from presence-sensitive input component 464, and other ranges are possible. Presence-sensitive input component 464 may use capacitive, inductive, and/or optical recognition techniques to determine the location of presence-sensitive input component 464 selected by the user's finger.
In some examples, PSD 412 may also provide output to a user using tactile, audio, or video stimuli as described with respect to output component 444. For example, PSD 412 may include a display component 462 that displays a graphical user interface. Display component 462 can be any type of output component that provides visual output, such as described with respect to output component 444. Although illustrated as an integrated component of computing system 410, in some examples, PSD 412 may be an external component that shares a data or information path with other components of computing system 410 for transmission and/or reception of input and output. For example, PSD 412 may be a built-in component of computing system 410 (e.g., a screen on a mobile phone) that is located within the external packaging of computing system 410 and is physically connected to the external packaging of computing system 410. In another example, PSD 412 may be an external component of computing system 410 that is located outside of the packaging of computing system 410 and is physically separate from the packaging of computing system 410 (e.g., a monitor, projector, etc. that shares a wired and/or wireless data path with a tablet computer). In some examples, PSD 412, when located outside of the packaging of computing system 410 and physically separated from the packaging of computing system 410, may be implemented by two separate components: a presence-sensitive input component 464 for receiving input, and a display component 462 for providing output.
One or more storage components 448 within computing system 410 may store information for processing during operation of computing system 410 (e.g., computing system 410 may store data accessed by FRM422 during execution at computing system 410). In some examples, storage component 448 is a temporary memory, meaning that the primary purpose of storage component 448 is not long-term storage. The storage component 448 on the computing system 410 may be configured for short-term storage of information as volatile memory, and therefore does not retain stored contents in the event of a power outage. Examples of volatile memory include Random Access Memory (RAM), Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memory known in the art.
In some examples, storage component 448 also includes one or more computer-readable storage media. The storage component 448, in some examples, includes one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media. The storage component 448 may be configured to store larger amounts of information than is typically stored by volatile memory. The storage component 448 may also be configured for long-term storage of information as non-volatile storage space and retain information after power on/off cycles. Examples of non-volatile memory include forms of magnetic hard disks, optical disks, flash memory or electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable memories (EEPROM). Storage component 448 may store program instructions and/or information (e.g., data) associated with FRM 422. Storage component 448 may include a memory configured to store data or other information associated with FRM422 and registration information 428.
The one or more processors 430 may implement the functionality associated with the computing system 410 and/or execute instructions associated with the computing system 410. Examples of processor 430 include an application processor, a display controller, an auxiliary processor, one or more sensor hubs, and any other hardware configured to act as a processor, processing unit, or processing device. FRM422 may be operable by processor 430 to perform various actions, operations, or functions of computing system 410.
In certain examples, when the computing system 410 includes an example of the vehicle computing system 100, the storage 448 may include information and/or modules that are executable by the processor 430 to implement corresponding functionality of the vehicle computing system 100 (e.g., as illustrated and/or described with reference to the system 100 in fig. 1 and/or 5). In other examples, such as that illustrated in fig. 4, where computing system 410 includes the example of computing device 310 of fig. 3, processor 430 of computing system 410 may retrieve and execute instructions stored by storage component 448 that cause processor 430 to perform the operations described herein due to FRM 422. The instructions, when executed by processor 430, may cause computing system 410 to store information in storage component 448.
FRM422 may include all of the functionality of FRM322 of computing device 310 of fig. 3 and may perform similar operations as FRM322 in order to perform facial recognition to authenticate a user of computing system 410. FRM422 may include a registration module 424 and an authentication module 426.
In some examples, enrollment module 424 may perform an enrollment process to associate image data of a known user of computing system 410 with a user account of the known user. In some examples, the registration module 424 may perform the registration process once for a given user account, for example, when setting up a new account.
During the enrollment phase, image capture device 414 captures one or more image data 330 (of fig. 1) of known users of computing system 410 (e.g., users logged into an associated user account) and generates image data indicative of each of the images. Registration module 424 of FRM422 may receive image data from image capture device 414 and analyze the image data to assign each of image data 330 to one or more pose buckets 332 (fig. 1).
In some examples, registration module 424 determines whether image data 330A should be included in multiple gesture buckets 332. For example, registration module 424 may include image data 330A within a given pose bucket when the yaw and pitch angles of image data 330A are within a predefined distance (e.g., a radius of 10 degrees) of the center of the given pose bucket 332. For example, registration module 424 may determine that the yaw and pitch angles of the user's face in image data 330A are 0 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. In one case, the predefined distance may be 10 degrees and pose bucket 332BC may be centered at 0 degrees yaw and 10 degrees pitch, such that registration module 424 may determine that the yaw and pitch angles of image data 330A are within the predefined distance of the center of pose bucket 332 BC. In such cases, registration module 424 may include image data 330A within pose bucket 332 BC. Similarly, registration module 424 can determine that the yaw and pitch angles of image data 330A are within a predefined distance of the centers of pose buckets 332CB, 332CD, and 332DC, and include image data 330A in pose buckets 332CB, 332CD, and 332DC in addition to pose buckets 332CC and 332 BC.
In some examples, registration module 424 receives image data 330B after receiving image data 330A. Registration module 424 can determine whether to include image data 330B in any of gesture buckets 332. Registration module 424 may determine, based on the landmarks in image data 330B, that the yaw angle of the user's face in image data 330B is approximately 0 degrees and the pitch angle of the user's face in image data 330B is approximately 0 degrees. Registration module 424 may determine that attitude bucket 332AC includes a range of yaw angles from-5 degrees to 5 degrees and a range of pitch angles from 15 degrees to 25 degrees (e.g., attitude bucket 332AC center is at 0 degrees yaw and 20 degrees pitch). In such examples, registration module 424 may determine that the yaw and pitch angles of the user's face in image data 330B are within the range of pitch and yaw angles of pose bucket 332 AC. Registration module 424 may determine whether pose bucket 332AC includes one of image data 330 and may include image data 330B in pose bucket 332AC in response to determining that pose bucket 332AC does not already include image data.
In some examples, registration module 424 determines that pose bucket 332BC already includes image data 330A and determines whether to replace image data 330A with image data 330B in pose bucket 332 BC. In one example, registration module 424 may determine whether to replace image data 330A with image data 330B in pose bucket 332BC based on a distance between a center of pose bucket 332BC and respective yaw and pitch angles of image data 330A, 330B. For example, registration module 424 may determine that the yaw and pitch angles of image data 330A are 0 degrees, 0 degrees; the yaw and pitch angles of the image data 330B are 0 degrees, 19 degrees, and the yaw and pitch angles of the center of the attitude bucket 332BC are 0 degrees, 10 degrees. In such examples, registration module 424 may determine that image data 330B is closer to the center of pose bucket 332BC than image data 330A, and may replace image data 330A with image data 330B within pose bucket 332 BC.
In some examples, registration module 424 may determine whether to include image data 330A or image data 330B within pose bucket 332BC based on the order in which image data 330A, 330B was received. For example, registration module 424 may include the oldest image data (e.g., the first received image data) within pose bucket 332 BC. In such an example, registration module 424 may determine that image data 330A should be included within pose bucket 332BC because image data 330A was received first. In another example, registration module 424 may include the most recent image data within pose bucket 332 BC. In these examples, registration module 424 may determine that image data 330B should be included within pose bucket 332 BC.
In some examples, registration module 424 may associate data indicative of image data 330 with a user account of a known user in response to determining that a number of pose buckets that include image data 330 satisfies a threshold number of pose buckets. In some examples, image data 330 may include the images themselves or an image template (e.g., calculated facial feature data) for each respective image. The image template may include a vector having a plurality of element values (e.g., 50 values, 100 values, 500 values, etc.). In some examples, each element value of the vector corresponds to a feature of the user's face (e.g., distance between eyes, nose shape, etc.). Alternatively or additionally, the element values of the vector may be generated by a non-linear machine learning model trained to generate an output indicative of facial traits. As one example, registration module 424 may apply the trained facial recognition model to a plurality of image data 330 and output an image template (e.g., a vector) for each respective image data 330. In some examples, registration module 424 associates data indicative of image data 330 with a user account by assigning an image template identifier to each image template and associating the respective image template identifier with a user account identifier of a user account of a known user.
In some scenarios, authentication module 426 performs an authentication process in response to receiving, using authentication module 426, data indicative of an authentication image of a face of unknown user 150 (of fig. 1). The data indicative of the image of the unknown user's face may include the image itself or an image template representing characteristics of the unknown user's face.
In response to receiving the data indicative of the authentication image data, authentication module 426 may determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338. Authentication module 426 may determine whether unknown user 150 is a known user 338 based on the authentication image data of user 150 and one or more enrollment image data 330. In some cases, authentication module 426 uses a gesture-independent (also referred to as gesture-invariant) technique or a gesture-dependent technique to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338.
In some pose-related examples, authentication module 426 determines whether unknown user 150 is known user 338 based on the authentication image data and particular image data including image data 330 of the known user's face in a pose closest to the pose of the unknown user 150's face in the authentication image. In one example, the particular image data 330 that includes the face of the known user 338 in a pose closest to the pose of the face in the authentication image data may be a particular image of the image data 330 included in the same pose bucket as the pose bucket 332 associated with the authentication image data.
In some examples, authentication module 426 determines whether the similarity score of image data 330G satisfies a threshold similarity score. As one example, authentication module 426 determines the similarity score for image data 330G by determining an angle between a vector representing image data 330G and a vector representing authentication image data, and determines that the similarity score for image data 330G satisfies a threshold similarity score in response to determining that the similarity score is less than the threshold similarity score. As another example, authentication module 426 determines the similarity score for image data 330G by determining a cosine similarity between a vector representing image data 330G and a vector representing authentication image data, and determines that the similarity score for image data 330G satisfies a threshold similarity score in response to determining that the similarity score is greater than the threshold similarity score.
In some pose-independent examples, authentication module 426 determines a respective similarity score for each of image data 330 to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338. The respective similarity scores indicate similarities between corresponding image data of image data 330 and authentication image data. As discussed above, authentication module 426 may determine a respective similarity score for each of image data 330 based on the data indicative of the respective image data 330 and the data indicative of the authentication image data. In some examples, the data indicative of image data 330 includes a respective image template. Such image templates may be represented as vectors and may be generated by a trained facial recognition model. The vector may include a plurality of element values, each element value corresponding to a respective feature of the user's face. In such examples, the data indicative of the authentication image data may comprise a vector comprising a plurality of element values, each element value corresponding to a respective feature of the face of the unknown user 150. In some scenarios, authentication module 426 determines a respective similarity score for each of image data 330 by calculating an angle between the respective vector and a vector representing the authentication image data. As another example, authentication module 426 may determine the respective similarity score for each of image data 330 by determining a cosine similarity between the respective vector for each of image data 330 and a vector representing the authentication image data.
In one pose-independent example, authentication module 426 selects image data in image data 330 based on respective similarity scores of image data 330 to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338. Authentication module 426 selects a single image data of image data 330 having a similarity score indicating a closest match to the authentication image data. In some examples, authentication module 426 determines the respective similarity scores of image data 330 based on an angle between each vector representing the respective image data of image data 330 and the vector representing the authentication image data and determines that the score indicating the closest match is the lowest similarity score (e.g., the smaller the angle between the two vectors, the closer the vectors are to each other). In another example, authentication module 426 determines the respective similarity score of image data 330 based on a cosine similarity between each vector representing the respective image data of image data 330 and the vector representing the authentication image data and determines that the score indicating the closest match is the highest similarity score (e.g., the greater the cosine value between the two vectors, the more similar the vectors).
In some scenarios, authentication module 426 selects two or more of image data 330 based on respective similarity scores to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338. In one scenario, authentication module 426 determines a composite similarity score for two or more image data 330. In some cases, authentication module 426 may determine a composite similarity score based on the highest similarity score of two or more image data 330 or the lowest similarity score of two or more image data 330. In one case, authentication module 426 may determine a composite similarity score based on an average of respective similarity scores of two or more of image data 330 and may compare the composite similarity score to a threshold similarity score to determine whether unknown user 150 is known user 338.
As another example, authentication module 426 may compare each respective similarity score of two or more image data to a threshold similarity score. In such examples, authentication module 426 may determine that unknown user 150 is known user 338 in response to determining that a threshold number (e.g., 100%, 80%, 60%, etc.) of selected image data has a similarity score that satisfies a threshold similarity score. For example, authentication module 426 may determine that the set of selected image data includes three of image data 330 having the highest similarity scores, and may determine that unknown user 150 is known user 338 in response to determining that the similarity scores of two of the three selected image data satisfy the threshold similarity score.
In some cases, the storage 448 may also store one or more models 429. As described above, for example, in some cases, computing device 310 may utilize a deep learning model to extract facial landmarks that are useful for identifying individuals. These models may be adapted to execute on a dedicated neural engine or processor of the personal device. As described above, in some examples, the image template may generally correspond to a statistical model of one or more features (e.g., biometric features) of the user's face. For example, FRM322 may generate an image template that includes a vector having a plurality of element values (e.g., 50 values, 100 values, 500 values, etc.). In some examples, each element value of the vector corresponds to a feature of the user's face (e.g., distance between eyes, nose shape, etc.). Alternatively or additionally, the element values of the vector may be generated by, for example, a non-linear machine learning model trained to generate an output indicative of facial traits. For example, FRM322 may apply the trained facial recognition model to the plurality of image data 330 and output an image template (e.g., embedded) for each respective image data 330 as a vector. Alternatively or additionally, the element values of the vector may be generated by a non-linear machine learning model trained to generate an output indicative of facial traits. As one example, registration module 424 may apply the trained facial recognition model to a plurality of image data 330 and output an image template (e.g., a vector) for each respective image data 330. Such image templates may be represented as vectors and may be generated by a trained facial recognition model. The vector may include a plurality of element values, each element value corresponding to a respective feature of the user's face (e.g., distance between eyes, nose shape, etc.).
In some cases, biometric feature information or identifiers associated with known users may include various enrollment image data and/or features of the user stored in enrollment information 428, which may include image data and/or feature information for various different poses of image data 330. In some cases, such biometric information stored in enrollment information 428 may also include a unique identifier of the user and/or information specific to the user's user profile or account. The machine model may be stored locally (e.g., in model 429 of computing device 410) or may be stored remotely from device 410 (e.g., on one or more remote servers).
In response to determining that the unknown user 150 is a known user 338, the computing device 310 may send authentication data to the IHU system 100 of the vehicle. For example, the computing device 310 may transmit data indicating a successful authentication of the unknown user 150 as the known user 338, thereby indicating the authentication of the user 150. In some cases, computing device 310 may send user profile and/or account information to system 100 that is customized or personalized for user 338 (e.g., authenticated user 150). In some cases, the computing device 310 may also transmit the unique identifier of the user 338 and/or the computing device 310 to the system 100 of the vehicle.
Fig. 5 is a diagram illustrating an example driver enrollment and authentication process in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure, and fig. 6 is a diagram illustrating an example face registration process in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Such as creating an account on the IHU system 100, the registration or posting of the user 150, such as a driver, may be done on the user's personal device (e.g., mobile computing device 170 of fig. 1, computing device 310 of fig. 3). This process involves an enrollment application running on a personal device that captures biometric features of a user's face using, for example, a front-facing camera on a device such as that described above with reference to fig. 3. These corresponding facial features are stored as feature data (e.g., registration information 328) on the personal device. The personal device registers/pairs with an IHU (e.g., IHU system 100 of fig. 1) as a trusted device. The camera of the personal device (e.g., one or more of the image capture devices 314 of the computing device 310) may be any of a variety of different types of cameras, such as a camera that captures Near Infrared (NIR) frames and/or red, green, and blue (RGB) frames. When a personal device is paired with an IHU, the personal device is identified as a trusted device with respect to the IHU and is assigned a unique identifier by the IHU. This trusted device and its corresponding unique identifier are associated by the IHU with the user of the vehicle (e.g., user 150) and any profile and/or account information for that user.
In various examples, the registration process may include the following aspects. Various personal computing devices or systems, such as mobile computing device 170 and/or computing device 310, may be equipped with a front-facing image capture device 173 or 314, such as a camera. These cameras may use or provide NIR and/or RGB frames 551 for the purpose of facial recognition, where these frames 551 may be one example of the image 333 shown in fig. 3. In some cases, NIR spectroscopy may provide better adaptability to different lighting conditions. As described above, in some examples, a personal device may utilize a deep learning model to extract facial landmarks that help identify a person. These models may be adapted to execute on a dedicated neural engine or processor of the personal device. As described above, in some examples, the image template may generally correspond to a statistical model of one or more features (e.g., biometric features) 553 of the user's face, where the features 553 may be one example of the feature data 330. In some cases, computing device 310 may include model information within model 329 based on feature data of trained images and/or images taken with NIR cameras and/or RGB cameras. In some cases, computing device 310 may extract (distill) information (e.g., feature data) in model 329 from one color space (RGB space) to another color space (NIR space). As a result, the camera used within the vehicle of fig. 1 does not necessarily have to be of the same type as the image capture device (e.g., camera) 314 used in the computing device 310. For example, the vehicle may include an NIR camera, but the image capture device 314 may include an RGB camera. In various examples, the camera used within the vehicle of fig. 1 may be of the same type as the image capture device 314 included in the computing device 310.
For example, FRM322 may generate an image template that includes a vector having a plurality of element values (e.g., 50 values, 100 values, 500 values, etc.). In some examples, each element value of the vector corresponds to a feature of the user's face (e.g., distance between eyes, nose shape, etc.). Alternatively or additionally, the element values of the vector may be generated by, for example, a non-linear machine learning model trained to generate an output indicative of facial traits. For example, FRM322 may apply the trained facial recognition model to frame 551 and output an image template (e.g., embedding) of the respective facial features in features 553 as a vector. Alternatively or additionally, the element values of the vector may be generated by a non-linear machine learning model trained to generate an output indicative of facial traits.
As one example, the registration module 424 may apply the trained facial recognition model to the frames 551 and output image templates (e.g., vectors) of corresponding facial features in the features 553. Such image templates may be represented as vectors and may be generated by a trained facial recognition model. The vector may include a plurality of element values, each element value corresponding to a respective feature of the user's face (e.g., distance between eyes, nose shape, etc.). In some cases, biometric feature information or identifiers 555 associated with a known user may include various enrollment features of the user that are stored on a trusted device (e.g., in enrollment information 328), and the stored information may include feature information for various different gestures. Such biometric information stored in the enrollment information 328 may also include a unique identifier of the user and/or information specific to the user's user profile or account. The machine model may be stored locally (e.g., on mobile computing device 170, computing device 310, computing device 410, IHU system) or may be stored remotely from these systems (e.g., on one or more remote servers).
In one or more alternative examples of the example illustrated in fig. 5, the trusted mobile computing device may transmit the enrollment feature data to a vehicle computing system (e.g., vehicle computing system 100), which may then be configured to perform authentication of the unknown user in the vehicle by comparing the authentication feature data of the unknown user to the received enrollment feature data of the known user. In these cases, the vehicle computing system 100 receives feature data (e.g., feature data or an identifier 555) associated with at least one image of a previously registered user's face from the mobile computing device. The vehicle computing system 100 may then be configured to associate this received feature data with feature data associated with a captured image of the user's face inside the vehicle (e.g., feature 559). The vehicle computing system 100 may then determine a match between the user of the vehicle and the previously registered user based on the comparison, wherein the authentication data processed by the vehicle computing system 100 includes an indication of the match.
As previously described with reference to fig. 3, and as additionally shown in fig. 5, during the enrollment process, a computing device (e.g., mobile computing device 170, computing device 310) may create a gallery of facial image data (e.g., feature data) against different facial poses of the same user (e.g., known user 338). The face pose estimate consists of the pan and tilt values of the face. The pose with the registered facial features can appear as a pattern on the personal device. These patterns guide the user to move his head to capture different poses of the face, as shown in fig. 6.
Fig. 6 illustrates how this screen display can be done inside an application on the personal device. Known user 338 may utilize one or more of image capture devices 314 to view one or more images of user 338 that are output at PSD 312. Representations of these images may be displayed at the PSD 312 within a graphical box 600 visible to the user 338. Computing device 310 may output instructions to user 338 via PSD 312, as shown in fig. 6.
For example, the computing device 310 may output instructions to the user 338 to move his/her face relative to the image capture device 314 in order to position the face of the user 338 within the box 600, and then gently rotate the head of the user 338 until all of the dots shown in the box 600 become a certain color (e.g., green) or switch from unfilled dots to fully filled dots. As shown in fig. 6, the nine dots included in block 600 are currently unfilled, indicating that the user 338 should rotate his/her head until all dots become green or switch from unfilled to filled state or color (e.g., black). Once the user 338 has done so, the image capture device 314 will capture the image for the given pose and store it in registration information (e.g., data store) 328. The computing device 310 may instruct the user 338 to pan various different poses while capturing feature data 330 for various different poses based on different pitch and yaw angles, such as previously described with reference to fig. 3. The computing device 310 may iterate the above process of fig. 6 for each of these different poses of the user 338. Facial feature data for corresponding features/landmarks for various different facial poses may then be stored in the registration gallery in registration information 328. In some cases, registration information 328 may include a secure enclave (enclave) of personal device 310.
The computing device 310, which is one example of a mobile computing device 170, may register with the IHU system 100 of the vehicle shown in fig. 1 and, upon registration, may be a trusted companion device of the vehicle. IHU system 100 may assign a unique identifier to computing device 310 and/or known user 338 that may be associated with the user's account on IHU system 100. For example, a user 150 of a vehicle may have a user's account on the IHU system 100 that includes a personal profile of the user 150 associated with information that may be customized or personalized for the user 150 displayed on the display 112 of the IHU system 100, as previously described with reference to fig. 1-2. When the user 150 is authenticated as a known user 338 of the device 310, the unique identifier assigned to the computing device 310 and/or the known user 338 by the IHU system 100 may be associated with a user account or profile of the user 150.
In some cases, the user 150 may also have a wearable device 107 (e.g., a smart watch). In these cases, in some examples, mobile computing device 170 may communicate with wearable device 107 to provide information included in registration information 328 for storage on wearable device 107. In these examples, wearable device 107 may be configured to store information included in registration information 328. As a result, once the wearable device 107 stores this information, the wearable device 107 may perform the authentication functionality previously described with reference to fig. 3. For example, the wearable device 107 may be one example of the computing device 310 shown in fig. 3. In these cases, the user 150 of the vehicle may not necessarily have a separate mobile computing device 170 in the vehicle or near the IHU system 100. Alternatively, the IHU system 100 may communicate directly with the wearable device 107 to authenticate the user 150. As previously noted, IHU system 100 may use a wireless communication protocol (e.g., bluetooth, WIFI, BLE) to communicate with wearable device 107 and/or mobile computing device 170.
Referring again to fig. 5, upon authentication of the user 150 of the vehicle shown in fig. 1, image frames 557 from an in-vehicle driver facing camera 104/111 (e.g., an NIR or RGB camera) are used to calculate biometric features 559 of the face of the user 150 that may be seated in the driver's seat. These features 559 are then sent (563) from the IHU system 100 to the computing device 310 (e.g., mobile computing device 170, wearable device 107), which may occur over a secure channel for, for example, non-spoofing features, as described further below. The computing device 310 may be a trusted, previously registered device with respect to the system 100.
As previously described, software on the computing device 310 determines whether there is a match in the facial features of the current driver 150 and the registered, known user 338. If there is a match, computing device 310 sends data indicating the match to IHU system 100, and IHU system 100 receives (565) this data indicating the match as representing authentication of the registered user and proceeds to log on to the registered user (e.g., user 150 of the vehicle).
With respect to facial feature estimation, a model similar to the enrollment model may be used by the IHU system 100. As previously described, the computing device 310 may utilize one or more models 329 (e.g., enrollment models) to identify feature vector data for images of a known user 338 taken by the image capture device 314. IHU system 100 may utilize similar models to identify feature vector data for images of user 150 taken by in-vehicle cameras 104 and/or 111. For example, IHU system 100 may utilize these models to determine facial features of user 150 based on, for example, NIR images acquired by cameras 104, 111. In some cases, these features may be encrypted by the IHU system 100 and sent to a trusted device (e.g., computing device 310, mobile computing device 170) that authenticates the user 150. The IHU system and the trusted device may communicate using a variety of different encryption/decryption techniques to maintain confidentiality of the feature data exchanged between these entities. In some examples, the IHU system 100 may establish a secure communication channel with a previously registered trusted device. This channel can be established over, for example, a bluetooth/BLE or other wireless interface.
With respect to authentication on a trusted device (e.g., computing device 310), the trusted device may, upon receiving incoming feature data (e.g., feature vector data) from the IHU system 100, compare such data to a gallery of saved feature vectors and determine a match, such as described previously (e.g., with reference to fig. 3). If there is a match, an indication of this match and/or authentication data for the user (e.g., a registration token) is sent to the IHU system 100 over a secure channel, which may be used or otherwise used as a trigger to log the user 150 into the IHU system 100.
In some cases, it may be possible that an intruder with a stolen personal device (e.g., computing device 310) can attempt to unlock the IHU system 100 using a three-dimensional mask of the owner (e.g., user 150) or other image (e.g., paper image) of the owner's face. The deep learning model used by the IHU system and/or computing device 310 may be able to discover or otherwise detect such spoofing attempts as part of spoofing detection 561 and abort the authentication procedure. For example, these models may be trained with a variety of different objects and object types (e.g., human objects, paper objects, plastic objects). As a result, the model may include a variety of different feature data (e.g., feature vectors) that contain features associated with images of these different types of objects, and the model may be used to identify features such as the owner's three-dimensional mask or paper image in an attempt to abort any authentication procedures associated with such fraud attempts.
Further, in various examples, IHU system 100 may utilize a deep learning model and/or input from other signals to determine the presence of user 150 and/or an appropriate or optimal time to capture a facial image of user 150 using camera 104/111. For example, the IHU system 100 may store corresponding feature vector information using a learning model trained with various image information to determine the gaze of the user 150. The IHU system 100 may determine to capture an image of the face of the user 150 when the user's gaze is toward the camera or when the pose of the user 150 is optimal for capturing an increased number of facial feature information for use in authenticating the user 150. Further, the system 100 may utilize additional signals provided by the vehicle. For example, if the vehicle provides signals to the system 100 indicating that the user 150's seat belt is fastened, the user 150's hand is on the steering wheel 154, or the vehicle's gear is changing from park to drive, the system 100 may use these signals (alone or in combination with gaze information collected from the camera) to determine the appropriate or optimal time to capture an image of the user's 150 face using the camera 104/111.
As described above, in many cases, the camera used by IHU system 100 (e.g., camera 104/111) and/or the camera used by computing device 310 (e.g., image capture device 314) may include a NIR camera that may provide improved adaptability to ambient lighting and wearing items like sunglasses. However, these systems and devices may use any number of other different types of cameras (e.g., RGB cameras, NIR cameras, etc.).
The techniques of this disclosure use biometric features computed from frames captured by different cameras (e.g., a camera of IHU system 100 and a camera of computing device 310) to address the challenge of reliable authentication of a user (e.g., user 150), where such comparison and authentication may be invariant or adaptable to a variety of different lighting conditions. As previously described, the cameras of the IHU system 100 and the computing device 310 may be of the same type or different types, which provides additional flexibility. The models used in the system 100 and/or the computing device 310 may be trained using methods that can generate matchable features for the faces of the same person captured using different cameras. The disclosed techniques also reliably address faces at different distances/poses than the in-vehicle camera of IHU system 100 due to the robust process and the enrollment feature data stored in computing device 310 for different user poses.
These aspects can potentially be implemented without user intervention by the user 150, thereby providing a seamless "enter and drive" experience for the user 150. The model used by the IHU system 100 and/or the computing device 310 to compute biometric features allows the above workflow to work with different personal devices (e.g., personal devices running various different operating systems). Additionally, since any user's facial features reside on the user's personal device (e.g., trusted device 310), the user's private biometric traits and information reside only on the user's personal device, and not on the IHU system, which may be included in a shared vehicle potentially used by a variety of different individuals.
In some examples, the disclosed technology also enables use cases where a user can log into a rental/shared/rental car and have the same personalized experience without worrying about having to wipe out any personal information after the user runs out of vehicles. In these examples, the personal information is not stored in the IHU system 100 of such a vehicle, but instead is stored only on the user's personal device (e.g., device 310).
In some other examples, another use of the disclosed techniques may be for a ride share application to verify the identity of a registered driver (e.g., user 150) and use the IHU system 100 to prevent an unregistered individual who may have stolen or is otherwise carrying the registered driver's personal device from being able to accept any ride request. In certain other examples, the disclosed techniques may confirm identity or otherwise authenticate the user 150 of the vehicle prior to allowing the user 150 to operate the vehicle in order to prevent unauthorized individuals from operating the vehicle.
Fig. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process performed by an example computing system in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. For example, the process illustrated in fig. 7 may be performed by mobile computing device 170 (fig. 1), wearable device 107 (fig. 1), computing device 310 (fig. 3), and/or computing system 410 (fig. 4). For purposes of illustration only, the process of fig. 7 will be described with reference to operations performed by computing device 310.
The computing device 310 may establish (702) a connection with a vehicle computing system of a vehicle (e.g., IHU system 100). For example, computing device 310 may utilize one or more communication units (e.g., communication unit 446) to establish this connection. After establishing the connection, the computing device 310 may receive (704), from the vehicle computing system, first feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a user of the vehicle (e.g., the user 150). At least one image of a face of a user of the vehicle may be captured by an image capture device (e.g., camera 104, 111) connected to at least a portion of the vehicle.
Based on a comparison between the first feature data and second feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a previously registered user (e.g., user 338) (e.g., feature data associated with image 330 stored in registration information 328), computing device 310 may then determine (706) a match between the user of the vehicle and the previously registered user. Based on the match, the computing device 310 may authenticate (708) the user of the vehicle and send (710) authentication data for the user of the vehicle to the vehicle computing system, where the authentication data indicates the match.
Fig. 8 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process performed by an example vehicle computing system in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. For example, the process illustrated in fig. 8 may be performed by the vehicle computing system 100 and/or the computing system 410 (fig. 4) of fig. 1. For purposes of illustration only, the process of fig. 8 will be described with reference to operations performed by the vehicle computing system 100.
The vehicle computing system 100 may establish (802) a connection with a mobile computing device (e.g., the mobile computing device 170 of fig. 1, the wearable device 107 of fig. 1, the computing device 310 of fig. 3), wherein the vehicle computing system includes an infotainment head unit. The vehicle computing system 100 may determine (804) that a user (e.g., user 150) is present inside the vehicle. After determining that the user is present inside the vehicle, the vehicle computing system 100 captures (806) at least one image of the user's face using an image capture device (e.g., camera 104 and/or 111) connected to at least a portion of the vehicle.
The vehicle computing system 100 determines (808) first feature data associated with at least one image of a face of a user, and receives (810) authentication data for the user. The authentication data indicates a match between the user and a previously registered user.
