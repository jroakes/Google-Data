- FIGS. 4 and 5 are flow charts illustrating processes for controlling content delivery.
- a content provider such as an advertiser
- performance metrics relevant to a content provider include media cost per impression or media cost per action by a viewer of the content, including cost per click or cost per conversion.
- a content provider can set or adjust one or more parameters of a content distributor associated with the content distribution channel.
- the content distributor can be the paid search advertisement platform, such as the ADWORDS system operated by Google, Inc., that selects advertisements for display to users based on searched keywords and keyword bids submitted by content providers. Accordingly, the content provider can adjust their bids for each keyword, including adding or removing keywords, in an effort to find the most cost effective keywords and reduce a cost per click associated with an advertisement campaign.
- the paid search advertisement platform such as the ADWORDS system operated by Google, Inc.
- controllable parameters that an advertiser can adjust for each advertisement campaign can make it difficult to effectively and efficiently control the distribution, or improve performance of the advertisement campaign.
- an advertisement campaign can use thousands of keywords, or even tens of thousands of keywords. This results in thousands of parameters that may need to be adjusted in order to achieve optimal results. Further, such adjustment should be performed in an on-going basis so as to keep up with a dynamic and competitive market.
- the selected goal of the content provider involves a performance metric that is affected by multiple parameters
- achieving the goal can be difficult.
- a content provider must choose from thousands of parameter setting combinations when attempting to optimize the settings to achieve or approach the goal. For example, if a content provider selects to obtain a maximum amount of revenue from their total media budget, the content provider may need to adjust different parameters to increase a total number of impressions of their advertisements, while also reducing a cost per impression, and/or increasing a click through rate. Adjusting some content distribution parameters can impact different performance metrics differently.
- bidding higher on a keyword will likely increase a number of impressions of an advertisement, but will also increase a total cost for the advertisement. It can be difficult to predict whether and how much to adjust various parameters in order to strike an optimum balance between desired results and cost. This difficulty can be compounded by inexperience if the content provider is not an expert in using the distribution channel and is not familiar with the affect of such settings or adjustments.
- a content provider can benefit from at least partial automation of setting and or adjustment of distribution parameters.
- these difficulties can be overcome by a content distribution manager system that analyzes performance data regarding historical content distribution information, obtains performance metrics from the historical data, provides an indication of a relative quality of the achieved performance metrics, recommends adjustments to relevant distribution parameters based on a selected goal or combination of goals, and estimates the anticipated performance metrics that may be obtained if content is distributed with the recommended content distribution parameter settings.

- the customized rules and rule sets for the content provider 130 are stored in the storage device 243 .
- the content provider 130 can create customized rules and/or rule sets to encode such domain knowledge such that the content distribution manager 111 operates according to the best practices of the content provider. Additionally, the content provider 130 may simply have different goals, or may favor a different balance between goals from those achieved by the default rules and/or rule sets. Thus, depending on a selected goal or goal set, including selected rules or rule sets, the content distribution manager 111 can operate differently for different distribution channels, industries, or content providers to provide desired analysis of the content distribution information. The content distribution manager 111 also can operate using different rules or rule sets depending on the content for which analysis and recommendation are performed.
- a rule refining module can be included which is operable to adjust default or user-specific rules based on automatic analysis of available data. For example, where historical information indicates that modifying a rule like the default or user-specific rule in a particular way improves results in one or more performance metric with little or no cost, the rule refining module can automatically modify the default or user-specific rule in the particular way.
- the rule refining module can include learning algorithm, such as linear regressions or logistic regressions, among others.

- the recommendations may include a recommended adjustment of a paid search advertisement bid value for a keyword, a recommended adjustment of a budget value for a search advertisement or a display advertisement, a recommended adjustment of a budget for a campaign, or a recommended adjustment of a budget for a distribution channel.
- the output format can include an indication of a change to be applied to a current value for a current parameter, an indication of a new value for a current parameter, or an indication of a new value for a recommended new parameter.
- the recommendations can include a recommended change to a keyword bid value that is currently being used to distribute the advertisement, a new bid value (e.g., the recommended change taking into account the old bid value) for the keyword, and/or a new recommended bid amount for a keyword not currently being bid on by the content provider 130 .
- the content distribution manager outputs recommendations that are determined to achieve or approach a selected goal or goal set for the distribution of the content.
- distribution of the content using the output recommendations should result in derived performance metrics derived from future historical information which are closer to desired values than the currently derived values of the performance metrics.
- the content distribution manager 111 also automatically outputs estimations that relate to predicted results of accepting the recommendations (i.e., making an adjustment according to the recommendations), which should reflect in advance the expected improvements associated with the recommendations.
- the estimations can include expected content distribution data, such as expected clicks, expected impressions, expected rank, expected media cost, expected sales, expected revenue, or expected values for any other data collected by the content provider 130 and/or the content distributor 121 or 123 associated with the content.

- the normalizer module 221 processes the raw historical content distribution data to derive selected performance metrics according to rules stored on the storage device 243 ( 503 ).
- the normalizer module 221 derives a cost per click by dividing a number of times that content recipients 140 and 150 activated the advertisement by the total media cost for the advertisement over the time in which the clicks were received.
- the analysis of the raw historical content distribution data is performed once per day, and/or on-demand, although other periodic intervals can be used.
- a click-through rate, a return on investment, a cost per action, average position, and/or other performance metrics are similarly derived according to rules associated with the piece of content.
- the derived performance metrics and/or selected pieces of raw data such as a number of clicks, prior bid amount, prior minimum position, a number of sales, a value of the sales, and/or other data are provided to the content provider 130 for review.
- the normalizer module 221 can derive other performance metrics based on default or customized rules.
- one or more of the performance metrics can be based, at least in part, on activity of the content distributor 121 that does not involve the advertisement.
- a market share metric can be derived by dividing a total number of impressions of the advertisement divided by a total number of searches that were requested by all users that included a keyword for which the content provider 130 has placed a bid for the advertisement.
- the analysis can provide the content provider with a reference point for the performance of the advertisement relative to other similar and/or competing advertisements.
- raw values of such channel-wide parameters can also be displayed without derivation, as can selected values specific to the performance of the advertisement.
- channel-wide values for cost per click, click-through rate, or other performance metrics can be derived and provided to the content provider for review.
- the resulting performance metrics and/or data values for each component of the campaign are categorized ( 505 ) by the categorizer module 223 to obtain metric driver values according to selected rules and the metric driver values are provided to the content provider 130 for review.
- the metric driver values can be qualitative, e.g., text descriptors selected from a group, e.g., excellent, good, average, poor, and badly, of the driver values can be quantitative, e.g., positive or negative integer values selected from a predetermined range, e.g., ⁇ 5 to +5.
- the metric driver values indicate an extent to which the campaign component drives, or affects, the data value or performance metric, and its relative performance compared to other components of the campaign.
- a click driver value which indicates a relationship between a keyword and the number of clicks obtained from the advertisement, can be obtained by the categorizer module 223 based on the average number of clicks for all keywords. For example, if the number of clicks associated with a keyword is 50% higher than the average, it may be considered excellent in terms of driving clicks. Thus, the click driver value associated with the keyword can be “excellent” or “5” on a scale from 1 to 5.
- the categorizer uses a threshold rule extracted from domain practices, which indicates that 50% is an appropriate threshold for a value of excellent. The value of excellent indicates that the budget spent on the keyword is highly effective at generating clicks on the advertisement, and is better than other keywords in consideration which have lower click driver values.
- the average position, the click-through rate, and the number of clicks, among others, can also affect the click driver value, or other metric driver values.
- other drivers are obtained, such as a growth driver that indicates whether spending additional budget for the campaign component will yield a greater number of impressions.
- the drivers can be obtained on channel-wide data, such as by a rule that categorizes cost per click based on a number of standard deviations from an average cost per click for the channel (or industry or content provider). It is important to note that nearly any performance metric and/or driver value can be derived and obtained by the normalizer module 221 and the categorizer module 223 by authoring an appropriate rule.
- the driver values may frequently be more helpful than the actual metric values.
- an inexperienced advertiser (even if experienced in other forms of advertising, but new to a particular channel) may not be adequately familiar with the channel or industry to learn anything of value from an indication that a cost per click associated with a keyword is fifteen cents.
- a default rule that provides the advertiser with a driver value for clicks that can be compared to a scale can be more helpful.
- the transformer module 225 transforms the driver values into recommended action levels regarding content distribution settings ( 507 ).
- the recommended action levels are designed to reflect a desired action based on an associated driver value, such that an advertisers best practices are automatically implemented based on the analysis of the historical data, which allows the advertisers budget to be spent more effectively, increasing performance by increasing budget allocation to productive campaign components and decreasing budget allocation to unproductive campaign components.
- Transforming the drivers involves, for example, obtaining a recommended action, such as “bid up by 2 levels,” from a set of rules.
- the recommended action levels can be independent, such as increase (or reduce) bid or budget by a predetermined amount, or by a predetermined percentage of a current amount.
- the recommended action levels can also be dependent on another value, such as where a bid is increased by ten percent of the channel-wide average bid, or to five percent greater than the average bid value associated with a rank one position closer to a desired rank than the current average rank of the advertisement.
- the analyzer 210 can associate the recommended action levels with portions of the driver value range, such that if a driver value falls within a first exclusive range, a first recommended action level is provided, and if the driver value falls in a second exclusive range, a second different action level is provided.
- other rule formats can be employed to obtain the recommended action levels for content distribution settings based on one or more driver values. Referring back the to the previous example, the combination of an “excellent” cost per click driver, an “excellent” growth driver, and an “excellent” click-through rate driver can result in a recommended action level to bid up on the associated campaign component.
- Current content distribution settings are then converted by the converter module 227 to recommended content distribution settings ( 509 ).
- the conversion from a current content distribution setting to a recommended content distribution setting is performed according to one or more rule based on one or more recommended action levels.
- a recommended content distribution setting is, for example, a recommended bid amount for a given keyword in a given advertising channel.
- Two or more recommended action levels may be obtained for the same content distribution setting, and the rules can be configured to account for contradictory or confirmatory recommended action levels for the same content distribution setting.
- the recommended action levels for a content distribution setting for a campaign component can be summed to obtain a net recommended action level, which can be applied to the current setting to obtain the recommended content distribution setting.
- the recommended content distribution settings are provided to the content provider for review.
- predicted values for selected parameters and performance metrics are estimated by the estimator module 229 , and the estimated value predictions are provided to the content provider 130 ( 511 ).
- the estimator module 229 estimates a predicted result of accepting the recommended actions levels and/or the recommended distribution settings such that the content provider can understand what the current rules and rule sets will, when implemented without adjustment or revision, obtain as a result. For example, the estimator module 229 could predict that modifying a current bid level in an advertisement channel to a recommended bid level would result in an increase in the number of advertisement impressions delivered by the content distributor 121 to the recipients 140 and 150 through the affected distribution channel. A corresponding increase in media cost for the keyword can also be estimated and provided to the content provider 130 .
- the process 500 can include other tiers of recommendation and estimation.
- the converter module 227 can convert the current content distribution settings to recommended content distribution settings based on recommended action levels for multiple campaign components, including campaign components from different campaigns, and/or based on content distribution settings for one or more campaigns and/or across campaigns.
- the recommended action levels for a keyword of a paid search advertisement can, according to rules associated with the keyword and as described above, be combined to obtain a recommended action level for a bid associated with the keyword.
- the converter module 227 can further combine and/or compare such a recommended action level for the bid based on the performance metrics and data of the keyword with performance recommended action levels for bids of different keywords in the campaign, and adjust one or more recommended bid action level(s) in order to ensure that the total effect of all the recommended bid action levels does not result in the new bids exceeding a predetermined campaign budget.
- the converter module 227 can combine and/or compare bid action levels of keywords in different campaigns, and adjust one or more of the recommended bid action levels to achieve a predetermined result, such as a minimum possible cost per click (optionally while receiving at least a minimum number of clicks, or the like).
- the converter module 227 can, according to another rule or rule set, adjust the recommendation by increasing the bid for one keyword more than an amount associated with the recommended action level because a current or estimated cost per click associated with the first keyword is less than the cost per click of the second keyword.

Abstract
Distributing content using one or more content distributors associated with respective content distribution channels is based on an analysis of historical content distribution information and analysis rules. Recommended actions are provided to a content provider along with estimations of predicted results.
Description
- This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/245,832, filed Sep. 25, 2009, and entitled “Controlling Content Distribution,” which application is incorporated herein by reference.
- This disclosure relates to controlling content distribution within and across content distribution channels.
- Media content may be distributed to provide many types of communication, such as news, entertainment, business, or other communication. Advertisements, for example, may be distributed to communicate information relating to goods and/or services of an associated advertising entity, or to communicate other information to an audience. One form of media content includes electronic advertisements, such as those distributed on the Internet or other communication networks. For electronic advertisements and other forms of media content, advertising entities or other suppliers of media content may desire to deliver media content across one or more selected content distribution channels, including print, radio, television, on-line search engine, on-line display, or email channels, in order to achieve, with a limited budget or other constraints, a suitable return on investment or other performance metrics. Such media content suppliers are able to control distribution of content by selectively setting and/or adjusting one or more distribution parameters. Frequently, different distribution channels involve different distribution parameters. For example, some distribution channels may be competitive, and the content of a highest bidder may be selected for distribution such that bid price is an adjustable parameter controlled by the content suppliers. Other channels may be reservation based, and the content will be distributed at a fixed cost per delivery until an adjustable budget is reached in a fixed period of time. Accordingly, the paid search channel allows an advertiser to choose the keywords, bids for the keywords, and a daily budget, among other parameters, to control the distribution of advertisements. The display channel allows an advertiser to choose publishers to which the advertisements are to be delivered, the total number of impressions per day and/or per campaign, budgets for one or more publishers, and campaign duration, among other parameters. Thus, from an advertiser's perspective, it is important to decide how to allocate budget among different distribution channels, and within a channel, as well as to decide how to tune the distribution parameters of the selected channels so as to optimize the advertisement campaign goals.
- In one general implementation, distributing content includes receiving, in a content manager, content distribution information regarding how content is to be distributed, automatically analyzing historical data stored in a storage device accessible by the content manager, adjusting the content distribution information based on the analysis of the historical data, and distributing content based on the adjusted content distribution information. Analyzing the historical data includes, normalizing the historical data to obtain a performance metric, categorizing the performance metric to obtain metric driver value, transforming the metric driver value to a recommended action regarding a content distribution setting, and estimating a predicted result of accepting the recommended action.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the content distribution information can include information regarding a content distribution channel and content distribution control settings for a content distribution system associated with the content distribution channel, and adjusting the information can include adjusting at least one content distribution control setting for the content distribution system. Distributing content can also include generating recommendation information regarding a recommended adjustment of the content distribution information based on the analysis of the historical data. Adjusting the content distribution information can include adjusting the content distribution information based on the recommended adjustment. Distributing content can also include providing the recommendation information to a user and receiving approved adjustment information from the user, and adjusting the content distribution information can include adjusting the content distribution information based on the approved adjustment information. The recommendation information can include information regarding adjustment of a content distribution setting associated with a content distribution system. The recommendation information can include information regarding adjustment of a content distribution channel. Distributing content can also include receiving rule authoring information from a user and creating a custom rule according to the rule authoring information, and analyzing the historical data can include analyzing the historical data based on the custom rule. Creating the custom rule can include adjusting a default rule. Adjusting the content distribution information can include modifying at least one of content bid information and content budget information based on the recommended setting. Analyzing the historical data can also include converting a current content distribution setting to a recommended content distribution setting based on the recommended action, and estimating a predicted result can include estimating a performance metric predicted to result from distributing content based on the recommended setting.
- In another general aspect advertising includes receiving, in an advertisement distribution manager, advertisement information comprising advertisement channel information and channel setting information, analyzing, by the advertisement distribution manager, historical advertisement information based on rules selected from a rule repository, the rules being selected from among default rules and customized rules, the rules being selected based on the advertisement channel information, and automatically outputting, by the advertisement distribution manager, recommendation information regarding a recommended channel setting. Analyzing the historical advertisement information includes normalizing the historical advertisement information to obtain a performance metric, transforming the performance metric to recommendation information regarding a recommended channel setting, and estimating a predicted result of accepting the recommendation information.
- In another general aspect, managing advertisement distribution includes storing advertisement distribution rule information on a storage device to create an advertisement distribution rule library, each rule being associated with at least one advertisement distribution channel, receiving advertisement distribution information regarding distribution of at least one advertisement, the distribution information being associated with a user and comprising information regarding at least one distribution channel, analyzing advertisement distribution history data using rules selected from the advertisement rule library based on the advertisement distribution information, and providing, to the user, adjustment information based on the analysis, the adjustment information comprising a recommended distribution setting of a distribution system associated with the advertisement distribution information.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, analyzing the advertisement distribution history data can include analyzing advertisement distribution history data for at least one advertisement associated with the user. Analyzing the advertisement distribution history data can also include analyzing advertisement distribution history data for an advertisement distribution channel. Managing advertisement distribution can also include creating a custom rule associated with a user, and including advertisement distribution rule information associated with the custom rule in the rule library, and analyzing advertisement distribution history data uses the custom rule.
- In another general aspect, a content distribution management system includes an analysis rule library repository including rules regarding analysis of content distribution information, a user data repository, and a content distribution analyzer computer processor. The content distribution analyzer computer processor includes an analysis pipeline configured to analyze content distribution history data according to selected rules of the rule library repository. The selected rules are selected based on information of the user data repository. Analysis of the content distribution historical data includes normalizing the historical data to obtain a performance metric, transforming the performance metric to a recommended action regarding a content distribution setting, estimating a predicted result of accepting the recommended action, and outputting the recommended action
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the content distribution management system can also include a rule authoring module operable to create a rule in the rule library for use in analyzing content distribution history data. The analysis pipeline of the content distribution analyzer computer processor is further configured to modify at leas one of content bid information and content budget information based on the recommended setting. The content distribution management can also include a converter module configured to change a current content distribution setting to a recommended content distribution setting based on the recommended action, and the estimator can be configured to estimate a performance metric predicted to result from distributing content based on the recommended setting.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.
-
FIG. 1 is an illustration of a system for controlling distribution of media content. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a content distribution manager. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a computer system operable in the system ofFIG. 1 . -
FIGS. 4 and 5 are flow charts illustrating processes for controlling content delivery. - Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- In many situations, a content provider, such as an advertiser, may wish to distribute content in such a way as to achieve a desired result, such as reaching a large audience for great dissemination of content. Some content providers, including advertisers, may want to improve one or more performance metrics, such as a return on investment on their advertising budget. In some instances, performance metrics relevant to a content provider include media cost per impression or media cost per action by a viewer of the content, including cost per click or cost per conversion. In an attempt to achieve a selected goal, such as achieving a lowest possible cost per click, or a selected combination of goals, a content provider can set or adjust one or more parameters of a content distributor associated with the content distribution channel. For example, in an on-line search advertising distribution channel, the content distributor can be the paid search advertisement platform, such as the ADWORDS system operated by Google, Inc., that selects advertisements for display to users based on searched keywords and keyword bids submitted by content providers. Accordingly, the content provider can adjust their bids for each keyword, including adding or removing keywords, in an effort to find the most cost effective keywords and reduce a cost per click associated with an advertisement campaign.
- Often the number of controllable parameters that an advertiser can adjust for each advertisement campaign can make it difficult to effectively and efficiently control the distribution, or improve performance of the advertisement campaign. For example, in a paid search channel, an advertisement campaign can use thousands of keywords, or even tens of thousands of keywords. This results in thousands of parameters that may need to be adjusted in order to achieve optimal results. Further, such adjustment should be performed in an on-going basis so as to keep up with a dynamic and competitive market.
- In addition, especially where the selected goal of the content provider involves a performance metric that is affected by multiple parameters, achieving the goal can be difficult. In some distribution channels, there can be multiple parameters that affect a given performance metric, and each parameter can have multiple setting values. Thus, a content provider must choose from thousands of parameter setting combinations when attempting to optimize the settings to achieve or approach the goal. For example, if a content provider selects to obtain a maximum amount of revenue from their total media budget, the content provider may need to adjust different parameters to increase a total number of impressions of their advertisements, while also reducing a cost per impression, and/or increasing a click through rate. Adjusting some content distribution parameters can impact different performance metrics differently. For example, bidding higher on a keyword will likely increase a number of impressions of an advertisement, but will also increase a total cost for the advertisement. It can be difficult to predict whether and how much to adjust various parameters in order to strike an optimum balance between desired results and cost. This difficulty can be compounded by inexperience if the content provider is not an expert in using the distribution channel and is not familiar with the affect of such settings or adjustments.
- Thus, it is very time consuming and complex for an individual to adjust such a large set of parameters manually in a timely manor. In many situations, a content provider can benefit from at least partial automation of setting and or adjustment of distribution parameters. For example, these difficulties can be overcome by a content distribution manager system that analyzes performance data regarding historical content distribution information, obtains performance metrics from the historical data, provides an indication of a relative quality of the achieved performance metrics, recommends adjustments to relevant distribution parameters based on a selected goal or combination of goals, and estimates the anticipated performance metrics that may be obtained if content is distributed with the recommended content distribution parameter settings.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , asystem 100 for distributing content, including advertisements includes, for example, acontent distribution manager 111, acontent provider 130,content recipients content distributors storage devices system 100, and/or which may be connected by anetwork 190, such as the Internet. Thecontent distributors content provider 130, such as an advertiser, to thecontent recipients content distribution manager 111 is operable to provide recommendations regarding control of thecontent distributors content distributors content distribution manager 111, thecontent provider 130, thecontent recipients content distributors storage devices computer 300, illustrated inFIG. 3 , includes aprocessor 310,memory modules 330, astorage device 320, and input-output modules 340 connected by asystem bus 360. The input-output modules 340 are operable with one or more input and/oroutput devices 350, including a communication device for operable connection with thenetwork 190 and with the other components of thesystem 100. - In some implementations, the
content distributors content distributors content distributors content provider 130, to contentrecipients content recipients content distributors content recipients content distributor 121 can distribute advertisements based on search query keywords of a search requested by one or more of thecontent recipients content provider 130. Similarly, thecontent distributor 125 can distribute advertisements based on reservations of advertisement slots made by content providers, including thecontent provider 130. - Information regarding bids and reservations, among other information, is stored on the
storage devices content distributors content distributors content provider 130. Additionally, information regarding these parameters can also be stored on thestorage devices content distributors storage devices storage devices content distributors content provider 130 to set and/or adjust selected parameter settings of thecontent distributors content distributors content provider 130. - The
content distribution manager 111 is operable at least with thecontent provider 130 to facilitate control of the distribution of the content associated with thecontent provider 130 through one or more of thecontent distributors content distribution manager 111 is configured to receive content distribution information from thecontent distributors 121 and/or 125, thestorage devices 123 and/or 127, and/or from thecontent provider 130. Additionally, thecontent distribution manager 111 is configured to analyze the content distribution information, to provide recommendations regarding distribution parameter settings and/or adjustments thereto, and to estimate a predicted result of distributing content using such recommended settings and/or adjustments. In some implementations, thecontent distribution manager 111 is configured to receive information regarding review, acceptance, and/or modification of the recommended settings and/or adjustments to the distribution parameters, and to transmit parameter setting and/or adjustment information to one or more of thecontent distributors - For example, the
content distribution manager 111 receives raw historical data regarding delivered impressions of an advertisement, such as total impressions, total clicks, media cost, total actions, total actions by advertisement. Based on the received data, thecontent distribution manager 111 calculates selected performance metrics, such as cost per impression, cost per click, cost per conversion, and click through rate for the advertisement. The content distribution manager can determine that a bid for a first keyword associated with the advertisement should be increased, and/or that a bid for a second keyword should be decreased in order to reduce the cost per click associated with the advertisement. The specific amounts of bid increase and decrease can be selected such that an anticipated media cost for distribution of the advertisement using the recommended bid amounts will not exceed a predetermined budget. The recommended bid amounts and/or bid adjustments can be provided to thecontent provider 130 for review, acceptance, rejection, and or modification. After receiving input from thecontent provider 130, the content distribution manager can output the recommended distribution parameter settings for use in distributing content. In some implementations, thecontent distribution manager 111 can directly set or adjust the distribution parameter settings of thecontent distributors - Referring to
FIG. 2 , thecontent distribution manager 111 can include a rule library stored on astorage device 243. The rule library contains, for example, advertisement distribution rule information, analysis rule information, and/or estimation rule information. Each rule in the library is associated with at least one of thecontent distributors content provider 130. Thecontent distribution manager 111 also includes a data structure stored on astorage device 241 that includes information regarding thecontent provider 130, computer executable instructions or computer software, and other data. Thecontent distribution manager 111 also includes ananalyzer 210 comprising an analysis pipeline having analysis modules 221-231, a rule-authoring module 251, and an input/output interface 261. - The
analyzer 210 is configured to analyze the content distribution information received over thenetwork 190 through the input/output interface 261 from, for example,storage devices content distributors analyzer 210 is configured to analyze the content distribution information according to one or more selected rules of the rule library in conjunction with operating software stored on thestorage device 241. The rules can include default rules or rule sets and/or custom rules or rule sets in the rule library created using the rule-authoring module 251 by thecontent provider 130, or by another user, such as an operator of thecontent distribution manager 111. Theanalyzer 210 includes anormalizer module 221 that is configured to derive at least one performance metric based on received content distribution information. Theanalyzer 210 also includes acategorizer module 223 configured to obtain driver values based on the content distribution information and/or derived performance metrics, atransformer module 225 configured to obtain a recommended action regarding a content distribution setting based, at least in part, on driver values, and aconverter module 227 configured to derive a recommended content distribution setting based, at least in part, on a current content distribution setting and on a recommended action. Theanalyzer 210 also includes anestimator module 229 configured to forecast a result of accepting the recommended action and/or to estimate expected content distribution data predicted to result from distributing content using the recommended content distribution settings. Thecontent distribution manager 111 can also include one or more additional modules, such as aninterface module 231 configured to provide additional functionality, such as to receive inputs from thecontent provider 130, or other user, regarding acceptance, rejection, or alteration of a recommended content distribution setting, and/or to implement accepted recommendations in a content distributor. - In use, and as illustrated in
FIG. 4 , aprocess 400 includes receiving, by thecontent distribution manager 111, information regarding content distribution (401). The content distribution information is associated with thecontent provider 130 and includes information regarding at least one content item, such as an advertisement, and at least one content distribution channel. For example, the content distribution information can include information identifying a particular advertisement associated with a particular advertiser which is to be distributed through a particular channel. The distribution information can further include information regarding content distribution control settings and/or channel setting information. For example, the content distribution information can include advertising campaign information, such as a total budget, a channel budget, a budget fraction, a campaign duration, a priority indication, a bid price, a minimum position, or other general information regarding the advertisement and/or the advertiser's goals or plans. The specific type of content distribution information that is included will often depend on the type of advertisement and/or the type of distribution channel. For example, a search advertisement can include keyword bid information regarding a maximum price or price component to be paid for selecting the advertisement for display in response to a search including the keyword and a minimum display rank regarding acceptable positions in a list of advertisements, whereas a display advertisement can include scheduling information indicating how many times and how often the advertisement is to be displayed, size information, position information regarding a position on a display, and location information regarding a web page on which the advertisement is to be displayed. In addition, the content distribution information can include targeting information for use in selecting content recipients to receive the content. - In cases where the content has previously been distributed through the channel, the content distribution information also includes historical data associated with such distribution. For example, if the content is an advertisement, and the channel is the paid
search advertisement channel 121, the content distribution information includes raw data regarding each instance where an advertisement was delivered by the paidsearch advertisement channel 121 in response to an advertisement request. The requests can be based on search queries that include a keyword for which thecontent provider 130 placed a bid for the advertisement. In this example, the content distribution data includes a rank assigned to the advertisement for each time the advertisement was considered, an indication of whether the advertisement was delivered, an indication of the rank of the slot for each instance that the advertisement was selected and/or delivered, an indication of whether the advertisement was viewed, selected or activated by a content viewer, and an indication of whether a subsequent action, such as a purchase, occurred as a result of viewing, selecting or activating the advertisement. Other data can also be collected regarding distribution of the content. - Where a display advertisement channel is involved, the content distribution information can include data such as a number of times that an impression of the advertisement was delivered, an indication of the locations to which impressions of the advertisement were delivered, a number of times that the impression of the advertisement was viewed, selected, and/or activated by a content viewer, and/or a number of times that the subsequent action was taken. The data can also include per event cost data and summary cost data, including total media cost for the advertisement. In some implementations, the content distribution information includes all data available from a
content provider 130 and/or one or more of thecontent distributors content provider 130 and/or one or more of thecontent distributors - After receiving the content distribution information transmitted by the
content provider 130, thecontent distributor 121, and/or thecontent distributor 125, thecontent distribution manager 111 automatically analyzes the content distribution information (403), which is stored on thestorage device 241. In some implementations, the content distribution information can be stored on one or more of thestorage devices content distribution manager 111 can receive the content distribution information by accessing the storage devices containing the information. The analysis of the content distribution information is performed according to one or more rules or rule sets selected from the rule library based on the received content distribution information. - For example, information identifying the
content provider 130 may be sufficient to allow thecontent distribution manager 111 to select a rule or rule set associated with thecontent provider 130. In some implementations, the content provider may have different rules or rule sets defined for different advertisements, advertisement campaigns, advertisement channels, and/or time periods, and thecontent distribution manager 111 selects the appropriate rule or rule set based on these parameters, or any other desired criteria. Such rules, or rule sets, can be associated with different settings of thecontent distribution manager 111, which may be associated with different goals or goal sets of thecontent provider 130. As an example, thecontent distribution manager 111 can include a single setting, such as a “maximize return on investment” setting, that is configured to cause the content distribution manager to utilize a predefined (including where defined by the content provider 130) rule or rule set that is designed to maximize or increase a return on investment for a media budget. Other settings can also be included, such as a “maximize impressions” setting, a “maximize clicks” setting, a “maximize click-through rate” setting, a “minimize cost per click” setting, or another setting selected by thecontent provider 130. Such settings can be used for the entire account of the content provider, a single campaign, or a particular advertisement. Alternatively, no global settings can be used, and specific rules or rule sets can be defined for each analysis action. - When such a goal of optimization is selected, the content distribution manager can automatically analyze the historical information, automatically provide recommended actions and/or distribution channel settings, and/or implement the recommended actions. The automatic actions are performed according to selected rules or rule sets. The rules and/or rule sets can include default rules available to all content providers for an associated content distribution channel, or customized rules specifically associated with the
content provider 130, and the rule sets can also be default rule sets or customized rule sets. Such customized rules or rule sets are authored by content providers, or other users of thecontent distribution manager 111, using the rule-authoring module 251. In some implementations, the content provider can create customized rules or rule sets by adjusting default rules or rule sets and/or by creating new rules and rule sets which are not based on any default rule. The customized rules and rule sets for thecontent provider 130 are stored in thestorage device 243. - For example, where the
content provider 130 has a domain knowledge regarding a particular product, industry, distribution channel, or targeted recipient or group of recipients, thecontent provider 130 can create customized rules and/or rule sets to encode such domain knowledge such that thecontent distribution manager 111 operates according to the best practices of the content provider. Additionally, thecontent provider 130 may simply have different goals, or may favor a different balance between goals from those achieved by the default rules and/or rule sets. Thus, depending on a selected goal or goal set, including selected rules or rule sets, thecontent distribution manager 111 can operate differently for different distribution channels, industries, or content providers to provide desired analysis of the content distribution information. Thecontent distribution manager 111 also can operate using different rules or rule sets depending on the content for which analysis and recommendation are performed. - Additionally, a rule refining module can be included which is operable to adjust default or user-specific rules based on automatic analysis of available data. For example, where historical information indicates that modifying a rule like the default or user-specific rule in a particular way improves results in one or more performance metric with little or no cost, the rule refining module can automatically modify the default or user-specific rule in the particular way. For example, the rule refining module can include learning algorithm, such as linear regressions or logistic regressions, among others. Thus, the
content distribution manager 111 can dynamically create and modify rules to assist users achieve or approach their selected goals. - Following completion of the analysis (403), the
content distribution manager 111 automatically outputs recommendations and estimations to thecontent provider 130 regarding one or more content distribution settings based on the analysis (405). For example, the recommendations may include a recommended adjustment of a paid search advertisement bid value for a keyword, a recommended adjustment of a budget value for a search advertisement or a display advertisement, a recommended adjustment of a budget for a campaign, or a recommended adjustment of a budget for a distribution channel. The output format can include an indication of a change to be applied to a current value for a current parameter, an indication of a new value for a current parameter, or an indication of a new value for a recommended new parameter. In the context of a search advertisement, the recommendations can include a recommended change to a keyword bid value that is currently being used to distribute the advertisement, a new bid value (e.g., the recommended change taking into account the old bid value) for the keyword, and/or a new recommended bid amount for a keyword not currently being bid on by thecontent provider 130. As discussed above, by use of the rules or rule sets, the content distribution manager outputs recommendations that are determined to achieve or approach a selected goal or goal set for the distribution of the content. Thus, distribution of the content using the output recommendations should result in derived performance metrics derived from future historical information which are closer to desired values than the currently derived values of the performance metrics. - The
content distribution manager 111 also automatically outputs estimations that relate to predicted results of accepting the recommendations (i.e., making an adjustment according to the recommendations), which should reflect in advance the expected improvements associated with the recommendations. The estimations can include expected content distribution data, such as expected clicks, expected impressions, expected rank, expected media cost, expected sales, expected revenue, or expected values for any other data collected by thecontent provider 130 and/or thecontent distributor analyzer 210 based on rules or rule sets stored in thestorage device 243, such as those associated with a selected goal or goal set, and are intended to provide desired results if accepted. However, thecontent provider 130 is able to accept or reject (including by modification) the recommended actions associated with the recommendations. - Then, based on the accepted or modified recommendation information, the
content distribution manager 111 performs appropriate adjustments of the content distribution settings of the content distributor (407). The adjustments can include directly adjusting distribution settings of one or morecontent distributors content distribution manager 111. The content is then distributed based on the adjusted content distribution settings (409) and content distribution data is collected (411) based on such distribution. The content distribution data resulting from the distribution ofstep 409 can be collected in preparation for a subsequent analysis (403), enabling an iterative content distribution control process. As will be understood, repeated iterations of the analysis, recommendation, and implementation functions of thecontent manager 111 can quickly approach an optimum performance level for the content distribution relative to the selected goal or goal set. However, as thecontent provider 130 revises the goal or goal set, thecontent distribution manager 111 will automatically recommend or adjust the settings of thecontent distributors content distribution manager 111 can automatically recommend or adjust the settings of thecontent distributors content distributors 121 an/or 125, or other changes in the content distribution environment by repeated and/or periodic analysis of the historical information, and generation of recommended actions. - In some implementations, the
content distribution manager 111 can executeprocess 500, illustrated inFIG. 5 , which includes receiving historical content distribution data (501). The historical content distribution data includes raw data collected by thecontent distributor 121, for example. For each campaign, such as a group of keywords for a paid search advertisement or a group of advertisement slots for a display ad, thecontent distribution manager 111 normalizes the historical content distribution data for each component of the campaign to obtain performance metrics for the campaign and campaign components over a selected period of time. For example, thenormalizer module 221 processes the raw historical content distribution data to derive selected performance metrics according to rules stored on the storage device 243 (503). - In the paid search advertisement example discussed above, the
normalizer module 221 derives a cost per click by dividing a number of times thatcontent recipients content provider 130 for review. - Additionally or alternatively, the
normalizer module 221 can derive other performance metrics based on default or customized rules. In some implementations, one or more of the performance metrics can be based, at least in part, on activity of thecontent distributor 121 that does not involve the advertisement. For example, a market share metric can be derived by dividing a total number of impressions of the advertisement divided by a total number of searches that were requested by all users that included a keyword for which thecontent provider 130 has placed a bid for the advertisement. Thus, the analysis can provide the content provider with a reference point for the performance of the advertisement relative to other similar and/or competing advertisements. As should be understood, raw values of such channel-wide parameters can also be displayed without derivation, as can selected values specific to the performance of the advertisement. Similarly, channel-wide values for cost per click, click-through rate, or other performance metrics can be derived and provided to the content provider for review. - The resulting performance metrics and/or data values for each component of the campaign are categorized (505) by the
categorizer module 223 to obtain metric driver values according to selected rules and the metric driver values are provided to thecontent provider 130 for review. In some implementations, the metric driver values can be qualitative, e.g., text descriptors selected from a group, e.g., excellent, good, average, poor, and terrible, of the driver values can be quantitative, e.g., positive or negative integer values selected from a predetermined range, e.g., −5 to +5. The metric driver values indicate an extent to which the campaign component drives, or affects, the data value or performance metric, and its relative performance compared to other components of the campaign. For example, a click driver value, which indicates a relationship between a keyword and the number of clicks obtained from the advertisement, can be obtained by thecategorizer module 223 based on the average number of clicks for all keywords. For example, if the number of clicks associated with a keyword is 50% higher than the average, it may be considered excellent in terms of driving clicks. Thus, the click driver value associated with the keyword can be “excellent” or “5” on a scale from 1 to 5. Here, the categorizer uses a threshold rule extracted from domain practices, which indicates that 50% is an appropriate threshold for a value of excellent. The value of excellent indicates that the budget spent on the keyword is highly effective at generating clicks on the advertisement, and is better than other keywords in consideration which have lower click driver values. The average position, the click-through rate, and the number of clicks, among others, can also affect the click driver value, or other metric driver values. Similarly, other drivers are obtained, such as a growth driver that indicates whether spending additional budget for the campaign component will yield a greater number of impressions. Also, the drivers can be obtained on channel-wide data, such as by a rule that categorizes cost per click based on a number of standard deviations from an average cost per click for the channel (or industry or content provider). It is important to note that nearly any performance metric and/or driver value can be derived and obtained by thenormalizer module 221 and thecategorizer module 223 by authoring an appropriate rule. - Particularly for inexperienced content providers, the driver values may frequently be more helpful than the actual metric values. For example, an inexperienced advertiser (even if experienced in other forms of advertising, but new to a particular channel) may not be adequately familiar with the channel or industry to learn anything of value from an indication that a cost per click associated with a keyword is fifteen cents. Thus, a default rule that provides the advertiser with a driver value for clicks that can be compared to a scale can be more helpful.
- The
transformer module 225 transforms the driver values into recommended action levels regarding content distribution settings (507). The recommended action levels are designed to reflect a desired action based on an associated driver value, such that an advertisers best practices are automatically implemented based on the analysis of the historical data, which allows the advertisers budget to be spent more effectively, increasing performance by increasing budget allocation to productive campaign components and decreasing budget allocation to unproductive campaign components. Transforming the drivers involves, for example, obtaining a recommended action, such as “bid up by 2 levels,” from a set of rules. The recommended action levels can be independent, such as increase (or reduce) bid or budget by a predetermined amount, or by a predetermined percentage of a current amount. The recommended action levels can also be dependent on another value, such as where a bid is increased by ten percent of the channel-wide average bid, or to five percent greater than the average bid value associated with a rank one position closer to a desired rank than the current average rank of the advertisement. - In some implementations, the
analyzer 210 can associate the recommended action levels with portions of the driver value range, such that if a driver value falls within a first exclusive range, a first recommended action level is provided, and if the driver value falls in a second exclusive range, a second different action level is provided. However, other rule formats can be employed to obtain the recommended action levels for content distribution settings based on one or more driver values. Referring back the to the previous example, the combination of an “excellent” cost per click driver, an “excellent” growth driver, and an “excellent” click-through rate driver can result in a recommended action level to bid up on the associated campaign component. - Current content distribution settings are then converted by the
converter module 227 to recommended content distribution settings (509). The conversion from a current content distribution setting to a recommended content distribution setting is performed according to one or more rule based on one or more recommended action levels. A recommended content distribution setting is, for example, a recommended bid amount for a given keyword in a given advertising channel. Two or more recommended action levels may be obtained for the same content distribution setting, and the rules can be configured to account for contradictory or confirmatory recommended action levels for the same content distribution setting. For example, the recommended action levels for a content distribution setting for a campaign component can be summed to obtain a net recommended action level, which can be applied to the current setting to obtain the recommended content distribution setting. The recommended content distribution settings are provided to the content provider for review. - Additionally, predicted values for selected parameters and performance metrics are estimated by the
estimator module 229, and the estimated value predictions are provided to the content provider 130 (511). Theestimator module 229 estimates a predicted result of accepting the recommended actions levels and/or the recommended distribution settings such that the content provider can understand what the current rules and rule sets will, when implemented without adjustment or revision, obtain as a result. For example, theestimator module 229 could predict that modifying a current bid level in an advertisement channel to a recommended bid level would result in an increase in the number of advertisement impressions delivered by thecontent distributor 121 to therecipients content provider 130. - Additionally, the
process 500 can include other tiers of recommendation and estimation. For example, theconverter module 227 can convert the current content distribution settings to recommended content distribution settings based on recommended action levels for multiple campaign components, including campaign components from different campaigns, and/or based on content distribution settings for one or more campaigns and/or across campaigns. In a simple example, the recommended action levels for a keyword of a paid search advertisement can, according to rules associated with the keyword and as described above, be combined to obtain a recommended action level for a bid associated with the keyword. In addition, theconverter module 227 can further combine and/or compare such a recommended action level for the bid based on the performance metrics and data of the keyword with performance recommended action levels for bids of different keywords in the campaign, and adjust one or more recommended bid action level(s) in order to ensure that the total effect of all the recommended bid action levels does not result in the new bids exceeding a predetermined campaign budget. Similarly, theconverter module 227 can combine and/or compare bid action levels of keywords in different campaigns, and adjust one or more of the recommended bid action levels to achieve a predetermined result, such as a minimum possible cost per click (optionally while receiving at least a minimum number of clicks, or the like). Thus, where two keywords both merit an increased bid according to respective rules or rule sets associated with each, theconverter module 227 can, according to another rule or rule set, adjust the recommendation by increasing the bid for one keyword more than an amount associated with the recommended action level because a current or estimated cost per click associated with the first keyword is less than the cost per click of the second keyword. - As will be understood by those skilled in the art, implementations of the disclosed subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification, such as the
