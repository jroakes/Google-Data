Definitions
- the invention generally relates to search engines. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and systems for improving search rankings using advertising data.
- a search engine or search engine program is a widely used mechanism for allowing users to search vast numbers of documents for information.
- Automated search engines locate websites by matching terms from a user entered search query to an indexed corpus of web pages.
- a conventional network search engine such as the GoogleTM search engine, returns a search result set in response to the search query submitted by the user.
- the search engine can perform the search based on conventional search methods. For example, one known method, described in an article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a document, such as a web page, based on the link structure of the web page.
- the search engine can rank or sort the individual articles or documents in the result set based on a variety of measures, such as, the number of times the search terms appear in the document and the number of documents that contain a link to a document.
- a search result set comprising a ranked list of documents with a link to each document can be returned to the user.
- Publishers or authors of a document can use a variety of techniques to manipulate the document to increase the ranking of the document by a search engine. With a high ranking, a user is more likely to click on the manipulated document from the search results.
- a search engine attempts to provide the most relevant search results in response to a user's query.
- a user's search experience is degraded if the search results are not particularly relevant.
- Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for improving search rankings using advertising data.
- a search engine implements a method comprising receiving a search query, identifying a plurality of articles relevant to the search query, determining advertising data associated with the search query, and ranking the articles based at least in part on the advertising data.
- the advertising data can comprise information related to search advertisements associated with the search query and information related to content advertisements associated with the articles. Additional aspects of the present invention are directed to computer systems and to computer-readable media having features relating to the foregoing aspects.

- the advertising data database 140 stores data associated with advertisements or advertising data.
- some search engines can cause the display of search advertisements associated with a search query along with a search result set. Users can select the advertisement by clicking on the search advertisement and be forwarded to a document, such as a web page, from the advertiser. Advertising data from the search advertisements, such as what advertisements users clicked on for what search terms, the ratio or number of users that clicked on particular search advertisements, and the number of users that purchased an advertised product after clicking of the advertisement can be stored in the advertising data database 140 .
- Content advertisements can also be displayed on source documents, such as web pages, based on the content of the source document.
- a content advertisement is requested by the publisher of a source document from a provider each time a user visits the page.
- the provider can match a content advertisement with the content of the source document.
- the provider determines the content of the source document by determining a set of content terms that describe the document. Users can generally click on the content advertisement and be forwarded to a document, such as a web page, from the advertiser.
- Advertising data from the content advertisements such as the number of visits to a source document, the set of content terms, and the text of the content advertisements, can be stored in the advertising data database.
- server device 104 may comprise a single physical or logical server.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to explain the exemplary methods shown in FIG. 2 .
- the advertising data comprises a selection score for each search advertisement displayed for the search query.
- the selection score can be based at least in part on a number of users that selected a search advertisement when displayed for the search query, such as a ratio or percentage of users that selected the search advertisement.
- ranking of the articles can be determined by weighting the articles based at least in part on the selection scores for the search advertisements.
- the advertising data comprises content advertising visit data associated with at least a first article.
- the content advertising visit data can be based at least in part on a number of users that visited the first article.

- the content terms can be determined by an advertising provider, so that the provider can match an advertisement to the terms.
- the provider can then cause the display of a matched advertisement on the source article.
- the ranking of the first article can be determined at least in part by augmenting the text of the first article with the content terms.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary method 200 that provides a method for improving search rankings using advertising data.
- This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 can be executed or otherwise performed by any of various systems.
- the method 200 is described below as carried out by the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 by way of example, and various elements of the system 100 are referenced in explaining the example method of FIG. 2 .
- an advertising data database 140 is provided. This may be accomplished by, for example, constructing such a database or establishing communication with such a database. As described with reference to FIG. 1 , the advertising data database 140 stores advertising data.
- a search query in the form of a search query input, is received by the server device 104 .
- a user 112 a generates a search query 114 at a client device 102 a .
- the client device 102 a transmits an associated search query input 122 reflecting the search query 114 to the server device 104 via a network 106 .
- the search engine 120 receives the search query input 122 and processes the search query 114 .
- documents responsive to the search query can be determined.
- the document retriever 134 conducts a search for documents responsive to the search query in a search database (not shown) or memory 118 that have previously been indexed from the network 106 or devices connected to the network. Based on the search, the document retriever 134 determines a list of documents related to the search query. This list of documents can be referred to as the initial search result set for the search query 114 .
- the document retriever 134 can determine the initial search result set based on a conventional search engine query and results return, such as by matching terms contained in the document with the terms in the search query.
- the document retriever 134 shown can determine an initial search result set responsive to the search query “jaguar.”
- This initial search result set for “jaguar” can comprise a list of documents determined to include the term “jaguar” in the documents.
- Other methods of determining an initial search result set can be used.
- advertising data is determined.
- the advertising data processor 138 can determine and retrieve advertising data related to the search query from the advertising data database 140 .
- the retrieved advertising data can be used by the advertising data processor 138 to create advertising data signals that can be used to sort and rank documents in the initial search result set.
- an advertising data signal can be a weighted value for a document returned in the initial search result set.
- An advertising data signal can also be a set of terms associated with a user query. These terms can be selected by the set of terms associated with advertisements highly selected by users when displayed with the results for the user query.
- an advertising data signal can be a set of terms associated with a document returned in the initial search result set. Advertising data may not be available for all documents returned in the initial search results set.
- a document may have more than one advertising data signal associated with it or if a document has no relevant advertising data it may have no associated advertising data signal.
- advertising data may comprise information concerning search advertisements, such as, for example, the search advertisements displayed for search terms and selection data for the search advertisements.
- the selection data or score can represent for each search advertisement the number of times users click on the advertisement when it is displayed, such as a ratio or percentage of users that click on the advertisement or type of advertisement. For example, when the user inputs the search query “jaguar” the advertising data processor 138 can retrieve advertising data concerning search advertisements previously displayed for the search term “jaguar” and the selection data about the search advertisements.
- the advertising data may indicate that the search advertisements for “jaguar” related to three distinct concepts, automobiles, large cats, and football, and the selection data may indicate that 70% of the users selected the automobile advertisements, 10% of the users selected the large cat advertisements, and 20% of the users selected the football advertisements.
- the advertising data processor 138 can use this advertising data to determine advertising data signals that more heavily weight documents in the initial search result set for “jaguar” that relate to automobiles than large cats or football.
- Advertising data may also comprise information concerning content advertisements.
- Content advertising involves placing an advertisement on a source document based on the content of the source document.
- the content of the source document can be defined by a set of content terms.
- Content advertising data for source documents can include, for example, the number of visits to a source document (visit data), the set of content terms used to describe the content of the source document, and the terms of the content advertisements.
- an advertising data signal for this document can represent the number of visits to the document by users.
- An advertising data signal for a source document can also contain the set of content terms.
- the advertising data processor 138 can, based on selection information, determine the content advertisement or group of content advertisements most selected by users viewing the source document. The terms from the most selected content advertisement or group of advertisements can be contained in an advertising data signal for the source document.
- a variety of other advertising data can be used to generate an advertising data signal for a search query and documents relevant to a search query.
- advertising data signals 128 for the documents in the initial search result set are provided to the ranking processor 136 for determining rankings or scores of the initial search result set.
- the ranking processor 136 includes a ranking or scoring function or set of computer-executable instructions that incorporates the advertising data signals 128 and/or other output from the advertising data processor 138 .
- advertising data signals 128 containing a weighted value and set of terms generated in step 208 are transmitted to the ranking processor 136 , which utilizes the advertising data signals 128 to rank or otherwise score the initial search result set.
- Other signals 130 generated for each document by the search engine 120 or another system or method can also be transmitted to the ranking processor 136 to rank or score subsequent search results.
- a search result set 124 can be provided by the search engine 120 to the client device 102 a via the network 106 .
- the ranking processor 136 generates a ranking or scoring of each document located in the initial search result set in response to the search query input 122 .
- the ranking processor 136 uses the advertising data signal 128 from step 210 to affect the ranking or scoring of one or more documents located in an initial search result set. For example, for the initial result set responsive to the search query “jaguar”, if the ranking processor 136 receives an advertising data signal or signals 128 that weight the documents associated with the concept of automobiles higher than other concepts, the ranking processor 136 can use these signals to increase the rank of the documents associated with the concept of automobiles in the search result set.
- the ranking processor 136 can receive an advertising data signal containing terms associated with a highly selected search advertisement or a group of search advertisements and can use these terms to increase the rank of documents containing these terms. In another example, if the ranking processor 136 receives an advertising data signal 128 indicating a high number of visitors to a document in the initial result set, the ranking processor 136 can use this signal to increase the ranking of the document. The ranking processor 136 can use this visitation signal in a hyperlink structure-based ranking method or can compare it to visitation signals for other documents to determine a ranking for the document.
- the ranking processor 136 can use the content terms to augment the text of the document in the ranking function.
- the ranking processor 136 receives an advertising data signal 128 , for a document, that contains advertising terms from the a highly selected content advertisement displayed on the document, the ranking processor 136 can use the advertising terms to augment the text of the document in the ranking function.
- the ranking processor 136 receives an advertising data signal 128 , for a document, that contains advertising terms from the content advertisements displayed on the document, the ranking processor can augment the text of the document with the advertising terms weighted by the selection information for the content advertisement containing the terms.
- the ranking processor 136 can use other signals in conjunction with the advertising data signal to rank or otherwise score documents of an initial search result set. In some instances, the ranking processor 136 can further decide whether to utilize a particular advertising data signal and/or other signals during processing of a score or ranking for a search result 124 .
- advertising data By using advertising data, a better understanding of what users desire when inputting search queries and a better understanding of the documents can be determined. Additionally, it is very difficult for document authors or publishers to manipulate advertising data.
- the use of advertising data in ranking documents identified in response to a search query can improve the quality of the search results.
