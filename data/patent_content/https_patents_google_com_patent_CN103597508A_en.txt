Journal file 116 or history data repository 119 can also be stored the data of quoting and represent condition to advertisement, wherein under this condition, select each advertisement for presenting to user.For example, history data repository 119 can be stored target keyword, bid (bid) and be selected the other standards of qualified advertisement for presenting.In addition, history data repository 119 can comprise the data of specifying about a plurality of impression of each advertisement, and, can be for example with causing the keyword of advertising impression and/or the cookie associated with impression to follow the tracks of a plurality of impression about each advertisement.Can also store the data about each impression, (make each impression and user select and/or to make this advertisement be selected for the target keyword presenting with the advertisement of selecting is associated, advertisement and/or target keyword with reference to this selection are stored each impression and user's selection, and/or according to the advertisement of this selection and/or each impression of target critical glossarial index and user's selection).
Advertiser 108 can submit the movement parameter (for example, target keyword and corresponding bid) for controlling ad distribution to Advertising Management System 110.The addressable Advertising Management System 110 of advertiser 108, to monitor the performance of the advertisement of using movement parameter distribution.For example, the addressable active performance report of advertiser, it provides a plurality of impression (presenting), selection (clicking) about advertisement, and the conversion of having identified.Active performance report can also provide within the time period of appointment about the total cost of advertisement, the cost of click, and other costs measurements at every turn.For example, advertiser can access performance report, its advertisement of having described use phrase match keyword " hockey " distribution has obtained 1000 impression (being presented 1000 times), selected (for example clicked) 20 times, and has charged to 5 conversions.Therefore, can indicate the hockey of phrase match keyword with 1000 impression, 20 clicks and 5 conversions.
As described above, the report that offers certain content supplier can be described for weigh performance measurement that occurred, user and content exchange before transforming.When user carries out required movement, transform, and conversion pathway comprises the one group of user interactions that transforms and occurred before carrying out conversion by user.Can regard any one or more " recordable " user interactions as conversion.For example, dialing the telephone number showing on website can be to transform and can be tracked.The factor form transforming may be because thing is different and can determine in various manners.For example, when user clicks advertisement, forwards webpage or website to, then complete while buying leaving before this webpage or website at that, can transform.Again for example, when user is when specific website spends the time of measuring more than preset time, can transform.Data from a plurality of user interactions can be used for determining the time quantum at specific website.
Each advertiser can specify and form the action transforming.For example, each advertiser can select one or more measurement/observable user action as conversion, for example download white paper, at least navigate to the given depth of website, at least check the webpage of some, at least on website or webpage, spend predetermined time amount, or register on website.Also can use and form other actions that transform.
Follow the tracks of conversion (and mutual with other of advertiser's website), advertiser can comprise embedding instruction in this advertiser's webpage, wherein this embeds the user interactions (for example the page is selected, content item is selected and other mutual) of instruction monitoring and advertiser's website, and can detect the user interactions (or a series of user interactions) that forms conversion.In certain embodiments, when user is during from webpage referenced (or other resources) accessed web page or another resource, can identify about this mutual webpage referenced (or other resources), for example,, by carrying out the code snippet quoted by just accessed webpage and/or based on identifying for accessing the URL of this webpage.
For example, user can visit advertiser's website by being chosen in the link presenting on webpage, and for example, selection is as the link of the part of the popularization activity of advertiser's affiliate (affiliate).This link can be associated with the URL that comprises the data (being text) of unique identification resource, and wherein user navigates from this resource.For example, link http://www.example.com/homepage/%affiliate_identifier%promotion _ 1 shows user to navigate to example.com webpage from the webpage of the associated affiliate of the affiliate identifier with appointment this URL, and based on being chosen in linking of comprising in the popularization activity associated with promotion_1, user is directed to example.com webpage.Can deposit the user interactive data about this mutual (selecting link) in database, and as mentioned below, with this user interactive data, facilitate performance report.
When conversion being detected for advertiser, can represent that the conversion data transforming is transferred to the data processing equipment (" analytical equipment ") that receives this conversion data, and then this conversion data is stored in data-carrier store.Can with for carrying out one or more cookie of the user's set of user interactions, store explicitly this conversion data, make the user interactive data associated with cookie can with transform associatedly, and the performance that can be used for generating about this conversion is reported.
Conventionally, when the advertisement of using target keyword to be decided to be target is, while transforming the front last advertisement of clicking, to think that this conversion is owing to this target keyword.For example, advertiser X can be associated keyword " tennis ", " footwear " and " brand X " with advertisement.In this example, suppose that user submits the first search inquiry to " tennis " to, to this user, present the result of page searching of the advertisement that comprises advertiser X, and this user selects this advertisement, but this user does not take to form the action transforming.Further this user of hypothesis submits the second search inquiry to " brand X " subsequently to, presents the advertisement of advertiser X to this user, and user selects the advertisement of advertiser X, and user takes to form the action (for example, user buys brand X tennis shoes) transforming.In this example, this is transformed owing to keyword " brand X ", this is the advertisement presenting because last advertisement of selecting before transforming (" advertisement of finally selecting ") is in response to coupling " brand X ".
To causing being presented on before conversion the keyword of the last advertisement of selecting, provide that to transform score (" finally selecting score (credit) ") be a kind of effective measurement to advertisement performance, yet only this measurement can not be offered help and analyze the data of transformation period to advertiser, this transformation period be included in the advertisement of last selection before user to the contact of advertisement and/or selection.For example, independent last selection score weighs that do not describe may be by having increased the keyword of brand or product popularity before selecting this last advertisement of selecting to presenting of the advertisement of presenting to user and/or being selected by user.Yet these advertisements may be to taking the user who forms the action transforming to have major contribution subsequently.
In the above example, even if the advertisement presenting in response to the search inquiry of matching keywords " tennis " may for example, have contribution to the user of the action (buying brand X tennis shoes) of taking form to transform, but does not provide any score about transforming to keyword " tennis ".For example, when advertisement that user selects to present in response to matching keywords " tennis ", user may check the brand X tennis shoes that can obtain from advertiser X.Contact based on user to brand X tennis shoes, user may submit search inquiry " brand X " subsequently to, to find the tennis shoes from brand X.Similarly, the selection regardless of user to advertisement, user to the contact of advertisement of using keyword " tennis " and being decided to be target also for example, to taking subsequently the user who forms the action (buying the product from advertiser X) transforming to contribute to some extent.The user interactions of analysis that occur and advertisement advertiser (or other guide) before selecting the last advertisement of selecting, can improve the ability that advertiser understands this advertiser's transformation period.
Transformation period is when presenting advertisement to user, and when user takes to form the action transforming, finish during.Can weigh and/or retrain the transformation period by time or action, and this transformation period can cross over a plurality of user conversations.User conversation is the set condensing together for the user interactions analyzed.Each user conversation comprises the data that represent user interactions that carried out by specific user and that (specify the phase) in session window.For example, session window can be the time period (for example 1 hour, 1 day or 1 month) of appointment, or can delimit this session window with required movement.For example, user search session user search queries that occur in can being included in during 1 hour and/or that for example, occur before in conversation end event (, closing search browser) and action subsequently.
Analyze the transformation period can improve advertiser understand within the transformation period its client how with the mutual ability of advertisement.For example, if advertiser determines that contacting for the first time advertisement from user is 20 days to the mean time area of a room transforming, advertiser can infer that user is transforming (taking to form the action transforming) front time quantum spending for studying alternate source by these data.Similarly, if advertiser determines the user much transform and is using particular keywords to do like this after being decided to be the presenting of advertisement of target, advertiser may wish to increase the amount of funds that it spends in the advertisement of using this keyword to distribute, and/or improves the quality of using this particular keywords to be decided to be the advertisement of target.
Help the user interactions measurement of analyzing the transformation period can be called conversion pathway performance measurement.Conversion pathway is by specific user, transformed front and comprising one group of user interactions of this specific user of this conversion.As be described in more detail below, the mutual quantity of specific user occurring before user interactions path before conversion pathway performance is weighed and describe the duration of transformation period, the amount of user interaction occurring within the duration of transformation period, transforms, conversion, and other measurements to the user interactions occurring within the duration of transformation period.
Advertising Management System 110 comprises performance point desorption device 120, and it determines the conversion pathway performance measurement of the measurement that user and content item in the duration be described in the transformation period are mutual.Performance point desorption device 120 for each advertiser follow the tracks of advertisement that user and this advertiser provide mutual, determine that (calculating) one or more conversion pathway performances weigh, and the data that make it possible to present performance report are provided, wherein this at least one conversion pathway performance of performance report description is weighed.By use, show report, advertiser can analyze its transformation period, and learns how its each keyword causes facilitating the presenting of advertisement of conversion, and no matter whether this keyword causes presenting the advertisement of last selection.Conversely, advertiser can adjust the movement parameter of controlling its ad distribution based on performance report.
Can provide config option to reduce the deviation in performance report.There is no config option, some performance report may have deviation, for example, be partial to short conversion pathway.For example, if comprise the number percent in Partial Conversion path by the basic data of giving a report, performance report may be partial to short conversion pathway.Partial Conversion path be wherein about some user interactive datas of user but not all user interactive data all with transform associated conversion pathway.For example, if generate report with the report period of typical transformation period length that is less than the advertiser of request report, can in this report, add Partial Conversion path.
Report period is determined the maximum length (to represent over sky) of the transformation period reported, and this is to generate this report due to the excessive data of operation report outside the phase not.Performance report can, based on report period (looking back window), make the user interactions before the report period not to be regarded as the part of transformation period when generating report.Such report period is called " review window ".For example, when generating report according to the review window of 30 days, be illustrated in the available subscribers interaction data of the user action occurring between July 1 in given time and July 31, will be available to the conversion occurring this year July 31.
For example, when using acquiescence to look back window (30 days), if being greater than this acquiescence, the typical transformation period length of the product associated with report looks back window, show public lecture and be partial to short conversion pathway.For example, in example above, the typical transformation period of " brand X " tennis shoes (for example 30 days) is with for example, compare compared with the transformation period of your make (, new car) may be relatively short.New car can have the longer transformation period (for example, 90 days).
Different advertisers or advertiser's different product can have different associated transformation period length.For example, sell (being for example less than 100 dollars) advertiser of product at a low price and can specify the review window of 30 days, and the advertiser who sells more expensive product (for example at least 1000 dollars) can specify the review window of 90 days.
In certain embodiments, advertiser 108 can when request performance report, for example, specify the review window that will use by input number of days or for example, by select to look back window from specific review window list (30 days, 60 days, 90 days).The review window that allows advertiser to configure their performance report makes advertiser can select the review window corresponding with their transformation period of product.Allow to look back window configuration and also make advertiser to test by enough different review windows, its possibility of result causes finding to improve the method for conversion rate.
Other factors can work to report section conversion pathway.For example, as described above, with the basic user interactive data of giving a report, can be associated with the unique identifier that represents user's set, wherein with this user's set, carry out user interactions.As described above, unique identifier can be stored as to cookie.Cookie can be deleted from user's set, for example, can by delete cookie user, the browser of deleting cookie (for example,, when exiting browser, based on browser Preferences), or some other softwares (for example Rogue Anti-Spyware) of deletion cookie are deleted cookie.
If deleted cookie from user's set, for example, when user's accessed web page (search system 112), new cookie can be set on user's set.This new cookie can be used for storing new part unique identifier, and the user interactive data subsequently therefore occurring on this user's set can be associated from different identifiers.Therefore,, owing to thinking that each user identifier represents different users, so compare with the user interactive data of associated new cookie, the user interactive data associated from deleted cookie is identified as with different users and is associated.
For example, in example above, suppose that user deletes cookie after carrying out first search inquiry of " tennis ", and in the deleted rear generation of cookie the second search inquiry to " brand X ".In this example, the performance that the user interactive data based on about user calculates is weighed may there is deviation.For example, because the advertisement selection the first search inquiry not being caused is regarded the part of the transformation period that the advertisement selection that causes with the second search inquiry is identical as, so weighing, path may be calculated as one, rather than two, this is because these two user interactions seem not to be to be carried out by identical user.
Check the report that reduces the deviation being caused by Partial Conversion path, advertiser can be this report and specifies review window.As described above, looking back window appointment is the user interactive data associated with unique identifier for generating the user interactive data of report, wherein, this unique identifier has initialization time before appointment phase (for example 30 days, 60 days, 90 days) before conversion.Therefore, for the conversion that wherein user interactive data is associated with the unique identifier with the initialization time of this appointment after date, be not included the basis that is used as this report.Have on the user's set that the unique identifier indication of recent initialization time may represent at this unique identifier recently and reinitialized this unique identifier.Therefore, the user interactive data associated with relatively new unique identifier can only represent part conversion pathway.Or, for user interactive data wherein, be comprised in this report with the conversion that the unique identifier with the initialization time of this appointment after date is associated.For reducing deviation, before adding report, from conversion pathway, remove any user interactions comprising in conversion pathway, occur after this appointment phase.
Fig. 2 is the process flow diagram for the method for integrated user interactions daily record data according to an illustrative embodiment.Method 200 is to upgrade conversion pathway and the definite method transforming of the user's conversion pathway based on upgrading.
Can be on Advertising Management System 110, performance point desorption device 120 or another calculation element implementation method 200.In one embodiment, on computer-readable medium, coding method 200, and this computer-readable medium comprises the instruction that makes the operation of this calculation element manner of execution 200 when being carried out by calculation element.
As described above, journal file 116 can comprise user interactive data.Journal file 116 can be before processing combines with the user interactive data of other daily records from other servers, comprises those servers of realizing search system 112.Processing from the calculation element of implementation method 200 determine new daily record can be used for processing (210).For example, can send the notice that the new daily record of indication has been ready for processing to calculation element, or the existence of new daily record can indicate this new daily record to be ready for processing.
Next, retrieve new daily record (220).Can retrieving novel daily record on network 102.User action based on being indicated by new daily record upgrades each user's state history.New daily record can comprise the information relevant to a plurality of users' user interactions.History data repository 119 comprises the user interactive data from previously processed journal file.Owing to can according to user identifier, user interactive data being divided into groups and by the time, it be sorted, so the user interactive data comprising in history data repository 119 can have state.Fig. 3 is described in the block diagram of the user interactive data upgrading in the duration of user interactions daily record data integrated approach 200 according to an illustrative embodiment.Fig. 3 shows four user identifier examples, yet history data repository 119 can comprise the data associated with thousands of or millions of different user identifiers with journal file 116.In one embodiment, previously stored user interactive data 310 is stored in history data repository 119.As shown in the figure, previously also in history data repository 119, do not stored the user interactive data associated with user identifier 3.
New daily record can comprise the user interactive data about one or more user identifiers.Can to user interactive data, divide into groups according to user identifier and then by time sort (230).Row 320 illustrate the user interactive data that divides into groups and sort.As shown in the figure, user identifier 2 does not comprise any new user interactive data, and user identifier 1,3 and 4 has upgraded user interactive data.For example, new journal file comprises the mutual a with the associated user who is associated with user identifier 1
13and a
14associated user interactive data.Then, divided into groups can merge mutually (240) with the user interactive data of storage in history data repository 119 with the user interactive data of sequence.If preexist user identifier in history data repository 119, adds new user interactive data to previous user interactive data.Otherwise, add new user interactive data and new user identifier.
Row 330 illustrate the user interactive data about the renewal of each user identifier.User interactive data based on upgrading, can determine any conversion (250) occurring in each of the more new route of user interactions.User interactions path is restricted to those user interactions relevant to particular advertisers 108.The conversion of particular advertisers 108 transforms for determining whether alternately.For example, suppose user interactions a
13and a
32represent to transform mutual.Correspondingly, find conversion pathway 340 and 350.Once find, conversion pathway can be write to another part or another data-carrier store of history data repository 119, for further analysis.
Each user interactions comprises associated with this user interactions one group of data or dimension.Can sparsely fill this dimension, make any user interactions can there are the data that subset is relevant to dimension.Can generate a large amount of conversion pathway by the user interactive data based on receiving.Various report about the implementation status of activity or advertiser's arrangement can comprise the various information about conversion pathway.Consider a large amount of potential conversion pathway, each conversion pathway can be aggregated to together to reduce the quantity of the different conversion pathway of report.In an illustrative embodiment, the conversion pathway that polymerizable has the user interactions of equal number and has corresponding data.
The dimension data of user interactions can be sparse filling.By single dimension, come polymerization conversion pathway can cause not having a large amount of polymerization conversion pathway of the data associated with polymerization dimension.In an illustrative embodiment, can carry out the various conversion pathway of polymerization by a plurality of dimensions.The sorted lists that can use dimension is definite the first matching dimensionality that comprises data of each user interactions.If there is not alternately the dimension of coupling, specify default dimension or data value for any specific user.For example, the default dimensions that is not sparse filling can be used as to default dimensions or text-string, for example can be by " unavailable ", " (nothing) " or " " as default value.
The sorted lists that uses dimension, can be converted to each conversion pathway dimension path.Dimension path comprises the dimension element corresponding with the user interactions of conversion pathway.Dimension element can comprise or quote the data from the first dimension, and wherein this first dimension comprises the data from corresponding user interactions.For example, the sorted lists of supposing dimension comprises dimension
1, dimension
2and dimension
3, and user interactions comprises dimension
2and dimension
3in data, but there is no dimension
1in data.Due to dimension
2be the first dimension of the user interactions that comprises data, the dimension element corresponding with this user interactions will comprise or quote the dimension from this user interactions
2data.Dimension is not limited to have the data from single dimension.For example, the data from a plurality of dimensions can be combined in a dimension.In addition, dimension element can comprise the extraneous information except the first matching dimensionality from user interactions.
In one embodiment, by adding to each user interactions the quoting of dimension data, conversion pathway is converted to dimension path.In another embodiment, create and conversion pathway dimension path independently.In this embodiment, storage dimension path, position that can be different in the position from storage conversion pathway.In any case realize dimension path, can length and dimension element based on dimension path come polymerization dimension path.
In one embodiment, dimension element comprises dimension data and other data from corresponding user interactions.For example, transform and can comprise alternately and transform associated value.When polymerization dimension path, the value of all conversion pathway that all right polymerization is associated with the dimension path of polymerization.The value of this polymerization can be included in report.
Fig. 4 a describes the example of conversion pathway.First user can be by carrying out the website 400 of searching for and visiting advertiser by the sponsored link of selecting to show in Search Results in search engine (being search engine 1).Suchly can be called and there is source alternately: " search engine 1 " and medium " cpc " (at every turn clicking cost) or search engine 1/cpc401.Therefore, by search engine 1/cpc401, there is first mutual between this user and advertisers 400.Because user has arrived advertiser's website 400, this user can carry out user interactions 407.According to this example, user's business 407 may not cause transforming.Then, can quote 402 by social networks website 1/ user is directed to advertisers 400.After quoting, user can carry out user interactions 408, and it may not cause the conversion of advertiser's appointment.Then, user can be by searching for advertiser's trade mark or domain name and selecting nature Search Results (being search engine 1/ nature 403) to arrive advertisers 400.After accessing for the third time advertiser's website 400, it is mutual 409 that user can carry out, and it may not cause transforming.Because user has accessed this website three times, this user can allow browser at the 4th time, directly to open this website, i.e. (nothing)/direct 405 when mutual.Once arrive advertiser's website, user can carry out various user interactions 410, it can cause transforming 406.In response to arriving, transform, performance point desorption device 120 can determine that this conversion pathway comprises first mutual (search engine 1/cpc401), second mutual (social networks website 1/ quotes 402), the 3rd mutual (search engine 1/ nature 403), and the 4th mutual (nothing/direct 405).
The addressable historical data 119 of performance point desorption device 120, to determine the conversion pathway to advertiser's website by user's guiding.In addition, performance point desorption device 120 can be to each node specified attribute in conversion pathway, and for example first is mutual, auxiliary mutual and finally mutual.Therefore for example, because user has accessed advertiser's website 400 by search engine 1/cpc401, can be search engine 1/cpc401 and specify first mutual.Can be alternately finally without/direct 405 because its be cause transforming 406 mutual.Before arriving advertiser's website except last mutual all can be called alternately auxiliary mutual.Therefore, in the example that Fig. 4 a discusses, can be search engine 1/cpc401, social networks website 1/ quote 402 and search engine 1/ nature 403 specify auxiliary mutual attribute.In Fig. 4 a, also show from first alternately to the time period that transforms 406.
Fig. 4 b illustrates the calculating of All Paths length.The conversion pathway length of example before transforming, there are four nodes 401,402,403 and 405, so will be 4 in Fig. 4 a.
Fig. 4 c illustrates from first alternately to transforming for 406 a period of times that may pass through.As shown in Fig. 4 c, first occurred January 15 in generation on January 12, the 3rd alternately alternately in generation on January 1, second alternately, and the 4th occurred January 20 alternately.Therefore, first, the time interval alternately and between transforming has 20 days.Analysis tool can be determined by identical user and carried out these four each in mutual, and create conversion pathway.In one embodiment, can in Aggregation Table, store the dimension of interaction level attribute, path, elapsed time and other intercorrelations.Advertiser can carry out segmentation to conversion data with interaction level filtrator or path-level filtrator.
Fig. 5 is for time period 501(i.e. on January 31st, 1 2010 on January 1st, 2010) the explanation of the auxiliary mutual demonstration example of summing up.Advertiser can select the transformation standard 502 of user's appointment.For example, in Fig. 5, advertiser can have target 2, and wherein whether advertiser can be based on having a plurality of users place an order and conversion pathway data are carried out to segmentation.The demonstration of Fig. 5 also allows user's length 503 sequences by path.In this example, user is appointed as 2 or more by path.Advertiser can select to show the type 504 of conversion pathway data.The type can comprise that the AdPrograml about advertiser's data assists or AdProgram2.In the example depicted in fig. 5, advertiser has selected to show " owning " type 504.
In browser view 506, performance point desorption device 120 can generate and show the mutual total number percent that meets the transformation standard 502 of advertiser's appointment and have path 503.For example, screenshotss can show the sum that meets the mutual 509a that transforms target and conversion pathway length standard.Can show the similar statistics (number percent of mutual sum and auxiliary mutual sum) about auxiliary mutual 509b and last mutual 509c.Ratio 509d has compared about the auxiliary mutual quantity of a dimension and last mutual sum about this dimension.Therefore,, if ratio 509d is larger for particular source, advertiser may wish to spend the auxiliary machine meeting that additional finance is sought this particular source.For example, in Fig. 5, shown auxiliary/last mutual ratio 528 about each provenance/medium.Due to source: search engine 1, and medium: click cost (cpc) search engine 1/cpc at every turn and there is the highest ratio (i.e. " 6.44 ") in the result of demonstration, can notify this search engine of advertiser 1/cpc may be seldom for alternately finally.Yet a lot of conversion pathway are used search engine 1/cpc as auxiliary, and advertiser may wish to continue cost fund and impel more users to arrive their content, this be because auxiliary may cause alternately transforming mutual.
Other sequences and filter criteria in Fig. 5, have also been shown.For example, advertiser can select to change view 511, discharge pattern 512, source 513, medium 514, source/medium 516 or customization dimension 517.Advertiser can the second dimension based on selecting from drop-down menu 519 select further to filter or sorting data.Alternatively, or in addition, advertiser can use the further filtering data of the filtering button 520.
Demonstration in Fig. 5 also allows user based on source/medium 521, mutual 522, auxiliary mutual 524, last mutual 526 and auxiliary data shown in sorting divided by last mutual 528.Sequence can adopt ascending order or descending.
Fig. 6 to 13 shows for the explanation across the demonstration of the flow process of the user-defined segmentation of channel to conversion pathway data creation.Fig. 6 shows the report 601 relevant to example domains www.company.com620.Can create from the Submenu Items of the menu item across channel funnel 612 and auxiliary mutual 613 and transform segmentation 603.Create new segmentation, user can click and create new segmentation button 607.Other options of some that can present to advertiser can comprise management segmentation control 608, and it allows the existing segmentation of user management.The segmentation of current definition has also been shown in list box 611.Some segmentations comprise the time interval: between mutual, be less than 1 day, etc.Advertiser for example can select, to Another Application (spread sheet) output segmentation or segmentation result, and output menu button 604 can be facilitated this function.Advertiser can select to send the result from segmentation by Email, and email button 605 addressable e-mail programs etc., to facilitate this function.
Fig. 7 shows the illustrative user interface 700 that shows advertiser when advertiser selects the new segmentation of the establishment button 607 from Fig. 6.In creating new minute segment interface 700, advertiser can be segmentation and selects title 704." comprise " that drop-down option 705 allows advertiser to comprise conversion pathway data or gets rid of conversion pathway.Conversion pathway options menu 706 can provide that selecting paths is mutual, at least one option in path access or targets option.Advertiser can be by using button 708 to add OR("or") statement or by use button 709 add AND(" with ") statement, add further conversion pathway segmentation.After specifying expression formula or condition for conversion pathway segmentation, advertiser can carry out preview result, with button 711, preserve segmentation with preview 710 buttons, or cancels segmentation with button 712.
Fig. 8 is the illustrative user interface of showing when selecting paths is mutual in selection conversion pathway options menu 706 as advertiser.The interactive selection 803 mutual dimensions in the various paths of use in path are filled screen, for example first alternately from, finally alternately from, transformation time, mutual quantity, path etc.Advertiser can select any one in these options to carry out the mutual segmentation of conversion pathway.
Fig. 9 selects the first illustrative user interface 901 that can show when mutual as advertiser from the path interactive menu of Fig. 8.Can present three additional menus options with the first intercorrelation to advertiser: select traffic sources 903, comprise or do not comprise 904, and text box or drop-down menu 905.Figure 10 is that wherein source is selected as the illustrative user interface 1001 that dimension and source comprise " message transmission sites 1 ".Can preserve or preview segmentation.From the result of this fragmentation example, can comprise that message transmission sites 1 is wherein source all first mutual of conversion pathway.
Refer now to Figure 11, Figure 11 is the illustrative user interface 1102 of showing when selecting to add AND statement OptionButton 709 in Figure 10.Can add AND statement 1103 to segmentation.Segmentation can be extended for to further filter result, so that the conversion data that comprises path access to be shown, wherein any access in conversion pathway comprises country " Canada ".Therefore, result segmentation comprises that about source be wherein the first mutual and use the conversion pathway data from the path of Canadian any access of message transmission sites 1.Creating new segmentation screen allows advertiser to add as required a large amount of and/or statements.
Refer now to Figure 12, Figure 12 is the illustrative user interface 1201 of showing when selecting to add OR statement option in Figure 11.Can add OR statement to segmentation.Segmentation can be extended for and comprise the conversion pathway data that wherein complete target 1.OR operational character will have precedence over two statements that connected by AND operational character in this case.For example, segment logic will be decomposed into A and (B or C), and wherein A represents to have first mutual as source of message transmission sites 1, and B represents from Canadian any access, and C represents to complete target 1.
Refer now to Figure 13, Figure 13 is the illustrative user interface from the segmentation of Figure 12.In Figure 13, by the first interactive modifying, be any mutual, and any being further revised as alternately occurred over 3 times.Therefore, segmentation is modified to describes A'and (B or C), and wherein A' represents that wherein source is that any conversion pathway of 3 times appears surpassing in message transmission sites 1.In Fig. 6-13, disclosed dimension and tolerance are the examples how advertiser can create segmentation.Also there is spendable many other tolerance of advertiser and dimension.
For example, advertiser can create location segment, and this location segment comprises that wherein source/medium (for example search engine 1/cpc) is the mutual path of another source/medium (for example, Email/quote) after mutual.Another user-defined segmentation of definable, making specific source or medium is not first mutual (for example wherein first be not path from " social networks website 1 " alternately).
