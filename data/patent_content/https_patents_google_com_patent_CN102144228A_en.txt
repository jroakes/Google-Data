Technical field
The disclosure relates to input method.
Background technology
In lexicon literal (logographic script), one or two character is roughly corresponding to a speech or a kind of connotation, and the character that language had that uses the lexicon literal is more than the key on the standard input device (as computer keyboard or mobile device keypad).For example, Chinese language comprises tens thousand of characters by basic phonetic alphabet and five tone definition pronunciations.Can realize these related mappings of many-one potentially by help the character that input can not find and the input method of symbol on input equipment.Therefore, can use the keyboard of roman character type to import Chinese character.Similarly, input method can be used in the keyboard of use roman character type or many other language that other input equipment inputs comprise ideograph, as Japanese, Korean and other language.
Although can use Input Method Editor, the address of internet site, URL(uniform resource locator) (" URL ") for example adopts the form of ascii character usually.Thereby, be based on the user of the language of lexicon literal, mainly the speak Chinese user of dialect for example for mother tongue, even they know the literal title (literal name) of website in their language, also be difficult to remember the URL of website.Therefore, these users must take several separate steps to import the URL of their website checked of expectation.Can use ideographic character in user's the language, spell the literal title that is associated with URL with user's language.Because ideographic character is not to use Western-style keyboard directly to import, import (for example, phonetic) conversion to candidate ideographic characters (for example, Chinese character) so use Input Method Editor to finish from the roman character phonetic symbol.Afterwards, use ideographic character to find the website of possible user expectation by search engine, and if in the Search Results that produces, this website occurs, then the user selects this website.
Summary of the invention
This instructions has been described the technology relevant with Input Method Editor.In some implementations, can directly find resource location (for example, URL) according to the phonetic symbol input of in the address field of web browser, importing (for example, phonetic input).In the address field of web browser, receive user's input of roman character, and convert this user's input to non-Roman alphabet candidate collection, for example Chinese character candidate collection.The set of each non-Roman alphabet is discerned keyword as the keyword prefix.Keyword is associated with URL, and when having selected candidate collection, for each non-Roman alphabet candidate collection that is associated shows URL and the keyword that is associated.
Usually, an aspect of the theme of describing in this manual can be embodied as the method that comprises following action: receive the roman character input; Use described roman character input to discern the non-Roman alphabet candidate collection; Recognition resource position candidate collection, each resource location candidate collection is associated with corresponding non-Roman alphabet candidate collection; And provide described resource location candidate collection and described non-Roman alphabet candidate collection for demonstration to user interface.Other embodiment of this aspect comprise corresponding system, device and computer program.

Specific implementation
Fig. 1 is the screenshotss 100 of examples shown web browser environment 104, in this example web page browser environment 104, from Input Method Editor input recognition resource position.Address field 103 is integrated with IME address environment 101.In some implementations, address field 103 can be used as standard URL input field, and the user can import web page address, for example www.example.com therein.In some implementations, Input Method Editor input is provided for IME address environment 101, in described IME address environment 101, be input in the IME address field 102 roman character (for example, the ascii character that is used for the phonetic input) is converted into non-Roman alphabet (for example, Chinese character).In some implementations, on behalf of the phonetic symbol of one or more candidate collection of lexicon text, the roman character input represent, as the pinyin representation of Chinese character.IME address environment 101 can use the text of being imported to locate URL(uniform resource locator) (URL) automatically, and can advise and the relevant one or more at user option URL result of roman character input.
Although address field 103 and IME address field 102 are shown as independently address field, the IME address field can be integrated in the address field 103.In addition, can be automatically or instantiation manually (instantiate) IME address environment 101.Automatically instantiation can be in user's input corresponding to phonetic symbol input (for example, " Xin ") and do not correspond to the standard resource location address and (for example, take place during www.example.com) roman character.Manually instantiation can be in response to the particular command of user's input, for example keyboard or menucommand and take place.
For common use Chinese character or the user that utilizes other language of ideographic character to read and write, conversion from the roman character to the non-Roman alphabet and being identified as them and providing and need not to remember that URL just can discern the facility of URL to URL.IME address environment 101 provides the IME processing power that can receive the roman character input and the roman character input be converted to non-Roman alphabet.In some implementations, these non-Roman alphabets are corresponding to keyword, and described keyword is mapped to URL.
For example, the user can import " xin lang " to IME address field 102 input Pinyins of IME address environment 101, and this phonetic input can be converted into non-Roman alphabet candidate collection 106.These candidate collection 106 of non-Roman alphabet are the keyword prefix with the keyword 112 of non-Roman alphabet in some implementations.Keyword 112 is discerned by keyword prefix 106, thereby keyword prefix 106 can be used to discern corresponding URL 108.
Therefore, selection to each non-Roman alphabet candidate collection 106 can make corresponding keyword 112 and URL 108 be shown, illustrated among Fig. 1, Fig. 1 shows and selects first candidate characters set " Sina " and corresponding candidate URL 108 and keyword 112.Selection to another candidate characters set 106 will correspondingly make the candidate collection of another URL 108 and keyword 112 be shown.The user can utilize the input equipment of keyboard for example or mouse to select (illustrated as the choice box 202 around second URL108 (" news.sina.com.cn ")) and corresponding keyword thereof among the URL.
Although show 9 non-Roman alphabet candidate collection 106, also can show more or less non-Roman alphabet set.Similarly, in response to selection, also can show the candidate collection and the keyword 112 of more or less resource location 108 to the non-Roman alphabet candidate collection.
In some implementations, can carry out rank to the resource location in each candidate collection 108 according to the popularity of for example specific resources position or keyword.Resource location 108 and the keyword 112 that is associated can be for example provide according in advance rank order, and described rank order in advance is according to based on the selection frequency of click logs (click log) or inquiry log (query log) and/or based on the rank of the keyword in inquiry log.In some implementations, the data of definition resource location 108, keyword 112 and corresponding rank can be offered subscriber equipment, and can make amendment to rank based on the user's of subscriber equipment selection history.For example, IME address environment 101 can be followed the tracks of the number of times that each resource location has been selected by the active user of subscriber equipment, and correspondingly adjusts the rank of resource location.For example, can use rank to come the tabulation of exporting resource location 108 to the user of subscriber equipment with specific preferred sequence based on the popularity of resource location.In a similar manner, can adjust the order of display candidate characters 106 based on the user's of subscriber equipment selection.
In some implementations, keyword 112 can provide with data structure to the mapping of candidate characters set 106, and described data structure is such as keyword prefix table.Fig. 2 A illustrates example keyword prefix table 200.In some implementations, web browser on the client device be created and be provided for to table 200 can by external server.Keyword prefix table 200 comprises keyword prefix row 202, keyword row 204 and nested keyword row 206.Roman character is not included in the tabulation of keyword prefix, but being included to be convenient in diagram explains.
The Chinese character that second row 214 is included in the keyword prefix 216 " United " in the row 202 and represents this keyword prefix " United ".In example, keyword prefix 216 can be branched into two keywords that comprise " United Nations " 218 and " United Airlines " 220." United Nations " keyword 218 can be branched into further keyword extraly.For example, keyword 218 is illustrated as being branched off into two other keyword that comprises " United Nations Charter " 222 and " Secretary of UN " 224.
Keyword in the table 200 can be mapped to resource location.Fig. 2 B illustrates example keyword resource table 250.Keyword resource table 250 is the mappings between keyword and the resource location (such as URL(uniform resource locator)), and according to the rank of the URL(uniform resource locator) of user preference, clicking rate or other tolerance.Web browser on the client device be created and be provided for to table 250 can by external server.In some implementations, table 250 can be by determining to select the frequency of each URL to create in response to the inquiry that comprises each keyword at this keyword.These frequencies can for example obtain by excavating the inquiry log and the click logs that are associated with search engine.Based on these frequencies,, URL(uniform resource locator) is carried out rank with respect to other URL(uniform resource locator) for each keyword candidate set.
Table 250 comprises character row 252, URL row 254 and rank row 256.Character row 252 comprises Chinese character.The keyword of described character representative of consumer input.URL row 254 comprise the proper subclass in response to the selecteed URL(uniform resource locator) of inquiry that comprises the keyword Chinese character shown in the row 252.Rank row 256 comprise the rank score value of each the unified resource position in the row 254.The rank indication is selected the relative frequency of each unified resource position about corresponding keyword, and also determines to show to the user order of keyword and URL(uniform resource locator).
In one example, row 258 comprises first keyword 260, the URL(uniform resource locator) 262 of being correlated with and the rank 264 of URL(uniform resource locator).The most forward URL(uniform resource locator) of rank is " www.sina.com ", and is 9.75 by scoring, and the lower URL(uniform resource locator) of rank is 9.22 and 2.21 by rank respectively.Thereby for the keyword of character 260 representatives, it is three URL(uniform resource locator) 262 that most probable is wanted selecteed URL(uniform resource locator).In a similar fashion, row 266 shows second keyword 268, the URL(uniform resource locator) 270 of being correlated with and the rank 272 of URL(uniform resource locator).
At first these ranks can be set based on excavation to inquiry log and click logs.In some implementations, can be adjusted at rank in the particular table 250 on the client device based on user input.
Web browser can use table 200 and 250 to select in IME address environment 101 and show resource location 108 and corresponding keyword 112.For example, the client device of the software of running example IME address environment 101 can be visited prefix table 200, to discern keywords based on candidate characters set 106.Then, these keywords can be used as the index in the keyword location tables 250, to be used for discerning the most popular resource location about the candidate character selected set.For example, if the user has imported the phonetic that causes identifying keyword prefix " United ", then IME address environment 101 will comprise the keyword " United Nations " of suggestion and " United Airlines " and the corresponding resource location of index in keyword resource table 250.In addition, IME address environment 101 also will be advised " United Nations Charter " and " Secretary of UN " and corresponding resource location.
In some implementations, table 200 and 250 can reside on the server apparatus, as search engine server.In these implementations, server apparatus can be carried out all operations or its part in the IME address environment 101.For example, the browser on the client device can be carried out basic IME function, such as the phonetic input is converted to candidate characters set 106.Candidate characters set 106 can be provided for server apparatus, and then server apparatus can provide back client device with the candidate collection and the keyword 112 of resource location 108, to show in IME address environment 101.
Fig. 3 is the process flow diagram that is used to provide the instantiation procedure 300 of selectable resource location.Process 300 can for example be implemented in the equipment of describing among Fig. 5 502 and/or equipment 504.
Process 300 receives the roman character input, as ascii string (302).For example, IME address environment 101 comprises IME address field 102, and it can receive the roman character input.In one example, import the pinyin representation of Chinese words in the address field 102 that the user can show on equipment 504.For example, the user can import word " ping " in IME address field 102.Word " ping " is the pinyin representation of word " apple ".In some implementations, pinyin representation " ping " can be the keyword prefix.For example, " ping " can be the prefix of word " apple pie ".Usually, for example, can be from the roman character " ping " of the stylus input expression " apple " used such as the keyboard of Western-style keyboard or with handwriting recognition engine.
Process 300 determines whether to receive input (304) in address field.For example, equipment 504 can determine whether roman character input (that is keyword prefix) is placed in URL bar, search column, text editor or other program.If input is not imported in the URL bar (for example, IME address field 102), then process 300 finishes and handles by object program the text of input.
If the keyword prefix is imported in the URL bar, then process 300 is used roman character to import and is discerned non-Roman alphabet candidate collection (306).For example, process 300 can comprise Input Method Editor (IME) process that the roman character input is converted to Chinese (for example, Chinese character) from phonetic.This IME process can realize at server apparatus 502 or client device 504 places.
After converting roman character to non-Roman alphabet, process 300 identifications and the corresponding resource location candidate collection of non-Roman alphabet candidate collection (308).For example, process 300 is discerned the keyword of gathering about each non-Roman alphabet by the keyword of sharing identical non-Rome keyword prefix in the identification keyword prefix table 200.To the identification of keyword can be at server apparatus 502 places or client device 504 places realize.
The resource location that process 300 identifications are associated (for example, URL) and with this resource location and non-Roman alphabet candidate collection mates (310).For example, keyword that process 300 will identify from keyword prefix table 200 is with the index of doing keyword resource table 250, the resource location that is associated with identification.To the identification of the resource location that is associated can be at server apparatus 502 places or client device 504 places realize.
If do not find resource location, then process 300 finishes.If found resource location, then process 300 offers user interface for showing (312) with resource location candidate collection and non-Roman alphabet candidate collection.For example, if identify resource location at server apparatus 502 places, then server apparatus can offer client device 504 with resource location and the keyword that is associated.After receiving the keyword and resource location that is associated, if perhaps identify resource location and keyword at client device 504 places, then keyword and resource location can be provided for display interface, for example web browser interface.Afterwards, process 300 shows resource location 108 and corresponding keyword 112 in response to the selection that candidate characters is gathered.
In some implementations, can be according to selecting frequency that resource location is carried out rank.In some implementations, can select the highest URL of rank for each keyword, and the URL that rank is the highest is associated with the non-Roman alphabet candidate collection.
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram that is used for the instantiation procedure 400 of resolving resource location address.Process 400 can realize in the equipment 502 that for example Fig. 5 describes.
Fig. 5 is the block diagram that can realize the example system 500 of method described here.System 500 comprises server process equipment 502, and it is crossed over the Internet connection 506 and carries out data communication with client process equipment 504.Although in Fig. 5, only illustrate a client and a server, can comprise the server and/or the client of arbitrary number.
Server 502 comprises Input Method Editor code 510, and it can and can be provided for client device 504 by client device 504 execution.After being carried out by client device 504, the IME address environment 101 on the Input Method Editor code 510 instantiation client devices 504.Input Method Editor code 510 can comprise the language model (not shown), is used to handle roman character input (for example, phonetic input) and converts the roman character input to the non-Roman alphabet input.
Server 502 also comprises as keyword prefix table of describing among superincumbent Fig. 2 A and the 2B 200 and keyword resource table 250.Also can use other storage architectures.These tables 200 and 250 can be provided for client device.
Server 502 also comprises excavation engine 514, and it can excavate inquiry log 401a and click logs 401b, to generate keyword prefix table 200 and keyword resource table 250.In some implementations, can will excavate the keyword that engine 514 is configured to discern the overfrequency threshold value, for example in the certain hour section, use the keyword that surpasses minimum number, so that get rid of keyword rare or that seldom use.This selection course is by ignoring the size that the keyword of unlikely being imported or selecting by the user reduces keyword prefix table 200.Also can use other choice criteria.
In some implementations, can excavate the resource that engine 514 further is configured to discern selected overfrequency threshold value, website for example, for example selected resource location of minimum number at least when use keyword in inquiry.This selection course is by ignoring the size that the resource location of unlikely being selected by the user reduces keyword resource table 250.Also can use other choice criteria.
Keyword resource table 250 can comprise debut ranking when being provided for client device 504.These debut rankings have reflected the selection probability that obtains based on inquiry log 401a and click logs 401b.In some implementations, the user that IME code 514 can be followed the tracks of on the client device 504 selects, and adjusts the rank in the keyword resource table 250 that is stored on the client device 504.Thereby, can be the identification of each customization based on each user's browsing histories to keyword and resource location.
