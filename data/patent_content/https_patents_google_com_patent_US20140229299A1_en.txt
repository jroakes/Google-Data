Definitions
- Online content publication systems allow content publishers to publish content that promotes the content publisher and/or products/services that the content publisher sells. For example, manufacturers may publish content that promotes the manufacturers' products or brand to consumers. Retailers may publish content that promotes the retailers' stores and/or products that the retailers sell.
- online content publication systems do not provide a mechanism for entities such as manufacturers to promote affiliated entities (e.g., retailers that sell the manufacturers' products) in published content.
- One implementation of the disclosure relates to a method that includes receiving, at a computerized content publication system from a content provider, data identifying a plurality of affiliated entities that the content provider wishes to promote within published content.
- the method further includes receiving, at the content publication system from one or more computerized systems of one or more third party entities, rating data from the one or more third party entities.

- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a computing device according to an illustrative implementation.
- Content publication systems typically allow for the following types of content to be published within a basic manufacturer->retailer->consumer business model: (1) manufacturers can promote their products to consumers; (2) retailers can promote the products they sell to consumers; and (3) retailers can promote their stores to consumers.
- Such systems may not provide content publishers (e.g., manufacturers) with a way to promote entities with which they are affiliated (e.g., retailers that sell the manufacturers' products) to consumers.
- a content publication system may allow a content provider to promote one or more affiliated entities using third party data such as ratings or rankings.
- third party data such as ratings or rankings.
- a beverage manufacturer may establish a content campaign in which the published content promotes bars and/or restaurants that serve beverages manufactured by the beverage manufacturer to consumers based on third party rankings such as those published by Zagat.
- the content provider may provide a list of affiliated entities to the content publication system, and the content publication system may use the third party data to determine one or more of the affiliated entities to be featured in the published content.
- the content publication system may include in the published content a predetermined number of affiliated entities having the highest rankings/scores under the third party data or all affiliated entities having a ranking/score above a particular level.
- the published content may include links to resources associated with each of the selected affiliated entities (e.g., a resource published by the affiliated entity and/or a third party resource such as a map identifying a location of the affiliated entity).
- the third party ranking may appear next to a link or other data relating to the selected affiliated entities.
- the content may be a special type of content triggered in response to particular predetermined trigger conditions, such as a superlative (e.g., “best”) and/or location (e.g., “best restaurants in Chicago”).
- FIG. 1A shows a promotion chain 100 illustrating promotion channels available to a manufacturer 105 under a traditional content publication system according to an illustrative implementation.
- Traditional content publication systems allow manufacturer 105 to promote products to retailers 110 in an effort to encourage retailers 110 to sell the products (e.g., a “business-to-business,” or B2B, channel).
- Manufacturer 105 may also promote the products directly to consumers 115 in an effort to encourage consumers 115 to purchase the products (e.g., a “business-to-consumer,” or B2C, channel).
- Traditional content publication systems do not provide opportunities to publish content specifically designed for manufacturer 105 to promote retailers 110 that sell products manufactured by manufacturer 105 to consumers 115 . This results in an “incomplete triangle” or missed opportunity to connect consumers 115 who may wish to purchase products made by manufacturer 105 with retailers 110 through which consumers 115 may purchase the products.
- FIG. 1B illustrates types of promotion that are and are not available to retailer 110 and manufacturer 105 using a traditional content publication system according to an illustrative implementation.
- Retailer 110 may publish content that promotes products sold by retailer 110 and content that promotes the stores, website, computing device application, etc. of retailer 110 .
- Manufacturer 105 may publish content that promotes the products produced by manufacturer 105 .
- Traditional content publication systems do not provide a mechanism for manufacturer 105 to publish content promoting multiple retailers 110 that sell the products produced by manufacturer 105 in an effort to connect those retailers 110 with consumers.
- FIG. 1C illustrates another example promotion chain 150 that shows promotion channels available to a content publisher such as manufacturer 105 under a content publication system of the present disclosure according to an illustrative implementation.
- Promotion chain 150 provides the same channels linking manufacturer 105 with retailers 110 and manufacturer 105 with consumers 115 as in promotion chain 100 .
- Content publication systems of the present disclosure also provide methods for manufacturer 105 to help achieve a link between retailers 110 that are affiliated with manufacturer 105 (e.g., sell products produced by manufacturer 105 ) and consumers 115 that may be interested in purchasing products made by manufacturer 105 , completing the “incomplete triangle.” Connecting affiliated retailers 110 with consumers 115 may increase business opportunities (e.g., sales) for manufacturer 105 .
- business opportunities e.g., sales
- a consumer 115 who may be interested in purchasing a product made by manufacturer 105 may be presented with a content item that identifies one or more retailers 110 that are near a current location of the consumer 115 and sell the product. This may provide an opportunity for the consumer 115 to immediately purchase the product at one of the identified retailers 110 and may increase the likelihood that the consumer 115 will move ahead with the purchase rather than changing his or her mind.
- the content publication system may provide manufacturer 105 with a way to promote those retailers 110 who are most valuable to manufacturer 105 (e.g., sell a large amount of products made by manufacturer 105 , promote products made by manufacturer 105 in content they publish, etc.).
- the content publication system may also provide more useful results to users who are searching for particular types of information, such as location-based information.
- FIGS. 1A through 1C and illustrative implementations discussed herein identify manufacturers of products as an example of content providers who may utilize the content publication system, the present disclosure is equally applicable to providers of services and/or other content providing entities having a relationship with one or more other entities that the content providing entities may wish to promote to customers.

- FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 300 for generating content that promotes affiliated entities according to an illustrative implementation.
- content publication system 208 may receive a list of affiliated entities that the content provider wishes to promote from content provider device 206 via network 202 ( 305 ).
- the content provider may be a producer of products and/or services and the affiliated entities may be retailers or other entities that sell or otherwise feature the products/services of the manufacturer.
- the content provider may be an entity who is interested in promoting one or more other entities regardless of whether or not the content provider has a financial interest in the promoted entities.
- a content provider may provide a list of philanthropic organizations whose causes the content provider wishes to support.
- the use of the term “affiliated entities” herein is not intended to imply that the content provider must have a formal relationship or legal relationship with the affiliated entities, rather only that the content provider wishes to promote the affiliated entities through published content.
- the list of affiliated entities may be provided to content publication system 208 in conjunction with or separate from content that the content provider wishes to be published.
- the list of affiliated entities may be included as part of a bid for content to be published submitted by the content provider (e.g., submitted along with the actual content item or creative).
- the list of affiliated entities may be provided separate from one particular content item for the purpose of being applied to a group of content items, such as a content campaign relating to a particular product or service.
- a beverage manufacturer may create a content campaign featuring several types of beverages made by the manufacturer, and the beverage manufacturer may provide a list of restaurants that serve the manufacturer's beverages to be applied to part or all of the content submissions or bids submitted as part of the campaign.
- the list of affiliated entities may be stored in an affiliated entities portion 214 of content database 210 for retrieval by content publication system 208 when generating content to be published.
- content providers may be free to determine what affiliated entities and/or how many entities to include within the list. For example, a content provider may determine that an entity may be included within the list if the entity sells a certain amount of the content provider's products or services, if the entity features the content provider or its products/services prominently in its marketing materials, or for any other reason.
- a producer of beverages may include restaurants or other establishments where a specified percentage of beverages served are made by the beverage producer

- content publication system 208 may require that the submitted list include a minimum number of affiliated entities per geographic location (e.g., more than 3, more than 5, more than 10, etc.) to prevent brands from biasing the list.
- Content publication system 208 may also receive rating data from one or more third party entities (rating parties) ( 310 ). Content publication system 208 may receive the rating data by communicating with third party entity systems 216 having rating data stored in one or more rating databases 218 .
- the third party rating entities may include any entity that rates, ranks, or otherwise substantively reviews other entities.
- the third party rating entities may be organizations that create ratings or rankings internally (e.g., Zagat) and/or organizations that compile rankings based on submitted user reviews (e.g., Yelp).
- content publication system 208 may only retrieve rating data from third party entities that utilize quantitative ratings and/or rankings so that content publication system 208 can organize and rank entities from the list of affiliated entities based on the rating (e.g., numerical rating). In some implementations, content publication system 208 may utilize rating data from third party entities that include only qualitative ratings. In some implementations, content publication system 208 may retrieve rating data and store the rating data in content database 210 . For example, content publication system 208 may obtain rating data periodically, according to a schedule, etc., store the data in database 210 , and use the stored data to prepare content items to be published. In some implementations, content publication system 208 may retrieve rating data in real-time or near real-time while preparing content items for publication to ensure that the ratings are as current as possible.
- content publication system 208 may be configured to utilize the same third party rating source or sources to prepare every published content item for a particular category (e.g., restaurants, entertainment venues, etc.). For example, any content item relating to restaurants may be generated using the same one or more third party ratings. This may help provide the user with a consistent experience.
- the content provider may be allowed to select which third party ratings the content provider wishes to be used in generating content items for the content provider (e.g., from among a list of available third party ratings).
- Content publication system 208 may select two or more affiliated entities from the list for inclusion in the published content item based on the rating data ( 315 ). In some implementations, content publication system 208 may select a predetermined number of affiliated entities from the list having the highest rating under the rating data. For example, content publication system 208 may select the top three affiliated entities from the list for a particular content item being published. In some implementations, content publication system 208 may select some or all of the entities having a rating above a certain threshold rating. For example, content publication system 208 may select some or all of the listed entities having a rating higher than 75 on a scale of 0 to 100, or a rating of “B” or above on a F to A grading scale. In some implementations, a combination of selection methods may be used.
- the top three listed entities by rating may be selected for inclusion in the published content item, but only if they all exceed a threshold rating level.
- Various other selection criteria may be used based on the rating data according to other illustrative implementations.
- the rating data may be the sole criterion for which affiliated entities are selected for inclusion in the published content item.
- selection of the affiliated entities to be included in the published content item may occur dynamically, or after the content item has been selected for publication (e.g., as part of a bidding process).
- the list of affiliated entities and the content item may be associated with a bid submitted to content publication system 208 .
- the bid may be associated with one or more triggering keywords or phrases.
- content publication system 208 may select a content item to be published to the user on user device 204 , for example, based on a comparison of the bid with other bids submitted for the same or similar triggering keywords and/or phrases.
- content publication system 208 may compare the list of affiliated entities with the rating data and select the affiliated entities from the list that will be included in the published content item. Dynamically selecting the affiliated entities from the list (e.g., instead of selecting the entities when the list is submitted) may help ensure that the ratings used to determine which entities are selected from the list are current at the time of publication of the content item.
- selection of the affiliated entities may be performed in part based on a geographic location (e.g., identified within the input relating to the user activity).
- a bid may include a bid to display a content item in response to a triggering phrase “best cocktail in (location),” where (location) includes one of six locations, such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and Tampa Bay.
- the list of affiliated entities may include six groups of affiliated entities, each of which is connected to one of the locations. If an input phrase of “best cocktail in Houston” results in the bid being selected, content publication system 208 may be configured to select affiliated entities for inclusion from among the group of affiliated entities associated with the Houston location.
- published content items that promote affiliated entities as described herein may be triggered for selection only upon detection of input relating to the user that satisfies one or more triggering characteristics.
- affiliate-promoting content items may be selected when the detected input includes one or more of a superlative (e.g., “best” or “greatest”), a location indicator (e.g., “in” or “near”), and/or a market or geographic location (e.g., “Chicago” or “nyc”). Any type of triggering phrase or condition could be utilized to trigger selection of an affiliate-promoting bid according to various illustrative implementations.
- entities may be selected from the list based on a combination of rating data from different sources. For example, if rating data from multiple different sources relates to the same category (e.g., restaurants), the entities in that category may be ranked and selected for inclusion based on a combination of the rating data sources. In some implementations, if the rating data sources utilize different numerical or quantitative scales for ratings, the scales may be normalized to one another to allow combination of the ratings for the purposes of comparing the entities on the list.
- the entities may be selected based in part on input relating to the user. For example, if the input indicates that the user is interested in a particular characteristic, content publication system 208 may select entities based in part on that characteristic.
- an input phrase in a search engine may be “best cheap golf courses near Chicago,” and content publication system 208 may select golf courses from a list of affiliated golf courses that have green fees under a particular price or within a particular price category.
- the characteristic data for the affiliated entities may be provided by the content provider as part of the list, collected by content publication system 208 based on the name and/or other data provided by the content provider, included within the data provided by the third party rating entities, etc.

Description
- Online content publication systems allow content publishers to publish content that promotes the content publisher and/or products/services that the content publisher sells. For example, manufacturers may publish content that promotes the manufacturers' products or brand to consumers. Retailers may publish content that promotes the retailers' stores and/or products that the retailers sell. However, online content publication systems do not provide a mechanism for entities such as manufacturers to promote affiliated entities (e.g., retailers that sell the manufacturers' products) in published content.
- One implementation of the disclosure relates to a method that includes receiving, at a computerized content publication system from a content provider, data identifying a plurality of affiliated entities that the content provider wishes to promote within published content. The method further includes receiving, at the content publication system from one or more computerized systems of one or more third party entities, rating data from the one or more third party entities. Each of the one or more third party entities is an entity other than the content provider and the plurality of affiliated entities. The rating data relates to one or more of the plurality of affiliated entities. The method further includes selecting, at the content publication system, two or more affiliated entities from among the plurality of affiliated entities for inclusion within a published content item based on the ranking data from the one or more third party entities.

FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of a process for generating content that promotes affiliated entities according to an illustrative implementation. -
FIGS. 4 and 5 are display images of example content items that may be generated using the process ofFIG. 3 according to illustrative implementations. -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a computing device according to an illustrative implementation. - Referring generally to the Figures, various illustrative systems and methods are provided that allows content providers to publish content promoting affiliated entities based on rankings or reviews provided by a third party. Content publication systems typically allow for the following types of content to be published within a basic manufacturer->retailer->consumer business model: (1) manufacturers can promote their products to consumers; (2) retailers can promote the products they sell to consumers; and (3) retailers can promote their stores to consumers. Such systems may not provide content publishers (e.g., manufacturers) with a way to promote entities with which they are affiliated (e.g., retailers that sell the manufacturers' products) to consumers.
- A content publication system according to illustrative implementations of the present disclosure may allow a content provider to promote one or more affiliated entities using third party data such as ratings or rankings. For example, a beverage manufacturer may establish a content campaign in which the published content promotes bars and/or restaurants that serve beverages manufactured by the beverage manufacturer to consumers based on third party rankings such as those published by Zagat. The content provider may provide a list of affiliated entities to the content publication system, and the content publication system may use the third party data to determine one or more of the affiliated entities to be featured in the published content. In some implementations, the content publication system may include in the published content a predetermined number of affiliated entities having the highest rankings/scores under the third party data or all affiliated entities having a ranking/score above a particular level. The published content may include links to resources associated with each of the selected affiliated entities (e.g., a resource published by the affiliated entity and/or a third party resource such as a map identifying a location of the affiliated entity). In some implementations, the third party ranking may appear next to a link or other data relating to the selected affiliated entities. In some implementations, the content may be a special type of content triggered in response to particular predetermined trigger conditions, such as a superlative (e.g., “best”) and/or location (e.g., “best restaurants in Chicago”).

FIG. 1A shows apromotion chain 100 illustrating promotion channels available to amanufacturer 105 under a traditional content publication system according to an illustrative implementation. Traditional content publication systems allowmanufacturer 105 to promote products toretailers 110 in an effort to encourageretailers 110 to sell the products (e.g., a “business-to-business,” or B2B, channel).Manufacturer 105 may also promote the products directly toconsumers 115 in an effort to encourageconsumers 115 to purchase the products (e.g., a “business-to-consumer,” or B2C, channel). Traditional content publication systems do not provide opportunities to publish content specifically designed formanufacturer 105 to promoteretailers 110 that sell products manufactured bymanufacturer 105 toconsumers 115. This results in an “incomplete triangle” or missed opportunity to connectconsumers 115 who may wish to purchase products made bymanufacturer 105 withretailers 110 through whichconsumers 115 may purchase the products. - This limitation of traditional content publication systems is further illustrated with respect to
FIG. 1B , which illustrates types of promotion that are and are not available toretailer 110 andmanufacturer 105 using a traditional content publication system according to an illustrative implementation.Retailer 110 may publish content that promotes products sold byretailer 110 and content that promotes the stores, website, computing device application, etc. ofretailer 110.Manufacturer 105 may publish content that promotes the products produced bymanufacturer 105. Traditional content publication systems do not provide a mechanism formanufacturer 105 to publish content promotingmultiple retailers 110 that sell the products produced bymanufacturer 105 in an effort to connect thoseretailers 110 with consumers. -
FIG. 1C illustrates anotherexample promotion chain 150 that shows promotion channels available to a content publisher such asmanufacturer 105 under a content publication system of the present disclosure according to an illustrative implementation.Promotion chain 150 provides the samechannels linking manufacturer 105 withretailers 110 andmanufacturer 105 withconsumers 115 as inpromotion chain 100. Content publication systems of the present disclosure also provide methods formanufacturer 105 to help achieve a link betweenretailers 110 that are affiliated with manufacturer 105 (e.g., sell products produced by manufacturer 105) andconsumers 115 that may be interested in purchasing products made bymanufacturer 105, completing the “incomplete triangle.” Connectingaffiliated retailers 110 withconsumers 115 may increase business opportunities (e.g., sales) formanufacturer 105. For example, aconsumer 115 who may be interested in purchasing a product made bymanufacturer 105 may be presented with a content item that identifies one ormore retailers 110 that are near a current location of theconsumer 115 and sell the product. This may provide an opportunity for theconsumer 115 to immediately purchase the product at one of the identifiedretailers 110 and may increase the likelihood that theconsumer 115 will move ahead with the purchase rather than changing his or her mind. Additionally, the content publication system may providemanufacturer 105 with a way to promote thoseretailers 110 who are most valuable to manufacturer 105 (e.g., sell a large amount of products made bymanufacturer 105, promote products made bymanufacturer 105 in content they publish, etc.). The content publication system may also provide more useful results to users who are searching for particular types of information, such as location-based information. - While
FIGS. 1A through 1C and illustrative implementations discussed herein identify manufacturers of products as an example of content providers who may utilize the content publication system, the present disclosure is equally applicable to providers of services and/or other content providing entities having a relationship with one or more other entities that the content providing entities may wish to promote to customers. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , and in brief overview, a block diagram of acontent publication system 208 and associatedenvironment 200 is shown according to an illustrative implementation. One ormore user devices 204 may be used by a user to perform various actions and/or access various types of content, some of which may be provided over a network 202 (e.g., the Internet, LAN, WAN, etc.). For example,user devices 204 may be used to access websites (e.g., using an internet browser), media files, and/or any other types of content.Content publication system 208 may be configured to select content for display to users within resources (e.g., webpages, applications, etc.) and to provide content from acontent database 210 touser devices 204 overnetwork 202 for display within the resources. The content from whichcontent publication system 208 selects items may be provided by one or more content providers vianetwork 202 using acontent provider device 206. - In some implementations, bids for content to be selected by
content publication system 208 may be provided tocontent publication system 208 from content publishers participating in an auction using devices, such ascontent provider device 206, configured to communicate withcontent publication system 208 throughnetwork 202. In such implementations,content publication system 208 may determine content to be published based at least in part on the bids. - Referring still to
FIG. 2 , and in greater detail,user devices 204 and/orcontent provider device 206 may be any type of computing device (e.g., having a processor and memory or other type of computer-readable medium), such as a television and/or set-top box, mobile communication device (e.g., cellular telephone, smartphone, etc.), computer and/or media device (desktop computer, laptop or notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet device, gaming system, etc.), or any other type of computing device. In some implementations, one ormore user devices 204 may be set-top boxes or other devices for use with a television set. In some implementations, content may be provided via a web-based application and/or an application resident on auser device 204. In some implementations,user devices 204 and/orcontent provider device 206 may be designed to use various types of software and/or operating systems. In various illustrative implementations,user devices 204 and/orcontent provider device 206 may be equipped with and/or associated with one or more user input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, remote control, touchscreen, etc.) and/or one or more display devices (e.g., television, monitor, CRT, plasma, LCD, LED, touchscreen, etc.). -
User devices 204 and/orcontent provider device 206 may be configured to receive data from various sources using anetwork 202. In some implementations,network 202 may comprise a computing network (e.g., LAN, WAN, Internet, etc.) to whichuser devices 204 and/orcontent provider device 206 may be connected via any type of network connection (e.g., wired, such as Ethernet, phone line, power line, etc., or wireless, such as WiFi, WiMAX, 3G, 4G, satellite, etc.). In some implementations,network 202 may include a media distribution network, such as cable (e.g., coaxial metal cable), satellite, fiber optic, etc., configured to distribute media programming and/or data content. - Some content that may be accessed via
user devices 204 may include content that has been selected to appear in conjunction with certain resources through an auction or other content selection process. For example, a portion of a search result interface or another resource may be configured to display content that has been selected through the use of an auction.Content publication system 208 may be configured to receive bids from auction participants (e.g., content providers) and select content to be displayed in resources (e.g., on webpages) based on the bids. In some implementations, content may be ranked based on bids associated with the content. A search engine or other resource operator may receive revenue by auctioning a certain set of keywords to auction participants. Auction participants may place auction bids for the ability to include their content on the search result resource, whenever a user searches using a keyword in the set. For example, an online manufacturer of golf equipment may participate in an auction for the golf-related set of keywords. If a user searches for the term “golf,” and the manufacturer is determined to be the winner of the auction, content from the manufacturer may appear in the same resource as the search results. A provider of a website devoted to a particular topic may also receive revenue by auctioning off the ability to place content with his or her resource (e.g., embedded in a webpage, in a pop-up window, etc.). In some implementations, the provider of the website may be a different entity than the provider ofcontent publication system 208. Similar to bidding on search results, an auction participant may place a bid in the auction using a set of keywords that corresponds to keywords found in the text of the resource. In some implementations, the auction bids may additionally or alternatively include criteria other than keywords, such as user interests, locations (e.g., geographic areas), semantic entities of resources (e.g., web pages), etc. - In some implementations, the content provider may create an account with
content publication system 208. Associated with the account may be data relating to which content the content provider wishes to use, a daily budget to spend, topical categories of resources on which the content is to be placed (e.g., resources related to Sports>Golf, etc.), one or more bid amounts, and/or other data that may be used bycontent publication system 208 to select content to be displayed byuser devices 204. When auser device 204 interacts with a resource that participates in the auction network,content publication system 208 may compare bids among auction participants to select content to be included in the resource. In some implementations, bids may be received from one or morecontent provider devices 206, and information relating to the bids, including the content associated with the bids, may be stored in content database 210 (e.g., in a content items portion 212).Content provider device 206 may be similar devices and/or have similar characteristics and features as described with respect touser devices 204. -
Content publication system 208 is configured to allow a content provider to generate and submit content items for publication (e.g., as part of bids) that feature and/or promote one or more entities that are affiliated with the content provider.FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram of aprocess 300 for generating content that promotes affiliated entities according to an illustrative implementation. Referring to bothFIGS. 2 and 3 ,content publication system 208 may receive a list of affiliated entities that the content provider wishes to promote fromcontent provider device 206 via network 202 (305). In some implementations, the content provider may be a producer of products and/or services and the affiliated entities may be retailers or other entities that sell or otherwise feature the products/services of the manufacturer. In some implementations, the content provider may be an entity who is interested in promoting one or more other entities regardless of whether or not the content provider has a financial interest in the promoted entities. For example, a content provider may provide a list of philanthropic organizations whose causes the content provider wishes to support. The use of the term “affiliated entities” herein is not intended to imply that the content provider must have a formal relationship or legal relationship with the affiliated entities, rather only that the content provider wishes to promote the affiliated entities through published content. - The list of affiliated entities may be provided to
content publication system 208 in conjunction with or separate from content that the content provider wishes to be published. In some implementations, the list of affiliated entities may be included as part of a bid for content to be published submitted by the content provider (e.g., submitted along with the actual content item or creative). In some implementations, the list of affiliated entities may be provided separate from one particular content item for the purpose of being applied to a group of content items, such as a content campaign relating to a particular product or service. For example, a beverage manufacturer may create a content campaign featuring several types of beverages made by the manufacturer, and the beverage manufacturer may provide a list of restaurants that serve the manufacturer's beverages to be applied to part or all of the content submissions or bids submitted as part of the campaign. The list of affiliated entities may be stored in anaffiliated entities portion 214 ofcontent database 210 for retrieval bycontent publication system 208 when generating content to be published. - In some implementations, content providers may be free to determine what affiliated entities and/or how many entities to include within the list. For example, a content provider may determine that an entity may be included within the list if the entity sells a certain amount of the content provider's products or services, if the entity features the content provider or its products/services prominently in its marketing materials, or for any other reason. For example, a producer of beverages may include restaurants or other establishments where a specified percentage of beverages served are made by the beverage producer, a golf equipment manufacturer may include golf courses that sell more of the manufacturer's clubs in their pro shops than other brands, a shampoo manufacturer may include salons that use its shampoo, etc. In some implementations, a submitted list may be partitioned into different geographic locations. For example, a list submitted by a golf club manufacturer may include separate lists of affiliated courses in each of the New York, Chicago, San Diego, and Dallas areas. In some implementations,
content publication system 208 may require that the submitted list include a minimum number of affiliated entities per geographic location (e.g., more than 3, more than 5, more than 10, etc.) to prevent brands from biasing the list. -
Content publication system 208 may also receive rating data from one or more third party entities (rating parties) (310).Content publication system 208 may receive the rating data by communicating with thirdparty entity systems 216 having rating data stored in one ormore rating databases 218. The third party rating entities may include any entity that rates, ranks, or otherwise substantively reviews other entities. In some implementations, the third party rating entities may be organizations that create ratings or rankings internally (e.g., Zagat) and/or organizations that compile rankings based on submitted user reviews (e.g., Yelp). In some implementations,content publication system 208 may only retrieve rating data from third party entities that utilize quantitative ratings and/or rankings so thatcontent publication system 208 can organize and rank entities from the list of affiliated entities based on the rating (e.g., numerical rating). In some implementations,content publication system 208 may utilize rating data from third party entities that include only qualitative ratings. In some implementations,content publication system 208 may retrieve rating data and store the rating data incontent database 210. For example,content publication system 208 may obtain rating data periodically, according to a schedule, etc., store the data indatabase 210, and use the stored data to prepare content items to be published. In some implementations,content publication system 208 may retrieve rating data in real-time or near real-time while preparing content items for publication to ensure that the ratings are as current as possible. - In some implementations,
content publication system 208 may be configured to utilize the same third party rating source or sources to prepare every published content item for a particular category (e.g., restaurants, entertainment venues, etc.). For example, any content item relating to restaurants may be generated using the same one or more third party ratings. This may help provide the user with a consistent experience. In some implementations, the content provider may be allowed to select which third party ratings the content provider wishes to be used in generating content items for the content provider (e.g., from among a list of available third party ratings). -
Content publication system 208 may select two or more affiliated entities from the list for inclusion in the published content item based on the rating data (315). In some implementations,content publication system 208 may select a predetermined number of affiliated entities from the list having the highest rating under the rating data. For example,content publication system 208 may select the top three affiliated entities from the list for a particular content item being published. In some implementations,content publication system 208 may select some or all of the entities having a rating above a certain threshold rating. For example,content publication system 208 may select some or all of the listed entities having a rating higher than 75 on a scale of 0 to 100, or a rating of “B” or above on a F to A grading scale. In some implementations, a combination of selection methods may be used. For example, the top three listed entities by rating may be selected for inclusion in the published content item, but only if they all exceed a threshold rating level. Various other selection criteria may be used based on the rating data according to other illustrative implementations. In some implementations, the rating data may be the sole criterion for which affiliated entities are selected for inclusion in the published content item. - In some implementations, selection of the affiliated entities to be included in the published content item may occur dynamically, or after the content item has been selected for publication (e.g., as part of a bidding process). For example, the list of affiliated entities and the content item may be associated with a bid submitted to
content publication system 208. The bid may be associated with one or more triggering keywords or phrases. When the triggering keywords or phrases are detected in input associated with user activity on auser device 204,content publication system 208 may select a content item to be published to the user onuser device 204, for example, based on a comparison of the bid with other bids submitted for the same or similar triggering keywords and/or phrases. After the bid is chosen as a winning bid,content publication system 208 may compare the list of affiliated entities with the rating data and select the affiliated entities from the list that will be included in the published content item. Dynamically selecting the affiliated entities from the list (e.g., instead of selecting the entities when the list is submitted) may help ensure that the ratings used to determine which entities are selected from the list are current at the time of publication of the content item. - In some implementations, selection of the affiliated entities may be performed in part based on a geographic location (e.g., identified within the input relating to the user activity). For example, a bid may include a bid to display a content item in response to a triggering phrase “best cocktail in (location),” where (location) includes one of six locations, such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and Tampa Bay. The list of affiliated entities may include six groups of affiliated entities, each of which is connected to one of the locations. If an input phrase of “best cocktail in Houston” results in the bid being selected,
content publication system 208 may be configured to select affiliated entities for inclusion from among the group of affiliated entities associated with the Houston location. - In some implementations, published content items that promote affiliated entities as described herein may be triggered for selection only upon detection of input relating to the user that satisfies one or more triggering characteristics. For example, affiliate-promoting content items may be selected when the detected input includes one or more of a superlative (e.g., “best” or “greatest”), a location indicator (e.g., “in” or “near”), and/or a market or geographic location (e.g., “Chicago” or “nyc”). Any type of triggering phrase or condition could be utilized to trigger selection of an affiliate-promoting bid according to various illustrative implementations.
- In some implementations, entities may be selected from the list based on a combination of rating data from different sources. For example, if rating data from multiple different sources relates to the same category (e.g., restaurants), the entities in that category may be ranked and selected for inclusion based on a combination of the rating data sources. In some implementations, if the rating data sources utilize different numerical or quantitative scales for ratings, the scales may be normalized to one another to allow combination of the ratings for the purposes of comparing the entities on the list.
- In some implementations, the entities may be selected based in part on input relating to the user. For example, if the input indicates that the user is interested in a particular characteristic,
content publication system 208 may select entities based in part on that characteristic. In one example, an input phrase in a search engine may be “best cheap golf courses near Chicago,” andcontent publication system 208 may select golf courses from a list of affiliated golf courses that have green fees under a particular price or within a particular price category. In various implementations, the characteristic data for the affiliated entities may be provided by the content provider as part of the list, collected bycontent publication system 208 based on the name and/or other data provided by the content provider, included within the data provided by the third party rating entities, etc. - Once the affiliated entities have been selected,
content publication system 208 may generate the published content item including content relating to the selected affiliated entities (320). The published content item may include a portion that relates to the content provider, such as a portion featuring the content provider's products/services/brands/etc. In some implementations, the published content item may include a link to a resource associated with the content provider (e.g., a website of the content provider, a social media profile associated with the content provider, location-based (e.g., mapping) service data relating to the content provider, etc.).Content publication system 208 may transmit data representing the published content item to one or more user devices (325). The data representing the published content item may cause the one or more user devices to display the published content item within an interface of the user devices. - One or more data items may be provided in the published content relating to each of the selected affiliated entities. In some implementations, the data items may include the rating data associated with the selected entity and/or a textual narrative from the third party rating entity relating to the selected entity. In some implementations, the data items may include a link associated with the selected entity, such as a link to a website of the selected entity, social media interface relating to the entity, location-based (e.g., mapping) service identifying a location of the entity, reservation service providing the user with the ability to make a reservation with the selected entity, etc. In some implementations, the published content item may include a link that allows a user to see an expanded list of affiliated entities (e.g., up to or including all of the entities on the list), such as within a mapping interface. In some implementations (e.g., when the content provider is paying for each user click-through), clicks on any of the links in the published content item, including those related to the affiliated entities, may be paid for by the content provider.
