Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for determining category and attribute specifications for product search queries.
- a search query entered by a user as “50 inch lcd” is clearly intended (implicitly) for the product category of televisions even though the product category is not explicitly included within the search query.
- categories are merely, or even barely, implied or are ambiguous.
- methods and systems can determine categories for product searches.
- One or more computing devices can receive a product query of search terms.
- the product query can be classified to identify a product category.
- the search terms may be verified against an ambiguous term list for the product category.
- the search terms may also be verified against an attribute list for the product category.
- the product query may be classified as fully understood in response to all of the search terms matching either the ambiguous term list or the attribute list for the product category.
- a product search may be performed on the product query.
- the product search may be informed by the product category when the product query has been classified as fully understood. Search results may be generated and returned according to the product search.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an online product search system in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein.
- FIG. 2 is a user interface diagram depicting a browser interface for product queries and search results in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for determining category and attribute specifications for product search queries in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein.
- search queries “50 inch lcd,” “50 mm ef lens,” and “1TB Drive,” respectively imply product categories of televisions, camera lens, and hard disk drives. However, these categories are not explicitly included within the queries.
- search queries “50 inch lcd,” “50 mm ef lens,” and “1TB Drive,” respectively imply product categories of televisions, camera lens, and hard disk drives. However, these categories are not explicitly included within the queries.
- attributes and aspects of such product queries For example, it is helpful to determine that the search query “50 mm ef lens” relates to the product category of camera lenses, and also that the desired focal length is 50 mm and the desired mount type is Canon EF.
- a search query may be automatically mapped to a product category. Such a mapping may be incorrect or uncertain for some terms within the query.
- Information from a dictionary of attributes associated with various product categories may be applied to resolve uncertainty from the query classifier in determining the product category.
- Information from a dictionary of category ambiguous terms may also be applied. Such terms may be ambiguous by themselves, but can be resolved to a specific product category when that resolution is supported by category matching attributes from the attribute dictionary.
- an approach may be applied to resolve uncertainty from the query classifier in determining the product category where the query contains an ambiguous term.
- Such an ambiguous term may relate to more than one category but may be resolved to a specific product category when that resolution is supported by category matching attributes from the attribute dictionary.
- an approach may be applied to resolve uncertainty from the query classifier in determining the product category where the query does not contain any terms indicating a particular product category.
- other terms from the search query may indicate an implied product category.
- a metric for evaluating the confidence in the determination of a product category for a search query is whether or not the terms of the search query have been fully understood.
- the techniques presented herein can significantly increase the percentage of product search queries that may be fully understood.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an online product search system 100 in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein.
- a user 110 can issue a product query 120 from a user system 115 to a query classifier 160 via a network 130 .
- the query classifier 160 can map the query to a product category to be provided to a product category resolution module 150 .
- the product category resolution module 150 can evaluate, correct, and verify the product category determined by the query classifier 160 .
- the product category resolution module 150 may leverage a category attribute dictionary 170 and a category ambiguous term dictionary 180 to improve the resolution of the determined product category.
- the product query 120 and the determined product category may then be provided to a product search engine 190 .
- the product search engine 190 may then provide search results 195 to the user 110 at the user system 115 via the network 130 .
- the category attribute dictionary 170 can provide a dictionary of attributes associated with various product categories.
- the category attribute dictionary 170 may be applied to resolving uncertainty from the query classifier 160 in determining the product category associated with the product query 120 .
- the category attribute dictionary 170 entries associated with the category “camera lenses” may include various focal lengths, various types of lens mounts, and so forth as the attributes associated with products of the category “camera lenses.”
- the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 can provide a dictionary of category ambiguous terms. Such terms may be ambiguous by themselves. However, but a product query 120 containing a category ambiguous term may still be resolved to a specific product category according to other terms in the product query 120 . For example, the term “lens” may be ambiguous with respect to the product category “camera lenses” since that term may also apply to, among other examples, the category “contact lenses.”
- the query classifier 160 may be used to map the product query 120 to an initial product category. Even a high-precision query classifier 160 may return mappings that are incorrect or uncertain for some terms within the product query 120 . Accordingly, the product category resolution module 150 may be applied to resolve uncertainty from the query classifier 160 in determining the product category associated with the product query 120 .
- the product category resolution module 150 can leverage information from the category attribute dictionary 170 and the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 to reduce uncertainty in determining the product category from the product query 120 . In practice, the product category resolution module 150 can significantly increase the percentage of product queries 120 that can be fully understand by the online product search system 100 .
- uncertainty from the query classifier 160 in determining the product category may be resolved where the product query 120 contains an ambiguous term A.
- the ambiguous term A may relate to more than one category according to the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 .
- One of those ambiguous categories may be category C.
- the determination of product category C for the product query 120 may be supported when the other terms from the product query 120 are associated with the category C in the category attribute dictionary 170 .
- the combination of partial evidence from ambiguous term A and the query classification C may be regarded as strong evidence that the product query 120 relates to the determined product category C.
- the ambiguous term A may be considered properly interpreted when every term other than A in the product query 120 is also understood based on the category attribute dictionary 170 for category C.
- the whole product query 120 may have been classified into the “camera lens” category by the query classifier 120 .
- the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 indicates that for the “camera lens” category, the term “lens” is an ambiguous term.
- “50 mm” may relate to a focal length of associated with the “camera lens” product category.
- the query term “ef” may relate to a “Canon EF” mount type for the “camera lens” product category. Together, this accounts for every part of the search query 120 even though one part of it (“lens”) may be ambiguous for the category.
- the product query 120 of “50 mm ef lens” may be fully understood as related to the “camera lens” product category.
- the product query 120 of “acuvue lens” contains the same ambiguous term “lens” but may be resolved to the product category “contact lenses” where the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 also includes “lens” as an ambiguous term for the product category “contact lenses.”
- uncertainty from the query classifier 160 in determining the product category may be resolved where the product query 120 does not contain any terms (even ambiguous terms) indicating a particular product category, however other terms within the product query 120 indicate an implied product category.
- the product query 120 does not contain any terms (even ambiguous terms) indicating a particular product category, however other terms within the product query 120 indicate an implied product category.
- the product query 120 may be initially classified into the “television” product category by the query classifier 160 .
- the product category resolution module 150 may leverage the category attribute dictionary 170 to confirm that “52 inch” is a reasonably diagonal dimension for a television, “sony” is a known television brand, and “lcd” is a common television technology. Together, these resolutions from the category attribute dictionary 170 can support a confirmation of the implied product type “television.” In such an instance of an implied product category, it is further strong evidence when no term, or part, of the product query 120 offends the category determination of category C by failing to be resolved within the category attribute dictionary 170 for category C. Such a complete category identification supports characterizing the product query 120 (of “52 inch sony lcd”) as being fully understood.
- the product search engine 190 can use the product query 120 along with the determined product category associated with the product query 120 to identify search results 195 .
- the product search engine 190 may comprise various search index techniques.
- the product search engine 190 may also leverage product or shopping search techniques.
- the search results 195 may be presented to the user 110 at a user system 115 within a web browser or other application software. According to one or more example embodiments, example search results 195 are presented in further detail with respect to FIG. 2 .
- the user system 115 one or more systems associated with the query classifier 160 , the product category resolution module 150 , the product search engine 190 , or any other computing machines associated with this technology may be any type of computing machine such as, but not limited to, those discussed in more detail with respect to FIG. 4 .
- any modules associated with any of these computing machines or any other modules (scripts, web content, software, firmware, or hardware) associated with the technology presented herein may by any of the modules discussed in more detail with respect to FIG. 4 .
- the computing machines discussed herein may communicate with one another as well as other computer machines or communication systems over one or more networks such as network 130 .
- the network 130 may include any type of data or communications network including any of the network technology discussed with respect to FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 2 is a user interface diagram depicting a browser interface for product queries 120 and search results 195 in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein.
- the user interface 210 can provide an input mechanism for the user 110 to enter a product query 120 .
- the user interface 210 can provide a list of search results 195 from the online product search system 100 .
- a set of attribute selectors 220 may be included within the user interface 210 to allow the user 110 to narrow or redirect the search results 195 onto products with specific product attributes.
- the user interface 210 may be rendered as content to be presented to a browser or other software application. Such a browser or software application may be configured to execute upon the user system 115 . As such, the user interface 210 may be presented to, and/or interacted upon by, the user 110 at a user system 115 .
- the attribute selectors 220 may be included within the user interface 210 to allow the user 110 to narrow or redirect the search results 195 onto products with specific product attributes.
- the attributes may be populated within the attribute selectors 220 according to the determined product category for the product query 120 .
- the attributes for population and presentation may be retrieved from the category attribute dictionary 170 according to the determined product category.
- Presentation of the attribute selectors 220 may be particularly meaningful when the product query 120 has been “fully understood” implying a high confidence that the determined product category corresponds to the product query 120 .
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 300 for determining category and attribute specifications for product search queries in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- the online product search system 100 can receive a product query 120 from a user 110 associated with a user system 115 .
- the product query 120 can include terms associated with one or more products being searched by the user 110 .
- a query classifier 160 may be used to map the product query 120 to one or more initial product categories.
- the set of search terms making up the product query 120 may be mapped to a category that covers the set of terms.
- the resulting initial product category mappings may be uncertain for some terms within the product query 120 .
- the product category resolution module 150 may be applied to resolve uncertainty from the query classifier 160 in determining the product category associated with the product query 120 .
- the product category resolution module 150 can leverage information from the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 to reduce uncertainty in determining the product category from the product query 120 where the product query 120 contains an ambiguous term.
- the ambiguous term may relate to more than one category according to the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 .
- the determination of the product category for the product query 120 may be supported when the other terms from the product query 120 are in the category attribute dictionary 170 for the particular category determined for the product query 120 .
- the combination of partial evidence from an ambiguous term and the other query terms may be regarded as strong evidence that the product query 120 relates to the determined product category.
- the product category resolution module 150 can leverage information from the category attribute dictionary 170 in determining the product category from the product query 120 .
- Such implied category resolution can be useful where the product query 120 contains terms implying a product category. Every term, or part, of the product query 120 found within the category attribute dictionary 170 for a particular category, may imply strong corroborative evidence that the classification of that category for the product category 120 is correct. The greater a number of terms within the product query 120 that are within the category attribute dictionary 170 for a particular category strengthen the understanding that the particular category is the correct product category for the product query 120 . When ideally every term in the product query 120 is within the category attribute dictionary 170 (or the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 ) for the particular category then the product query 120 may be classified as “fully understood.”
- the product category resolution module 150 can select a product category for the product query 120 .
- the product category may be selected for having attributes (according to the category attribute dictionary 170 ) matching terms, or parts, of the product query 120 along with any arbitrary terms from the product query 120 according to the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 . Where more than one of the product categories may be initially identified, a category with the most matches may be preferred. A category that covers all terms, or parts, of the product query 120 in either attributes or matched ambiguous terms may be selected as the category and then also result in the product query 120 to be classified as “fully understood.”
- the selected product category may be classified as “fully understood” in response to all terms of the query matching the category. Such a “fully understood” determination can provide confidence that the full intent of the product query 120 is determined and the proper matching search results 195 are more likely to be identified. If the search query 120 is not classified as “fully understood,” a best guess category may still be determined.
- the product search engine 190 can process the product query 120 to identify search results 195 .
- the search engine 190 may also leverage the selected product category to refine the search results 195 .
- the search may be limited to, or narrowed to, products within the identified product category.
- the search may be limited by the attributes associated with the product category as identified within the product query 120 according to the category attribute dictionary 170 . As such the search may be informed by, or improved by, the category determined for the product query 120 .
- refinement or limitation of the search by the product category may be dependent upon whether or not the product query 120 was classified as “fully understood,” or not.
- application of the product category to the product search may be a function of a confidence metric based upon how well the product query 120 was understood or how many of the search terms match the category attribute dictionary 170 or the category ambiguous term dictionary 180 according to the product category.
- the online product search system 100 can return search results 195 to the user 110 at a user system 115 via the network 130 .
- the search results 195 may be presented to the user 110 at a user system 115 within a web browser or other application software.
- the method 300 ends.
- the determination of category and attribute specifications for product search queries may be continued through repeated, or continual, application of method 300 .

Abstract
Systems and methods can determine categories for product searches. One or more computing devices can receive a product query of search terms. The product query can be classified to identify a product category. The search terms may be verified against an ambiguous term list for the product category. The search terms may also be verified against an attribute list for the product category. The product query may be classified as fully understood in response to all of the search terms matching either the ambiguous term list or the attribute list for the product category. A product search may be performed on the product query. The product search may be informed by the product category when the product query has been classified as fully understood. Search results may be generated and returned according to the product search.
Description
- The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for determining category and attribute specifications for product search queries.
- Users frequently perform Internet search queries for products being offered for sale. The users often type search queries that implicitly refer to a specific product or a set of products within a category. While such implicit references may often occur, explicit references within search queries are much less frequent.
- For example, a search query entered by a user as “50 inch lcd” is clearly intended (implicitly) for the product category of televisions even though the product category is not explicitly included within the search query. There is a need in the art for determining product categories from search queries where categories are merely, or even barely, implied or are ambiguous.
- In certain example embodiments described herein, methods and systems can determine categories for product searches. One or more computing devices can receive a product query of search terms. The product query can be classified to identify a product category. The search terms may be verified against an ambiguous term list for the product category. The search terms may also be verified against an attribute list for the product category. The product query may be classified as fully understood in response to all of the search terms matching either the ambiguous term list or the attribute list for the product category. A product search may be performed on the product query. The product search may be informed by the product category when the product query has been classified as fully understood. Search results may be generated and returned according to the product search.
- These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the example embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated example embodiments.
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an online product search system in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. -
FIG. 2 is a user interface diagram depicting a browser interface for product queries and search results in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. -
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for determining category and attribute specifications for product search queries in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. - The methods and systems described herein enable determining category and attribute specifications for product search queries. As example search queries, “50 inch lcd,” “50 mm ef lens,” and “1TB Drive,” respectively imply product categories of televisions, camera lens, and hard disk drives. However, these categories are not explicitly included within the queries. In order to serve the most relevant search results, it is helpful to determine attributes and aspects of such product queries. For example, it is helpful to determine that the search query “50 mm ef lens” relates to the product category of camera lenses, and also that the desired focal length is 50 mm and the desired mount type is Canon EF.
- When one or more terms within a product search query are left indeterminate, the intent of the query may be incorrectly evaluated thereby preventing determination of a correct set of products to present to the user in the search results. Thus, it is an important challenge to understand each part, or term, of the search query. Such a full understanding can provide confidence that the full intent of the query is determined and that properly matching search results are more likely to be provided.
- Using a high-precision query classifier, a search query may be automatically mapped to a product category. Such a mapping may be incorrect or uncertain for some terms within the query. Information from a dictionary of attributes associated with various product categories may be applied to resolve uncertainty from the query classifier in determining the product category. Information from a dictionary of category ambiguous terms may also be applied. Such terms may be ambiguous by themselves, but can be resolved to a specific product category when that resolution is supported by category matching attributes from the attribute dictionary.
- According to certain example embodiments, an approach may be applied to resolve uncertainty from the query classifier in determining the product category where the query contains an ambiguous term. Such an ambiguous term may relate to more than one category but may be resolved to a specific product category when that resolution is supported by category matching attributes from the attribute dictionary.
- According to other example embodiments, an approach may be applied to resolve uncertainty from the query classifier in determining the product category where the query does not contain any terms indicating a particular product category. In such instances, other terms from the search query may indicate an implied product category.
- The two example approaches may be used together with other such category resolution techniques to significantly improve the determination of product categories. A metric for evaluating the confidence in the determination of a product category for a search query is whether or not the terms of the search query have been fully understood. The techniques presented herein can significantly increase the percentage of product search queries that may be fully understood.
- The functionality of the various example embodiments will be explained in more detail in the following description, read in conjunction with the figures illustrating the program flow. Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments are described in detail.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an onlineproduct search system 100 in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. Within the onlineproduct search system 100, a user 110 can issue aproduct query 120 from a user system 115 to aquery classifier 160 via anetwork 130. Thequery classifier 160 can map the query to a product category to be provided to a productcategory resolution module 150. The productcategory resolution module 150 can evaluate, correct, and verify the product category determined by thequery classifier 160. The productcategory resolution module 150 may leverage acategory attribute dictionary 170 and a categoryambiguous term dictionary 180 to improve the resolution of the determined product category. Theproduct query 120 and the determined product category may then be provided to aproduct search engine 190. Theproduct search engine 190 may then providesearch results 195 to the user 110 at the user system 115 via thenetwork 130. - The
category attribute dictionary 170 can provide a dictionary of attributes associated with various product categories. Thecategory attribute dictionary 170 may be applied to resolving uncertainty from thequery classifier 160 in determining the product category associated with theproduct query 120. For example, thecategory attribute dictionary 170 entries associated with the category “camera lenses” may include various focal lengths, various types of lens mounts, and so forth as the attributes associated with products of the category “camera lenses.” - The category
ambiguous term dictionary 180 can provide a dictionary of category ambiguous terms. Such terms may be ambiguous by themselves. However, but aproduct query 120 containing a category ambiguous term may still be resolved to a specific product category according to other terms in theproduct query 120. For example, the term “lens” may be ambiguous with respect to the product category “camera lenses” since that term may also apply to, among other examples, the category “contact lenses.” - The
query classifier 160 may be used to map theproduct query 120 to an initial product category. Even a high-precision query classifier 160 may return mappings that are incorrect or uncertain for some terms within theproduct query 120. Accordingly, the productcategory resolution module 150 may be applied to resolve uncertainty from thequery classifier 160 in determining the product category associated with theproduct query 120. - The product
category resolution module 150 can leverage information from thecategory attribute dictionary 170 and the categoryambiguous term dictionary 180 to reduce uncertainty in determining the product category from theproduct query 120. In practice, the productcategory resolution module 150 can significantly increase the percentage ofproduct queries 120 that can be fully understand by the onlineproduct search system 100. - According to certain example embodiments, uncertainty from the
query classifier 160 in determining the product category may be resolved where theproduct query 120 contains an ambiguous term A. The ambiguous term A may relate to more than one category according to the categoryambiguous term dictionary 180. One of those ambiguous categories may be category C. The determination of product category C for theproduct query 120 may be supported when the other terms from theproduct query 120 are associated with the category C in thecategory attribute dictionary 170. In such an instance, the combination of partial evidence from ambiguous term A and the query classification C may be regarded as strong evidence that theproduct query 120 relates to the determined product category C. The ambiguous term A may be considered properly interpreted when every term other than A in theproduct query 120 is also understood based on thecategory attribute dictionary 170 for category C. For example, using the query “50 mm ef lens,” thewhole product query 120 may have been classified into the “camera lens” category by thequery classifier 120. However, the categoryambiguous term dictionary 180 indicates that for the “camera lens” category, the term “lens” is an ambiguous term. According to thecategory attribute dictionary 170, “50 mm” may relate to a focal length of associated with the “camera lens” product category. Similarly, the query term “ef” may relate to a “Canon EF” mount type for the “camera lens” product category. Together, this accounts for every part of thesearch query 120 even though one part of it (“lens”) may be ambiguous for the category. Thus, theproduct query 120 of “50 mm ef lens” may be fully understood as related to the “camera lens” product category. In a contrasting example, theproduct query 120 of “acuvue lens” contains the same ambiguous term “lens” but may be resolved to the product category “contact lenses” where the categoryambiguous term dictionary 180 also includes “lens” as an ambiguous term for the product category “contact lenses.” These examples demonstrate how the term “lens” may be disambiguated based upon context within theproduct query 120. - According to certain other example embodiments, uncertainty from the
query classifier 160 in determining the product category may be resolved where theproduct query 120 does not contain any terms (even ambiguous terms) indicating a particular product category, however other terms within theproduct query 120 indicate an implied product category. When every term, or part, of theproduct query 120 is found within thecategory attribute dictionary 170 for category C, it is determined as strong corroborative evidence that the classification of category C is correct. - Considering the
example product query 120 of “52 inch sony lcd,” theproduct query 120 may be initially classified into the “television” product category by thequery classifier 160. The productcategory resolution module 150 may leverage thecategory attribute dictionary 170 to confirm that “52 inch” is a reasonably diagonal dimension for a television, “sony” is a known television brand, and “lcd” is a common television technology. Together, these resolutions from thecategory attribute dictionary 170 can support a confirmation of the implied product type “television.” In such an instance of an implied product category, it is further strong evidence when no term, or part, of theproduct query 120 offends the category determination of category C by failing to be resolved within thecategory attribute dictionary 170 for category C. Such a complete category identification supports characterizing the product query 120 (of “52 inch sony lcd”) as being fully understood. - It may be considered an important challenge to understand each part, or term, or the
product query 120. Such a “fully understood” determination can provide confidence that the full intent of theproduct query 120 is determined and the propermatching search results 195 are more likely to be identified. - The
product search engine 190 can use theproduct query 120 along with the determined product category associated with theproduct query 120 to identify search results 195. Theproduct search engine 190 may comprise various search index techniques. Theproduct search engine 190 may also leverage product or shopping search techniques. The search results 195 may be presented to the user 110 at a user system 115 within a web browser or other application software. According to one or more example embodiments, example search results 195 are presented in further detail with respect toFIG. 2 . - The user system 115, one or more systems associated with the
query classifier 160, the productcategory resolution module 150, theproduct search engine 190, or any other computing machines associated with this technology may be any type of computing machine such as, but not limited to, those discussed in more detail with respect toFIG. 4 . Furthermore, any modules associated with any of these computing machines or any other modules (scripts, web content, software, firmware, or hardware) associated with the technology presented herein may by any of the modules discussed in more detail with respect toFIG. 4 . The computing machines discussed herein may communicate with one another as well as other computer machines or communication systems over one or more networks such asnetwork 130. Thenetwork 130 may include any type of data or communications network including any of the network technology discussed with respect toFIG. 4 . -
FIG. 2 is a user interface diagram depicting a browser interface forproduct queries 120 andsearch results 195 in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. The user interface 210 can provide an input mechanism for the user 110 to enter aproduct query 120. The user interface 210 can provide a list ofsearch results 195 from the onlineproduct search system 100. A set ofattribute selectors 220 may be included within the user interface 210 to allow the user 110 to narrow or redirect the search results 195 onto products with specific product attributes. - The user interface 210 may be rendered as content to be presented to a browser or other software application. Such a browser or software application may be configured to execute upon the user system 115. As such, the user interface 210 may be presented to, and/or interacted upon by, the user 110 at a user system 115.
- The
attribute selectors 220 may be included within the user interface 210 to allow the user 110 to narrow or redirect the search results 195 onto products with specific product attributes. The attributes may be populated within theattribute selectors 220 according to the determined product category for theproduct query 120. For example, the attributes for population and presentation may be retrieved from thecategory attribute dictionary 170 according to the determined product category. Presentation of theattribute selectors 220 may be particularly meaningful when theproduct query 120 has been “fully understood” implying a high confidence that the determined product category corresponds to theproduct query 120. - According to methods and blocks described in the embodiments presented herein, and, in alternative embodiments, certain blocks can be performed in a different order, in parallel with one another, omitted entirely, and/or combined between different example methods, and/or certain additional blocks can be performed, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, such alternative embodiments are included in the invention described herein.
-
FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 300 for determining category and attribute specifications for product search queries in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments. - In
block 310, the onlineproduct search system 100 can receive aproduct query 120 from a user 110 associated with a user system 115. Theproduct query 120 can include terms associated with one or more products being searched by the user 110. - In
block 320, aquery classifier 160 may be used to map theproduct query 120 to one or more initial product categories. Generally, the set of search terms making up theproduct query 120 may be mapped to a category that covers the set of terms. However, the resulting initial product category mappings may be uncertain for some terms within theproduct query 120. Accordingly, the productcategory resolution module 150 may be applied to resolve uncertainty from thequery classifier 160 in determining the product category associated with theproduct query 120. - In
block 330, the productcategory resolution module 150 can leverage information from the categoryambiguous term dictionary 180 to reduce uncertainty in determining the product category from theproduct query 120 where theproduct query 120 contains an ambiguous term. The ambiguous term may relate to more than one category according to the categoryambiguous term dictionary 180. However, the determination of the product category for theproduct query 120 may be supported when the other terms from theproduct query 120 are in thecategory attribute dictionary 170 for the particular category determined for theproduct query 120. In such an instance, the combination of partial evidence from an ambiguous term and the other query terms may be regarded as strong evidence that theproduct query 120 relates to the determined product category. - In
block 340, the productcategory resolution module 150 can leverage information from thecategory attribute dictionary 170 in determining the product category from theproduct query 120. Such implied category resolution can be useful where theproduct query 120 contains terms implying a product category. Every term, or part, of theproduct query 120 found within thecategory attribute dictionary 170 for a particular category, may imply strong corroborative evidence that the classification of that category for theproduct category 120 is correct. The greater a number of terms within theproduct query 120 that are within thecategory attribute dictionary 170 for a particular category strengthen the understanding that the particular category is the correct product category for theproduct query 120. When ideally every term in theproduct query 120 is within the category attribute dictionary 170 (or the category ambiguous term dictionary 180) for the particular category then theproduct query 120 may be classified as “fully understood.” - In
block 350, the productcategory resolution module 150 can select a product category for theproduct query 120. The product category may be selected for having attributes (according to the category attribute dictionary 170) matching terms, or parts, of theproduct query 120 along with any arbitrary terms from theproduct query 120 according to the categoryambiguous term dictionary 180. Where more than one of the product categories may be initially identified, a category with the most matches may be preferred. A category that covers all terms, or parts, of theproduct query 120 in either attributes or matched ambiguous terms may be selected as the category and then also result in theproduct query 120 to be classified as “fully understood.” - In
block 360, the selected product category may be classified as “fully understood” in response to all terms of the query matching the category. Such a “fully understood” determination can provide confidence that the full intent of theproduct query 120 is determined and the propermatching search results 195 are more likely to be identified. If thesearch query 120 is not classified as “fully understood,” a best guess category may still be determined. - In
block 370, theproduct search engine 190 can process theproduct query 120 to identify search results 195. Thesearch engine 190 may also leverage the selected product category to refine the search results 195. For example, the search may be limited to, or narrowed to, products within the identified product category. Also, the search may be limited by the attributes associated with the product category as identified within theproduct query 120 according to thecategory attribute dictionary 170. As such the search may be informed by, or improved by, the category determined for theproduct query 120. According to various example embodiments, refinement or limitation of the search by the product category may be dependent upon whether or not theproduct query 120 was classified as “fully understood,” or not. According to other example embodiments, application of the product category to the product search may be a function of a confidence metric based upon how well theproduct query 120 was understood or how many of the search terms match thecategory attribute dictionary 170 or the categoryambiguous term dictionary 180 according to the product category. - In
block 380, the onlineproduct search system 100 can returnsearch results 195 to the user 110 at a user system 115 via thenetwork 130. The search results 195 may be presented to the user 110 at a user system 115 within a web browser or other application software. - After
block 380, themethod 300 ends. Of course, the determination of category and attribute specifications for product search queries may be continued through repeated, or continual, application ofmethod 300. -
