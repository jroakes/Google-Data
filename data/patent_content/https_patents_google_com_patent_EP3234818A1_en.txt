Definitions
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of information.
- digital image files, video and/or audio files, as well as web page resources for particular subjects or particular news articles are accessible over the Internet.
- web page resources many of these resources are designed to facilitate the performing of particular functions, such as banking, booking hotel reservations, shopping, etc., or to provide structured information, such as on-line encyclopedias, movie databases, etc. Search engines crawl and index these resources to facilitate searching of the resources.
- a deeplink is an instruction specifying a particular environment instance of a native application and configured to cause the native application to instantiate the environment instance of the specified native application when selected at a user device.
- the native application generates the environment instance for display within the native application on a user device.
- a deeplink may be a URI that specifies a particular native application, resource content that the native application is to access, and a particular user interface that should be instantiated when the native application is launched by use of the deeplink.
- a deeplink may specify a selection menu for a game environment; or a particular selection of a song for a music application; or a particular recipe for a cooking application; and the like.
- a user's informational need may thus be satisfied by search engines providing search results that identify either one (or both) of a particular web page resource that describes a native application, and search results for the native application itself.
- this specification describes a system for providing native application search results with web search results.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that includes the actions of receiving a plurality of web search results responsive to a search query submitted at a user device, the plurality of web search results generated from a web corpus; including an interface element in the plurality of web search results, the interface element specifying a particular native application and configured to, when selected at the user device, cause a plurality of native application search results responsive to the search query be provided to the user device, each native application search result deeplinking to the particular native application; providing the interface element and the plurality of web search results to the user device; receiving an indication of a selection of the interface element from the user device; and in response to receiving the indication, providing the plurality of native application search results for the particular native application to the user device.
- Native application search results can sometimes be more relevant than web search results.
- the system can respond with search results including both native application and web search results.
- the user can select a native application search result to access content directly from a native application installed on a device of the user, thereby providing the user with additional relevant search results and a better user experience.
- the interface element allows a user of a user device to view native application search results via an input to the user device.
- the interface element may provide an efficient way for the user to identify when native application search results are available.
- the interface element may also provide an efficient way for a user to view the native application search results, which may be displayed together in response to receipt of a user input to the device. Such an input may be selection of the interface element.
- the user may, for example, be saved from trailing through a mixed list or other mixed presentation of web search results and native application search results in order to identify whether, and to what extent, native application search results are available. Such a mixed list may be difficult to navigate.
- the efficiency of the interface element in identifying the availability of native application search results may in this regard reduce the number of user inputs to the user device because the user may easily identify the availability of native application search results from the interface element.
- the native application search results may be viewed together by selecting the interface element.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which triggering the search of and the ranking of native applications occurs.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example method for providing native application search results with web search results.
- FIG. 3 is a first illustration of providing native application search results with web search results.
- FIG. 4 is a second illustration of providing native application search results with web search results.
- a system determines when to search a native application corpus for native applications and insert native application search results into a set of general web search results in response to receiving a query.
- the search can optionally be based on a search probability ratio or relevance scores for native application search results.
- a native application generates environment instances for display on a user device within an environment of the native application, and operates independent of a browser application on the user device.
- a native application is an application specifically designed to run on a particular user device operating system and machine firmware. Native applications thus differ from browser-based applications and browser-rendered resources. The latter require all, or at least some, elements or instructions downloaded from a web server each time they are instantiated or rendered.
- browser-based applications and browser-rendered resources can be processed by all web-capable mobile devices within the browser and thus are not operating system specific.
- a search is triggered to include native application search results and web search results
- the corpus is searched for native applications and the native applications are scored.
- scoring signals can be used, including indexed content of native applications, user ratings of the native applications, the query popularity for queries received for searches of the application corpus, etc.
- Native applications, once scored in response to the query, are ranked, and one or more native application search results may be provided to the user device in response to the query.
- Whether a native application search result is provided, and if provided, the position of the native application search result relative to other search results, is determined based on filtering criteria and ranking criteria.
- the filtering criteria and ranking criteria may include the ranking of a corresponding resource that describes the native application relative to other resources, the scores of the native applications, and other factors.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which triggering the search of and the ranking of native applications occurs.
- a computer network 102 such as the Internet, connects resource publisher websites 104, application publishers 106, user devices 108 and a search engine 120.
- a resource publisher website 104 includes one or more web resources
- a resource publisher website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
- a web page resource is any data that can be provided by a publisher website 104 over the network 102 and that has a resource address, e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL).
- Web resources may be HTML pages, images files, video files, audio files, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- the resources may include embedded information, e.g., meta information and hyperlinks, and/or embedded instructions, e.g., client-side scripts. More generally, a "resource” is anything identifiable over a network, and can also include native applications.
- An application publisher website 106 may also include one or more web resources 105, and also provides native applications 107.
- a native application 107 is an application specifically designed to run on a particular user device operating system and machine firmware.
- Native applications 107 may include multiple versions designed to run on different platforms.
- native applications corresponding to a movie database website may include a first native application that runs on a first type of smart phone, a second native application that runs on a second type of smart phone, a third native application that runs on a first type of tablet, etc.
- an “environment instance” is a display environment within a native application and in which is displayed content, such as text, images, and the like.
- An environment instance is specific to the particular native application, and the native application is specific to the particular operating system of the user device 108.
- An environment instance differs from a rendered web resource in that the environment instance is generated within and specific to the native application, while a web resource may be rendered in any browser for which the web page resource is compatible, and is independent of the operating system of the user device.
- a user device 108 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user.
- a user device 108 is typically capable of requesting and receiving web page resources 104 and native applications 107 over the network 102.
- Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and tablet computers.
- the search engine 120 accesses a web index 1 16 and an application index 114.
- the web index 1 16 is an index of web resources 105 that has, for example, been built from crawling the publisher websites 104.
- the application index 1 14 is an index of application pages for native applications 107, and is constructed using an application data extractor and processor 1 10 and an indexer 112. Although shown as separate indexes, the web index 116 and the application index 114 can be combined in a single index.
- the user devices 108 submit search queries to the search engine 120.
- the search engine 120 accesses the web index 1 16 and, optionally, the application index 1 14 to identify resources and applications, respectively, that are relevant to the query.
- a first type of search operation implementing a first search algorithm is used to search the index 1 16
- a second type of search operation implementing a second, different algorithm is used to search the application index 114.
- the search engine 120 implements a resource scorer 132 process to score web resources, and a native application content scorer 134 process to score content within native applications.
- a variety of appropriate search engine algorithms can be used to implement the resource scorer 132 and the native application content scorer 134.
- the search engine 120 utilizes a native application trigger system 136 to determine whether to search the native application index 114 and provide a native application search result to a user device.
- the native application trigger system 136 is described in more detail with reference to FIG. 2 below.
- the search engine 120 utilizes a search engine front end 138, such as a web server, arrange and provide the search results to the user device 108 from which the query was received.
- a web resource search result is data generated by the search engine 120 that identifies a web resource and provides information that satisfies a particular search query.
- a web resource search result for a resource can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the resource, and a resource locator for the resource, e.g., the URL of a web page.
- a native application search result specifies a native application and is generated in response to a search of the application index 1 14.
- a native application search result may include a "deep link" specifying a particular environment instance of the native application and which is configured to cause the native application to instantiate the specified environmental instance.
- selection of a native application search result may cause the native application to launch (if installed on the user device 108) and generate an environment instance referenced in the application search result in the form of a screen shot.
- a native application search result may include a "purchase” (or "install") command that, when selected, results in a purchase (or free download) and installation of the native application on a user device.
- Publishers 106 that provide native applications 107 also provide the deep links 109 to the search engine 120.
- an application publisher may provide a list of deep links 109 in the form of uniform resource identifiers (URIs) (or other instruction types that are specific to the native application published by the publisher).
- URIs uniform resource identifiers
- These deep links are deep links that publisher 106 desires to be crawled and indexed in the application index 114.
- web resources 11 1 that are descriptive of the native applications 107.
- One example of such a resource 11 1 is a product page in an on-line native application store.
- the product page can be browsed using a web browser, and can be indexed in the web index 116.
- the web resource 1 11 may include screen shots of the native application, descriptions of user ratings, and the like.
- the web resource 1 11 is a web page specific to the native application, and is used to facilitate a purchase and/or download of the native application.
- the search engine 120 may include in a set of web page search results a native application search result.
- the native application search result may be, for example, inserted at a position relative to a product web page search result for the native application, or, alternatively, may entirely replace the product web page search result.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram 200 of an example method for providing native application search results with web search results.
- the method 200 will be described with respect to a system, e.g., the native application trigger system 136 of FIG. 1, having one or more computing devices that execute software to implement the method 200.
- the system receives multiple web search results responsive to a search query submitted at a user device (step 202).
- a search engine can generate the web search results from a web corpus, e.g., the web index 116 of FIG. 1.
- the search engine can provide the web search results to the system.
- the system includes an interface element in the web search results (step
- the system can generate the interface element to specify a particular native application that is relevant to the search query.
- the interface element can also be configured to, when selected at the user device, cause the search engine to generate multiple native application search results responsive to the search query. Each native application search result can be a different deeplink to the particular native application. This will be described further below with reference to FIG. 3.
- the system can determine that the particular native application is installed at the user device.
- a user of the user device can have a user account that is logged into the system or the search engine utilizing the system.
- the user account can be associated with a profile of installed native applications on the user device.
- the system can access the profile to determine whether the particular native application is installed.
- the system can then retrieve or generate multiple native application search results deeplinking to the particular native application that are responsive to the search query.
- the search engine can generate the native application search results from an application corpus, e.g., the application index 114 of FIG. 1. Each native application search result also has a respective relevance score, as described above with reference to FIG. 1.
- the system includes the interface element based on relevance scores of native application search results responsive to the search query.
- the system can determine that at least a threshold number of the native application search results for a particular native application have a threshold relevance score to the search query.
- the threshold number and the threshold relevance score can be predetermined by the system.
- the system can include the interface element. If there is not the threshold number of native application search results having the threshold relevance score, the system can provide only the web search results and not any native application search results to the user device.
- the system includes the interface element based on a search probability ratio.
- the search probability ratio is a measure of a likelihood of the search query being submitted for an application corpus, e.g., derived from an application index, compared to the web corpus, e.g., derived from a web index.
- search probability ratio can be the likelihood of a query being issued for a search of a particular corpus.
- search probability ratio is a likelihood that the query is being issued for a search of native applications given a total number of instances of the query for the web corpus.
- the search probability ratio for a particular corpus can be the ratio of the number of instances for the particular corpus to the total number of instances for several corpora combined.
- search engines that provide for the ability to search particular corpora, such as a web corpus, an image corpus, a native application corpus, and the like, can track, for each query, the number of instances that each query is submitted for each corpus.
- a search engine may have access to query logs for on-line stores that offer native applications.
- the number of instances of the query can be compared to the number of instance of the query submitted for a search of one or more other corpora to determine the search probability ratio for the native application.
- the system can determine that the search query has a threshold search probability ratio for the particular native application.
- the threshold search probability ratio can be predetermined by the system.
- the system can include the interface element. Similar to above, if the threshold search probability ratio is not satisfied, the system can provide only the web search results and not any native application search results to the user device.
- the system provides the interface element and the web search results to the user device (step 206) in response to the search query.
- the response can be sent to the user device through a network, e.g., the Internet.
- the system also provides one or more native application search results, e.g., a most highly scored native application search result.
- the interface element can be included as an additional link in the provided native application search results for the particular native application. This will be described further below with reference to FIG. 4.
- the user device can receive a selection of the interface element. For example, a user can click or tap on the interface element.
- the user device sends an indication of a selection of the interface element to the system, and the system processes the indication of the selection of the interface element (step 208).
- the system provides multiple native application search results to the user (step 210).
- the native application search results each correspond to a particular native application, but each has a different deep link.
- native application search results for two or more native applications can be provided.
- the system can generate or be provided with the native application search results responsive to the search query.
- the system can then send the multiple native application search results to the user device.
- Each native application search result when selected at the user device, specifies a particular environment instance of the native application. That is, selecting the native application search result causes the native application to instantiate an instance of the specified native application in which content referenced in the native application search result is displayed.
- FIG. 3 is a first illustration 300 of providing native application search results with web search results.
- the search results can be provided at a browser application of a user device.
- the browser application displays a view 301 of search results 306-310 provided in response to a search query 302 by a search engine.
- the search engine can include an interface element 304, as described above with reference to FIG. 2.
- the interface element 304 can display a title of a native application to which it deeplinks.
- the search engine can determine a position of the interface element 304 within the search results 304-310, e.g., manually or based on web and application search result relevance scores.
- the interface element 304 When selected, the interface element 304 does not instantiate the native application but causes a new view 303 to be displayed in the browser application. That is, the user device can receive the selection and provide the selection to the search engine.
- the search engine can receive an indication of the selection and provide native application search results 312-318 to the new view 303 at the user device.
- Each native application search result is a deeplink to the native application as described above.
- the interface element 304 when selected, is a deeplink to the native application that causes the native application to instantiate an instance of the specified native application with the search query 302 as a parameter.
- the search query 302 can be passed to the native application, e.g., via an Application Program Interface (API), or as a command line parameter.
- API Application Program Interface
- the native application can submit the search query 302 to a backend search system and provide search results responsive to the search query 302 within an environment of the native application.
- the search engine modifies the search query
- the specific query 320 limits search results responsive to the query 320 to be only native application search results for the native application and not web search results.
- an operator "inapp:” can cause the limitation to occur.
- the more specific query 320 restricts search results responsive to the query 320 to be only native application search results for a group of native applications.
- the search engine can modify the search query to "inapp:fancy.bag.app,beautiful.bag.app” or “inapp:installed” to restrict native application search results to reference the "fancy. bag. app” and
- FIG. 4 is a second illustration 400 of providing native application search results with web search results.
- the search results can be provided at a browser application of a user device.
- the browser application displays a view 401 of search results 404-410 provided in response to a search query 402 by a search engine.
- One of the search results is a native application search result, i.e., native application search result 404, while the remaining search results are web search results, i.e., web search results 406- 410.
- the search engine can include an interface element 405.
- the interface element 405 can be an additional link adj acent to the native application search result 404.
- the interface element 405 can display text indicating selection of the interface element 405 will cause additional relevant search results for the native application to be displayed, as described above with reference to FIG. 2.
- the interface element 405 When selected, the interface element 405 does not instantiate the native application but causes a new view 403 to be displayed in the browser application.
- the new view 403 displays only native application search results 412-418, each of which is a deeplink to the native application as described above.
- the search engine modifies the search query
- the specific query 420 limits search results responsive to the query 420 to be only native application search results for the native application and not web search results.
- Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in tangibly-embodied computer software or firmware, in computer hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a tangible non-transitory computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus.
- the computer storage medium can be a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory device, or a combination of one or more of them.
- the computer program may include multiple files, and may be deployed to execute one or more data processing apparatus.
- data processing apparatus encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, special-purpose circuitry, or multiple processors or computers.
- the apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them.
