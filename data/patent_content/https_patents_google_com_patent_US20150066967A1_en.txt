The blank page may be a webpage such as a 404 error page, an undeveloped webpage (e.g., a webpage created by a publisher but for which the publisher does not yet have content for display), a non-existing webpage (e.g., a webpage reached by mistyping a URL), or any other type of webpage for which the publisher does not have content to display on. One way to provide content to display on the blank page is to display advertisements. The advertisements may be related to the domain.
- One implementation of the present disclosure relates to a method for selecting content and search terms for display on a webpage. The method includes receiving a request to provide content on the webpage and selecting content for display on the webpage. The content may be selected based on one or more keywords associated with the webpage. The method further includes logging selections of content by users accessing the webpage and analyzing performance of the content. The content may be associated with one or more keywords. The method further includes selecting selectable search terms related to the keywords associated with the best-performing content and displaying the selectable search terms on the webpage.
- Another implementation of the present disclosure relates to a computer readable storage medium having instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by one or more processors to cause the one or more processors to perform operations. The operations include receiving a request to provide content on the webpage and selecting, content for display on the webpage. The content may be selected based on one or more keywords associated with the webpage. The operations further include logging selections of content by users accessing the webpage and analyzing performance of the content. The content may be associated with one or more keywords. The operations further include selecting selectable search terms related to the keywords associated with the best-performing content and displaying the selectable search terms on the webpage.
- Another implementation of the present disclosure relates to a system for selecting content and search terms for display on a webpage.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with a described implementation. -
FIG. 2 is a more detailed block diagram of the content management system of the computer system ofFIG. 1 in accordance with a described implementation. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example website including content in accordance with a described implementation. -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart of a process for selecting content and search terms for display on a webpage in accordance with a described implementation. - Referring generally to the figures, systems and methods for determining search query hints using content keywords are shown. The search query hints are used by a publisher of a website to provide content that may be of interest to users of the website.
- On an undeveloped website domain (or on another webpage of the website that does not have content), a publisher may provide content for display instead of providing a blank page, a “404 not found” message, an error message, etc. The content may be advertisements, according to one implementation. The types of advertisements may vary. For example, the advertisements may be text or image advertisements that a user can select. The content provided for display may also include selectable search terms. When a user selects a selectable search term displayed on the website, advertisements related to the selectable search terms may be displayed. The advertisements, selectable search terms, and other types of content may be related to the domain and/or domain name of the website.
- When content is selected on the website, the selection may be logged along with the performance of the content. For example, if the content was an advertisement, if the click through rate (CTR) or other metric related to user selection of the advertisement is tracked, the corresponding performance may relate user purchases a product or service the advertisement promoted (or other revenue information related to the advertisement), etc. The keywords or other selection criteria associated with the best-performing content may be determined. The keywords may often include terms that represent a semantic and commercial explanation of the product or service in the advertisement or of the domain of the website. A keyword may be considered more relevant to the website and domain if the content associated with the keyword performs well.
- The best-performing keywords (e.g., the keywords of the best-performing content) may be used as search query hints to assist in determining content to display on the website. These search query hints may assist in determining content by helping determine which selectable search terms to display on the website, which text advertisements to display, or determining other content for display on the website.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , a block diagram of acomputer system 100 is accordance with a described implementation is shown.Computer system 100 includes one ormore client devices 104 which communicate with other computing devices via anetwork 102.Client device 104 may execute a web browser or other application to retrieve content from other devices vianetwork 102. For example,client device 104 may communicate with any number ofcontent sources 106.Content sources 106 may provide webpage data and/or other content (e.g., text documents, PDF files, and other forms of electronic documents) to aclient device 104. In some implementations,computer system 100 may also include acontent management system 108 configured to manage content provided toclient devices 104 bycontent sources 106 or another source connected tonetwork 102.Content management system 108 is shown remotely connected tocontent sources 106 andclient devices 104; in other implementations, content management system 110 may be local tocontent sources 106 orclient devices 104. In general,computer system 100 is shown as an illustrative system that selects content for display onclient devices 104 using selection features of the content. - Network 102 may be any form of computer network that relays information between
content sources 106 andclient devices 104. For example,network 102 may include the Internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, satellite network, or other types of data networks. Network 102 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computers, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) that are configured to receive and/or transmit data withinnetwork 102. Network 102 may further include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections. For example,client device 104 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to other computing devices connected tonetwork 102. -
Client device 104 may be any number of different types of user electronic devices configured to communicate via network 106 (e.g., a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a mobile phone or other mobile device, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a digital video recorder, a set-top box for a television, a video game console, combinations thereof, etc.).Client device 104 is shown to include aprocessor 112 andmemory 114, i.e., a processing circuit.Memory 114 may store machine instructions that, when executed byprocessor 112 to causeprocessor 112 to perform one or more of the operations described herein.Processor 112 may include a microprocessor, ASIC, FPGA, etc., or combinations thereof.Memory 114 may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providingprocessor 112 with program instructions.Memory 114 may include a floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic disk, memory chip, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory, optical media, or any other suitable memory from whichprocessor 112 can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable computer programming language such as, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, HTML, XML, Python, and Visual Basic. -
Client device 104 may include one or more user interface devices. A user interface device may be any electronic device that conveys data to a user by generating sensory information (e.g., a visualization on a display, one or more sounds, etc.) and/or converts received sensory information from a user into electronic signals (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a pointing device, a touch screen display, a microphone, etc.). The one or more user interface devices may be internal to the housing of client device 104 (e.g., a built-in display, microphone, etc.) or external to the housing of client device 104 (e.g., a monitor or speaker connected toclient device 104, etc.), according to various implementations. For example,client device 104 may include anelectronic display 116, which displays webpages and other data received fromcontent sources 106 and/orcontent management system 108. -
Content sources 106 may be one or more electronic devices connected to network 102 that provide content toclient devices 104. For example,content sources 106 may be computer servers (e.g., FTP servers, file sharing servers, web servers, etc.) or combinations of servers (e.g., data centers, cloud computing platforms, etc.). Content may include, but is not limited to, webpage data, a text file, a spreadsheet, images, and other forms of electronics documents. - According to various implementations,
content sources 106 may provide webpage data toclient devices 104 that includes one or more content tags. In general, a content tag may be any piece of webpage code associated with including content with a webpage. According to various implementations, a content tag may define a slot on a webpage for additional content, a slot for out of page content (e.g., an interstitial slot), whether content should be loaded asynchronously or synchronously, whether the loading of content should be disabled on the webpage, whether content that loaded unsuccessfully should be refreshed, the network location of a content source that provides the content (e.g.,content sources 106,content management system 108, etc.), a network location (e.g., a URL) associated with clicking on the content, how the content is to be rendered on a display, one or more keywords used to retrieve the content, and other functions associated with providing additional content with a webpage. For example,content sources 106 may provide webpage data that causesclient devices 104 to retrieve an advertisement fromcontent management system 108. In another implementation, the advertisement may be selected bycontent management system 108 and provided by acontent source 106 as part of the webpage data sent toclient device 104. - Similar to
content sources 106,content management system 108 may be one or more electronic devices connected to network 102 that provide advertisements and/or other content toclient devices 104.Content management system 108 may be a computer server (e.g., FTP servers, file sharing servers, web servers, etc.) or a combination of servers (e.g., a data center, a cloud computing platform, etc.).Content management system 108 may include a processing circuit including a processor and memory as described above. The processing circuit ofcontent management system 108 may be configured to select content to provide to aclient device 104 or to providecontent sources 106 with information allowing thecontent sources 106 to select content to provide to aclient device 104. For example,content management system 108 may select content, such as an advertisement, to be provided with a webpage served bycontent sources 106. - Content selected by
content management system 100 may be provided to aclient device 104 bycontent sources 106 orcontent management system 108. For example,content management system 108 may select content fromcontent sources 106 to be included with a webpage served by acontent source 106. In another example,content management system 108 may provide the selected content to aclient device 104. In some implementations,content management system 108 may select content stored inmemory 114 of aclient device 104. The content may be selected based on content keywords, in accordance with one implementation. For example,content management system 108 may select content, such as an advertisement, if the content has one or more keywords that are a match with the website onclient device 104. The content may include advertisements, selectable search terms, search query hints, etc. - The selection of content may further be based on one or more user identifiers associated with
client device 104. The user identifiers may refer to any form of data that may be used to represent one or more users that have opted into or have not opted out of receiving relevant content selected bycontent management system 108. In some implementations, a user identifier may be associated with a client identifier that identifies a client device tocontent management system 108 or may itself be the client identifier. In some implementations, a user identifier may be associated with multiple client identifiers (e.g., a client identifier for a mobile device, a client identifier for a home computer, etc.). Client identifiers may include, but are not limited to, cookies, device serial numbers, user profile data, telephone numbers, or network addresses. For example, a client identifier associated withclient device 104 may be used to identifyclient device 104 and the client tocontent management system 108. In another implementation, user identifiers and client identifiers may be anonymous. For example, a client identifier may include information about a user and client device, but not information that would identify the user tocontent management system 108.Content management system 108 may then use the client identifier and user identifiers for content selection (as described below) without knowledge of the identity of the user. -
Content management system 108 may use information associated with a user identifier in addition to keyword information to select relevant content for the user identifier. For example,content management system 108 may analyze history data associated with a user identifier to determine one or more potential interest categories for the user identifier. History data may be any data associated with a user identifier that is indicative of an online action (e.g., visiting a webpage, selecting an advertisement, navigating to a webpage, making a purchase, downloading content, etc.). Advertisers and other content sources that have content matching an interest category of a user identifier may select content to be provided to a device associated with the user identifier. For example,content management system 108 may select content to be displayed with a certain webpage byclient device 104. While the present disclosure describes systems and methods for content selection based on keywords and content performance, in various implementations, user identifiers may be used in addition to keywords and content performance to select content. - The content provided by
content sources 106 may be advertisements. The advertisements may be image advertisements, flash advertisements, video advertisements, text-based advertisements, or any combination thereof. It should be understood that while the present disclosure describes the use of text advertisements and search terms, the type of advertisement or other content displayed via aclient device 104 may vary according to various implementations. -
Computer system 100 is illustrated as an example environment for use with the systems and methods of the present disclosure; in various implementations,computer system 100 may include more or less systems and modules for use with the systems and methods of the present disclosure. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , a more detailed block diagram ofcontent management system 108 is shown, according to an exemplary embodiment.Content management system 108 selects content to display onclient devices 104. In one implementation,content management system 108 is configured to select content for a webpage displayed onclient devices 104. The webpage may be an undeveloped domain, an empty page, an error page (e.g., a “page not found” error page), or any other type of webpage where the publisher of the webpage has no or an insufficient amount of content to display.Content management system 108 may select content to display on the webpage in lieu of leaving the webpage blank or with an error message. -
Content management system 108 includesprocessing electronics 202 including aprocessor 204 andmemory 206.Processor 204 may be implemented as a general purpose processor, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a group of processing components, or other suitable electronic processing components.Memory 206 is one or more devices (e.g., RAM, ROM, Flash memory, hard disk storage, etc.) for storing data and/or computer code for completing and/or facilitating the various processes described herein.Memory 206 may be or include non-transient volatile memory or non-volatile memory.Memory 206 may include data base components, object code components, script components, or any other type of information structure for supporting the various activities and information structures described herein.Memory 206 may be communicably connected toprocessor 204 and includes computer code or instructions for executing one or more processes described herein. -
Content management system 108 includes an input/output (I/O)interface 212 that may be configured to receive data from various media channels and to transmit advertisements and advertisement information to the various media channels as described above. I/O interface 212 may be configured to facilitate communications, either via a wired connection or wirelessly, with the multiple media channels, network, advertisers, and other devices as described in the present disclosure. -
Memory 206 includes various modules for completing the methods described herein. It should be understood thatmemory 206 may include more or less modules, and that some of the activity described as occurring withinmemory 206 andprocessing electronics 202 may be completed by modules located remotely from advertisement management system 200 orprocessing electronics 202. -
Memory 206 is shown to include aperformance module 208.Performance module 208 may generally be configured to evaluate performance of content displayed on a webpage of aclient device 104. When a user selects content (e.g., an advertisement) on the webpage, the performance of the content may be evaluated. The performance may be calculated using various metrics. For example, if the content is an advertisement, a click through rate (CTR) may be calculated (e.g., the number of clicks on the advertisement compared to the number of times the advertisement is shown on the webpage). The advertisements may be ranked based on their CTR, according to one implementation. As another example, the number of clicks on the advertisement may be totaled. As yet another example, other metrics such as impressions or views (the number of times an advertisement is shown on a webpage), a cost per action or click (e.g., the number of actions or clicks a user makes after selecting an advertisement), or revenue may be used to evaluate content performance. -
Memory 206 further includes acontent selection module 210.Content selection module 210 may determine content to display on a webpage (e.g., a webpage displayed on client device 104). The content may be advertisements (e.g., image advertisements, video advertisements, text advertisements, search terms, etc.), according to one implementation.Content selection module 210 may determine which content to display on the webpage based on the type of webpage and on performance of content previously displayed on the webpage. - For example,
content selection module 210 may initially select content (e.g., multiple advertisements) to display on the webpage. The advertisements may be selected based on webpage information. For example, if the website is a parked domain and the URL includes the word “car”, or if the webpage is an error page for a website about cars, the advertisement may be related to cars. For example, some of the advertisements that are selected may relate to sportscars, some of the advertisements may relate to foreign cars, some of the advertisements may be relate to car insurance, etc. In other words, advertisements may be related to the topic of the webpage but may vary from other advertisements shown on the webpage in other ways. - The performance of the advertisements may be evaluated by, for example,
performance module 208. Using the performance evaluation, selection criteria (e.g., related search terms) are determined. Using the selection criteria,content selection module 210 selects content for display on the webpage again. For example, the URL, subject or topic of the domain may be related to bats, and one keyword of the domain may be “bat.” Ads may be displayed on the domain that relate to bats. A list may be generated of the keywords of ads that have been clicked on. For example, the list may include “baseball bat”, “cricket bat”, and other keywords that may have been used in connection with well-performing, bat-related advertisements. “Baseball bat,” “cricket bat” and the other keywords are then displayed as related search queries. The performance of each keyword may be tracked (e.g., it may be determined that “baseball bat” performs better than “cricket bat”). Then, when another user selects a search term, the best performing keywords (e.g., “baseball bat”) may be used to refine the type of advertisement displayed (e.g., more ads relating to baseball bats may be shown than ads related to cricket bats). - As another example, for a webpage associated with vehicles, if text advertisements related to sportscars (e.g., advertisements with the keyword “sportscars”, or advertisements that are about sportscars) are performing better than other car advertisements on the webpage,
content selection module 210 may select search terms related to “sportscars” to display on the webpage as related search queries. The terms that are selected may be those terms that are the keywords for the advertisements that are performing well (in this example, the advertisements relating to sportscars). - In one implementation,
content selection module 210 may assign weights to different keywords based on performance evaluation fromperformance module 208. For example, the keywords of the best-performing content may be assigned a greater weight than keywords of lesser-performing content.Content selection module 210 may then use the weights to determine when or how often to select a particular advertisement for display. - Referring to
FIG. 3 , anexample webpage 300 for which content may be provided for display is shown, in accordance with a described implementation. For example,webpage 300 may be an undeveloped domain. As another example,webpage 300 may be an error page (e.g., the user may have typed in a wrong URL and the webpage is a page the user is redirected to) and content is provided for display onwebpage 300 instead of or in addition to an error message. As yet another example,webpage 300 may be a webpage without content that is visited by a user via a search.Webpage 300 may receive content from acontent management system 108 or another similar system for content selection, from acontent source 106, or via another source vianetwork 102. - Two types of content may be displayed on
webpage 300. For example,text advertisements 302 andrelated search terms 304 may be displayed.Text advertisements 302 andrelated search terms 304 may be selected based on the webpage. In one implementation,advertisements 302 andsearch terms 304 are selected based on a topic of the webpage, keywords associated with the webpage, or other webpage data. For example, if a user navigated to the webpage from another link, the webpage on which the link was displayed may be used to determine a topic or keyword. As another example, if the webpage was reached because of a typographical error,content selection module 210 or another module may determine an intended user input and use the determination as a topic or keyword. As other examples, metadata of the webpage may be used to determine a topic, a publisher of a webpage may associate the webpage with a topic or keyword, etc. The determination of a topic, keyword, or other webpage property may be performed by a keyword or topic selection tool or other module ofmemory 206. -
Text advertisements 302 may be advertisements selected by, for example,content selection module 210.Text advertisements 302 may relate to a topic or subject ofwebpage 300. For example, in the implementation ofFIG. 3 , the URL includes the term “bat”; therefore,text advertisements 302 may be advertisements related to bats.Text advertisements 302 may be related to different types of bats or may otherwise be related to bats in various ways. For example, one text advertisement is shown related to baseball bats, another text advertisement is shown related to cricket bats, another is shown related to equipment related to batting in baseball, etc. The relation of the advertisements to the topic or subject ofwebpage 300 may be based on the actual keywords associated with webpage 300 (e.g., “bat”) or may be based on any type of interpretation of the keywords. -
Related search terms 304 are shown as another type of content that is selected for display onwebpage 300.Related search terms 304 may be selectable by a user ofwebpage 300. Upon selection, the user may be presented with additional advertisements (e.g., image advertisements, text advertisements, or any other type of advertisement) or other search results related to related search terms 304 (e.g., advertisements with a keyword that matches or is similar to the related search terms). InFIG. 3 , search terms related to “bat” are provided for display: “baseball bats”, “cricket bats”, “wooden bats”, “fungo bats,” etc. For example, an advertisement related to fungo bats may be associated with the keywords “bats” and “fungo bats.” The keyword “bats” may be the keyword that causes the fungo bats advertisement to be selected and displayed amongtext advertisements 302. When the advertisement for fungo bats performs well, another more detailed keyword associated with the same advertisement (in this case, the “fungo bats” keyword) may be used as arelated search term 304. If advertisements for aluminum fungo bats then start performing well, then “aluminum fungo bats” may be used as arelated search term 304. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , a flow chart of aprocess 400 for selecting content and search terms for display on a webpage is shown in accordance with a described implementation.Process 400 may be executed by, for example, acontent management system 108 configured to select content for display on a webpage. -
Process 400 may include receiving a request to provide content on a webpage (block 402) at, for example, acontent management system 108.Process 400 may also include selecting content for display on a webpage (block 404). The selection of content may be made by, for example, acontent management system 108. Referring also toFIG. 3 , block 404 may include selectingtext advertisements 302 andrelated search terms 304 for display onwebpage 300. -
Process 400 may further include logging selections of content by users accessing the webpage (block 406) and analyzing the performance of the content by studying the logged selections (block 408). For example, referring also toFIG. 3 , block 406 may include determining when content is selected by a user and logging the selections, and block 408 may include analyzing the performance of the selected content based on one or more metrics (e.g., CTR). The selections may be logged in, for example,memory 206 of acontent management system 108. -
Process 400 may further include selecting selectable search terms related to keywords associated with the best -performing content (block 410). For example, referring also toFIG. 3 , iftext advertisement 302 relating to baseball bats is the best performing content,webpage 300 may be configured to show morerelated search terms 304 relating to baseball bats than other types of bats. The selectable search terms may then be displayed on the webpage (block 412). - Configurations of Various Exemplary Implementations
