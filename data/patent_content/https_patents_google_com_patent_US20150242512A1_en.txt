- 2. Description of the Related Art
- Users employ Internet searches to locate items of interest from the millions of items available on the Internet. For example, a user may submit a search for “Movie theatre” in hopes of locating webpages, maps, and the like that provide information regarding a movie theatre that is near their location. Search results typically include a listing of hyperlinks to the location items on the Internet as well as some information about the search result. The search results are typically displayed in an ordered listing based one the search results relevance to the search query. For example, webpages including content that closely matches the query string may be ranked and displayed higher in the search results listing than other webpages. In some instances, the user's past Internet browsing history may be used to determine the user's preferences/demographics and search results that correspond to the user's preferences/demographics may be ranked higher.
- Applicants have recognized that, despite search providers taking measures to gather and interpret information about what the user is interested in, search results may not rank and display search results in accordance with the user's actual interest. As a result, user's may have to expend additional effort in locating items of interest or, in some instances, the user may employ another search provider in hopes of receiving search results that they are interested in.

FIG. 6 is a block diagram that illustrates a search query environment in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. -
FIG. 7 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary computer system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. - As discussed in more detail below, provided are systems and methods for ranking and displaying search results. Certain embodiments include a user selecting items that are of interest to them (e.g., places the user would like to visit in the future, articles they would like to read, etc.), and, in response to receiving a search query from the user, generating and displaying a set of search results that reflect the user's interest in the items. In some embodiments, search results that correspond to the selected items receive a boost in ranking such that they appear higher within the set of search results ultimately displayed to the user. For example, where a user selects “The Palo Alto Restaurant” as a place of interest while surfing the Internet, and later submits a search query for “restaurants” that generates a set of search results including “The Palo Alto Restaurant”, the search result for “The Palo Alto Restaurant” receives a boost in its ranking/score such that it is displayed higher within the search results or in another prominent location. Accordingly, search results that correspond to items a user has explicitly expressed an interest in may incur a boost in their rating such that they are displayed more prominently. Thus, for example, a user may be able to select a place they would like to visit in the future (e.g., paces they want to go to) and search results that correspond to the place selected by the user receive a boost in score/ranking within search results that are provided to the user.
- In some embodiments, a list of items selected by the user is generated as the user selects various items. When the user submits a search query, search results corresponding to items in the list may be subject to a score enhancement that helps to boost a ranking score or similar metric used to rank the search results. In some embodiments, the score enhancement includes a score multiplier. For example, a ranking score for search results that correspond to items in the list may be subject to a 2.0× factor (i.e., the score is multiplied by two). In some embodiments, items are associated with different levels/degrees of interest and corresponding levels/degrees of score enhancements. For example, ranking scores for items the user selects as being of high interest may be subject to a factor of 2.0×, and ranking scores for items the user selects as being of moderate interest may subject to a factor of 1.5×.
- Although certain embodiments are described with regard to a various types of items (e.g., places) for illustrative purposes, similar embodiments may be employed with any variety of items such as webpages, articles, goods, services, etc. For example, a user may select various places (e.g., landmarks, cities, businesses, etc.), webpages, articles, goods, services and so forth, such that search results corresponding to any of the items selected receive a boost in their score/ranking regardless of the type of item.
- In some embodiments, a user selects items of interest while navigating (“surfing” the Internet. For example, a user selects an icon or similar graphic associated with an item listed on a webpage and the selected item is added to a list of items that are interest to the user.
FIG. 1 is an illustration of aplace page 100 for “Palo Alto Movie Theatre”. A place-page is a webpage that includes information about a particular geographic place (e.g., a business, point of interest, transit station, neighborhood, landmarks, city and so forth). A place-page often includes contact information for the given place, photographs/images relating to the place, reviews for the place, and so forth. For example,place page 100 may include a place-page for “Palo Alto Movie Theatre” that provides information including a name, address, phone number, webpage, a type/category, hours of operation, directions, reviews, an option to add a review, a listing of movies now playing, a map and so forth.Place page 100 also includes an option to add the place (“Palo Alto Movie Theatre”) to the user's items of interest via selection ofbutton 102 a, as well as options to add the individual movies listed to the user's items of interest via selection ofbuttons - In some embodiments, the option to select an item of interest may be provided within a listing of search results. For example, a search result for a business may be accompanied by a button similar to that of
button 102 a that can be selected by the user to add the business to the list of items that are of interest to the user. A similar button may be provided in association with any variety of search results such that an item corresponding to the search result is added to a list of items that are of interest to a user upon the user selecting a button corresponding to the search result. - In some embodiments, the selections are associated with the user based on the user identifying them self. For example, the user “John Doe” may log into his account by providing his unique name and password. John Doe may browse the Internet while being logged into his account and, upon selecting
buttons - In some embodiments, the user is provided an opportunity to indicate their level/degree of interest. For example, upon selecting
button 102 a, John Doe is prompted with the option of identifying “Palo Alto Movie Theatre” as an item of “High Interest”, “Moderate Interest” or “Low Interest” via selection of a corresponding one of pop-up buttons button 102 a andbutton 104 a, “Palo Alto Movie Theatre” is added to the list of items of interest to John Doe in association with a “High” level of interest. -
FIG. 2 is an illustration of a table 200 including an exemplary listing of items of interest 201 for John Doe. Each entry of table 200 corresponds to an item selected by John Doe and includes aname 202, a level ofinterest 204 and afactor 206.Name 202 includes a name/title or similar descriptive information for the item selected. Level ofinterest 204 corresponds to the user's level/degree of interest in the item.Factor 206 includes a factor that corresponds to the level ofinterest 204. For example, where John Doe selectsbutton 102 a on the place page for “Palo Alto Movie Theatre” andbutton 104 a indicating a high level of interest, the first entry of table 200, including the name “Palo Alto Movie Theatre” and “High” level of interest, is created. In some embodiments,factor 206 may include a predetermined factor that corresponds to the level/degree of interest. For example, high, medium and low levels of interest may correspond to factors of “2.0”, “1.5” and “1.25”, respectively. Although the illustrated embodiment includes a single table/list that includes items of various levels/degrees of interest and corresponding factors, other embodiments may include separate tables/lists corresponding to levels/degrees of interest and/or the factors. For example, a first table/list associated with a factor of “2.0” and including all items selected as being of “High” interest, a second table/list associated with a factor of “1.5” and including all items selected as being of “Moderate” interest, and a third table/list associated with a factor of “1.25” and including all items selected as being of “Low” interest. The table(s) may be stored in a data repository (e.g.,repository 610 described in more detail below). In some embodiments, all items of interest to a user may be associated with a given level/degree of interest. For example, upon the user may not be presented with the option to select a level/degree of interest, and items selected are associated with a default level/degree of interest and factor (e.g., moderate level/degree of interest and a factor of 1.5×). -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart that illustrates anexemplary method 300 of ranking and displaying search results.Method 300 includes receiving a search query from a user as depicted atblock 302. Receiving a search query may include receiving a free-text search string via a search webpage, a map-based search via a search webpage, or the like. For example, John Doe may submit the search string “Palo Alto Business” via a free-text search field of a search webpage. In some embodiments, the search is associated with a particular user. For example, John Doe may submit the search query while being logged into his account. -
Method 300 includes identifying search results as depicted atblock 304. Identifying search results includes identifying a set of one or more search results that are responsive to the search query. For example, where John Doe submits a search query for “Palo Alto Business”, a corresponding search query is submitted to a search server (e.g., a search engine), and the search server processes the search query to identify a listing of search results (e.g., a listing of entities/webpages) corresponding to “Palo Alto Business”. -
Method 300 includes identifying search results corresponding to items previously identified as items of interest to the user as depicted at block 306. In some embodiments, identifying search results corresponding to items previously identified as items of interest to the user includes assessing some or all of the search results to identify search results having a name that matches (e.g., is the same or similar to) a name in a list of items of interest to the user. For example, where the search results include “Palo Alto Shopping Mall” and “Palo Alto Car Repair”, at least these two results are identified as corresponding to items of interest to the user (John Doe) based on their presence in the “List of items of interest to John Doe” 200 (SeeFIG. 2 ). -
Method 300 includes ranking search results as depicted atblock 308. In some embodiments, ranking search results includes determining a ranking score for each of the search results identified at block 306 and raking the search results based on the raking score. The ranking score may be based on a raw raking score provided by the search engine and any applicable factors. The raw ranking for a search results (e.g., a webpage) may include a score determined by the search engine based any number and combination of factors, such as popularity, relevancy to the search query, and so forth. In some embodiments, search results are associated with a raw ranking score, and the raw ranking score for the search results corresponding to the items previously identified as items of interest to the user (identified at block 306) is multiplied by the factor corresponding thereto. For example, the raw ranking score corresponding to “Palo Alto Shopping Mall” is multiplied by “2” and the raw ranking score corresponding to “Palo Alto Car Repair” is multiplied by “1.5” in accordance with thefactors 206 provided in the table ofFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 4 is a table 400 that illustrates an exemplary set of ranked search results 402. Set of ranked search results 402 may include a listing of search results identified by a search engine in response to the search query for “Palo Alto Business” by John Doe. Each entry of table 400 corresponds to a given search result of set of search results 402. Each entry includes aresult name 404, araw ranking 406, araw score 408, a factor 410, anadjusted score 412 and anadjusted rank 414. Theraw ranking 406 is derived based on theraw scores 408 of the search results initially returned by the search engine (e.g., prior to any score adjustments for search results corresponding to items in John Doe's list 201). Theadjusted score 412 is a product ofraw score 408 and factor 410. The factors 410 for search results corresponding to items of interest to John Doe (i.e., items in list 201) include the factor listed in table 200. For example, the search result for “Palo Alto Shopping Mall” has a factor 410 of “2” and the search result for “Palo Alto Car Repair” has a factor 410 of “1.5” in accordance with thefactors 206 provided in table 200 ofFIG. 2 . The factors 410 for search results that do not correspond to an item of interest to John Doe may have a default value (e.g., a value of “1”) or other value determined by the search engine. The adjustedrank 414 is based on theadjusted score 412, with those search results having the highest adjustedscore 412 being ranked the highest. Notably, the search result for “Palo Alto Mall” moved from a raw ranking of “3” to an adjusted ranking of “1” based on the score adjustments. Further, the search result for “Palo Alto Car Repair” moved from a raw ranking of “5” to an adjusted ranking of “4” based on the score adjustments. -
Method 300 includes displaying ranked search results as depicted atblock 310. Displaying the ranked search results may include displaying a listing of search results in accordance with the adjusted rankingsFIG. 5 is an illustration of anexemplary webpage 500 displaying map-based search results 502. Search results 502 correspond to set ofsearch results 402 ranked based on theiradjusted rank 414. Accordingly, the search results displayed reflect a boost in ranking score and/or ranking of search result that correspond to items previously selected by John Doe as items of interest. In some embodiments, search results that correspond to items of interest to the user may be accompanied by a graphic and/or annotations that communicate the association of the search result to the user's items of interest. For example, search results 502 for “Palo Alto Shopping Mall” and “Palo Alto Car Repair” may be highlighted, may be displayed with text having a color that is different from the search results for “Palo Alto Business Park”, and “Palo Alto Better Business Bureau”, and/or may be accompanied by an annotation adjacent the search result that states “This search result corresponds to one or your items of interest”. In some embodiments, the search results that receive a boost in score and/or ranking may be displayed in association with an indication of the boost in score and/or ranking. For example, search results 502 for “Palo Alto Shopping Mall” and “Palo Alto Car Repair” may be accompanied by an annotation adjacent the search result that states “This search result received a boost in ranking based on your indication that it a place of interest to you”. -
