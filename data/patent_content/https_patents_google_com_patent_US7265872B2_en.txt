Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to digital printing and, more particularly, to digital printing methods using error diffusion (ED) but without the usual problems of anisotropy associated with ED methods.
- ED error diffusion
- Error diffusion as first described in “An Adaptive Algorithm for Spatial Greyscale” by R. W. Floyd and L. Steinberg in Proceeding of the SID 17/2, (1976) pp. 75-77, is a popular technique for halftoning used today and is considered to be one of the best, and the best among the techniques with similar operating time. This technique and others are reviewed in the book Digital Halftoning , MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. 1987, by R. Ulichney which is a general reference for digital halftoning. H. Kang, Color Technology for Electronic Imaging Devices , SPIE Optical Engineering Press, Bellingham Washington (1997) is another general reference on digital printing, including digital color printing.
- ED is marred with the problem that it is strongly anisotropic as the result depends strongly on the raster utilized to enumerate the pixels on a page. ED generates worm-like patterns, and other artifacts at the scale of the pixels. These artifacts affect the quality of the image, and are indeed attributed to the very anisotropic character of the algorithm.
- a method to perform digital printing using error diffusion but without the usual problems of the anisotropy associated to that method More particularly, the problems of the anisotropy associated to error diffusion are avoided, for printers that can print more grey levels than just white and black at each pixel, by choosing several rasters and error diffusions methods along these rasters (that may or not be all the same on the different rasters). Digital images are created for these pairs made by a raster and an algorithm followed by performing weighted averaging of the digital images obtained along the rasters, using some chosen set of weights to perform the weighted averaging, so that the average value at each pixel can be rendered at that pixel.
- the invention can also be implemented with printers that have only white and black as possible outputs at each pixel, by creating super-pixels, blocks of B pixels whose outputs in terms of grey level can take B+1 values.
- FIGS. 1 a and 1 b are diagrams illustrating super-pixels that can be used to implement the invention with one bit per pixel digital printers;
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart representing the way the invention can be implemented.
- FIG. 3 a diagram that illustrates the typical flow from an input image to an output image to be printed with a digital printer.
- FIG. 1 a shows examples of two types of super-pixels with 2 bits (3 pixels per block) that are used in conjunction to pave the page.
- the representation of 1 ⁇ 3 and of 2 ⁇ 3 can be fixed as for instance in FIG. 1 a , which might be most adequate for some printers (or other display systems) whose pixels are rectangular rather than being square.
- the representation of 1 ⁇ 3 and of 2 ⁇ 3 can instead be variable, using all or part of the choices available to represent 1 ⁇ 3 and 2 ⁇ 3 as shown in FIG. 1 b .
- Such choice of the representation when the grey level of the super-pixel has been determined to be 1 ⁇ 3 or 2 ⁇ 3 can be made in many ways, for instance:
- VED Vector Error Diffusion
- Each ED algorithm Alg(M) in some library of ED algorithms can be defined by a set of weights defined for instance for the standard raster. As well know in the art, it is easy computation to adopt such weights to any raster, so that with:
- the number M(G,n,i) is, as mentioned, the number of possible output grey levels (including 0 and 1), so that M(G, n, i)>1, and for the simplicity of the exposition we will assume that M(G, n, i) does not depend on i, so that we will use M(G, n) instead of M(G, n, i) to designate the number of grey levels that are possible at each pixel by each of the algorithms Alg(i).
- the number M(G, n) is not a (well defined) function as what counts is the number G of outputs after averaging according to the present invention as described below, which has to correspond to the printer being used, or to the number of grey levels that can be rendered at each pixel or super pixel.
- the final image is obtained by averaging over the n images I dig (i), but the raster may be chosen so that averaging can begin before the images I dig (i) are computed so that less information needs to be traded (another possible tradeoff between efficiency and quality).
- the averaging can be done with equal weights for all images, but one may prefer to use different weights for the different rasters. For instance, one can take two rasters, each providing an image with a two grey levels (0 and 1), and take one image for one of the rasters with weight 2 ⁇ 3, and the other one with weight 1 ⁇ 3 to get 4 grey levels (0, 1 ⁇ 3, 2 ⁇ 3, and 1) for the averaged image.
- n will in general depend not only on the printer being utilized, but also on the image, with images being possibly classifiable according for instance to the violence of the contrast, the presence or not of lots of straight lines, etc., which may help choosing appropriate combinations of rasters, algorithms and weights.
- Block 5 is a library of ED algorithms, which can be kept for instance in standard form, i.e., by the weights that describe the algorithm with the standard raster which consists in following line by line, going down the line, and following each line from left to right.
- a set of weights for averaging the output digital images I dig (i).
- a set of weights may be chosen once and for all, or may depend on the rasters being used, the algorithm being used, and the input images of some classes of input images (such as dark versus clear, landscapes or portraits or neither, etc.).
- At input block 50 is the input image that is a matrix (or array) I inp (h, v).
- I inp a matrix (or array)
- n some number n, with 0 ⁇ n ⁇ G, of rasters that will be used for the process of digital printing according to the present invention.
- n of rasters and of algorithms will be chosen at function block 120 from the library 10 , i.e., for each i that satisfies the inequality (limits on i ) 0 ⁇ i ⁇ n+ 1
- i is incremented at function block 110 , replacing the input i by an output new value i+1.
- the raster R i,L,C and the algorithm Alg(i) with order number i for the pass of the method, as described previously, are picked.
- At function block 120 is also chosen the number M(G, n) of grey levels among which outputs will be sought by the algorithms Alg(i), and the grey levels themselves among which the outputs will be sought.
- M(G, n) and the grey levels themselves among which the outputs will be sought are part of the specifications of the algorithms, besides the ED weights A(a, b, Alg(i), R i,L,C )
- the digital image I dig (i) corresponding to the input image I inp at 50 and to the choices of R i,L,C and Alg(i) and of the associated ED weights A(a, b, Alg(i), R i,L,C ) at function block 120 is computed.
- the averaging process can be done on parts of images rather than on full images to save some space, or to judge the choice made of the rasters and algorithm before the whole processing is done.
- the digital image can be the form in which the image to be printed is given.
- the digital image associated to the input image according to the present invention is printed on the digital printer at 640 .
- the method can be installed in the computer using different means such as a diskette, or using transfer through a network, including a global network such as the Internet, and updates such as new rasters or new algorithms can be installed in the same way.
Abstract
Description
- at random,
- or using a preselected ordering of representations to get the best possible image quality:
- out of a given printer (e.g., by making tests of various periodic sequences of the different renderings of a given grey value),
- or out of a family of printers (e.g., again by making tests of various periodic sequences of the different renderings of a given grey value),
- the preselected ordering being made so as to either:
- depend on the grey level being represented (this is again done by laborious but easy to make testing),
- or to not depend on the grey level being represented,
- or the choices of representation of ⅓ and ⅔ to encode and hide some information in the super-pixels using the teaching of co-pending application Ser. No. 09/593,445.
- n algorithms that may be all different, be all the same, or any choice in between,
- n different rasters, for instance, in the case when n=2, one could choose:
- the standard raster, defined by going down the page line by line, and each line from left to right, starting at the top left pixel which we designate by the pair formed by its column and line coordinates (1,1), and
- the inverted standard raster, defined by going up the page line by line, and each line from right to left, starting at the bottom right pixel (C,L) on a page with C columns and L lines of pixels.
- L standing for the number of lines,
- C standing for the number of columns,
- RK,L,C standing for the Kth raster choice, adapted to L lines and C columns, i.e., the pair
R K,L,C=(I K,L,C , F K,L,C)
where:
I K,L,C=(h(0, K, L, C), v(0, K, L, C)),
stands for the initial condition expressed by the original (starting) pixel of the raster, and where FK,L,C describes the evolution of pixels positions according to that Kth raster as expressed by
(h(m+1, K), v(m+1, K))=F K,L,C[(h(m, K), v(m, K))].
With now (a,b) standing for the vector from the pixel being treated to the pixel whose error is being weighted,
A(a, b, Alg(M), RK,L,C)
will stand for the set of weights for the Mth choice of an algorithm adapted to the Kth choice of a raster.
M i(h, v)=I inp(h, v)+Σ(a,b) in V(i) W (a,b) Er i(h+a, v+b),
where V(i) is the set of vectors (defined by Alg(i) and Ri,L,C) where the errors needs to be taken into account to modify the input Iinp(h, v) at (h, v), and W(a,b) is the weight at (h+a, v+b) in the set of weights A(a, b, Alg(i), Fi,L,C). One can use errors zero out of the L lines and C columns to treat pixels near the boundary by the same formulas as the others. Other methods are easily devised; this is all part of the art of ED.
- the output Idig(i)(h, v) at (h, v) for the ED algorithm Alg(i) is Clos(M(G,n,i)), i.e., the closest grey level g(i,h,v) among the M(G,n,i) ones that are available, and
- the new error Eri(h, v) computed at (h, v) is just:
Er i(h, v)=M i(h, v)−I dig(i)(h, v).
One sees that according to whether g2+g3=1 or not, and according to whether
or not, the number of averaged outputs that needs to be G is different. So for instance, for g2=⅓ and g3=⅔, the list can be rewritten as:
-
- 0, ⅙, ⅓, ½,
- ⅓, ½, ⅔,
- ⅔, ⅚,
- 1,
with alist 0, ⅙, ⅓, ½, ⅔, ⅚, 1 of G=7 different outputs, and we see that M(4, 2)=4 is a possible choice. One can make M(G, n) a function if one imposes that the algorithms possible outputs are equally distributed among the possible M output grey levels and the weights for image average are all equal. Therefore, with averaging weights all set to be 1/n and with possible output grey levels for the ED algorithms all set to be of the form:
the number M(G, n) is a well defined function of G and n. Indeed, then the averaged outputs read
which implies that G=n(M−1)+1=nM−
under all these simplifying assumptions (and only in such case).
for the number of output grey level for the algorithms (Alg(i)). For instance, for
which cannot be as M must be an integer,
so that n=3 is a possible choice,
which cannot be as M must be an integer, and no further value of n is possible, so that for b=2 (or G=4), n=3 and M=2 is the only possible choice under all the simplifying assumptions that we have made. The averaged outputs are then
-
- 0, ⅓, ⅔, 1,
and the possible grey for Alg(1), Alg(2) and Alg(3) are just 0 and 1.
- 0, ⅓, ⅔, 1,
R K,L,C=(I K,L,C , F K,L,C),
where the index K designates the Kth choice of raster, IK,L,C stands for an initial condition, i.e., the choice of an initial pixel on a page with L lines and C columns, FK,L,C stands for the function or lookup table that describes in which order the pixels are visited on the page to perform the chosen ED algorithm, so that with (h(0, K, L, C), v((0, K, L, C)) standing for the initial pixel of the raster RK,L,C(for instance for the standard raster, say RI,L,C, (h(0, 1, L, C), v((0, 1, L, C))=(1, 1), i.e., the top left pixel of the page for any L and C), and (h(m, K, L, C), v((m, K, L, C)) standing for the mth pixel along the Kth raster, we have
(h(m+1, K, L, C), v(m+1, K, L, C))=F K,L,C(h(m, 1, L, C), v((m, 1, L, C)).
For instance, with the standard raster
(h(m+1, 1, L, C), v(m+1, 1, L, C))=(h(m, 1, L, C)+1, v(m, 1, L, C)),
if h(m, 1, L, C)<C,
(h(m+1, 1, L, C), v(m+1, 1, L, C))=(1, v(m, 1, L, C)+1),
if h(m+1, 1, L, C)=C, and v(m, 1, L, C)<L, and is not defined if h(m+1, 1, L, C)=C, and v(m, 1, L, C)=L, i.e., the raster stops there.
{W(a, b)}=A(a, b, Alg(M),R K,L,C)
such that the modified input from an input image Iinp at pixel (h, v) reads:
M K,M(h, v)=I inp(h,v)+Σ(a,b) in V(M) W (a,b) Er K,M(h+a, v+b),
where V(M) is the neighborhood associated to the algorithm Alg(M) and the raster RK,L,C and ErK,M(i, j) stands for the error at pixel (i, j) for the choices K for the raster and M for the ED algorithm and whichever image is being treated.
(limits on i) 0<i<n+1

- an algorithm among the algorithms Alg(M) that we designate by Alg(i).
