- an indication of the task action “buy” may include the terms “buy” and/or “purchase”.
- User task entry system 102 may be configured to identify and/or classify user task entries within messages based at least in part on analysis of the messages pursuant to a grammar.
- NLP engine 124 may be configured to first perform natural language processing on messages to provide what will be referred to herein as an “annotated message.”
- the annotated message may include various types and levels of annotations for various aspects of the message. These annotations may clarify various aspects of the message, relationships between terms and sections of the message, and so forth, so that designing a grammar suitable for analyzing messages to identify and/or classify tasks may become practicable.
- the annotated message may be organized into one or more data structures, including but not limited to trees, graphs, lists (e.g., linked list), arrays, and so forth.
- NLP engine 124 may include a part of speech tagger 230 , which may be configured to annotate, or “tag,” words of the message with its grammatical role. For instance, part of speech tagger 230 may tag each word with its part of speech, such as “noun,” “verb,” “adjective,” “pronoun,” etc.
- NLP 124 may also include a dependency parser 232 .
- Dependency parser 232 may be configured to determine syntactic relationships between words of the message. For example, dependency parser 232 may determine which words modify which others, subjects and verbs of sentences, and so forth. Dependency parser 232 may then make suitable annotations of such dependencies.
- NLP 124 may include a mention chunker 234 .
- Mention chunker 234 may be configured to identify and/or annotate references or “mentions” to entities, including task interaction entities, in the message. For example, mention chunker 234 may determine to which person, place, thing, idea, or other entity each noun or personal pronoun refers, and may annotate, or “tag,” them accordingly.
- mention chunker 234 may be configured to associate references to times and/or dates to specific times or dates. For instance, assume a message contains the sentence, “Can you pick up some milk on your way home tonight?” Mention chunker 234 may associate the word “tonight” with today's date, and with a particular time (e.g., after 5 pm).
- mention chunker 234 may determine, e.g., from a user's calendar, when the user is leaving work, and may associate that time with the word “tonight.”
- One or more downstream components may use this information to create, or help a user create, an appropriate calendar entry and/or to make sure the user receives a reminder at an appropriate time (e.g., while driving home).
- NLP 124 may include a named entity tagger 236 .
- Named entity tagger 236 may be configured to annotate, or “tag,” entity references in the annotated message as a person, location, organization, and so forth.
- named entity tagger 236 may identify one or more task actions of the user task entry.
- one or more other components depicted in FIG. 2 or elsewhere in the figures may be configured to identify one or more task actions of the user task entry.
- NLP 124 may include a coreference resolver 238 .
- Coreference resolver 238 may be configured to group, or “cluster,” references to the same entity based on various contextual cues contained in the message. For example, “Reagan,” “the President,” and “he” in a message may be grouped together.
- coreference resolver 238 may use data outside of a body or subject of a message, e.g., metadata, to cluster references. For instance, an email or text may only contain a reference to “you” (e.g., “can you pick up milk on the way home tonight”). In such case, coreference resolver 238 (or another component, in different implementations) may resolve the reference to “you” to a person to which the email or text is addressed.
- NLP 124 may also include an entity resolver 240 .
- Entity resolver 240 may be configured to communicate with entity engine 120 to determine whether entities referenced in the message (e.g., by references tagged by mention chunker 234 ) are entities that are contained in entity database 125 .
- grammar engine 126 may be configured to analyze the annotated message of NLP engine 124 against a grammar to determine whether a message includes a user task entry.
- grammar engine 126 may analyze the annotated message pursuant to a plurality of rule paths of the grammar. Each rule path may be associated with one or more potential types of user task entry.
- Task classification engine 128 may be configured to analyze output of grammar engine 126 , and in particular, output of the plurality of rule paths of the grammar, to determine a task type.
- User interface engine 122 may be configured to identify a user interface associated with the task, e.g., based on various data from various other components of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 3 depicts one example process flow for identifying tasks in a message 350 .
- Message 350 may include computer-readable characters and/or symbols, e.g., of an email, text message, etc. Additionally or alternatively, message 350 may include speech-recognized text (e.g., a transcript) of a voicemail or other audio message.
- Message 350 may be first processed by NLP engine 124 to produce the annotated message. As depicted in FIG. 3 , NLP 124 may obtain data from entity engine 120 , e.g., by way of entity resolver 240 , to perform various analysis.
- the annotated message output by NLP 124 may be provided as input to a plurality of rule paths, 352 a - n (referenced generically by 352 ), of grammar engine 126 .
- Each rule path 352 may define one or more rules against which the annotated message is compared and judged. In some implementations, the more rules or parameters of a rule path 352 that are satisfied by the annotated message, the higher a score the annotated message will receive from that rule path 352 .
- rule path 352 a tests the annotated message for a task action of “confer,” a location (e.g., an address), a date and a time.
- rule path 352 b also tests the annotated message for a task action of “confer,” a date and a time, but tests for a telephone number instead of a location. If message 350 includes a task, “Make sure you confer with Judy (555-1234) on June 2 nd at 3 pm about party plans,” first rule path 352 a may produce a score of three (because three of the four items sought were matched), and second rule path 352 b may produce a score of four.
- Task classification engine 128 may be configured to receive scores from the plurality of grammar rule paths 352 a - n and select the most satisfactory score (e.g., highest). For example, in the above example, task classification engine 128 would select a type of task associated with rule path 352 b. In some implementations, if no score yielded by any rule path 352 satisfies a particular threshold, task classification engine 128 may determine that no user task entries are present in message 350 .
- UI engine 122 may be configured to identify a user interface associated with fulfillment of the user task entry based on various data. For instance, UI engine 122 may be in communication with entity engine 120 such that it is able to associate a task interaction entity, e.g., tagged by entity tagger 236 , with a particular task.
- an association between a user interface and an entity may be based on presence of one or more attributes of the entity in the user interface. For example, an association between a user interface and an entity may be based on an importance of one or more aliases of the entity in the user interface. For example, appearance of an alias of an entity in important fields and/or with great frequency in a user interface may be indicative of association of the entity to the user interface.
- an association between a user interface and an entity may be based on presence of additional and/or alternative attributes of an entity such as date of birth, place of birth, height, weight, population, geographic location(s), type of entity (e.g., person, actor, location, business, university), etc.
- UI engine 122 may identify, and in some cases open or launch, a calendar user interface. In some implementations, UI engine 122 may populate one or more data points associated with the user interface. Thus, in the same example, UI engine 122 may launch a calendar entry with the date and time already set as described in the task.
- UI engine 122 may identify, open and/or initiate other types of user interfaces for other types of tasks. For example, assume message 350 includes a task, “Make dinner reservations at Sal's Bistro on Tuesday.” As described above, the plurality of rule paths 352 a - n may be used by grammar engine 126 to analyze the annotated message output by NLP engine 124 . The rule path 352 associated with making restaurant reservations may yield the highest score, which may lead to its being selected by task classification engine 128 . Additionally, NLP engine 124 may have, e.g., by way of entity tagger 236 sending a query to entity engine 120 , identified Sal's Bistro as an entity and tagged it accordingly in the annotated message. In some implementations, other information about Sal's Bistro not specified in message 350 , such as its address and/or telephone number, may also be obtained from various sources once Sal's Bistro is tagged as an entity.
- UI engine 122 may identify an appropriate user interface to assist the user in making a reservation at the restaurant.
- Various user interfaces 354 a - m are depicted in FIG. 3 as being available for use by the user to make the reservation.
- a first interface 354 a may be an interface to online restaurant reservation application.
- a second interface 354 b may be a URL to a webpage, e.g., a webpage hosted by Sal's Bistro that includes an interactive interface to make reservations.
- Another user interface 354 m may be a smart phone telephone interface, which in some cases may be initiated with Sal's Bistro's telephone number already entered, so that the user only need to press “talk” to initiate a call to Sal's.
- one or more data points may be extracted from the annotated message and provided to whichever user interface is selected, so that the user need not provide this information manually.
- FIG. 4 an example method 400 of identifying tasks in messages is described.
- This system may include various components of various computer systems. For instance, some operations may be performed at the client device 106 , while other operations may be performed by one or more components of user task entry system 102 , such as entity engine 120 , user interface engine 122 , NLP engine 124 , grammar engine 126 , and/or task classification engine 128 .
- entities engine 120 entity engine 120
- user interface engine 122 e.g., user interface engine 122 , NLP engine 124 , grammar engine 126 , and/or task classification engine 128 .
- operations of method 400 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added.
- Method 400 may begin (“START”) when a message (e.g., 350 ) is received and/or consumed, e.g., at client device 106 or at user task entry system 102 (e.g., in a manner that is readily accessible to client device 106 ).
- the system may perform natural language processing on the message to generate the annotated message, including performing the operations associated with the various components depicted in FIG. 2 and described above.
- the system may analyze the annotated message pursuant to a grammar. For example, at block 406 , the system may analyze the annotated message pursuant to a plurality of rule paths (e.g., 352 a - n of FIG. 3 ) to generate a plurality of candidate user task entries and associated scores. As described above, candidates having satisfied more parameters of their respective rule paths than others may have higher scores than others.
- each rule path of the grammar, or the grammar as a whole may be various types of grammars, such as a context-free grammar.
- the system may classify a portion of the message (e.g., a sentence, paragraph, selected words, subject line, etc.) as a user task entry based on analysis of the annotated message provided at block 402 . For example, at block 410 , the system may select the candidate user task entry with the highest associated score.
- a portion of the message e.g., a sentence, paragraph, selected words, subject line, etc.
- the system may select one or more user interfaces associated with the selected user task entry.
- the system may automatically populate one or more data points (e.g., input fields) associated with the selected user interface. For example, if the interface is an interactive webpage, client 107 may transmit an HTTP request with values to assign to various HTTP server variables.
- the system may automatically launch or open the selected user interface. In some embodiments, the operations of blocks 414 and 416 may be performed in reverse.

- Memory 525 used in the storage subsystem can include a number of memories including a main random access memory (RAM) 530 for storage of instructions and data during program execution and a read only memory (ROM) 532 in which fixed instructions are stored.
- a file storage subsystem 524 can provide persistent storage for program and data files, and may include a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive along with associated removable media, a CD-ROM drive, an optical drive, or removable media cartridges.
- the modules implementing the functionality of certain implementations may be stored by file storage subsystem 524 in the storage subsystem 524 , or in other machines accessible by the processor(s) 514 .
- Bus subsystem 512 provides a mechanism for letting the various components and subsystems of computer system 510 communicate with each other as intended. Although bus subsystem 512 is shown schematically as a single bus, alternative implementations of the bus subsystem may use multiple busses.
- Computer system 510 can be of varying types including a workstation, server, computing cluster, blade server, server farm, or any other data processing system or computing device. Due to the ever-changing nature of computers and networks, the description of computer system 510 depicted in FIG. 5 is intended only as a specific example for purposes of illustrating some implementations. Many other configurations of computer system 510 are possible having more or fewer components than the computer system depicted in FIG. 5 .
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current geographic location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current geographic location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personal identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personal identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where geographic location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular geographic location of a user cannot be determined.
- geographic location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and/or used.
