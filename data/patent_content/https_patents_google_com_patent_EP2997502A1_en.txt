- user interface 500 may include additional fields, different fields, or fewer fields than those depicted in Fig. 5.
- Fig. 6 is a flowchart of an example process 600 for answering a people-related question, according to one or more implementations described herein.
- process 600 may be performed by server 220.
- process 600 may be performed by one or more other devices instead of, or possibly in conjunction with, server 220, such as user device 210.
- Process 600 may include receiving a search query from a user (block 610). For example, a user may enter a search query into user device 210.
- the search query may take the form of a natural language query.
- the search query may be entered via voice input, text input, and/or any other input technique.
- the user may cause user device 210 to submit the search query to server 220 (e.g., search system 225).
- server 220 may receive the search query from user device 210.
- the received search query may include, or be associated with, information identifying the user.
- Process 600 may also include determining that the search query is directed to a people-related question (block 620).
- server 220 e.g., search system 225
- search system 225 may be configured to detect people- related questions.
- a model may be created to predict the probability of a particular search query being a people-related question.
- the model may receive, as training data, different types of people -related questions.
- grammars of the different types of people-related questions may be analyzed to form a set of rules for predicting a probability of a search query being a people-related question.
- the rules may specify that the presence of a name in a search query, in combination with the presence of a particular word or words, such as address, phone number, number, email address, birthday, live, etc., is an indication that the search query is a people-related question.
- the rules may also classify names, in people-related data, as names and certain words as looking for particular types of information. For example, the rules may classify the words "telephone number,” “phone number,” and “number” as a phone number, as opposed to an address.
- the creation of the model may include a manual process.
- the different types of people-related questions, for which search system 225 is to provide answers may be identified.
- Example people-related questions may include looking for an email address, a location, or a phone number.
- a group of users may be asked how they would ask the people -related question.
- the group of users may be asked how they might ask their friend, John, for his phone number.
- the people- related questions, obtained from the group of users may be used as training data for the model.
- the people-related questions, obtained from the group of users may be provided to a second, different group of users.
- the second group of users may indicate whether each people-related question is a reasonable way to ask for the particular people-related data.
- the feedback from the second group of users may also be used as training data for the model.
- information from data structure 300 may be used as training data.
- unusual names that appear in data structure 300 may be fed into the model as training data.
- search system 225 may use the model to predict the probability of search queries being not only a people-related question, but a particular type of people-related question (e.g., a people-related question directed to finding a home address of a person named John).
- Process 600 may further include identifying people-related search results based on the search query and using the people-related data structure associated with the user (block 630).
- server 220 e.g., search system 225
- search system 225 may parse and normalize the search query.
- search system 225 may restructure the search query based on fields 310, 322, 324, and/or 326 of data structure 300.
- search system 225 may restructure the search query so as to identify which part of the search query corresponds to a name, which part of the search query corresponds to an attribute, which part of the search query corresponds to a type, and/or which part of the search query corresponds to a value.
- search system 225 may restructure a search query into the form:
- search system 225 may restructure the search query as:
- search system 225 may restructure the search query as:
- search system 225 may restructure the search query into another form.
- search system 225 may identify a data structure, such as data structure 300, with which the user is associated. For example, search system 225 may use the information identifying the user (received in connection with the search query) to identify a data structure 300 associated with that user.
- Search system 225 may identify people-related search results using the identified data structure 300 and based on the restructured search query. For example, search system 225 may compare the names, attributes, types, and/or values of the restructured search query to data in data structure 300 to obtain a list of people-related search results.
- search system 225 may identify people named Clark in data structure 300 and obtain, for each identified person and from data structure 300, a work address.
- Process 600 may additionally include scoring the people-related search results (block 640).
- server 220 may generate scores for each people- related search result, in the list of people-related search results.
- Search system 225 may generate the scores based on how well the entry, in data structure 300, matches the information in the restructured search query. For example, if the restructured query includes the name Bob and data structure 300 includes information for a first person with a first name of Bob and a second person with a first name of Robert, search system 225 may generate a higher score for the first person (e.g., since the first person's name, in data structure 300, exactly matches the name in the restructured search query) than the second person.
- search system 225 may modify the generated scores based on one or more factors. For example, search system 225 may modify the score, for a people -related search result, based on a tag score of the people-related search result.
- data structure 300 may store a tag, for a person identified in data structure 300, that indicates a relationship that the person has to the user.
- a tag score of a search result may be generated based on the tag associated with the people-related search result in data structure 300. For example, a higher tag score may be generated for a people-related search result that is associated with a tag that indicates that the person is a family member than a people-related search result that is not associated with a tag.
- a higher tag score may be generated for a people -related search result that is associated with a tag that indicates that the person is a family member than a people-related search result that is associated with a tag that indicates that the person is a former coworker.
- search system 225 may generate a higher tag score for the second person than the first person based on the tags with which the first person and the second person are associated.
- the user may assign a weight to one or more tags identified in data structure 300.
- search system 225 may generate tag scores based on the assigned weights.
- search system 225 may modify the score, for a people- related search result, based on a location score of the people-related search result.
- the location score of a people -related search result may be generated based on the geographic distance between a current location of the user and a current location of the person corresponding to the people -related search result, the geographic distance between a current location of the user and a home or work address of the person corresponding to the people-related search result, or the like. For example, a higher location score may be generated for a people-related search result that is associated with an address that is geographically closer to the current location of the user than a people-related search result that is associated with an address that is geographically further away from the current location of the user.
- search system 225 may generate a higher location score for the second person than the first person based on where the first person and second person live.
- the user may assign a weight to one or more locations identified in data structure 300. For example, the user may assign a higher weight to locations close to where the user lives and to locations where the user grew up than other locations.
- search system 225 may generate location scores based on the assigned weights.
- search system 225 may modify the score, for a people- related search result, based on a temporal score of the people-related search result.
- the temporal score of a people-related search result may be generated based on user activity data, associated with the user, with regard to the person corresponding to the people-related search result, such as, for example, whether the user has recently performed a search for information regarding the person; whether the person has recently shown up in people- related search results and the user has taken an action in connection with the people-related search result corresponding to the person; whether the user has communicated with the person recently or the person has communicated with the user recently (e.g., through email, phone, text messaging, instant messaging, etc.); whether a calendar entry identifying the person has been recently added, deleted, or modified; whether a calendar entry identifying the person relates, in time, to a time and/or date on which the search query was received; whether the user has recently interacted with the person's social network page; whether the user has recently taken
- search system 225 may generate a higher temporal score for the second person than the first person based on the user recently performing a search for information relating to the second person.
- the user may assign a weight to one or more particular types of user activity data. For example, the user may assign a higher weight to recent communications than to recent social network activity.
- search system 225 may generate temporal scores based on the assigned weights.
- search system 225 may modify the score, for a people- related search result, based on an interaction score of the people-related search result.
- the interaction score of a people-related search result may be generated based on a quantity of user activity data, associated with the user, with regard to the person
- the people-related search result such as, for example, the quantity of searches that the user has performed relating the person; the quantity of times that the person has shown up in people-related search results and the user has performed an action in relation to the people- related search result corresponding to the person; the quantity of communications that the user has had with the person or the person has had with the user (e.g., through email, phone, text messaging, instant messaging, etc.); the quantity of entries in the user's calendar that identifies the person; the quantity of locations that the user is connected to the person (e.g., the user has stored information relating to the person in the user's phone contacts, the user's email contacts, the user's social network, etc.); the quantity of interaction, by the user, with the person's social network page; the quantity of interactions, by the person, with the user's social network page; the quantity of pictures that the user has taken and/or stored that depict the person; or the like.

- the user may assign a weight to one or more particular types of user activity data or one or more quantities of user activity data. For example, the user may assign a higher weight to a quantity of communications than to the same quantity of social network activity.
- search system 225 may generate interaction scores based on the assigned weights.
- search system 225 may modify the score, for a people- related search result, based on an authority score of the people-related search result.
- the authority score of a people-related search result may be generated based on a public profile of the person.
- the public profile may correspond to a social network profile of the person, news documents relating to the person, or the like.
- search query is "what's Bob's phone number.”
- the second person, Robert is a very well known and respected CEO of a large corporation and that the first person, Bob, is a software engineer for a small defense company.

- search system 225 may modify the score, for a people- related search result, based on a photo score of the people-related search result.
- the photo score of a people-related search result may be generated based on whether data structure 300 includes a photo of the person corresponding to the people-related search result.
- the search query is "what's Bob's phone number.”
- data structure 300 includes a photo of the second person, Robert, and does not include a photo of the first person, Bob.
- search system 225 may generate a higher photo score for the second person than the first person based on data structure 300 storing a photo of the second person and not the first person.
- search system 225 may generate a total score for a people- related search result based on a combination of the score and the tag score, the location score, the temporal score, the interaction score, the authority score, and/or the photo score. In some implementations, search system 225 may generate a total score for a people-related search result based on a combination of the score, the tag score, the location score, the temporal score, the interaction score, the authority score, and the photo score. In some implementations, search system 225 may generate a total score for a people-related search result based on a weighted combination of the score, the tag score, the location score, the temporal score, the interaction score, the authority score, and/or the photo score.
- search system 225 may assign a weight value to the score, the tag score, the location score, the temporal score, the interaction score, the authority score, and/or the photo score.
- the weight values may differ— in other words, the amount that each of the score, the tag score, the location score, the temporal score, the interaction score, the authority score, and/or the photo score contributes to the total score may vary.
- Search system 225 may combine the weighted score, the weighted tag score, the weighted location score, the weighted temporal score, the weighted interaction score, the weighted authority score, and/or the weighted photo score to generate the total score.
- search system 225 may perform, in addition to performing a people-related data search, one or more other categories of searches, such as a general search, an image search, a video search, a news search, a product search, etc. based on the search query. In these implementations, search system 225 may obtain a ranked list of search results based on performing the one or more other categories of searches. This ranked list of search results will be referred to as "general search results" hereinafter.
- Process 600 may further include determining whether to provide the selected set of people-related search results (block 650).
- server 220 e.g., search system 225
