- a template can be provided to the publisher 102 b as part of a user interface.
- a user associated with the publisher 102 b can enter parameters for a mobile application using the user interface and select a submit control button to submit the entered information.
- the application system 110 automatically categorizes content and generates a corresponding structure for a mobile application without additional information from the publisher. For example, upon receiving a URL or other identifying information, the application system 110 can analyze the content and generate a mobile application using a default template or based on the content. For example, content analysis can include identifying keywords corresponding to particular categories and applying an appropriate template for that category.
- the application system 110 uses the information submitted by the publisher to create a preview (e.g., mock up) of a mobile application and present the preview to a user associated with the publisher.

- the generated layout includes geolocation features for the generated mobile application.
- the mobile application layout for a news application can include a category of “near me” so that news articles can be provided that are close to the user's physical location (e.g., based on GPS or other location information available from the mobile device executing the mobile application).
- applications can use geolocation information to provide users with particular postings, deals, or advertisements associated with the user's location.
- the application system 110 includes an application generator 116 for generating mobile applications from the collection of application layouts 114 , for example, by generating program code and compiling it into an executable program compatible with a mobile device.
- the application generator 116 can access the collection of application layouts 114 and select a particular application layout.
- the application generator 116 can then create executable code (e.g., Objective-C code or Java code) for a mobile application using the selected application layout.
- executable code e.g., Objective-C code or Java code

- an advertising view object could include “GoogleBaseAdView(String client)”.
- a constructor can set the client parameter in a content ads request that can include a URL for a frontend involved in content requests.
- the above object can extend a more general view class, such as a WebView class and can in some implementations be extended by other more specific classes directed at advertising. In some examples, such an extension can use “void setAdLayoutType(int placement)” to specify top and/or bottom placement of the view that requests the content.
- Other ways of displaying the content e.g., an advertisement
- can be used e.g., a gallery that places thumbnails of image content in a gallery view.
- One or more functions can be used with the object. Such function(s) can customize the look and feel of the content when it is displayed. In some implementations, such function(s) can set one or more CGI parameters in a content request. For example, any or all of the following functions can be used:
- the application generator 116 can customize the executable using information received from a publisher to create a mobile application for a particular platform (e.g., a particular brand of mobile device or a particular operating system).
