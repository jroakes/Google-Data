- Geographic information systems, mapping applications, navigational devices and other similar and related products can allow a user to request and receive routing instructions between an origin and a destination.
- a computing device in communication with the geographic information system over the Internet a user can request directions from their current location to a desired destination, such as a sports arena.
- the geographic information system can provide the user with a route from the user's current location to the sports arena.
- the geographic information system can also provide information describing a plurality of maneuvers required to follow the route, display a map of the route, etc.
- certain existing geographic information systems do not provide the ability to request directions among a plurality of desired destinations. Further, for certain existing geographic information systems that do allow multi-destination routing requests, the user may be required to specify a particular ordering of the destinations. Thus, in such systems, the user cannot simply identify a plurality of desired destinations and request that the geographic information system provide an optimized ordering and associated route.
- Another problem associated with certain existing geographic information systems is that they do not provide the ability for a user to input generalized location identifiers as a desired destination. For example, such existing systems may require identification of a particular address or particular point of interest in order to perform routing functionality. Thus, the user cannot simply identify a generalized location identifier (e.g. a type of location such as "sandwich shop") and request that the geographic information system provide routing options among various specific destinations that satisfy the generalized location identifier.
- a generalized location identifier e.g. a type of location such as "sandwich shop
- the user In order to receive a route that minimizes the user's travel time while visiting destinations that meet her criteria, the user will be required to perform separate searches to respectively identify dry cleaners and grocery stores in the area that satisfy her desired criteria. The user must then manually select one or more specific destinations based on personal preferences. The user will then be required to perform several additional searches to identify which ordering of destinations and available routes provides the minimized travel time. The user will be required to manually compare and keep track of her options throughout such search process.
- a computer implemented method for trip planning comprising: receiving a routing request associated with a user, the routing request comprising a list identifying a plurality of desired destinations, at least one of the plurality of desired destinations being a generalized location identifier; determining a plurality of specific destinations that satisfy the generalized location identifier; selecting, from the plurality of specific destinations, a recommended one of the specific destinations based at least in part on one or more attributes associated with the user; providing a personalized recommended route for display to the user, the personalized recommended route navigating among the plurality of desired destinations and the recommended one of the specific destinations.

Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to geographic information systems. In particular, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for providing personalized multi-destination trip planning.
- Geographic information systems, mapping applications, navigational devices and other similar and related products can allow a user to request and receive routing instructions between an origin and a destination. As an example, using a computing device in communication with the geographic information system over the Internet, a user can request directions from their current location to a desired destination, such as a sports arena. In response, the geographic information system can provide the user with a route from the user's current location to the sports arena. The geographic information system can also provide information describing a plurality of maneuvers required to follow the route, display a map of the route, etc.
- However, certain existing geographic information systems do not provide the ability to request directions among a plurality of desired destinations. Further, for certain existing geographic information systems that do allow multi-destination routing requests, the user may be required to specify a particular ordering of the destinations. Thus, in such systems, the user cannot simply identify a plurality of desired destinations and request that the geographic information system provide an optimized ordering and associated route.
- Another problem associated with certain existing geographic information systems is that they do not provide the ability for a user to input generalized location identifiers as a desired destination. For example, such existing systems may require identification of a particular address or particular point of interest in order to perform routing functionality. Thus, the user cannot simply identify a generalized location identifier (e.g. a type of location such as "sandwich shop") and request that the geographic information system provide routing options among various specific destinations that satisfy the generalized location identifier.
- Furthermore, many existing geographic information systems do not personalize the searching process and corresponding results to the particular user who submitted the routing request. Therefore, such existing systems do not provide personalized recommendations that are tailored to the tastes and preferences of the specific user.
- As an example, consider a user that is on vacation. She wishes to have dry cleaning services performed as well as purchase some groceries from a grocery store, but is unfamiliar with the surrounding area. Furthermore, while she does not have a particular dry cleaners in mind, she would prefer that it had a rating of at least four out of five stars.
- In order to receive a route that minimizes the user's travel time while visiting destinations that meet her criteria, the user will be required to perform separate searches to respectively identify dry cleaners and grocery stores in the area that satisfy her desired criteria. The user must then manually select one or more specific destinations based on personal preferences. The user will then be required to perform several additional searches to identify which ordering of destinations and available routes provides the minimized travel time. The user will be required to manually compare and keep track of her options throughout such search process.

FIG. 4 depicts a flow chart of an example method for trip planning according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. - Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the present disclosure, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the present disclosure, not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
- Generally, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for providing trip planning and navigational routing in response to a multi-destination routing request received from a user. In particular, the routing request can include a plurality of desired destinations, with at least one of the desired destinations being a generalized location identifier. In response to the routing request, a plurality of specific destinations that satisfy the generalized location identifier can be identified. A recommended one of the specific destinations can be selected based at least in part on one or more attributes associated with the user. A personalized recommended route that navigates among the plurality of desired destinations and the recommended one of the specific destinations can then be provided for display to the user. In such fashion, a user can be provided with a specific, personalized route in response to a multi-destination routing request that includes a generalized location identifier. In particular, the personalized route can visit a specific destination that satisfies the generalized location identifier and is recommended for the user based on one or more attributes of the user.
- More particularly, a geographic information system or other mapping application can allow a user to input a request for navigational routing among a plurality of locations. The routing request can identify or otherwise list a plurality of desired destinations. In some embodiments, the user can indicate that the desired destinations included in the routing request are not required to be visited according to a particular ordering. In other embodiments, the absence of a required order of visits can be assumed. Thus, the user can provide a list of desired destinations and request that the geographic information system provide a route that optimizes various variables (e.g. time, distance travelled, etc.) without regard to a particular predetermined ordering. In other embodiments, certain desired destinations may be locked at certain positions or relationships (e.g. visit the soccer fields at any point prior to the car wash) and the remainder of the ordering may be left unspecified.
- According to an aspect of the present disclosure, one or more of the desired destinations can be a generalized location identifier. As an example, the generalized location identifier can be a category or type of point of interest. Thus, in addition to one or more particular locations/addresses, the desired destinations can include one or more generalized location identifiers such as, for example, "grocery store," "Italian restaurant," or "dry cleaners."
- In some embodiments, the routing request may also specify one or more criteria to be satisfied by one or more of the desired destinations. As an example, the criteria can include a minimum feedback rating based on feedback provided by other users. For example, the generalized location identifier may include a dry cleaners that scored 4 out of 5 stars or greater based on reviews provided by users of a review service.
- As another example, the criteria may be a time-based criterion such as "open now." Alternatively, the routing request may specify a time at which the user plans to embark upon the trip. Therefore, the criteria may require that the desired destination be open at the specified time of embarkation or some period thereafter.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a plurality of specific destinations can be identified for each desired destination that includes a generalized location identifier. In particular, each of the plurality of specific destinations can satisfy the generalized location identifier and any other criteria associated with the generalized location identifier. As an example, in some embodiments, the routing request can specify an origin and/or a destination. In such embodiments, identifying the plurality of specific destinations can include identifying all points of interest that are within a threshold distance of the origin and/or the destination and which satisfy the generalized location identifier and any associated criteria. For example, map data or other available information can be searched to identify the points of interest.
- As another example, identifying the plurality of specific destinations can include identifying all points of interest that satisfy the generalized location identifier and that are within a threshold distance from any of the desired destinations that are not generalized. Thus, the specific destinations can be identified by performing a localized search around the other non-generalized destinations.
- As yet another example, identifying the plurality of specific destinations can include determining a preliminary route among the desired destinations that are not generalized. For example, the preliminary route can be a shortest route among the non-generalized desired destinations. Then, all points of interest that satisfy the generalized location identifier and that are within a threshold distance from the preliminary route can be identified.
- One of the plurality of specific destinations can be selected as a recommended specific destination based at least in part on one or more attributes associated with the user. In some embodiments, selecting the recommended specific destination based on the user attributes can include determining a match score for each of the plurality of specific destinations based at least in part on the one or more attributes. The match score for each specific destination can provide an indication of a degree of matching between the specific destination being scored and the one or more attributes associated with the user. The recommended specific destination can then be selected based at least in part on the plurality of match scores respectively determined for the plurality of specific destinations. For example, the specific destination receiving the highest match score can be selected as the recommended specific destination.
- As an example, the one or more attributes associated with the user can include one or more reviews provided by the user with respect to points of interest satisfying the generalized location identifier. For example, the user may have previously indicated via one or more reviews that she prefers upscale, specialty grocery stores offering gourmet items. Thus, in the instance that the user has provided a routing request including the generalized location identifier "grocery store," the resulting identified specific destinations can be selected from based on such previous reviews. In particular, as an example, identified grocery stores that offer specialty gourmet items may receive a higher match score while food marts, wholesalers, or discount stores may receive a lower match score.
- As another example, the one or more attributes associated with the user can include one or more reviews provided by reviews provided by other users with respect to points of interest satisfying the generalized location identifier, where the other users are connections of the user on a social network. For example, if a certain grocer or type of grocer has received complimentary ratings from the user's social network, then a specific destination corresponding to such grocer may be selected as the recommended specific destination in lieu of a different grocer that has received no ratings or negative ratings from the user's social network.
- As yet another example, the one or more attributes associated with the user can include a number and/or a frequency of visits by the user to one or more points of interest satisfying the generalized location identifier. For example, the number or frequency of visits to such points of interest can be obtained from a location history associated with the user.
- More particularly, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, a plurality of location updates can be received from one or more mobile devices (e.g. a smartphone) associated with each of a plurality of users. The plurality of location updates can be used to build a location history for each of the users. The location history of each user can provide a history of visits by such user to points of interest over time.
- Thus, in some embodiments, in order to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein, the user may be required to allow the collection and analysis of location information associated with the user or her device or other information concerning attributes of the user. For example, in some embodiments, users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect such information. If the user does not allow collection and use of such signals, then the user may not receive the benefits of the techniques described herein. The user can also be provided with tools to revoke or modify consent. In addition, certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- The location history for the user can describe a number and/or frequency of visits by the user to one or more points of interest over time. By analyzing the location history of the user, the user's preferences for certain points of interest or types of points of interest can be identified and used as attributes for selecting a recommended specific destination. For example, if the user consistently visits upscale, specialty grocery stores offering gourmet items rather than wholesalers or discount stores, then the user's preference for specialty grocery stores can be identified.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a plurality of routes navigating among the plurality of desired destinations and the recommended specific destination can be determined. In particular, each of the plurality of routes can visit the desired destinations and the recommended specific destination according to one of a plurality of different orderings. For example, the plurality of different orderings can include all potential orderings in which the destinations can be visited.
- In embodiments in which the user has provided one or more ordering relationships that define relative ordering positions for two or more of the desired destinations, then each of the plurality of different orderings can satisfy such ordering relationships.
- One of the plurality of routes navigating among the plurality of desired destinations and the recommended specific destination can be selected and provided to the user as a personalized recommended route. For example, the route having the shortest travel time or shortest travel distance can be selected and provided to the user for display.
- In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a particular specific destination is not selected prior to determining the plurality of candidate routes. In particular, in such embodiments, after identifying a plurality of specific destinations that satisfy the generalized location identifier, a plurality of routes that respectively visit such specific destinations and the other desired destinations can be identified. Thus, routes that visit several different specific destinations can be considered for selection as the personalized recommended route.
- In particular, one of such routes can be selected based at least in part on a length associated with each route and a match score associated with the specific destination visited by each route. The length of the route can be a travel time or a travel distance. In such fashion, the degree to which each potential specific destination matches the user attributes can be balanced against the length of the route required to visit such specific destination.
- As an example, a route score can be calculated for each of the plurality of routes. The route score can be determined according to a route scoring formula that applies different weightings to a plurality of variables. The variables can include the length associated with the route being scored and the match score associated with the specific destination visited by the route being scored. One of the routes can be selected as the personalized recommended route based on the route scores. For example, the route receiving the best route score can be selected as the personalized recommended route.
- The personalized recommended route can be displayed to the user in a user interface of the geographic information system, mapping application, and/or navigational device. For example, the recommended route can be shown on a map or described by a series of textual steps or icons. Additional routing options may be provided for selection as well. In such fashion, a user can be provided with a specific, personalized route in response to a multi-destination routing request that includes a generalized location identifier. In particular, the personalized route can visit a specific destination that satisfies the generalized location identifier and is recommended for the user based on one or more attributes of the user.
- With reference now to the FIGS., example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.
-
FIG. 1 depicts an example mapping application providing personalized multi-destination trip planning according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. In particular,user interface 110 of the mapping application shows a user providing a list of desired destinations for a routing request. One or more of the desired destinations is a generalized location identifier.User interface 150 of the mapping application shows the resulting personalized recommended route provided by the user interface and also two alternative routes. - More particularly,
user interface 110 shows features of the mapping application that allow the user to enter a multi-destination routing request. As shown inuser interface 110, a plurality of text entry fields may be provided for the user to enter text describing various desired destinations. - As an example, the user has indicated in
field 112 that they would like begin the trip at Seattle, WA. The user has also indicated infield 114 that she would like to visit a dry cleaner. Thus, the user has provided only a generalized location identifier "dry cleaner," rather than identify a particular location or specific point of interest. Generalized location identifiers can include categories of points of interest or other generalized ways of identify a grouping or subset of all existing points of interest. - The user has provided additional criteria in
field 114 as well. In particular, the user has indicated that she would like to visit a dry cleaner only if the dry cleaner has been rated four out of 5 stars or greater. For example, the mapping application can also include or be in operative communication with a review platform that allows users to provide reviews of points of interest. - Furthermore, although the additional criteria depicted in
field 114 entered as natural language in thesame field 114 as the desired destination, in some embodiments additional fields, icons, drop down menus, or other modes of selection or information entry can be used to allow the user to enter one or more criteria for each desired destination. - The user has also indicated in
field 116 that she would also like to visit a grocery store. The user has also entered additional criteria in field 116: the grocery store should be open now. Thus, the one or more criteria provided by the user can be quality criteria, time-based criteria, other suitable criteria such as price criteria or location criteria. - The user has also indicated by selecting
button 118 that the resulting route may visit the desired destinations according to any order. In other embodiments, the absence of a required order of visits can be assumed. Thus, the user can provide a list of desired destinations and request that the geographic information system provide a route that optimizes various variables (e.g. time, distance travelled, etc.) without regard to a particular predetermined ordering. In other embodiments, certain desired destinations may be locked at certain positions or relationships (e.g. visit the soccer fields at any point prior to the car wash) and the remainder of the ordering may be left unspecified. - Further shown in

In particular, when a user elects to participate and has signed into her user account into one of her computing devices, then such user computing device can periodically send a location update toserver 202. Alternatively, the user location histories can be built and maintained by a computing system that is separate and unique fromserver 202 and the user location histories can simply be accessed byserver 202. - For example, each location update can identify the presently active user account and a location (e.g. latitude and longitude) and a timestamp identifying the date and time of day. In some implementations, location updates can further include an accuracy indicator and/or other identifying information such as an originating IP address or a WiFi or cell tower identifier.
- Thus, in some embodiments, in order to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein, the user may be required to allow the collection and analysis of location information associated with the user or her device or other information concerning attributes of the user. For example, in some embodiments, users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect such information. If the user does not allow collection and use of such signals, then the user may not receive the benefits of the techniques described herein. The user can also be provided with tools to revoke or modify consent. In addition, certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- Additional information can be used to build or supplement a user location history as well. As an example, whenever a user is logged into a user account and performs a web search or uses one or more applications, such as a mapping application, it is possible that such interaction can result in obtaining the user's location. Therefore, an entry can be formed in the associated user location history based on such interaction. As another example, if a user provides consent, transaction data from a digital wallet can be used to identify locations visited by the user.
- All received location updates can be stored and associated with a particular user so that a user location history is built over time. Furthermore, in the event that the location reports provided by the
user computing device 204 simply provide a geo-location (e.g. a latitude and longitude), one or more algorithms or processes can be applied to such location data to identify a particular point of interest that the user likely visited. Thus, the user location history for each user can provide a history of visits by such user to points of interest over time. - In addition to the user location histories,
location preference database 224 can also include information concerning additional attributes for each user. As an example, the additional attributes can include reviews provided by the user for particular points of interest. As another example, the one or more attributes associated with the user can include one or more reviews provided by other users with respect to points of interest satisfying the generalized location identifier, where the other users are connections of the user on a social network. -
Location preference database 224 can store various other information concerning attributes of the user, as well. For example, in the instance in which the user consents to the use of such information, the user's home or work address or other attributes of the user that may be helpful in selecting a personalized location recommendation can be stored indatabase 224 and used to provide personalized routing options. -
Geographic information system 226 can store or provide geospatial data to be used byserver 202.

system 200 ofFIG. 2 employs a client-server architecture, it will be appreciate thatsystem 200 is provided for the purposes of example only and is not necessarily required to practice the present disclosure. For example, the present disclosure can be implemented by a single computing device executing instructions from memory. -
FIG. 3 depicts a flow chart of an example method (300) for trip planning according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Although exemplary method (300) will be discussed with reference tosystem 200 ofFIG. 2 , method (300) can be implemented using any suitable computing system. - In addition, although
FIG. 3 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, methods of the present disclosure are not limited to such particular order or arrangement. One skilled in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will appreciate that various steps of the method (300) can be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adapted in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. - At (302) a routing request can be received. The routing request can identify a plurality of desired destinations. At least one of the desired destinations can be a generalized location identifier. For example,
client device 204 can receive user input identifying a plurality of desired destinations and then transmit the routing request toserver 202. - As an example, the generalized location identifier can be a category or type of point of interest. Thus, in addition to one or more particular locations/addresses, the desired destinations can include one or more generalized location identifiers such as, for example, "grocery store," "Italian restaurant," or "dry cleaners."
- In some embodiments, the routing request may also specify one or more criteria to be satisfied by one or more of the desired destinations. As an example, the criteria can include a minimum feedback rating based on feedback provided by other users. For example, the generalized location identifier may include a dry cleaners that scored 4 out of 5 stars or greater based on reviews provided by users of a review service.
- As another example, the criteria may be a time-based criterion such as "open now." Alternatively, the routing request may specify a time at which the user plans to embark upon the trip. Therefore, the criteria may require that the desired destination be open at the specified time of embarkation or some period thereafter.
- At (304) a plurality of specific destinations that satisfy the generalized location identifier can be identified. For example,
server 202 can interact withgeographic information system 226 to identify the plurality of specific destinations. - In particular, each of the plurality of specific destinations can satisfy the generalized location identifier and any other criteria associated with the generalized location identifier. As an example, in some embodiments, the routing request can specify an origin and/or a destination. In such embodiments, identifying the plurality of specific destinations at (304) can include identifying all points of interest that are within a threshold distance of the origin and/or the destination and which satisfy the generalized location identifier and any associated criteria.
- As another example, identifying the plurality of specific destinations at (304) can include identifying all points of interest that satisfy the generalized location identifier and that are within a threshold distance from any of the desired destinations that are not generalized. Thus, the specific destinations can be identified by performing a localized search around the other non-generalized destinations.
- As yet another example, identifying the plurality of specific destinations a (304) can include determining a preliminary route among the desired destinations that are not generalized. For example, the preliminary route can be a shortest route among the non-generalized desired destinations. Then, all points of interest that satisfy the generalized location identifier and that are within a threshold distance from the preliminary route can be identified.
- At (306) one of the plurality of specific destinations can be selected based at least in part on one or more attributes associated with the user. For example,
server 202 can implement point ofinterest scoring module 218 to determine a match score for each of plurality of specific destinations and one of the specific destinations can be selected based on the match scores. For example, the specific destination receiving the highest match score can be selected as the recommended specific destination. - As an example, the one or more attributes considered at (306) can include one or more reviews provided by the user with respect to points of interest satisfying the generalized location identifier. For example, the user may have previously indicated via one or more reviews that she prefers upscale, specialty grocery stores offering gourmet items. Thus, in the instance that the user has provided a routing request including the generalized location identifier "grocery store," the resulting identified specific destinations can be selected from based on such previous reviews. In particular, as an example, identified grocery stores that offer specialty gourmet items may receive a higher match score while food marts, wholesalers, or discount stores may receive a lower match score.
- As another example, the one or more attributes considered at (306) can include one or more reviews provided by reviews provided by other users with respect to points of interest satisfying the generalized location identifier, where the other users are connections of the user on a social network. For example, if a certain grocer or type of grocer has received complimentary ratings from the user's social network, then a specific destination corresponding to such grocer may be selected as the recommended specific destination in lieu of a different grocer that has received no ratings or negative ratings from the user's social network.
- As yet another example, the one or more attributes considered at (306) can include a number and/or a frequency of visits by the user to one or more points of interest satisfying the generalized location identifier. For example, the number or frequency of visits to such points of interest can be obtained from a location history associated with the user. By analyzing the location history of the user, the user's preferences for certain points of interest or types of points of interest can be identified and used as attributes for selecting a recommended specific destination. For example, if the user consistently visits upscale, specialty grocery stores offering gourmet items rather than wholesalers or discount stores, then the user's preference for specialty grocery stores can be identified.
- At (308) a plurality of routes visiting the plurality of desired destinations can be determined. The plurality of routes can visit the destinations according to a plurality of different orderings. For example,
server 202 can implementroute identification module 220 to determine the plurality of routes. The plurality of different orderings can include all potential orderings in which the destinations can be visited. - In embodiments in which the user has provided one or more ordering relationships that define relative ordering positions for two or more of the desired destinations, then each of the plurality of different orderings can satisfy such ordering relationships.
- At (310) one of plurality of routes can be selected as a personalized recommended route. For example, the route having the shortest travel time or shortest travel distance can be selected as the personalized recommended route.
- At (312) the personalized recommended route can be provided for display to the user. For example,
server 202 can transmit information describing the personalized recommended route toclient device 204.Client device 204 can provide the personalized recommended route and associated information in a user interface ondisplay 256. For example, a user interface similar touser interface 150 ofFIG. 1 can be used. -
FIG. 4 depicts a flow chart of an example method (400) for trip planning according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Although exemplary method (300) will be discussed with reference tosystem 200 ofFIG. 2 , method (300) can be implemented using any suitable computing system. - In addition, although
FIG. 4 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, methods of the present disclosure are not limited to such particular order or arrangement. One skilled in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will appreciate that various steps of the method (400) can be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adapted in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. - At (402) a routing request can be received. The routing request can identify a plurality of desired destinations. At least one of the desired destinations can be a generalized destination. As an example, the routing request depicted in
FIG. 1 includes two generalized destinations: a "dry cleaner" and a "grocery store." - At (404) a plurality of points of interest that satisfy the generalized destination can be identified. For example,
server 202 can interact withgeographic information system 226 to identify the plurality of points of interest. - At (406) a match score can be determined for each of the plurality of points of interest. The match score for each of the plurality of points of interest can be based at least in part on one or more attributes associated with the user. For example,
server 202 can implement point ofinterest scoring module 218 to determine a match score for each of plurality of points of interest identified at (404). - At (408) a plurality of routes that respectively visit the plurality of points of interest and the other desired destinations can be determined. Each of the plurality of routes can have a length. For example,
server 202 can implementroute identification module 220 to determine the plurality of routes. The plurality of different orderings can include all potential orderings in which the destinations can be visited. - Thus, at least one route visiting each point of interest identified at (404) can be determined at (408). Further, in some embodiments, a plurality of different routes visiting each of such points of interest according to a plurality of different orderings can be determined. As such, for instances in which the routing request includes multiple generalized destination, a large number of routes visiting various identified candidate results according to different orderings can be determined at (408).
- At (410) one of the plurality of routes can be selected based at least in part on the length associated with each route and the match score associated with the point of interest visited by each route. As an example,
server 202 can implement route scoring module 22 to determine a route score for each route determined at (408). - More particularly, the route score can be determined for each route according to a route scoring formula that applies different weightings to a plurality of variables. The variables can include the length associated with the route being scored and the match score associated with the specific destination visited by the route being scored.
- Use of a route scoring formula as described above can balance various variables (e.g. travel time/distance and the match score(s) of the point(s) of interest being visited) so that the recommended route is optimized over all of such variables.
- As an example, with reference to
user interface 150 ofFIG. 1 , it can be seen thatroute 152 which visits gourmet grocery was selected in favor ofalternative route 2, which visits cheap food stop, even thoughroute 152 has a longer travel distance and travel time thanalternative route 2. Thus, because analysis of the user's preferences and attributes has indicated that she would greatly prefer a specialty grocery store to a food mart,route 152 can be selected in favor ofalternative route 2, even thoughroute 152 has a greater length thanalternative route 2. - At (412) the selected route can be provided for display to the user. For example,
server 202 can transmit information describing the personalized recommended route toclient device 204.Client device 204 can provide the personalized recommended route and associated information in a user interface ondisplay 256. For example, a user interface similar touser interface 150 ofFIG. 1 can be used. - The technology discussed herein makes reference to servers, databases, software applications, and other computer-based systems, as well as actions taken and information sent to and from such systems. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the inherent flexibility of computer-based systems allows for a great variety of possible configurations, combinations, and divisions of tasks and functionality between and among components. For instance, server processes discussed herein may be implemented using a single server or multiple servers working in combination.
