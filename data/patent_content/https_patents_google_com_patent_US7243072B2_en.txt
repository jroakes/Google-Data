- FIG. 2 a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of a server 200 , such as the remote agent 119 or assistant agents 123 , 125 , 127 (in part) will be discussed and described.
- the server is arranged, constructed, and operational to assist with control of a communications unit. Note that the specific functionality of portions, functional blocks or elements of the server can depend on the particular manufacturer and other conventions used by the network providers. These specifics of transmission and reception and relevant processing are known and therefore any further discussions will be in generalities that are applicable to typical servers and networks.
- the server is coupled to and from a network 201 via a connection, such as an Ethernet based connection, using a normal wired connection such as an RJ 45 connector.
- Signals comprising packetized data from the network are coupled to and received by a receiver 203 or transmitted or sent from a transmitter 205 to the network as is known.
- the receiver 203 and transmitter 205 may be operational in a WAN network such as the Internet, in a typical wired network such as an Ethernet environment or the like.
- the receiver 203 provides a signal that is coupled to a controller 207 for further processing, such as call and audio or message processing.
- the transmitter 205 is also coupled to the controller 207 and the controller 207 operates to generate messages and so on, as known, to prepare signals for amplification and transmission by the transmitter 205 .

- the elements and functionality of the user interface are known and widely available.
- the controller 207 includes a signal processor/modem 221 , typically digital signal processor based that is used for generating signals to be provided to the transmitter as well as processing signals from the receiver.
- the signal processor 221 functionally includes known and appropriate A/D and D/A convertors, an audio vocoder, channel coders and decoders, a modem, and other known functions. For example audio from the microphone 213 is processed through an A/D convertor and then the vocoder to provide audio frames. These frames may be combined or sequenced with other control information, data, and the like, channel coded, packetized (consistent with known VoIP schemes) and then used to modulate, via the modem, a signal that can be the carrier signal that is subsequently amplified by the transmitter.
- the signal processor also works essentially in reverse to demodulate signals from the receiver and provide messages or data for further processing by the controller, including for example applying voice packets or VoIP packets to a vocoder with an output coupled to a D/A convertor that is used to drive the earpiece or speaker 211 .
- the controller further includes a processor 223 that is, preferably, a known microprocessor based element that is widely available and can include one or more microprocessors and one or more digital signal processors depending on the precise responsibilities of the controller 207 with respect to signaling duties and call processing that are not here relevant.
- the processor 223 is also coupled to a memory 225 that can be, for example, a combination of known RAM (Random Access Memory), ROM (Read-Only Memory), EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM) or magnetic memory that among other items, such as messages and folders with messages, address books, standard or canned messages, and various operating variables and parameters will store an operating system and software and various operating variables and parameters 227 for execution and use by the processor 223 .
- This memory can include the memory 121 or portion thereof.
- This operating software when executed by the processor 223 will result in the processor 223 performing the requisite functions of the server such as interfacing with and controlling the transceiver or transmitter 205 , receiver 203 , signal processor/modem 221 and user interface 209 including display and keyboard, audio processing functions and so on including other functional elements not depicted and software routines that will be further described below.

- databases 231 including communication unit specific information, unit parameter status and a mirrored database including for example, one or more of a phone book, address book and the like for each communications unit that the server provides assistance to, voice instruction conversion routines 233 (can be part of an application for providing assistance depending on software architecture), a control message generator 235 corresponding to the various
- Assistant agent data/selection routines 237 confirmation messages routines 239 , and applications 241 , including for example a user interface to facilitate providing assistance to communications units as well as programs for maintaining or presenting statistics.
- This listing is merely a brief listing of exemplary routines that will be required or advantageous in effecting a server or agent for providing assistance to communications units and other services and various command and control duties and that many others 243 including user interface drivers, etc. that can be stored in the memory have not been mentioned.
- the server 200 can be the remote agent or assistant agent as described in the initial portions of this discussion.
- the server 200 is arranged and constructed to assist with control of a communications unit and this capability may be used by communications units for taking advantage of remote assistance service when desired.
- the server 200 includes the receiver 203 to receive an instruction message that corresponds to voiced instructions from one of a multitude of communications units qualified to utilize the assistance service. In one embodiment this instruction message uses known VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) techniques and capabilities.
- the receiver further receives specific information sufficient to identify the communications unit, such as an address or URL, URI (uniform resource locator, identifier) or other identifying indicia that can be used as an index to appropriate portions of the database 231 . From time to time the receiver will also receive messages with information to populate and maintain a database as is known and that corresponds to the communications unit. This database is stored in the memory that is part of the memory 121 also shown as 225 in FIG. 2 .
- the database associated with the communications unit includes one or more of unit specific information, a parameter status, such as ringer type, and a mirrored database associated with the communications unit.
- the mirrored database includes, for example, items that can stored in the communications unit that may change from time to time, such as phone books, address books, and the like.
- controller 207 coupled to the receiver and used in the assistant agent and one embodiment of the remote agent to, among other duties, convert the voiced instructions or a portion of the voiced instructions to control commands, such as keypad data that would result from key pad activations at the communications unit.
- control commands are specific to the communications unit or correspond to a type of the unit and are used by the controller to formulate or generate and otherwise provide a control message corresponding to the control commands.
- the conversion process includes one or more of an automated conversion technique wherein the VoIP packets are applied to a vocoder to provide speech with the speech analyzed by the speech recognition routine 229 , in total or in part, or manual techniques where the speech is used to drive the speaker or earpiece 211 for operator conversion.
- common instructions such as call or dial and perhaps the particular digits or numbers may be recognized by the speech recognition software while other voiced commands require intervention and conversion by an operator or at least review and approval of the results of the speech recognition by the person, agent or operator. It is anticipated that an operator would be presented with a screen that is specific to the type of a communications unit along with the speech as decoded, rendered, or interpreted by the signal processor 221 , specifically vocoder, and allowed to select from various menus to provide the proper control commands for the unit.
- the transmitter 205 cooperatively operates with and is controlled by the controller to send the control message to the communications unit, preferably using known packet data techniques thereby assisting with the control of the communications unit.
- the transmitter can be used to send a confirmation message provided by the controller using the confirmation messages routines 239 , as a confirmation that the receiver received the instruction message.
- a verbal message can be generated by the controller and forwarded by the transmitter where the message provides a user of the communications unit an indication of what control commands have or are concurrently being forwarded, thus what the communications unit is executing or will execute if approved by the user.
- the server 200 using these principles and concepts can assist the communications unit by, for example, using the controller to convert or assist with conversion of the voiced instructions to the control commands, the control commands, when executed by the communications unit, will effect actions at the communications unit such as dialing a number, looking up a number in a phone book of the communications unit, the phone book incorporated into the mirrored database at the server associated with the communications unit, modifying contents of a memory of the communications unit, the modifying also performed on the mirrored database associated with the communications unit, sending a text message, or the like.
- the server 200 operates at least in part as a distribution server to distribute a plurality or portion thereof of incoming instruction messages from corresponding communications units to assistant agents or servers.
- the controller further controls the transmitter to forward a message corresponding to or in part to each of the instruction messages.
- the message is forwarded to one of the assistant servers or assistant agents.
- the message that is forwarded to the assistant server is converted by the assistant server and agent operating as above discussed to the control commands and the assistant server then returns or replies to the server or remote agent with a second message corresponding to the control commands.
- the control message is generated and forwarded to the appropriate communications units by the server.
- assistant servers or agents will be available. These agents are typically public individuals working for example from their homes to make extra money. Thus the server 200 or remote agent has to select the appropriate assistants and see that they have proper tools and information and are appropriately motivated and compensated.
- the controller 207 of the server selects the assistant server for a particular task from a plurality of assistant servers prior to the forwarding the message relying on the assistant agent data. selection routines 237 .
- the assistant server is selected based on factors, such as availability of the assistant server and a ranking of the assistant server among the plurality of assistant servers.
- the assistant server is provided access, according to known techniques, to the database or portion of the database, via for example, the memory 121 or disk drive for the communications unit corresponding to the message that is forwarded. Security concerns may limit this access to only a portion of for example a phone book for the communications units.
- the server 200 can determine the availability and extent of availability of the assistant server using the controller based on a log on record stored in the memory.
- the controller preferably determines the ranking of the assistant server or agent relative to other assistant agents based on data maintained in the memory at 237 where the data corresponds to one or more of: an extent of availability of the assistant server with assistants that are logged on for more hours, perhaps up to some limit, given priority or a higher ranking than other assistants; a timeliness of services provided by the assistant server with assistant agents or servers with an average response time, possibly weighted to emphasize recent history, given a higher ranking that other assistants; an accuracy of the services provided by the assistant server with assistants providing higher quality services given higher rankings than other assistant agents with quality based on audit information, complaints, etc.
- the precise algorithm for ranking can be determined on an experimental basis or based on experience as data is collected with the selection of the assistant agent or server based on a round robin or random approach until the data is collected and ranking algorithm finalized. The ranking or results of the ranking would be updated from time to time.
- the server acting as a distribution server and providing the conversion tasks to the selected assistant servers or agents can also be supported with the server acting as a distribution server and providing the conversion tasks to the selected assistant servers or agents.
- the quality of services can be improved by having the controller select more than one assistant server from a plurality of assistant servers and then control the transmitter to forward the message corresponding to the same instruction message to the more than one assistant server.
- Each of the more than one assistant servers can then perform the converting the voiced instructions and the returning the respective second message to provide more than one respective second message.
- the controller can then compare the more than one respective second message to detect an error in one of the respective second messages.
- the controller of the server would be faced with a decision, such as to have the assistants repeat the conversion tasks or other assistants repeat the task to see whether the difference earlier noted disappears, or select the results from the more trusted or more accurate one of the selected assistants and forward a control message based on these results. Assuming 3 or more assistant agents were selected the controller could essentially vote on the results and forward the control message based on control commands from different assistants that are in agreement.
- a user of the communications unit or device that employs the above described assistance services may find the current challenge of operating an automobile or walking a crowded street while dialing a 10 or more digit phone number reduced to activating a PTT or PTA button and providing voiced instructions, such as call 987 123 4567 or call Mom and receiving a friendly beep when the call is being dialed by the unit.
- voiced instructions such as call 987 123 4567 or call Mom and receiving a friendly beep when the call is being dialed by the unit.
- the remote agent would need access to the unit's phone book by way of queries and response messages or access to a mirrored and synchronized phone book.
- the mind numbing task of sending a message to Jim Jones using for example a phone's normally numeric keypad, such as “please delay our 3PM meeting for 10-15 minutes” is again reduced to activating a button, speaking the instructions and waiting for a happy beep when the communications unit is sending the text message via for example SMS (short message service).
- SMS short message service
- a portion of the server is a system 245 for assisting with controlling the communications unit.
- the system 245 can be integral to the server as depicted or an add on or accessory system with appropriate coupling between an ordinary controller for a server and the system 245 .
- the structure, functionality and operation of such a system 245 has been described above and thus need not be repeated here.
- the system or server in one aspect is a more or less known server advantageously operating according to a software program for assisting with control of a communications unit.
- the software program when loaded and executing on a processor of a server results in the server performing a method corresponding to the above described processes and procedures or the method embodiment described below.
- the server 200 of FIG. 2 can advantageously perform the method 300 although various other structures would also be suitable for performing the method 300 .
- the method 300 begins at 303 where receiving an instruction message that corresponds to voiced instructions from the communications unit using for example, VoIP messages is shown. This can include receiving specific information sufficient to identify the communications unit.
- receiving an instruction message that corresponds to voiced instructions from the communications unit using for example, VoIP messages is shown. This can include receiving specific information sufficient to identify the communications unit.
- an optional process of sending a confirmation message to the communications unit indicating receipt of the instruction message is depicted.
- converting the voiced instructions to commands, such as control commands (keyboard data) corresponding to the communications unit is undertaken at 309 .
- the process at 309 can rely on the database 311 or contents thereof that is maintained and includes one or more of unit specific information, such as type of unit, e.g. model number, manufacturer and version, parameter settings, such as ringer type etc, or a mirrored database, including for example a phone book, etc.
- 313 depicts providing or generating a control message corresponding to the control commands where this message can include a verbalized message in VoIP format for the communications unit.
- 315 shows sending the control message to the communications unit, thereby assisting with the control of the communications unit.
- the control message will correspond to the original voiced instructions and correspond to or result in an action performed by the communications unit that includes for example dialing a number, looking up a number in a phone book of the communications unit, the phone book incorporated into the mirrored database associated with the communications unit, modifying contents of a memory of the communications unit, and sending a text message.
- This control message is preferably sent using packet data processes and connections.
- FIG. 4 a flow chart showing the optional process at 307 , will be discussed and described. Note that this process is a method used when the server is a distribution server and assistant servers are utilized. Some of the discussion below is a repeat of earlier material and will be presented in summary form.
- the server 200 of FIG. 2 can advantageously perform the method 400 although various other structures would also be suitable for performing the method.
- the method 400 is a method of using assistant agents and selecting and ranking those assistant agents or servers for assisting or controlling the communications unit.
- the method is an extension from the process at 303 or 305 and begins at 403 with selecting one or more assistant agents from a database including or identifying a plurality of assistant agents based on availability, given a log on status, of the assistant agent and a ranking of the assistant agent among the plurality of assistant agents.
- the ranking depends on one or more of an extent of availability of, a timeliness of services provided by, an accuracy of the services provided by, and economic considerations related to the assistant agent as compared to other agents.
- 405 indicates forwarding a message corresponding to the instruction message or a portion thereof to one or more assistant agents, preferably as selected at 403 .
- This procedure occurs after the instruction message has been received at the remote agent.
- 407 indicates that the assistant agent(s) performs the converting the voiced instructions to the control commands for all or the portion of the instruction message and each assistant agent returns to the remote agent, a second message corresponding to the control commands.
- the assistant agent may need access to the memory 121 or database 231 and can be granted such access as required (see 311 ) but no more thus securing the contents of this database from public individuals.
- the process as 409 shows comparing the respective messages from 407 that were returned from the different assistant agents. This allows the detection of an error in the more than one respective second messages which is indicated by a difference in the messages.
- performing the process at 409 can be accomplished, provided that more than one assistant agent was selected from the plurality of assistant agents at 403 and the message with the voiced instructions was forwarded to each of the more than one assistant agent, thus resulting in each of the more than one assistant agent performing the converting the voiced instructions and the returning the respective second message thereby providing more than one respective second message from 407 .
- 410 indicates selecting the resulting message or commands corresponding to the assistant agent with the best accuracy or repeating the process above beginning at 403 or 405 .
- This provides a way to improve the accuracy of the assistance offered by the method. It may also provide an approach for evaluating an unknown or new assistance agent. To do this the selecting more than one assistant agent would comprise selecting a trusted assistant agent and an unknown assistant agent and comparing the respective messages to evaluate the unknown assistant agent.
- 411 shows updating statistics for the assistant agents that have participated. This can also comprise updating records regarding compensation for the assistant agents. After 411 the process returns to 313 .
- the apparatus, processes, and systems discussed above and the inventive principles thereof are intended to offer a novel and advantageous methodology for providing assistance to a user of an electronic device or communications unit.
- Using these principles of receiving voiced instructions, converting these instructions and sending corresponding control commands specific to a communications unit from a remote agent for execution by that unit will facilitate a cost effective, efficient, and friendly means for assisting a user with tasks that are otherwise burdensome and hence often avoided, thus contributing to user satisfaction.
