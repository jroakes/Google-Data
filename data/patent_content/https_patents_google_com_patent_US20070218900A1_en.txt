Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method, apparatus, and system of map based community search and neighborhood contribution.
- a neighborhood may be a geographically localized community in a larger city, town, and/or suburb.
- residents of the neighborhood may refer to each other as neighbors, although this term may also be used across much larger distances in rural areas.
- the neighborhood may be small enough that the neighbors may be able to know each other by walking and/or driving a short distance (e.g., 5 miles) around their place of residence and/or their place of work.
- a short distance e.g., 5 miles
- the neighbors may not know one another very well (e.g., because of busy schedules, fenced communities, lack of effort, a lack of time, etc.).
- the neighborhood may be given a designated status through a neighborhood association, a neighborhood watch group, a political group, a homeowners association, and/or a tenant association.
- These groups may help in matters such as lawn care and fence height, and they may provide such services as block parties, neighborhood parks, children activities, special interest groups, and/or community security.
- getting messages out to residents of the neighborhood may require expensive direct mail, and/or time consuming door to door meetings with residents of the neighborhood.
- a neighborhood watch (e.g., a crime watch, a block watch, a neighborhood crime watch, etc.) may be an organization of active residents devoted to crime and/or vandalism prevention in the neighborhood. Members of the neighborhood watch may stay alert of unusual activity, behaviors, and/or crime in the neighborhood. However, most residents may not be active participants of the neighborhood association (e.g., because of a lack of time), and may be unaware of safety, security, and/or prevention issues in their immediate area.
- a method includes associating a verified registered user with a user profile, associating the user profile with a specific geographic location, generating a map concurrently displaying the user profile and the specific geographic location, and simultaneously generating, in the map, wiki profiles associated with different geographic locations surrounding the specific geographic location associated with the user profile.
- the method may also includes processing a query of at least one of the user profile and the specific geographic location and converting a particular wiki profile of the wiki profiles to another user profile when a different registered user claims a particular geographic location to the specific geographic location associated with the particular wiki profile, wherein the user profile is tied to a specific property in a neighborhood, and wherein the particular wiki profile is associated with a neighboring property to the specific property in the neighborhood.
- the method may further include delisting a certain wiki profile of the wiki profiles when a private registered user claims a certain geographic location adjacent to at least one of the specific geographic location and the particular geographic location and masking the certain wiki profile in the map when the certain wiki profile is delisted through the request of the private registered user.
- the method may include processing a tag data associated with at least one of the specific geographic location, a particular geographic location, and/or the delisted geographic location, displaying a frequent one of the tag data when the specific geographic location and/or the particular geographic location is made active, but not when a geographic location is delisted, permitting a commercial user to purchase a customizable business profile associated with a commercial geographic location, enabling the verified registered user to communicate a message to the neighborhood based on a selectable distance range away from the specific geographic location and/or processing a payment of the commercial user and the verified registered user.
- the method may also include permitting the verified registered user to edit any information in the wiki profiles including the particular wiki profile and the certain wiki profile until the certain wiki profile is claimed by the different registered user and/or the private registered user, enabling a claimant of any wiki profile to control what information is displayed on their user profile and/or allowing the claimant to segregate certain information on their user profile such that only other registered users directly connected to the claimant are able to view data on their user profile.
- the method may include applying a first user ID with the verified registered user and a second user ID to the different registered user, connecting the verified registered user with the different registered user with each other through at least one of a geo-positioning data associated with the first user ID and the second user ID, setting a maximum degree of separation (Nmax) of at least two that is allowed for connecting any two registered users, wherein two registered users who are directly connected are deemed to be separated by one degree of separation, two registered users who are connected through no less than one other registered user are deemed to be separated by two degrees of separation and/or two registered users who are connected through no less than N other registered users are deemed to be separated by N+1 degrees of separation, searching the user ID of the different registered user in a set of user IDs that are stored of registered users who are less than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user, and not in the sets of user IDs that are stored for registered users who are greater than or equal to Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user, until the user ID of the different registered user is found in one of the
- the method may include searching initially in the sets of user IDs that are stored of registered users who are directly connected to the verified registered user, communicating a profile of the different registered user to the verified registered user to display through a marker associating the verified registered user with the different registered user, storing a connection path between the verified registered user and the different registered user, the connection path indicating at least one other registered user through whom the connection path between the verified registered user and the different registered user is made, communicating the connection path between the verified registered user and the different registered user to the verified registered user to display and/or embedding a hyperlink in the connection path of each of the registered users through whom the connection path between the verified registered user and the different registered user is made.
- the method may also include storing of each registered user associated e-mail addresses of individuals who are not registered users and/or identified by each registered user as neighbors, communicating out an invitation to become a new user to neighbors of the particular user, processing an acceptance of a neighbor to whom the invitation was sent, adding the neighbor to a database and/or storing of the neighbor, a user ID and/or a set of user IDs of registered users who are directly connected to the neighbor, the set of user IDs stored of the neighbor including at least the user ID of the verified registered user, notifying the verified registered user that the invitation to the neighbor has been accepted when an acceptance is processed and/or processing inputs from the neighbor having descriptive data about the friend and storing the inputs in the database.
- the method may include communicating brief profiles of registered users, including a brief profile of the different registered user, to the verified registered user for display, each of the brief profiles including a hyperlink to a corresponding full profile, processing a hyperlink selection from the verified registered user, wherein, upon processing the hyperlink selection of the full profile of the different registered user, the full profile of the different registered user may be communicated to the verified registered user for display and ensuring that brief profiles of those registered users who are more than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user are not communicated to the verified registered user for display.

- an acceptance of the neighbor e.g., the neighbor 120 of FIG. 1
- the neighbor e.g., the neighbor 120 of FIG. 1
- the neighbor 120 of FIG. 1 to a database and storing of the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 120 of FIG. 1 ), a user ID and the set of user IDs of registered users may be added who are directly connected to the neighbor (e.g., the neighbor 120 of FIG.
- the set of user IDs stored of the neighbor e.g., the neighbor 120 of FIG. 1
- the set of user IDs stored of the neighbor including at least the user ID of the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 16 ).
- FIG. 28E is a continuation of process flow of FIG. 28D showing additional processes, according to one embodiment.
- the verified registered user e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 16
- the invitation to the neighbor e.g., the neighbor 120 of FIG. 1
- the neighbor e.g., the neighbor 120 of FIG. 1
- inputs from the neighbor e.g., the neighbor 120 of FIG. 1
- the neighbor having descriptive data about the friend and storing the inputs in the database
- brief profiles of registered users including a brief profile of the different registered user may be communicated, to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 16 ) for display, each of the brief profiles including the hyperlink to a corresponding full profile.
- the hyperlink selection from the verified registered user may be processed, wherein, upon processing the hyperlink selection of the full profile of the different registered user, the full profile of the different registered user is communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 16 ) for display.
- brief profiles of those registered users who may be more than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user may not communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 of FIG. 16 ) may be ensured for display.
- a social network for people who want to get to know their neighbors and/or neighborhoods Particularly, one in which a set of maps of neighborhoods (e.g., such as those on Zillow.com or provided through Google® or Microsoft®) are used as a basis on which a user can identify themselves with a particular address. This address may be verified through one or more of the modules on FIG. 1 . Particularly, this address may be the current address of the user is living, a previous address where the user used to live, etc.
- the address may be verified through a credit check of the user, or a copy of the user's drivers license. Once the user is approved in a particular home/location, the user can leave their comments about their home. They can mark their home information proprietary, so that no one else can contribute to their info without their permission. They can have separate private and public sections, in which the private section is shared with only verified addresses of neighbors, and the public section is shared with anybody viewing their profile. The user can then create separate social networking pages for homes, churches, locations, etc. surrounding his verified address. As such, the user can express him/herself through their profile, and contribute information about what they're neighborhood is like and who lives there. Only verified individuals or entities might be able to view information in that neighborhood.
- a marker e.g., a number of stars
- additional services offered to the neighbor such as the ability to search a profiles of neighbors in a larger distance range from a verified address of the user.
- the user may only be able to search profiles within 1 mile on their principal, current home after being verified as living in there.
- they create a profiles for themselves and/or contribute profiles of other people they may widen their net of private profiles they may be allowed to search (e.g., because they become a trusted party in the neighborhood by offering civic information). Neighbors can leave feedback for each other, and arrange private block parties, etc. through their private profile.
- FIGS. 1-28 illustrate various embodiments that may be realized. While a description is given here, a self-evident description can be derived for the software and various methods, software, and hardware directly from the attached Figures.
- a neighborhood expression and user contribution system is disclosed.
- the technology allows users to see the value of millions of homes across the United States and/or the world, not just those that the user themselves own or live in, because they can share information about their neighbors. People living in apartments or condos can use the apartment/condo modeler wizard (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 1 ) to create models (e.g. 2 or 3d) of their building and share information about their apartment/home and of their neighbors with others.
- the technology has an integrated targeted advertising system for enabling advertisers to make money through the social community module 100 by delivering targeted and non-targeted advertisements.
- the system may also provide value estimates of homes it may also offers several unique features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (e.g. 1, 5, or 10 years) and aerial views of homes as well as the price of the surrounding homes in the area. It may also provides basic data of a given home such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users may can also obtain current estimates of homes if there was a significant change made such as recently modeled kitchen.
- the user interface view of the social community module may include a searchable map interface and/or a social networking page on the right when one clicks a particular home/location.
- the map interface may/may not include information about prices of a home, or information about the number of bedrooms of a home, etc. In essence, certain critical input information may be divided as follows:
- Business location or civic location e.g., park, govt. building, church, etc.: (1) name of the business/location (2) email of the manager of the business/location (3) phone number of the business/location if known (4) anything else people want to say about the business (good or bad), for example, contributable through a wiki.
- an owner of an entity location wishes to mark their location private, and uneditable by the public without their permission, they will need to pay (e.g., a monthly fixed fee) through the social community module.
- the owner of the entity location may not need to pay to mark the location as private and uneditable by the public without the owner's permission.
- Example embodiments of the social community module may feature info about businesses. They may also feature info about people that live in the homes, and may/may not display information on prices, number of bedrooms, etc.
- the social community module may be a search engine (e.g., Google®, Yahoo®, etc.) that uses maps (e.g., satellite map views) instead of text displays to show information, user profiles, reviews, promotions, ads, directions, events, etc. relevant to user searches.
- search engine e.g., Google®, Yahoo®, etc.
- maps e.g., satellite map views
- the example systems and methods illustrated in FIGS. 1-28 may facilitate a social network membership that spreads virally by users inviting their friends. For example, every person that registers has their own profile, but registration may not be required to contribute content. However, registration may be required to “own” content on your own home, and have override permission to delete things that you don't like about yourself listed about you by others.
- the social community module may need to confirm the user's identity and address (e.g., using digital signature tools, drivers license verification, etc.), and/or the user may need to pay a monthly fixed fee (e.g., through a credit card) to control their identity.
- Profiles of users may be created and/or generated on the fly, e.g., when one clicks on a home.
- directions e.g., routes
- Users can leave their opinions on businesses, but the social community module also enables users to leave opinions on neighbors, occupants or any entity having a profile on the map display.
- the social community module may not attempt to restrict freedom of speech by the users, but may voluntarily delete slanderous, libelous information on the request of an owner manually at any time.
- the methods and systems illustrated in FIGS. 1-28 enable people to search for things they want e.g. nearby pizzas etc. (e.g., by distance away). Advertisers can ‘own’ their listing by placing a display ad on nextdoor.com. Instead of click-through revenues when someone leaves the site, revenues will be realized when the link is clicked and someone views a preview html on the right of the visual map. Targeted advertisements may also be placed when someone searches a particular street, name, city, etc.
- the social community module may enable users of the social network to populate profiles for apartments, buildings, condos, etc. People can create floors, layout, etc. of their building, and add social network pages on the fly when they click on a location that has multiple residents, tenants, or lessees.
- a user interface associated with the social community module 100 may be clean, simple, and uncluttered (e.g., Simple message of “get to know your neighbors”). For example, the map interface shows neighbors. Methods and systems associated with the features described may focus on user experience, e.g., ensuring a compelling message to invite friends and/or others to join.
- a seed phase for implementation of the methods and systems illustrated in FIGS. 1-28 may be identified for building a membership associated with the social community module.
- a user having extensive networks in a certain area may seed those communities as well.
- the social network may encourage user expression, user content creation, ease of use on site to get maximum users/distribution as quickly as possible.
- the social community module may ensure that infrastructure associated with operation of the social community module (e.g., servers) are able to handle load (e.g., data traffic) and keep up with expected growth.
- the user interface view illustrated in the various figures shows an example embodiment of the social community module of FIG. 1 .
- the user interface view may include a publicly editable profile wall section allowing public postings that owners of the profile can edit. For example, any user may be able to post on an empty profile wall, but a user must claim the location to own the profile (e.g., may minimize barriers to users posting comments on profile walls).
- Names featured on the profile wall may be links to the user profiles on the map (e.g., giving an immediate sense for the location of admirers (or detractors) relative to user location).
- an action e.g., mouse-over
- the user interface view may also utilize the mapping interface to link comments to locations.
- the various embodiments illustrate a comment announcing a garage sale, that is tied to a mappable location on the mapping interface. (e.g., allows people to browse references directly from people's profiles).
- a comment announcing a garage sale that is tied to a mappable location on the mapping interface.
- a mappable location on the mapping interface e.g., allows people to browse references directly from people's profiles.
- an example display of the mapping interface is illustrated.
- houses are shown in green
- a church is shown in white
- the red house shows the selected location and/or the profile owner's house
- question marks indicate locations without profile owners
- blue buildings are commercial locations
- the pink building represents an apartment complex.
- Houses with stars indicate people associated with (e.g., “friends”) of the current user.
- a user action e.g., mouse-over
- a commercial property displayed in the mapping interface may pull up a star (e.g., “***) rating based on user reviews, and/or a link to the profile for the property.
- a mouse-over action on the apartment complex may pull up a building schematic for the complex with floor plans, on which the user can see friends/profiles for various floors or rooms.
- Question marks indicated in the display may prompt users to own that profile or post comments on the wall for that space.
- a user action on any house displayed in the mapping interface may pull up a profile link, summary info such as status, profession, interests, etc. associated with the profile owner, a link to add the person as a friend, and/or a link to send a message to the user (e.g., the profile owner).
- a default profile view shown is that of the current user (e.g., logged in), and if the user clicks on any other profile, it may show their profile in that space instead (with few text changes to indicate different person).
- the events in your area view of the profile display in may have a default radius for notification of events (e.g., by street, by block, by neighborhood, county, etc.) Events are associated with user profiles and may link to locations displayed on the mapping interfaces.
- the hot picks section may be an ad/promotional zone, with default settings for radius of alerts also configurable.
- the “Find a Friend” section may permit users to search by name, address, interests, status, profession, favorite movies/music/food etc. Users are also able to search within a given radius of their location.
- the user interface view may include a link for the user to invite other people to join the network (e.g., may encourage users who see a question-mark on a house or a location on the mapping interface that corresponds to a real location associated with someone they know to contact that person and encourage them to join and own that profile through the social community module).
- Search engine that provides a visual map (e.g., rather than text) display of information relevant to user queries.
- Users can search on the map for other people having certain professional, educational, personal, extracurricular, cultural, political and/or family etc. profiles or interests, within any location range.
- Users can search for information on the map, that is accessible directly through profile displays. For example, the user may search for information about a certain subject and be directed to a profile of another user having information about the subject. Alternatively, the user may view the search subject itself as a visible item (e.g., if applicable to the search query) having a profile on the map display, along with additional information associated with the item (e.g., contributed by other users).
- a visible item e.g., if applicable to the search query
- additional information associated with the item e.g., contributed by other users.
- Users can find friends, business associates, vendors, romantic partners, etc. on the map within any location range (e.g., in their neighborhood, street, subdivision, etc.) by browsing the map display or searching for people with certain profile characteristics and/or similar interests.
- any location range e.g., in their neighborhood, street, subdivision, etc.
- Entities Users can view, browse and post comments/information/reviews about entity locations and/or people associated with those locations (e.g., occupants of a house, families, apartment residents, businesses, non-governmental entities, etc.), even for locations that do not have a profile owner.
- entity locations visible on the map display may link to a profiles on which any user can post comments.
- the occupant(s) would have to join the network associated with the social community module and become the owner of the profile.
- the profile owner would then become visible in the map display (e.g., entity locations without profile owners may only be visible as questions marks on the map, having blank profiles but public comment sections).
- Automatically notifies users of events and promotions in an area e.g., scope of area can be selected by the user
- highlights venues and user profiles on the map e.g., scope of area can be selected by the user
- Users can post reviews about entity locations (e.g., businesses) such that ratings for entity locations are visible on the map. Other users can trace the location of the users that posted the comments on the map.
- entity locations e.g., businesses
- Users who post comments on other profiles can be traced directly on the map through their comments.
- users can choose to submit anonymous postings or comments on other user/entity profiles, and/or may choose not to be traceable on the map through their comments.
- Users can visually determine routes/directions/orientation to locations that they can browse within the map display. Additionally, users can generate written driving, walking or public transit directions between points of interest (e.g., from the user's house to a friend's house) within the map display.
- Users can communicate (e.g., through live chat) directly with other users in the area based on an association determined through their profiles
- Business entity locations can generate targeted ads and promotions within locations on the map display (e.g., virtual billboards).
- the social community module can realize revenue based on ad clickthroughs by users, without the users being directed away from the interface. For example, when a user clicks on any targeted ad/promotion displayed on the map, the profile of the entity associated with the ad/promotion may be generated alongside the map display.
- Neighborhood is a geographically localized community located within a larger city or suburb.
- the residents of a given neighborhood are called neighbors (or neighbors), although this term may also be used across much larger distances in rural areas.
- a neighborhood is small enough that the neighbors are all able to know each other.
- neighbors may not know one another very well at all.
- Villages aren't divided into neighborhoods, because they are already small enough that the villagers can all know each other.
- neighborhoods encompass 2 , 000 to 10 , 000 families. Within neighborhoods, families are grouped into smaller residential units or quarters of 100 to 600 families and supervised by a residents' committee; these are subdivided into residents' small groups of fifteen to forty families. In most urban areas of China, neighborhood, community, residential community, residential unit, residential quarter have the same meaning: or or and is the direct sublevel of a subdistrict which is the direct sublevel of a district which is the direct sublevel of a city (See Political divisions of China.
- a neighborhood or neighborhood (see spelling differences) is a geographically localized community located within a larger city or suburb.
- the residents of a given neighborhood are called neighbors (or neighbors), although this term may also be used across much larger distances in rural areas.
- a block party is a large public celebration in which many members of a single neighborhood congregate to observe a positive event of some importance. Many times, there will be celebration in the form of playing music and dance. Block parties gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s. Block Parties were often held outdoors and power for the DJ's sound system was taken illegally from street lights. This was famously referenced in the song “South Bronx” by KRS-One with the line:
- block parties are commonly held on holidays such as Fourth of July or Labor Day. Sometimes the occasion may be a theme such a “Welcome to the Neighborhood” for a new family or a recent popular movie. Often block parties involve barbecuing, lawn games such as Simon Says and group dancing such as the Electric Slide, the Macarena or line dancing.
- a block party has come to mean any informal public celebration.
- a block party can be conducted via television even though there is no real block in the observance. The same is true for the Internet.
- the block party is closely related to the beach party.
- the British equivalent is the street party.
- a neighborhood watch also called a crime watch or neighborhood crime watch
- a neighborhood watch is a citizens' organization devoted to crime and vandalism prevention within a neighborhood. It is not a vigilante organization, since members are expected not to directly intervene in possible criminal activity. Instead, neighborhood watch members are to stay alert to unusual activity and contact the authorities. It builds on the concept of a town watch from Colonial America.

- FIGS. 1-28 can be applied to creating online community organizations of neighborhoods of any form.
- people During human growth and maturation, people encounter sets of other individuals and experiences. Infants encounter first, their immediate family, then extended family, and then local community (such as school and work). They thus develop individual and group identity through associations that connect them to life-long community experiences.
- Socialization The process of learning to adopt the behavior patterns of the community is called socialization.
- the most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which individuals develop the skills and knowledge and learn the roles necessary to function within their culture and social environment.
- the most important period of socialization is between the ages of 1 and 10. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.
- Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community norms. Other important influences include school, peer groups, mass media, the workplace and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of tolerance, reciprocity and trust are important “habits of the heart,” as de Tocqueville put it, in an individual's involvement in community.
- SCI Sense of Community Index
- Effective communication practices in group and organizational settings are important to the formation and maintenance of communities. How ideas and values are communicated within communities are important to the induction of new members, the formulation of agendas, the selection of leaders and many other aspects.
- Organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within organizational structures. Group members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting. Although organizational communication, as a field of study, is usually geared toward companies and business groups, these may also be seen as communities. The principles can also be applied to other types of communities.
- Azadi Tower is a town square in modern Iran.
- Social capital is defined by Robert D. Putnam as “the collective value of all social networks (who people know) and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (norms of reciprocity).”
- Social capital in action can be seen in groups of varying formality, including neighbors keeping an eye on each others' homes.
- Bowling Alone The Collapse and Revival of American Community (2000), social capital has been falling in the United States. Putnam found that over the past 25 years, attendance at club meetings has fallen 58 percent, family dinners are down 33 percent, and having friends visit has fallen 45 percent.
- Community organizing is sometimes focused on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage consensus decision-making with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group.

- a planned community is one that was designed from scratch and grew up more or less following the plan.
- Several of the world's capital cities are planned cities, notably Washington, D.C., in the United States, Canberra in Australia, and Brasilia in Brazil.

- Identity In some contexts, “community” indicates a group of people with a common identity other than location. Members often interact regularly. Common examples in everyday usage include:
- a “professional community” is a group of people with the same or related occupations. Some of those members may join a professional society, making a more defined and formalized group.
- a virtual community is a group of people primarily or initially communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies, typically over the Internet, rather than in person. These may be either communities of interest, practice or communion. (See below.) Research interest is evolving in the motivations for contributing to online communities.

Abstract
Description
- This patent application claims priority from:
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method, apparatus, and system of map based community search and neighborhood contribution.
- A neighborhood may be a geographically localized community in a larger city, town, and/or suburb. Residents of the neighborhood may refer to each other as neighbors, although this term may also be used across much larger distances in rural areas. In theory, the neighborhood may be small enough that the neighbors may be able to know each other by walking and/or driving a short distance (e.g., 5 miles) around their place of residence and/or their place of work. However, in practice, the neighbors may not know one another very well (e.g., because of busy schedules, fenced communities, lack of effort, a lack of time, etc.).
- The neighborhood may be given a designated status through a neighborhood association, a neighborhood watch group, a political group, a homeowners association, and/or a tenant association. These groups may help in matters such as lawn care and fence height, and they may provide such services as block parties, neighborhood parks, children activities, special interest groups, and/or community security. However, getting messages out to residents of the neighborhood may require expensive direct mail, and/or time consuming door to door meetings with residents of the neighborhood.
- A neighborhood watch (e.g., a crime watch, a block watch, a neighborhood crime watch, etc.) may be an organization of active residents devoted to crime and/or vandalism prevention in the neighborhood. Members of the neighborhood watch may stay alert of unusual activity, behaviors, and/or crime in the neighborhood. However, most residents may not be active participants of the neighborhood association (e.g., because of a lack of time), and may be unaware of safety, security, and/or prevention issues in their immediate area.
- For example, in many American communities, while a few active residents know a lot of their neighbors, there are far more residents who do not even know what professions, interests, and reputations are of their immediate next-door neighbors. As a result, friendships among neighbors don't form as often, neighbors have more difficult time asking other neighbors for help, safety in the neighborhood suffers, quality of life is impacted, and a sense of community is diminishing.
- A method, apparatus and system of map based neighborhood search and community contribution are disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes associating a verified registered user with a user profile, associating the user profile with a specific geographic location, generating a map concurrently displaying the user profile and the specific geographic location, and simultaneously generating, in the map, wiki profiles associated with different geographic locations surrounding the specific geographic location associated with the user profile.
- The method may also includes processing a query of at least one of the user profile and the specific geographic location and converting a particular wiki profile of the wiki profiles to another user profile when a different registered user claims a particular geographic location to the specific geographic location associated with the particular wiki profile, wherein the user profile is tied to a specific property in a neighborhood, and wherein the particular wiki profile is associated with a neighboring property to the specific property in the neighborhood.
- The method may further include delisting a certain wiki profile of the wiki profiles when a private registered user claims a certain geographic location adjacent to at least one of the specific geographic location and the particular geographic location and masking the certain wiki profile in the map when the certain wiki profile is delisted through the request of the private registered user. Moreover, the method may include processing a tag data associated with at least one of the specific geographic location, a particular geographic location, and/or the delisted geographic location, displaying a frequent one of the tag data when the specific geographic location and/or the particular geographic location is made active, but not when a geographic location is delisted, permitting a commercial user to purchase a customizable business profile associated with a commercial geographic location, enabling the verified registered user to communicate a message to the neighborhood based on a selectable distance range away from the specific geographic location and/or processing a payment of the commercial user and the verified registered user.
- Furthermore, the method may also include permitting the verified registered user to edit any information in the wiki profiles including the particular wiki profile and the certain wiki profile until the certain wiki profile is claimed by the different registered user and/or the private registered user, enabling a claimant of any wiki profile to control what information is displayed on their user profile and/or allowing the claimant to segregate certain information on their user profile such that only other registered users directly connected to the claimant are able to view data on their user profile.
- Also, the method may include applying a first user ID with the verified registered user and a second user ID to the different registered user, connecting the verified registered user with the different registered user with each other through at least one of a geo-positioning data associated with the first user ID and the second user ID, setting a maximum degree of separation (Nmax) of at least two that is allowed for connecting any two registered users, wherein two registered users who are directly connected are deemed to be separated by one degree of separation, two registered users who are connected through no less than one other registered user are deemed to be separated by two degrees of separation and/or two registered users who are connected through no less than N other registered users are deemed to be separated by N+1 degrees of separation, searching the user ID of the different registered user in a set of user IDs that are stored of registered users who are less than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user, and not in the sets of user IDs that are stored for registered users who are greater than or equal to Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user, until the user ID of the different registered user is found in one of the searched sets and/or connecting the verified registered user to the different registered user if the user ID of the different registered user is found in one of the searched sets, wherein the method limits the searching of the different registered user in the sets of user IDs that are stored of registered users who are less than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user, such that the verified registered user and/or the different registered user who are separated by more than Nmax degrees of separation are not found and connected.

search module 108 ofFIG. 1 , asearch module 108 ofFIG. 3 ) of the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) to enable a people search (e.g., information stored inpeople database 216 ofFIG. 2 ), a business search (e.g., information stored in business database 220 ofFIG. 2 ), and a category search of any data in the social community module (asocial community module 106 ofFIG. 1 , asocial community module 106 ofFIG. 2 ) and/or to enable embedding of any content in the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) in other search engines, blogs, social networks, professional networks and/or static websites, a commerce module (e.g., acommerce module 112 ofFIG. 1 , acommerce module 112 ofFIG. 5 ) of the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ). - The system may also provide an advertisement system to a business (e.g., through business display advertisement module 502 of
FIG. 5 ) who purchase their location in the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) in which the advertisement is viewable concurrently with a map indicating a location of the business, and in which revenue is attributed to the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) when the registered users and/or the unregistered users click-in on a simultaneously displayed data of the advertisement along with the map indicating a location of the business, a map module (amap module 114 ofFIG. 1 ) of the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) to include a map data associated with a satellite data which serves as a basis of rendering the map in the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) and/or which includes a simplified map generator (e.g., simplifiedmap generator module 602 ofFIG. 6 ) which can transform the map to a fewer color and location complex form using a parcel data which identifies at least some residence, civic, and/or business locations in the satellite data. - In yet another embodiment, a global neighborhood environment (e.g., a
global neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) includes a first instruction set to enable a social network to reside above a map data, in which the social network may be associated with specific geographical locations identifiable in the map data, a second instruction set integrated with the first instruction set to enable the users (e.g., the user 116 ofFIG. 1 ) of the social network to create profiles of other people through a forum which provides a free form of expression of the users sharing information about any entities and/or people residing in any geographical location identifiable in the satellite map data, and/or to provide a technique of each of the users (e.g., the user 116 ofFIG. 1 ) to claim a geographic location (ageographic location 1204 ofFIG. 12A ) to control content in their respective claimed geographic locations and a third instruction set integrated with the first instruction set and/or the second instruction set to enable searching of people in the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) by indexing each of the data shared by the users (e.g., the user 116 ofFIG. 1 ) of any of the people and entities residing in any geographic location (ageographic location 1204 ofFIG. 12A ). -
FIG. 1 is a system view of aglobal neighborhood environment 100 communicating with neighborhood(s) 102A-N through anetwork 104, an advertiser(s) 124, aglobal map data 126, anoccupant data 128, according to one embodiment. ParticularlyFIG. 1 illustrates theglobal neighborhood environment 100, theneighborhood 102A-N, thenetwork 104, advertiser(s) 124,global map data 126, and theoccupant data 128, according to one embodiment. Theglobal neighborhood environment 100 may contain asocial community module 106, asearch module 108, awiki module 110, acommerce module 112 and amap module 114. The neighborhood may include a user 116, acommunity center 120, aresidence 118, aneighbor 120 and a business 122, according to one embodiment. - The
global neighborhood environment 100 may include any number of neighborhoods having registered users and/or unregistered users. The neighborhood(s) 102 may be a geographically localized community in a larger city, town, and/or suburb. Thenetwork 104 may be search engines, blogs, social networks, professional networks and static website that may unite individuals, groups and/or community. Thesocial community module 106 may generate a building creator in which the registered users may create and/or modify empty wiki profiles (e.g., awiki profile 1206 ofFIG. 12A-12B , awiki profile 1302 ofFIG. 13A , awiki profile 1704 ofFIG. 17 ). Thesearch module 108 may include searching of information of an individual, group and/or community. - The
wiki module 110 may enable the registered users to create and/or update their information. A ‘wiki’ (e.g., may be enabled through the wiki module 110) can be defined as a perpetual collective work of many authors. Similar to a blog in structure and logic, a wiki allows anyone to edit, delete or modify content that has been placed on the Web site using a browser interface, including the work of previous authors. In contrast, a blog (e.g., or a social network page), typically authored by an individual, may not allow visitors to change the original posted material, only add comments to the original content. The term wiki refers to either the web site or the software used to create the site. The term ‘wiki’ also implies fast creation, ease of creation, and community approval in many software contexts (e.g., wiki means “quick” in Hawaiian). - The
commerce module 112 may provide an advertisement system to a business that may enable the users to purchase location in the neighborhood(s) 102. Themap module 114 may be indulged in study, practice, representing and/or generating maps, or globes.

Theresidence 118 may be a house, a place to live and/or like a nursing home in a neighborhood(s) 102. - The
community center 120 may be public locations where members of a community may gather for group activities, social support, public information, and other purposes. The business 122 may be a customer service, finance, sales, production, communications/public relations and/or marketing organization that may be located in the neighborhood(s) 102. The advertiser(s) 124 may be an individual and/or a firm drawing public who may be responsible in encouraging the people attention to goods and/or services by promoting businesses, and/or may perform through a variety of media. Theglobal map data 126 may contain the details/maps of any area, region and/or neighborhood. Thesocial community module 106 of theglobal neighborhood environment 100 may communicate with the neighborhood(s) 102 through thenetwork 104 and/or thesearch module 108. Thesocial community module 106 of theglobal neighborhood environment 100 may communicate with the advertiser(s) 124 through the commerce module, theoccupant data 128 and/orglobal map data 126 through themap module 114. - For example, the
neighborhoods 102A-N may have registered users and/or unregistered users of aglobal neighborhood environment 100. Also, thesocial community module 106 of theglobal neighborhood environment 100 may generate a building creator (e.g.,building builder 1602 ofFIG. 16 ) in which the registered users may create and/or modify empty wiki profiles, building layouts, social network pages, and/or floor levels structures housing residents and/or businesses in the neighborhood. - In addition, the
wiki module 110 of theglobal neighborhood environment 100 may enable the registered users to create a social network page of themselves, and/or may edit information associated with the unregistered users identifiable through a viewing of physical properties in which, the unregistered users reside when the registered users have knowledge of characteristics associated with the unregistered users. - Furthermore, the
search module 108 of theglobal neighborhood environment 100 may enable a people search (e.g., the people searchwidget 300 ofFIG. 3 ), a business search (e.g., the business search module 302 ofFIG. 3 ), and/or a category search (e.g., thecategory search widget 304 ofFIG. 3 ) of any data in thesocial community module 106 and/or may enable embedding of any content in theglobal neighborhood environment 100 in other search engines, blogs, social networks, professional networks and/or static websites. - The
commerce module 112 of theglobal neighborhood environment 100 may provide an advertisement system to a business who purchase their location in theglobal neighborhood environment 100 in which the advertisement may be viewable concurrently with a map indicating a location of the business, and/or in which revenue may be attributed to theglobal neighborhood environment 100 when the registered users and/or the unregistered users click-in on a simultaneously displayed data of the advertisement along with the map indicating a location of the business. - Moreover, a
map module 114 of theglobal neighborhood environment 100 may include a map data associated with a satellite data (e.g., generated by thesatellite data module 600 ofFIG. 6 ) which may serve as a basis of rendering the map in theglobal neighborhood environment 100 and/or which includes a simplified map generator which may transform the map to a fewer color and/or location complex form using a parcel data which identifies some residence, civic, and/or business locations in the satellite data. - In addition, a first instruction set may enable a social network to reside above a map data, in which the social network may be associated with specific geographical locations identifiable in the map data. Also, a second instruction set integrated with the first instruction set may enable users of the social network to create profiles of other people through a forum which provides a free form of expression of the users sharing information about any entities and/or people residing in any geographical location identifiable in the satellite map data, and/or to provide a technique of each of the users to claim a geographic location (e.g., a geographic location 1024 of
FIG. 12A ) to control content in their respective claimed geographic locations (e.g., a geographic location 1024 ofFIG. 12A ). - Furthermore, a third instruction set integrated with the first instruction set and the second instruction set may enable searching of people in the
global neighborhood environment 100 by indexing each of the data shared by the user 116 of any of the people and/or the entities residing in any geographic location (e.g., a geographic location 1024 ofFIG. 12A ). A fourth instruction set may provide a moderation of content about each other posted of the users 116 through trusted users of theglobal neighborhood environment 100 who have an ability to ban specific users and/or delete any offensive and libelous content in theglobal neighborhood environment 100. - Also, a fifth instruction set may enable an insertion of any content generated in the
global neighborhood environment 100 in other search engines through a syndication and/or advertising relationship between theglobal neighborhood environment 100 and/or other internet commerce and search portals. - Moreover, a sixth instruction set may grow the social network through neighborhood groups, local politicians, block watch communities, issue activism groups, and neighbor(s) 120 who invite other known parties and/or members to share profiles of themselves and/or learn characteristics and information about other supporters and/or residents in a geographic area of interest through the
global neighborhood environment 100. - Also, a seventh instruction set may determine quantify an effect on at least one of a desirability of a location, a popularity of a location, and a market value of a location based on an algorithm that considers a number of demographic and social characteristics of a region surrounding the location through a reviews module.

An invitation to become a new user (e.g., the user 116 of
FIG. 1 ) may be communicated out to neighbor (e.g., the neighbors neighbor ofFIG. 1 ) of the particular user. An acceptance of the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) to whom the invitation was sent may be processed. - The neighbor (e.g., the
neighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) may be added to a database and/or storing of the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ), a user ID and a set of user IDs of registered users who are directly connected to the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ), the set of user IDs stored of the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) including at least the user ID of the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ). Furthermore, the verified registered user may be notified that the invitation to the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) has been accepted when an acceptance is processed. Also, inputs from the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) having descriptive data about the friend may be processed and the inputs in the database may be stored. -
FIG. 24 is a flowchart of adding the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) to the queue, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 2402, the system may start with the empty connection list and empty queue. Inoperation 2404, the user may be added to the queue. Inoperation 2406, it is determined whether the queue is empty. Inoperation 2408, if it is determined that the queue is not empty then the next person P may be taken from the queue. Inoperation 2410, it may be determined whether the person P from the queue is user B or not. Inoperation 2412, if the person P is not user B then it may be determined whether the depth of the geographical location is less than maximum degrees of separation. - If it is determined that depth is more than maximum allowable degrees of separation then it may repeat the
operation 2408. Inoperation 2414, if may be determined that the depth of the geographical location (e.g., thegeographical location 1204 ofFIG. 12A ) is less than maximum degrees of separation then the neighbors (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) list for person P may be processed. Inoperation 2416, it may be determined whether all the neighbors (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) in the neighborhood (e.g., theneighborhood 102A-N ofFIG. 1 ) have been processed or not. If all the friends are processed it may be determined the queue is empty. - In
operation 2418, if all the neighbors (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) for person P are not processed then next neighbor N may be taken from the list. Inoperation 2420, it may be determined whether the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) N has encountered before or not. Inoperation 2422, if the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) has not been encountered before then the neighbor may be added to the queue. Inoperation 2424, if the neighbor N has been encountered before it may be further determined whether the geographical location (e.g., thegeographical location 1204 ofFIG. 12A ) from where the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) has encountered previously is the same place or closer to that place. - If it is determined that the neighbor (e.g., the
neighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) has encountered at the same or closer place then the friend may be added to the queue. If it may be determined that friend is not encountered at the same place or closer to that place then it may be again checked that all the friends have processed. Inoperation 2426, if it is determined that the person P is user B than the connection may be added to the connection list and after adding the connection to connection list it follows theoperation 2412. Inoperation 2428, if it may be determined that queue is empty then the operation may return the connections list. - For example, a first user ID with the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of
FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and a second user ID may be applied to the different registered user. The verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) with the different registered user may be connected with each other through at least one of a geo-positioning data associated with the first user ID and the second user ID. In addition, a maximum degree of separation (Nmax) of at least two that is allowed for connecting any two registered users, (e.g., the two registered users who may be directly connected may be deemed to be separated by one degree of separation and two registered users who may be connected through no less than one other registered user may be deemed to be separated by two degrees of separation and two registered users who may be connected through not less than N other registered users may be deemed to be separated by N+1 degrees of separation). - Furthermore, the user ID of the different registered user may be searched (e.g., the method limits the searching of the different registered user in the sets of user IDs that may be stored as registered users who are less than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of
FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ), such that the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and the different registered user who may be separated by more than Nmax degrees of separation are not found and connected.) in a set of user IDs that may be stored of registered users who are less than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ), and not in the sets of user IDs that may be stored for registered users who are greater than or equal to Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ), until the user ID of the different registered user may be found in one of the searched sets. Also, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) may be connected to the different registered user if the user ID of the different registered user may be found in one of the searched sets. - Moreover, the sets of user IDs that may be stored of registered users may be searched initially who are directly connected to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of
FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ). A profile of the different registered user may be communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) to display through a marker associating the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) with the different registered user. A connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and the different registered user, the connection path indicating at least one other registered user may be stored through whom the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and the different registered user is made. - In addition, the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of
FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and the different registered user may be communicated to the verified registered user to display. A hyperlink in the connection path of each of the at least one registered users may be embedded through whom the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and the different registered user is made. -
FIG. 25 is a flowchart of communicating brief profiles of the registered users, processing a hyperlink selection from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and calculating and ensuring the Nmax degree of separation of the registered users away from verified registered users (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ), according to one embodiment. Inoperation 2502, the data of the registered users may be collected from the database. Inoperation 2504, the relational path between the first user and the second user may be calculated (e.g., the Nmax degree of separation between verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and the registered user). - For example, the brief profiles of registered users, including a brief profile of the different registered user, to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of
FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) for display, each of the brief profiles including a hyperlink to a corresponding full profile may be communicated. - Furthermore, the hyperlink selection from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 of
FIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) may be processed (e.g., upon processing the hyperlink selection of the full profile of the different registered user, the full profile of the different registered user may be communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) for display). In addition, the brief profiles of those registered users may be ensured who are more than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) are not communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) for display. -
FIG. 26 is an N degree separation view, according to one embodiment. ME may be a verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) of the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) centered in the neighborhood network. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, 0, P, Q, R, S, T, and/or U may be the other registered user of the neighborhood network. The member of the neighborhood network may be separated from the centered verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) ME of the neighborhood network by certain degree of separation. The registered user A, B and C may be directly connected and are deemed to be separated by one degree of separation from verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) ME. The registered user D, E, F, G, and H may be connected through no less than one other registered user may be deemed to be separated by two degree of separation from verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) ME. The registered user I, J, K, and L may be connected through no less than N−1 other registered user may be deemed to be separated by N degree of separation from verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) ME. The registered user M, N, 0, P, Q, R S, T and U may be all registered user. -
FIG. 27 is a user interface view showing a map, according to one embodiment. ParticularlyFIG. 27 illustrates a satellite photo of a physical world. The registered user of the global neighborhood environment (e.g., theglobal neighborhood environment 100 ofFIG. 1 ) may use this for exploring the geographical location (e.g., thegeographical location 1204 ofFIG. 12A ) of the neighbors (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ). The registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) may navigate, zoom, explore and quickly find particular desired geographical locations of the desired neighbors (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ). This may help the registered user to read the map an/or plot the route of the neighbors (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) on the world map. -

operation 2852, a hyperlink in the connection path of each of the at least one registered users may be embedded through whom the connection path between the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) and the different registered user may be made. Inoperation 2854, each registered user associated e-mail addresses of individuals who are not registered users may be stored and identified by each registered user as neighbors (e.g., aneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ). - In
operation 2856, an invitation may be communicated to become a new user (e.g., a user 116 ofFIG. 1 ) to neighbors (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) of the particular user. Inoperation 2858, an acceptance of the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) to whom the invitation was sent may be processed. Inoperation 2860, the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) to a database and storing of the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ), a user ID and the set of user IDs of registered users may be added who are directly connected to the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ), the set of user IDs stored of the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) including at least the user ID of the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ). -
FIG. 28E is a continuation of process flow ofFIG. 28D showing additional processes, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 2862, the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) that the invitation to the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) has been accepted may be notified when the acceptance is processed. - In
operation 2864, inputs from the neighbor (e.g., theneighbor 120 ofFIG. 1 ) having descriptive data about the friend and storing the inputs in the database may be processed. Inoperation 2866, brief profiles of registered users, including a brief profile of the different registered user may be communicated, to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) for display, each of the brief profiles including the hyperlink to a corresponding full profile. - In
operation 2868, the hyperlink selection from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) may be processed, wherein, upon processing the hyperlink selection of the full profile of the different registered user, the full profile of the different registered user is communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) for display. - In
operation 2870, brief profiles of those registered users who may be more than Nmax degrees of separation away from the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) may not communicated to the verified registered user (e.g., the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 13A-B , the verified registered user 1310 ofFIG. 16 ) may be ensured for display. - People in suburbia and urban cities now may not even know who their neighbors are. Communities have become more insular. There may be a few active people in each neighborhood who know about their neighborhood and are willing to share what they know with others. They should be able to share this information with others through the Internet. Many people want to know who their neighbors are and express themselves and their families through the internet. People want to also know about recommendations and what kind of civic and cultural things are in the neighborhood. What is contemplated includes: A social network for people who want to get to know their neighbors and/or neighborhoods. Particularly, one in which a set of maps of neighborhoods (e.g., such as those on Zillow.com or provided through Google® or Microsoft®) are used as a basis on which a user can identify themselves with a particular address. This address may be verified through one or more of the modules on
FIG. 1 . Particularly, this address may be the current address of the user is living, a previous address where the user used to live, etc. - The address may be verified through a credit check of the user, or a copy of the user's drivers license. Once the user is approved in a particular home/location, the user can leave their comments about their home. They can mark their home information proprietary, so that no one else can contribute to their info without their permission. They can have separate private and public sections, in which the private section is shared with only verified addresses of neighbors, and the public section is shared with anybody viewing their profile. The user can then create separate social networking pages for homes, churches, locations, etc. surrounding his verified address. As such, the user can express him/herself through their profile, and contribute information about what they're neighborhood is like and who lives there. Only verified individuals or entities might be able to view information in that neighborhood.
- The more information the user contributes, the higher his or her status will be in the neighborhood through a marker (e.g., a number of stars), or through additional services offered to the neighbor, such as the ability to search a profiles of neighbors in a larger distance range from a verified address of the user. For example, initially, the user may only be able to search profiles within 1 mile on their principal, current home after being verified as living in there. When they create a profiles for themselves and/or contribute profiles of other people, they may widen their net of private profiles they may be allowed to search (e.g., because they become a trusted party in the neighborhood by offering civic information). Neighbors can leave feedback for each other, and arrange private block parties, etc. through their private profile. All these features may possible through one or more of the embodiments and/or modules illustrated in
FIGS. 1-28 . Through their public profile, neighbors can know if there is a doctor living down the street, or an attorney around the corner. TheFIGS. 1-28 illustrate various embodiments that may be realized. While a description is given here, a self-evident description can be derived for the software and various methods, software, and hardware directly from the attached Figures. - A neighborhood expression and user contribution system is disclosed. In one aspect, the technology allows users to see the value of millions of homes across the United States and/or the world, not just those that the user themselves own or live in, because they can share information about their neighbors. People living in apartments or condos can use the apartment/condo modeler wizard (e.g., as illustrated in
FIG. 1 ) to create models (e.g. 2 or 3d) of their building and share information about their apartment/home and of their neighbors with others. The technology has an integrated targeted advertising system for enabling advertisers to make money through thesocial community module 100 by delivering targeted and non-targeted advertisements. - Aside from giving user generated content of information of homes, the system may also provide value estimates of homes it may also offers several unique features including value changes of each home in a given time frame (e.g. 1, 5, or 10 years) and aerial views of homes as well as the price of the surrounding homes in the area. It may also provides basic data of a given home such as square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Users may can also obtain current estimates of homes if there was a significant change made such as recently modeled kitchen.
- In the example systems and methods illustrated in
FIGS. 1-28 , neighbors may get to know each other and their surrounding businesses more easily through the Internet. The user interface view of the social community module may include a searchable map interface and/or a social networking page on the right when one clicks a particular home/location. The map interface may/may not include information about prices of a home, or information about the number of bedrooms of a home, etc. In essence, certain critical input information may be divided as follows: - Residential location: (1) name of the persons/family living in that residence (2) Their profession if any 3) Their educational background if any (4) Their recreational interests (5) About their family description box (6) Anything else people want to post about that person including their interests, hobbies, etc. (7) An ability for users to leave endorsements.
- Business location or civic location (e.g., park, govt. building, church, etc.): (1) name of the business/location (2) email of the manager of the business/location (3) phone number of the business/location if known (4) anything else people want to say about the business (good or bad), for example, contributable through a wiki.
- These two will be the primary types. Various features differentiate example embodiments of the social community module from other social networks. These differentiators include (1) interface driven by address (2) maps that can be viewed, zoomed in on, tied to a parcel #, etc. (3) Anyone can populate anyone's social network page. (4) Anybody can post in one of the boxes. They can post anonymously or publicly (5) If someone wants to override information that already has been established, they will need to have an identity (e.g., user name), to override published posting information.
- However, according to one embodiment, if an owner of an entity location wishes to mark their location private, and uneditable by the public without their permission, they will need to pay (e.g., a monthly fixed fee) through the social community module. Alternatively, the owner of the entity location may not need to pay to mark the location as private and uneditable by the public without the owner's permission. Example embodiments of the social community module may feature info about businesses. They may also feature info about people that live in the homes, and may/may not display information on prices, number of bedrooms, etc.
- The social community module (e.g., as described in
FIG. 1 ) may be a search engine (e.g., Google®, Yahoo®, etc.) that uses maps (e.g., satellite map views) instead of text displays to show information, user profiles, reviews, promotions, ads, directions, events, etc. relevant to user searches. - The example systems and methods illustrated in
FIGS. 1-28 may facilitate a social network membership that spreads virally by users inviting their friends. For example, every person that registers has their own profile, but registration may not be required to contribute content. However, registration may be required to “own” content on your own home, and have override permission to delete things that you don't like about yourself listed about you by others. In one embodiment, the social community module may need to confirm the user's identity and address (e.g., using digital signature tools, drivers license verification, etc.), and/or the user may need to pay a monthly fixed fee (e.g., through a credit card) to control their identity. - For example, they can get a rebate, and not have to pay the monthly fee for a particular month, if they invite at least 15 people that month AND contribute information about at least 10 of their neighbors, friends, civic, or business locations in their neighborhood. People can post pics of their family, their business, their home, etc. on their profile once they ‘own’ their home and register. In another embodiment, endorsements for neighbors by others will be published automatically. People can search for other people by descriptors (e.g., name, profession, distance away from me, etc.)
- Profiles of users may be created and/or generated on the fly, e.g., when one clicks on a home.
- People may be able to visually see directions to their neighborhood businesses, rather than reading directions through text in a first phase. After time, directions (e.g., routes) can be offered as well. Users can leave their opinions on businesses, but the social community module also enables users to leave opinions on neighbors, occupants or any entity having a profile on the map display. The social community module may not attempt to restrict freedom of speech by the users, but may voluntarily delete slanderous, libelous information on the request of an owner manually at any time.
- In one embodiment, the methods and systems illustrated in
FIGS. 1-28 enable people to search for things they want e.g. nearby pizzas etc. (e.g., by distance away). Advertisers can ‘own’ their listing by placing a display ad on nextdoor.com. Instead of click-through revenues when someone leaves the site, revenues will be realized when the link is clicked and someone views a preview html on the right of the visual map. Targeted advertisements may also be placed when someone searches a particular street, name, city, etc. - In another example embodiment, the social community module may enable users of the social network to populate profiles for apartments, buildings, condos, etc. People can create floors, layout, etc. of their building, and add social network pages on the fly when they click on a location that has multiple residents, tenants, or lessees.
- A user interface associated with the
social community module 100 may be clean, simple, and uncluttered (e.g., Simple message of “get to know your neighbors”). For example, the map interface shows neighbors. Methods and systems associated with the features described may focus on user experience, e.g., ensuring a compelling message to invite friends and/or others to join. A seed phase for implementation of the methods and systems illustrated inFIGS. 1-28 may be identified for building a membership associated with the social community module. - For example, a user having extensive networks in a certain area (e.g., a city) may seed those communities as well. The social network may encourage user expression, user content creation, ease of use on site to get maximum users/distribution as quickly as possible. In another embodiment, the social community module may ensure that infrastructure associated with operation of the social community module (e.g., servers) are able to handle load (e.g., data traffic) and keep up with expected growth.
- For example, the user interface view illustrated in the various figures shows an example embodiment of the social community module of
FIG. 1 . The user interface view may include a publicly editable profile wall section allowing public postings that owners of the profile can edit. For example, any user may be able to post on an empty profile wall, but a user must claim the location to own the profile (e.g., may minimize barriers to users posting comments on profile walls). - Names featured on the profile wall may be links to the user profiles on the map (e.g., giving an immediate sense for the location of admirers (or detractors) relative to user location). In one embodiment, an action (e.g., mouse-over) on a comment would highlight the comment user's house on the map and names linking to user profiles. The user interface view may also utilize the mapping interface to link comments to locations.
- For example, the various embodiments illustrate a comment announcing a garage sale, that is tied to a mappable location on the mapping interface. (e.g., allows people to browse references directly from people's profiles). In the various figures, an example display of the mapping interface is illustrated. In this example display, houses are shown in green, a church is shown in white, the red house shows the selected location and/or the profile owner's house, question marks indicate locations without profile owners, blue buildings are commercial locations, and the pink building represents an apartment complex.
- Houses with stars indicate people associated with (e.g., “friends”) of the current user. In one embodiment, a user action (e.g., mouse-over) on a commercial property displayed in the mapping interface may pull up a star (e.g., “***) rating based on user reviews, and/or a link to the profile for the property. A mouse-over action on the apartment complex may pull up a building schematic for the complex with floor plans, on which the user can see friends/profiles for various floors or rooms. Question marks indicated in the display may prompt users to own that profile or post comments on the wall for that space. A user action on any house displayed in the mapping interface may pull up a profile link, summary info such as status, profession, interests, etc. associated with the profile owner, a link to add the person as a friend, and/or a link to send a message to the user (e.g., the profile owner).
- In another embodiment, a default profile view shown is that of the current user (e.g., logged in), and if the user clicks on any other profile, it may show their profile in that space instead (with few text changes to indicate different person). The events in your area view of the profile display in may have a default radius for notification of events (e.g., by street, by block, by neighborhood, county, etc.) Events are associated with user profiles and may link to locations displayed on the mapping interfaces. The hot picks section may be an ad/promotional zone, with default settings for radius of alerts also configurable.
- For example, the “Find a Friend” section may permit users to search by name, address, interests, status, profession, favorite movies/music/food etc. Users are also able to search within a given radius of their location. In one embodiment, the user interface view may include a link for the user to invite other people to join the network (e.g., may encourage users who see a question-mark on a house or a location on the mapping interface that corresponds to a real location associated with someone they know to contact that person and encourage them to join and own that profile through the social community module).
- Some of the reasons we believe these embodiments are unique include:
- Search engine that provides a visual map (e.g., rather than text) display of information relevant to user queries.
- Users can search on the map for other people having certain professional, educational, personal, extracurricular, cultural, political and/or family etc. profiles or interests, within any location range.
- Users can search for information on the map, that is accessible directly through profile displays. For example, the user may search for information about a certain subject and be directed to a profile of another user having information about the subject. Alternatively, the user may view the search subject itself as a visible item (e.g., if applicable to the search query) having a profile on the map display, along with additional information associated with the item (e.g., contributed by other users).
- Allows users to search, browse and view information posted by other users about an entity location such as a home, a business property, a condo, an apartment complex, etc. directly on a map display
- Allows users to browse, form and join groups and communities based on location, preferences, interests, friend requests, etc.
- Users can send messages to other people through their profiles within the map display
- Users can find friends, business associates, vendors, romantic partners, etc. on the map within any location range (e.g., in their neighborhood, street, subdivision, etc.) by browsing the map display or searching for people with certain profile characteristics and/or similar interests.
- Users can view, browse and post comments/information/reviews about entity locations and/or people associated with those locations (e.g., occupants of a house, families, apartment residents, businesses, non-governmental entities, etc.), even for locations that do not have a profile owner. For example, all entity locations visible on the map display may link to a profiles on which any user can post comments. To own the profile and edit the information posted about an entity location or the occupant(s), the occupant(s) would have to join the network associated with the social community module and become the owner of the profile. The profile owner would then become visible in the map display (e.g., entity locations without profile owners may only be visible as questions marks on the map, having blank profiles but public comment sections).
- Users can share their comments and opinions about locations, preferences and/or interests on their profiles that are visible and searchable on the map display
- Automatically notifies users of events and promotions in an area (e.g., scope of area can be selected by the user), and highlights venues and user profiles on the map.
- Users can post reviews about entity locations (e.g., businesses) such that ratings for entity locations are visible on the map. Other users can trace the location of the users that posted the comments on the map.
- Users who post comments on other profiles can be traced directly on the map through their comments. Alternatively, users can choose to submit anonymous postings or comments on other user/entity profiles, and/or may choose not to be traceable on the map through their comments.
- For entity locations having more than one residency unit (e.g., apartment complexes), people can create and post on profiles for any room/floor of the location (e.g., by entering information on a schematic view of the location that is visible on the map).
- Users can visually determine routes/directions/orientation to locations that they can browse within the map display. Additionally, users can generate written driving, walking or public transit directions between points of interest (e.g., from the user's house to a friend's house) within the map display.
- Users can communicate (e.g., through live chat) directly with other users in the area based on an association determined through their profiles
- Business entity locations can generate targeted ads and promotions within locations on the map display (e.g., virtual billboards).
- The social community module can realize revenue based on ad clickthroughs by users, without the users being directed away from the interface. For example, when a user clicks on any targeted ad/promotion displayed on the map, the profile of the entity associated with the ad/promotion may be generated alongside the map display.
- Neighborhood or neighborhood (see spelling differences) is a geographically localized community located within a larger city or suburb. The residents of a given neighborhood are called neighbors (or neighbors), although this term may also be used across much larger distances in rural areas.
- Traditionally, a neighborhood is small enough that the neighbors are all able to know each other. However in practice, neighbors may not know one another very well at all. Villages aren't divided into neighborhoods, because they are already small enough that the villagers can all know each other.
- The system however may work in any country and any geography of the world. In Canada and the United States, neighborhoods are often given official or semi-official status through neighborhood associations, neighborhood watches, or block watches. These may regulate such matters as lawn care and fence height, and they may provide such services as block parties, neighborhood parks, and community security. In some other places the equivalent organization is the parish, though a parish may have several neighborhoods within it depending on the area.
- In localities where neighborhoods do not have an official status, questions can arise as to where one neighborhood begins and another ends, such as in the city of Philadelphia, Pa. Many cities may use districts and wards as official divisions of the city, rather than traditional neighborhood boundaries.
- In the mainland of the People's Republic of China, the term is generally used for the urban administrative unit usually found immediately below the district level, although an intermediate, sub-district level exists in some cities. They are also called streets (administrative terminology may vary from city to city). Neighborhoods encompass 2,000 to 10,000 families. Within neighborhoods, families are grouped into smaller residential units or quarters of 100 to 600 families and supervised by a residents' committee; these are subdivided into residents' small groups of fifteen to forty families. In most urban areas of China, neighborhood, community, residential community, residential unit, residential quarter have the same meaning:
- The system and methods may be distributed through neighborhood associations. A neighborhood or neighborhood (see spelling differences) is a geographically localized community located within a larger city or suburb. The residents of a given neighborhood are called neighbors (or neighbors), although this term may also be used across much larger distances in rural areas.
- Traditionally, a neighborhood is small enough that the neighbors are all able to know each other. However in practice, neighbors may not know one another very well at all. Villages aren't divided into neighborhoods, because they are already small enough that the villagers can all know each other. Each of the technologies and concepts disclosed herein may be embodied in software and/or hardware through one or more of the modules/embodiments discussed in
FIGS. 1-28 . - A block party is a large public celebration in which many members of a single neighborhood congregate to observe a positive event of some importance. Many times, there will be celebration in the form of playing music and dance. Block parties gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s. Block Parties were often held outdoors and power for the DJ's sound system was taken illegally from street lights. This was famously referenced in the song “South Bronx” by KRS-One with the line:
- “Power from a street light made the place dark. But yo, they didn't care, they turned it out.” It is also interesting to note that many inner city block parties were actually held illegally, as they might be described as loitering. However, police turned a blind eye to them, reasoning that if everyone from the neighborhood was gathered in one place there was less chance of crime being committed elsewhere.
- In the suburbs, block parties are commonly held on holidays such as Fourth of July or Labor Day. Sometimes the occasion may be a theme such a “Welcome to the Neighborhood” for a new family or a recent popular movie. Often block parties involve barbecuing, lawn games such as Simon Says and group dancing such as the Electric Slide, the Macarena or line dancing.
- In other usage, a block party has come to mean any informal public celebration. For example, a block party can be conducted via television even though there is no real block in the observance. The same is true for the Internet. The block party is closely related to the beach party. The British equivalent is the street party.
- The systems and methods illustrated in
FIGS. 1-28 may have software to emulate a block party or a neighborhood watch. A neighborhood watch (also called a crime watch or neighborhood crime watch) is a citizens' organization devoted to crime and vandalism prevention within a neighborhood. It is not a vigilante organization, since members are expected not to directly intervene in possible criminal activity. Instead, neighborhood watch members are to stay alert to unusual activity and contact the authorities. It builds on the concept of a town watch from Colonial America. - The current American system of neighborhood watches began developing in the late 1960s as a response to the rape and murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens, N.Y. People became outraged that three dozen witnesses did nothing to save Genovese or to apprehend her killer. Some locals formed groups to watch over their neighborhoods and to look out for any suspicious activity in their areas. Shortly thereafter, the National Sheriffs' Association began a concerted effort in 1972 to revitalize the “watch group” effort nationwide.

- The various methods, systems, and apparatuses disclosed herein and illustrated and described using the attached
FIGS. 1-28 can be applied to creating online community organizations of neighborhoods of any form. During human growth and maturation, people encounter sets of other individuals and experiences. Infants encounter first, their immediate family, then extended family, and then local community (such as school and work). They thus develop individual and group identity through associations that connect them to life-long community experiences. - As people grow, they learn about and form perceptions of social structures. During this progression, they form personal and cultural values, a world view and attitudes toward the larger society. Gaining an understanding of group dynamics and how to “fit in” is part of socialization. Individuals develop interpersonal relationships and begin to make choices about whom to associate with and under what circumstances.
- During adolescence and adulthood, the individual tends to develop a more sophisticated identity, often taking on a role as a leader or follower in groups. If associated individuals develop the intent to give of themselves, and commit to the collective well-being of the group, they begin to acquire a sense of community.
- Socialization: The process of learning to adopt the behavior patterns of the community is called socialization. The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which individuals develop the skills and knowledge and learn the roles necessary to function within their culture and social environment. For some psychologists, especially those in the psychodynamic tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of 1 and 10. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.
- Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community norms. Other important influences include school, peer groups, mass media, the workplace and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of tolerance, reciprocity and trust are important “habits of the heart,” as de Tocqueville put it, in an individual's involvement in community.
- Continuity of the connections between leaders, between leaders and followers, and among followers is vital to the strength of a community. Members individually hold the collective personality of the whole. With sustained connections and continued conversations, participants in communities develop emotional bonds, intellectual pathways, enhanced linguistic abilities, and even a higher capacity for critical thinking and problem-solving. It could be argued that successive and sustained contact with other people might help to remove some of the tension of isolation, due to alienation, thus opening creative avenues that would have otherwise remained impassable.
- Conversely, sustained involvement in tight communities may tend to increase tension in some people. However, in many cases, it is easy enough to distance oneself from the “hive” temporarily to ease this stress. Psychological maturity and effective communication skills are thought to be a function of this ability. In nearly every context, individual and collective behaviors are required to find a balance between inclusion and exclusion; for the individual, a matter of choice; for the group, a matter of charter. The sum of the creative energy (often referred to as “synergy”) and the strength of the mechanisms that maintain this balance is manifest as an observable and resilient sense of community.
- McMillan and Chavis (1986) identify four elements of “sense of community”: 1) membership, 2) influence, 3) integration and fulfillment of needs, and 4) shared emotional connection. They give the following example of the interplay between these factors: Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members). Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).
- A Sense of Community Index (SCI) has been developed by Chavis and his colleagues (1986). Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace and a variety of types of communities.
- Communitarianism as a group of related but distinct philosophies (or ideologies) began in the late 20th century, opposing classical liberalism, capitalism and socialism while advocating phenomena such as civil society. Not necessarily hostile to social liberalism, communitarianism rather has a different emphasis, shifting the focus of interest toward communities and societies and away from the individual. The question of priority, whether for the individual or community, must be determined in dealing with pressing ethical questions about a variety of social issues, such as health care, abortion, multiculturalism, and hate speech.
- Effective communication practices in group and organizational settings are important to the formation and maintenance of communities. How ideas and values are communicated within communities are important to the induction of new members, the formulation of agendas, the selection of leaders and many other aspects. Organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within organizational structures. Group members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting. Although organizational communication, as a field of study, is usually geared toward companies and business groups, these may also be seen as communities. The principles can also be applied to other types of communities.
- If the sense of community exists, both freedom and security exist as well. The community then takes on a life of its own, as people become free enough to share and secure enough to get along. The sense of connectedness and formation of social networks comprise what has become known as social capital.
- Azadi Tower is a town square in modern Iran. Social capital is defined by Robert D. Putnam as “the collective value of all social networks (who people know) and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (norms of reciprocity).” Social capital in action can be seen in groups of varying formality, including neighbors keeping an eye on each others' homes. However, as Putnam notes in Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (2000), social capital has been falling in the United States. Putnam found that over the past 25 years, attendance at club meetings has fallen 58 percent, family dinners are down 33 percent, and having friends visit has fallen 45 percent.
- Western cultures are thus said to be losing the spirit of community that once were found in institutions including churches and community centers. Sociologist Ray Oldenburg states in The Great Good Place that people need three places: 1) The home, 2) the workplace, and, 3) the community hangout or gathering place.
- With this philosophy in mind, many grassroots efforts such as The Project for Public Spaces are being started to create this “Third Place” in communities. They are taking form in independent bookstores, coffeehouses, local pubs and through many innovative means to create the social capital needed to foster the sense and spirit of community.
- Community development is often formally conducted by universities or government agencies to improve the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. Less formal efforts, called community building or community organizing, seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities. These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions.
- Formal programs conducted by universities are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in sociology and community studies. The General Social Survey from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the Saguaro Seminar at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University are examples of national community development in the United States. In The United Kingdom, Oxford University has led in providing extensive research in the field through its Community Development Journal, used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.
- At the intersection between community development and community building are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of Northwestern University. The institute makes available downloadable tools to assess community assets and make connections between non-profit groups and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by “mobilizing neighborhood assets”—building from the inside out rather than the outside in.
- Community building and organizing: M. Scott Peck is of the view that the almost accidental sense of community which exists at times of crisis, for example in New York City after the attacks of Sep. 11, 2001, can be consciously built. Peck believes that the process of “conscious community building” is a process of building a shared story, and consensual decision making, built upon respect for all individuals and inclusivity of difference. He is of the belief that this process goes through four stages:
- Pseudo-community: Where participants are “nice with each other”, playing-safe, and presenting what they feel is the most favorable sides of their personalities. Chaos: When people move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their “shadow” selves. This stage places great demands upon the facilitator for greater leadership and organization, but Peck believes that “organizations are not communities”, and this pressure should be resisted.
- Emptying: This stage moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to us all as human beings. Out of this emptying comes
- Authentic community: the process of deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community. This stage Peck believes can only be described as “glory” and reflects a deep yearning in every human soul for compassionate understanding from one's fellows.
- More recently Scott Peck has remarked that building a sense of community is easy. It is maintaining this sense of community that is difficult in the modern world. The Ithaca Hour is an example of community-based currency. Community building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events such as potlucks and small book clubs to larger-scale efforts such as mass festivals and construction projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors. Some communities have developed their own “Local Exchange Trading Systems” (LETS) and local currencies, such as the Ithaca Hours system, to encourage economic growth and an enhanced sense of community.
- Community building that is geared toward activism is usually termed “community organizing.” In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, boycotting, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. The ARISE Detroit! coalition and the Toronto Public Space Committee are examples of activist networks committed to shielding local communities from government and corporate domination and inordinate influence.
- Community organizing is sometimes focused on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage consensus decision-making with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group.
- The three basic types of community organizing are grassroots organizing, coalition building, and faith-based community organizing (also called “institution-based community organizing,” “broad-based community organizing” or “congregation-based community organizing”).
- Community service is usually performed in connection with a nonprofit organization, but it may also be undertaken under the auspices of government, one or more businesses, or by individuals. It is typically unpaid and voluntary. However, it can be part of alternative sentencing approaches in a justice system and it can be required by educational institutions.
- The most common usage of the word “community” indicates a large group living in close proximity. Examples of local community include: A municipality is an administrative local area generally composed of a clearly defined territory and commonly referring to a town or village. Although large cities are also municipalities, they are often thought of as a collection of communities, due to their diversity.
- A neighborhood is a geographically localized community, often within a larger city or suburb. A planned community is one that was designed from scratch and grew up more or less following the plan. Several of the world's capital cities are planned cities, notably Washington, D.C., in the United States, Canberra in Australia, and Brasilia in Brazil. It was also common during the European colonization of the Americas to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of earlier Amerindian cities. Identity: In some contexts, “community” indicates a group of people with a common identity other than location. Members often interact regularly. Common examples in everyday usage include: A “professional community” is a group of people with the same or related occupations. Some of those members may join a professional society, making a more defined and formalized group.
- These are also sometimes known as communities of practice. A virtual community is a group of people primarily or initially communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies, typically over the Internet, rather than in person. These may be either communities of interest, practice or communion. (See below.) Research interest is evolving in the motivations for contributing to online communities.
- Some communities share both location and other attributes. Members choose to live near each other because of one or more common interests. A retirement community is designated and at least usually designed for retirees and seniors—often restricted to those over a certain age, such as 55. It differs from a retirement home, which is a single building or small complex, by having a number of autonomous households.
- An intentional community is a deliberate residential community with a much higher degree of social interaction than other communities. The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social, political or spiritual vision and share responsibilities and resources. Intentional communities include Amish villages, ashrams, cohousing, communes, ecovillages, housing cooperatives, kibbutzim, and land trusts.
- Special nature of human community Music in Central Park, a public space. Definitions of community as “organisms inhabiting a common environment and interacting with one another,” while scientifically accurate, do not convey the richness, diversity and complexity of human communities. Their classification, likewise is almost never precise. Untidy as it may be, community is vital for humans. M. Scott Peck expresses this in the following way: “There can be no vulnerability without risk; there can be no community without vulnerability; there can be no peace, and ultimately no life, without community.” This conveys some of the distinctiveness of human community.
