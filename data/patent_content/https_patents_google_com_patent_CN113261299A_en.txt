Description
Background
This specification relates to data processing and analysis of media. The internet provides access to media that can be uploaded by virtually any user, e.g., streaming media. For example, a user may create and upload a video file and/or an audio file to a media sharing site. Some sites that publish or distribute content for third parties (e.g., not administrators of the website) require users to comply with a set of content criteria, also referred to as content criteria, in order to share media on their site or to distribute content on behalf of these third parties. These content criteria may include policies relating to content that is not suitable for sharing on a site and therefore is not eligible for distribution.
Disclosure of Invention
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of: determining, using a first evaluation rule, a likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material; passing the content to a set of rating entities for further evaluation based on the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material, comprising: passing the unmodified version of the content to the set of rating entities when the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material is below a specified modification threshold; and when the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material is above a specified modification threshold: modifying the content to reduce delineation of objectionable material; and passing the modified content to a set of rating entities; receiving evaluation feedback from the set of rating entities indicating whether the content violates the content criteria; and formulating a distribution strategy based on the evaluation feedback, including: preventing distribution of the content when the evaluation feedback indicates that the content violates the content criterion; and distributing the content when the evaluation feedback indicates that the content does not violate the content criterion. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding methods, apparatus, and computer programs, encoded on computer storage devices, configured to perform the actions of the methods. These and other embodiments may optionally include one or more of the following features, respectively.
Formulating a distribution policy may include formulating a geography-based distribution policy that specifies different distribution policies for different geographic regions. The method can comprise the following steps: determining, based on the evaluation feedback, that the content violates a first content criterion for a first geographic region but does not violate a second content criterion for a second geographic region, wherein: preventing distribution of the content when the evaluation feedback indicates that the content violates the content criterion includes: preventing distribution of the content in the first geographic area based on a violation of the first content criterion; and distributing the content when the evaluation feedback indicates that the content does not violate the content criterion comprises: based on the content not violating the second content criteria, the content is distributed in the second geographic region regardless of whether the content violates the first content criteria of the first geographic region.
The method may include generating a set of rating entities, including: determining one or more entity attributes in the first context that are deemed to require consensus among the set of rated entities; and creating a set of rated entities to include only entities having one or more entity attributes that are deemed necessary to achieve consensus among the set of rated entities in a particular context.
The method can comprise the following steps: generating a second set of rated entities that do not have at least one of the one or more entity attributes; obtaining assessment feedback from the second set of rating entities indicating whether the content violates the content criteria; and determining whether the one or more entity attributes require consensus based on the evaluation feedback obtained from the second set of rated entities, comprising: determining that one or more attributes require consensus to be achieved when the evaluation feedback obtained from the second set of rated entities is different from the evaluation feedback received from the set of entities; and determining that the one or more attributes do not require consensus when the evaluation feedback obtained from the second set of rated entities matches the evaluation feedback received from the set of entities.
The method can comprise the following steps: parsing the content into smaller portions of the content, each portion comprising less than all of the content, wherein: passing the content to the set of rating entities for further evaluation includes: passing each smaller portion of the content to a different subset of entities from the set of entities for parallel evaluation; and receiving evaluation feedback indicating whether the content violates the content criterion comprises: separate feedback for each smaller portion is received from different subsets of entities to which the smaller portion is communicated.
The method can comprise the following steps: the amount of content delivered to the set of rating entities is limited. Limiting the amount of content delivered to the set of rating entities may include: for each different entity in the set of entities: determining an amount of content that has been delivered to a different entity within a pre-specified amount of time; determining a bad score that quantifies an extent of inadequacy of content that has been delivered to different entities within a pre-specified amount of time; and preventing the additional content from being delivered to the different entity when (i) an amount of content that has been delivered to the different entity within a pre-specified amount of time exceeds a threshold amount or (ii) the impairment score exceeds a maximum acceptable impairment score.
Determining the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material may include: automatically ranking entities using one or more of a skin detection algorithm, a blood detection algorithm, an object identification analysis, or a voice recognition analysis is performed by one or more data processors.
Modifying the content to reduce the delineation of the objectionable material may include any one of blurring, pixelating, or muting a portion of the content.
Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. For example, the techniques discussed throughout this document enable computer systems to utilize a hierarchical evaluation process that reduces the risk of inappropriate content being distributed to users, while also reducing the amount of time required to evaluate the content so that distribution of the content can occur more quickly. That is, inappropriate content may be more accurately filtered before being presented to the public. The discussed techniques may also reduce the psychological impact of the presentation of objectionable content on the rating entity and/or the user by modifying the content and/or dividing the content into smaller sub-portions and providing each sub-portion to a different rating entity prior to presenting the content to the rating entity. The discussed techniques may also enable real-time evaluation of user-generated content prior to public distribution of the content, while also enabling rapid publication of the content by dividing the duration of the content (e.g., video) into smaller durations and having each smaller duration evaluated simultaneously, thereby reducing the total time required to evaluate the entire duration of the content. The techniques may also determine whether the classification of the evaluated content varies on a geographic basis or a user-specific basis based on characteristics of the rating entity and its respective classification of the evaluated content, which may be used to block or allow content distribution on a per geographic area basis and/or on a per user basis. That is, aspects of the disclosed subject matter address the technical problem of providing an improved content filtering approach.
Another innovative aspect of the subject matter relates to a system that includes a data store that stores one or more evaluation rules; and one or more data processors configured to interact with the one or more evaluation rules and to perform the operations of any of the methods disclosed herein.
Another innovative aspect of the present subject matter relates to a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more data processing apparatus, cause the one or more data processing apparatus to perform operations comprising any of the methods disclosed herein.
Optional features of the various aspects may be combined with other aspects, as appropriate.
The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
This document discloses methods, systems, apparatuses, and computer-readable media for facilitating analysis of media items or other content and enforcement of content distribution policies. In some implementations, a hierarchical evaluation process is used to reduce the risk of inappropriate content being distributed to users, while also reducing the amount of time required to evaluate the content. As discussed in more detail below, a hierarchical evaluation process is implemented using a multi-level content evaluation and distribution system. Techniques may be implemented that improve the ability to identify inappropriate content prior to distribution of inappropriate content, while also reducing the negative impact that inappropriate content may have on rating entities reviewing and/or providing feedback as to whether the content violates content criteria. For example, as discussed in more detail below, when the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material is high, the content may be modified in one or more ways to reduce the depiction of the objectionable material. In some cases, the depiction of objectionable material may be diminished by pixelating the content or shortening the duration of the content during the evaluation of the content by the rating entity. This reduction in delineation of the objectionable material reduces the negative psychological impact of the objectionable material on the rating entity.
As used throughout this document, the phrases "content" and "media" refer to discrete units of digital content or digital information (e.g., video clips, audio clips, multimedia clips, images, text, or other units of content). The content may be electronically stored in the physical memory device as a single file or a collection of files, and the content may take the form of a video file, an audio file, a multimedia file, an image file, or a text file, and may include advertising information. Content can be provided for distribution by various entities, and a content distribution system can distribute content to various sites and/or native applications for many different content generators (also referred to as content creators).
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which digital components are distributed for presentation with an electronic document. The example environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. The network 102 connects an electronic document server 104, a client device 106, a media generator 107, a media server 108, and a media distribution system 110 (also referred to as a Content Distribution System (CDS)). The example environment 100 may include many different electronic document servers 104, client devices 106, media generators 107, and media servers 108.
The client device 106 is an electronic device capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102. Example client devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. The client device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate sending and receiving data over the network 102, although a native application executed by the client device 106 may also facilitate sending and receiving data over the network 102.
An electronic document is data that presents a set of content on a client device 106. Examples of electronic documents include web pages, word processing documents, Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, images, videos, search result pages, and feeds. Native applications (e.g., "apps"), such as applications installed on mobile devices, tablets, or desktop computer devices, are also examples of electronic documents. The Electronic document may be provided to the client device 106 through an Electronic document Server 104 ("Electronic Doc Server"). For example, the electronic document server 104 may include a server hosting a publisher's website. In this example, the client device 106 may initiate a request for a given publisher web page, and the electronic document server 104 hosting the given publisher web page may respond to the request by sending machine-executable instructions that initiate rendering of the given web page at the client device 106.
In another example, the electronic document server 104 may include an application server from which the client device 106 may download applications. In this example, the client device 106 may download files needed to install the application at the client device 106 and then execute the downloaded application locally. The downloaded application may be configured to present local content that is part of the application itself, as well as a combination of media that is generated outside the application (e.g., by media generator 107) and presented within the application.
The electronic document may include various contents. For example, the electronic document may include static content (e.g., text or other specified content) within the electronic document itself and/or that does not change over time. The electronic document may also include dynamic content that may change over time or on a per-request basis. For example, a publisher of a given electronic document may maintain a data source that is used to populate various portions of the electronic document. In this example, the given electronic document may include a tag or script that causes the client device 106 to request content from the data source when the given electronic document is processed (e.g., rendered or executed) by the client device 106. The client device 106 integrates the content obtained from the data source into a given electronic document to create a composite electronic document that includes the content obtained from the data source.
In some cases, a given electronic document may include a media tag or media script that references the media distribution system 110. In these cases, the media tag or media script is executed by the client device 106 when a given electronic document is processed by the client device 106. Execution of the media tag or media script configures the client device 106 to generate a media request 112, the media request 112 being transmitted to the media distribution system 110 over the network 102. For example, the media tag or media script may enable the client device 106 to generate a packetized data request including a header and payload data. The media request 112 may include event data that specifies characteristics, such as the name (or network location) of the server from which the media was requested, the name (or network location) of the requesting device (e.g., client device 106), and/or information that the media distribution system 110 may use to select one or more media items (e.g., different portions of media) that are provided in response to the request. The client device 106 transmits the media request 112 to a server of the media distribution system 110 over the network 102 (e.g., a telecommunications network).
The media request 112 may include event data specifying other event characteristics, such as characteristics of the requested electronic document and the location of the electronic document on which the media may be presented. For example, a reference (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) specifying an electronic document (e.g., a web page or application) in which media is to be presented, available locations of electronic documents available for presenting media, sizes of available locations, and/or event types that qualify for media types presented in those locations may be provided to media distribution system 110. Similarly, event data specifying keywords associated with the electronic document ("document keywords") or entities referenced by the electronic document (e.g., "people," "places," or "things") may also be included in the media request 112 (e.g., as payload data) and provided to the media distribution system 110 to facilitate identification of media that is eligible for presentation with the electronic document. The event data may also include search queries submitted from the client devices 106 to obtain search result pages (e.g., standard search result pages or media search result pages that present search results for audio and/or video media), and/or data specifying search results and/or textual, auditory, or other visual content included in the search results.
The media request 112 may also include event data related to other information, such as information that a user of the client device has provided, geographic information indicating a status or area in which the component request was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the digital component is to be displayed (e.g., time of day of the component request, day of the week of the component request, type of device on which the digital component is to be displayed, such as a mobile device or tablet device). Media request 112 may be transmitted, for example, over a packet-based network, and media request 112 itself may be formatted as packet-based data with a header and payload data. The header may specify the destination of the packet and the payload data may include any of the information discussed above.
The media distribution system 110, which includes one or more media distribution servers, selects a media item to be presented with a given electronic document in response to receiving a media request 112 and/or using information included in the media request 112. In some implementations, the media item is selected in less than one second to avoid errors that may result from delayed selection of the media item. For example, the delay in providing media in response to the media request 112 may result in a page loading error at the client device 106, or even cause portions of the electronic document to remain unfilled after other portions of the electronic document are presented at the client device 106. Moreover, as the delay in providing media to the client device 106 increases, the electronic document is more likely to no longer be presented on the client device 106 when the media is delivered to the client device 106, thereby negatively impacting the user's experience with the electronic document. Further, for example, if the electronic document is no longer presented at the client device 106 when the media is provided, the delay in providing the media may cause the delivery of the media to fail.
In some implementations, the media distribution system 110 is implemented in a distributed computing system that includes, for example, a server and a collection of multiple computing devices 114 that are interconnected and that identify and distribute digital components in response to media requests 112. The collection of multiple computing devices 114 operate together to identify a collection of media items from a corpus of millions of available media items (MI1-x) that qualify for presentation in an electronic document. For example, an index may be built in the media item database 116 for millions of available media items. Each media item index entry may reference a corresponding media item and/or include distribution parameters (DP1-DPx) that facilitate (e.g., set conditions or limits) distribution/transmission of the corresponding media item. For example, the distribution parameters may facilitate transmission of the media item by requiring that the media request include at least one criterion that matches (e.g., completely matches or has some pre-specified degree of similarity to) one of the distribution parameters of the media item.
In some implementations, the distribution parameters for a particular media item can include distribution keywords that must be matched (e.g., by an electronic document, document keyword, or term specified in the media request 112) in order for the media item to qualify for presentation. The distribution parameters may also require that the media request 112 include information specifying a particular geographic area (e.g., country or state) and/or information specifying that the media request 112 originates from a particular type of client device (e.g., mobile device or tablet device) in order to qualify the media item for presentation. The distribution parameters may also specify qualification values (e.g., ranking scores or other specified values) for evaluating eligibility of the media item for distribution/transmission (e.g., among other available digital components), as discussed in more detail below. In some cases, the eligibility value may specify an amount to submit when a particular event is attributed to a media item (e.g., when an application is installed on a client device through interaction with or attributable to a presentation of the media item).
The identification of eligible media items may be segmented into multiple tasks 117a-117c, which are then distributed among the computing devices within the collection 114 of multiple computing devices. For example, different computing devices in the collection 114 may each analyze different portions of the media item database 116 to identify individual media items having distribution parameters that match information included in the media request 112. In some implementations, each given computing device in the set 114 can analyze a different data dimension (or set of dimensions) and communicate (e.g., send) the results of the analysis (Res 1-Res 3)118a-118c back to the media distribution system 110. For example, the results 118a-118c provided by each computing device in the collection 114 may identify a subset of media items that are eligible for distribution in response to a media request and/or a subset of media items having certain distribution parameters. The identification of the subset of media items may include: for example, the event data is compared to distribution parameters, and a subset of media items having distribution parameters that match at least some characteristics of the event data is identified.
The media distribution system 110 aggregates the results 118a-118c received from the set of multiple computing devices 114 and uses information associated with the aggregated results to select one or more media items to be provided in response to the media request 112. For example, the media distribution system 110 may select a set of winning media items (one or more media items) based on the results of one or more media evaluation processes. In turn, the media system 110 may generate and transmit reply data 120 (e.g., digital data representing a reply) over the network 102 that enables the client device 106 to integrate the set of winning media items into a given electronic document such that the set of winning media items and the content of the electronic document are presented together on a display of the client device 106.
In some implementations, the client device 106 executes instructions included in the reply data 120 that configure and enable the client device 106 to obtain a set of winning media items from the one or more media servers 108. For example, the instructions in the reply data 120 may include a network location (e.g., a URL) and a script that causes the client device 106 to transmit a Server Request (SR)121 to the media server 108 to obtain a given winning media item from the media server 108. In response to the server request 121, the media server 108 will identify the given winning media item specified in the server request 121 (e.g., in a database storing a plurality of media items) and transmit media item data (MI data) 122 to the client device 106, the media item data (MI data) 122 presenting the given winning media item in an electronic document at the client device 106.
To facilitate searching of electronic documents, the environment 100 can include a search system 150, the search system 150 identifying electronic documents by crawling and indexing the electronic documents (e.g., indexing based on content of the crawled electronic documents). Data about the electronic document may be indexed based on the electronic document with which the data is associated. The indexed and (optionally) cached copies of the electronic documents are stored in the search index 152 (e.g., hardware memory device (s)). The data associated with the electronic document is data representing content included in the electronic document and/or metadata for the electronic document.
The client device 106 may submit a search query to the search system 150 over the network 102. In response, the search system 150 accesses the search index 152 to identify electronic documents that are relevant to the search query. The search system 150 identifies the electronic document in the form of search results and returns the search results to the client device 106 in a search results page. The search results are data generated by the search system 150 that identifies electronic documents that are responsive to (e.g., relevant to) a particular search query and that includes active links (e.g., hypertext links) that cause the client device to request the data from a specified location in response to user interaction with the search results. Example search results may include a web page title, a text snippet or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and a URL of the web page. Another example search result may include a title of the downloadable application, a text snippet depicting the downloadable application, an image depicting a user interface of the downloadable application, and/or a URL from which the application may be downloaded to a location of the client device 106. Another example search result may include a title of the streaming media, a text segment describing the streaming media, an image depicting the content of the streaming media, and/or a URL of a location from which the streaming media may be downloaded to the client device 106. Similar to other electronic documents, the search results page may include one or more slots in which digital components (e.g., advertisements, video clips, audio clips, images, or other digital components) may be presented.
The Media items may be generated by the Media generator 107 and uploaded to the Media server 108 in the form of a Media upload (Media UL) 160. The media upload 160 may take the form of a file transfer, such as a transfer of an existing video file, image file, or audio file. Alternatively or additionally, the media upload may take the form of "live streaming" or "real-time streaming capture". Live-stream and real-time stream capture may differ from file transfer in that these types of media uploads can typically occur in real-time as the media is captured, i.e., without first recording the media locally and then uploading the media via file transfer.
To facilitate the analysis of the media, the media distribution system 110 includes an evaluation device 170. As discussed in more detail below, the evaluation device 170 implements a hierarchical media review technique that uses a combination of machine automated review entities and field review entities. The automated reviewing entity may determine a likelihood that content (e.g., media items) uploaded by the media generator 107 depicts objectionable material (e.g., objectionable content that violates specified content criteria or social criteria based on a given community of users). As discussed in more detail below, some (or all) of the content reviewed by the machine automated review entity is passed to the field review entity to further analyze whether the content depicts objectionable material.
In some implementations, a set of rating entities that are to provide a given portion of content may be selected in a manner that ensures that a consensus can be reached regarding the classification of the content (e.g., at least a specified portion or percentage of the rating entities in the group agree on a classification for the content). In some cases, this means that the evaluation means 170 selects a different set of rating entities based on geographical location (or another distinguishing feature) to determine whether the content depicts material that is considered objectionable in one geographical area but acceptable in another geographical area. In some cases, the evaluation apparatus 170 may add additional rating entities to a particular set of rating entities if the use of the initially selected set of rating entities does not agree on the appropriateness of the content. Further, the evaluation device 170 may modify the content in the event that one or more previous evaluations of the content indicate that the content is highly likely (but not certain) to include objectionable material. For example, the evaluation device may blur, pixilate, mute, or attenuate the content to reduce the impact of the potentially objectionable material on any subsequent rating entities exposed to the suspect content. The modified content is then provided to other rating entities for further analysis and/or evaluation.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of an example hierarchical media evaluation process 200 that may be implemented by the evaluation device 170. The evaluation process 200 is hierarchical (or multi-tiered) in nature in that it begins with an initial analysis of content by a first set of rating entities 210, and subsequent actions and/or analysis of the content are performed by a different set of rating entities (e.g., rating entities 220 and/or rating entities 230) based on feedback obtained from the initial analysis. Similarly, different actions and/or further analysis may be performed at each subsequent level of the hierarchical review process. For example, during an initial analysis (e.g., a highest or first level of a hierarchical review process), media may be analyzed and/or evaluated for a first set of content criteria (e.g., originality, violence, and/or adult material), while media may be analyzed or evaluated for a second set of content criteria (e.g., sound quality, video quality, and/or accuracy of media description) at a lower level (e.g., a second level) of the hierarchical review process. As discussed in more detail below, various aspects of media evaluated at one level of the hierarchical review process may be re-evaluated at other levels of the hierarchical review process.
The process 200 may begin with the Content Distribution System (CDS)110 including the evaluating device 170 receiving a media upload 160 from the media generator 107. The media upload 160 includes content 202 that is evaluated by the evaluation device 170 prior to full public distribution (e.g., prior to publication to a video sharing site or distribution in a time slot of a web page or application). The content 202 may be video content, audio content, or a combination of video and audio content. The media upload may also include other information, such as a source of the media upload 160 (e.g., a media generator that submitted the media upload 160), descriptive information about the content 202 in the media upload, a target distribution site for the content 202, a timestamp of the time at which the media upload 160 was initiated, and/or a unique identifier for the content 202 included in the media upload 160.
Upon receiving the media upload 160, the evaluation device 170 triggers an initial evaluation of the content 202 according to a first evaluation rule. In some implementations, the evaluation device 170 triggers the initial evaluation by initially evaluating the content 202 using a first evaluation rule. In other implementations, the evaluation device 170 triggers the initial evaluation by passing the content 202 to the set of automatically rated entities 210.
The initial evaluation of the content 202 may be performed by the evaluation device 170 or the set of automated rating entities 210 using one or more algorithms and/or machine learning methods. The initial evaluation of the content 202 may include video analysis, skin detection algorithms, violence detection algorithms, object detection algorithms, and/or language detection algorithms. The output of the initial evaluation of the content 202 may be provided in the form of a likelihood of objectionable material 212. In some implementations, the likelihoods 212 of objectionable material are numerical values representing the overall likelihoods that the content 202 cannot meet the content criteria. For example, the likelihood of the objectionable material may be a number ranging from 0 to 10, where a number closer to 0 indicates that the content 202 has a determined lower likelihood of depicting the objectionable material and a number closer to 10 indicates that the content 202 has a determined higher likelihood of depicting the objectionable material. Of course, the likelihood of objectionable material 212 may be expressed using any suitable ratio. Examples of common objectionable materials that may be detected by the initial evaluation of the content 202 include pornography, cursing, and bloody scenes.
Using the determined likelihoods 212 of objectionable material, the evaluation device 170 may determine whether the content 202 is eligible for public distribution, needs further evaluation, or is ineligible for public distribution. In some implementations, this determination is made by comparing the likelihood of objectionable material 212 to one or more thresholds. For example, the evaluation device 170 may consider the content 202 as not eligible for public distribution when the likelihood of objectionable material 212 is greater than a specified threshold of objectionable (e.g., a number greater than 8 in the range of 0-10), and pass the content 202 to another set of rating entities (e.g., the rating entity 220) for further evaluation when the likelihood of objectionable material 212 is below the threshold of objectionable. In another example, the evaluation device 107 may consider the content 202 as eligible for public distribution when the likelihood of objectionable material 212 is below a specified safety threshold (e.g., in the range of 0-10, below 2), and pass the content 202 to another set of rating entities when the likelihood of objectionable material 212 is greater than the safety threshold. In yet another example, the evaluation device 170 may use the safety threshold and the aversion threshold as follows: when the likelihood 212 of objectionable material is between the security threshold and the objectionable threshold, the content 202 is simply passed to another set of rating entities. In some cases, the evaluation device 170 may pass the content 202 to another set of rating entities regardless of the likelihoods 212 of the objectionable material determined in the initial evaluation.
The likelihoods 212 of objectionable material may also be used to determine whether the content 202 should be modified before passing the content 202 to another set of rating entities. In some implementations, when the likelihood 212 of objectionable material is less than a specified modification threshold, the evaluation device 170 passes the content 202 to one or more other sets of rating entities without modification. However, when the likelihood of objectionable material 212 reaches (e.g., is equal to or greater than) the modification threshold, the evaluation device 170 may modify the content 202 before passing the content 202 to another set of rating entities (e.g., a set of rating entities in a second or other lower level of the hierarchical evaluation process). In some implementations, the assessment apparatus 170 can modify the content 202 by blurring, pixelating, or changing the color of the visual content, which reduces the psychological impact of the content 202 on the rating entity to which the content is delivered.
In some implementations, the evaluation device 170 passes the content 202 (modified or unmodified) to a set of rating entities 220 at one or more lower intermediate levels of the hierarchical evaluation process. The intermediate level set of rating entities 220 may be or may include human evaluators that are used to review the content of the objectionable material and/or services that have registered to provide content ratings based on certain incentives. In some implementations, the ratings entity is characterized by certain attributes. Example attributes may include age range, geographic location, online activity, and/or rating history of the human evaluator. The attributes of the rating entities may be submitted by the rating entities upon registration as rating entities. The rating history may indicate the type of content previously rated by the rating entity, the rating applied to the content, the relevance score between the previous rating and the overall rating of the content by the rating entity, and other information. The intermediate level set of rating entities 220 may be requested to evaluate the content with the same and/or different factors as considered in the initial evaluation.
The set of rating entities 220 at the intermediate level to which the content 202 is passed may be selected from a pool of rating entities. An intermediate level set of ratings entities 220 (also referred to as intermediate raters 220) may be selected in a manner that may provide a robust assessment of the content 202 based on the context of the content 202. For example, if the content 202 can only be accessed in a particular geographic region (e.g., a single country), the intermediate rater 220 may be chosen to include only rated entities from that particular geographic region. At the same time, the intermediate raters 220 may also be selected to provide diversity so that it can be revealed whether the content 202 is widely acceptable (or objectionable), and/or whether certain subgroups in the community differ in determining whether the content 202 is objectionable. For example, a particular set of intermediate raters 220 may include only rated entities located in the United states but having a diverse set of other attributes. Meanwhile, another intermediate rater set 220 may include only rated entities located in india but with diverse other attribute sets. In this example, the construction of different intermediate raters 220 may provide insight as to whether content 202 is generally considered objectionable in the united states and india, and may provide information as to how objectionable content 202 is considered to be different in the united states from india.
To facilitate these determinations, the evaluation device 170 communicates the content 202 to each of the selected intermediate raters 220 and receives evaluation feedback 222 from those intermediate raters 220. Content 202 may be passed to intermediate raters 220, for example, through a password-protected dedicated application or web page, such that access to content 202 is limited to only intermediate raters who have registered to rate the content.
The assessment feedback 222 received by the assessment device 170 may specify a score that indicates the degree to which the content 202 is objectionable. For example, by evaluating feedback, each intermediate rater 220 (or any other rating entity) may provide a score of 0 to 10, where 0 refers to the least objectionable material and 10 refers to the most objectionable material. In another example, the evaluation feedback may specify a vote in favor of or against which the content 202 is deemed objectionable. For example, a vote of "yes" with respect to content 202 may refer to a vote in which the content depicts objectionable material, while a vote of "no" with respect to content 202 may refer to a vote in which the content 202 does not depict objectionable material. The evaluation device 170 may use the evaluation feedback 222 to evaluate whether the content 202 violates one or more content criteria, as discussed in more detail below.
In some cases, the evaluation device 170 requests more detailed information from the rating entity in addition to whether the content 202 depicts objectionable material. For example, the evaluation device 170 may request information regarding the type of material depicted by the content 202 (e.g., adult themes, violence, fishy smell, drug usage, etc.), and may index the content 202 as the type of material depicted by the content, which helps determine whether the content 202 violates specified content criteria.
As discussed in more detail below, the evaluation device 170 may determine whether a consensus is achieved between the intermediate raters 220 (or other rating entities) that the content 202 depicts objectionable material or that the content 202 does not depict objectionable material. In some cases, whether consensus has been reached between the intermediate raters 220 may be determined based on the percentage of intermediate raters 220 that submitted matching assessment feedback. For example, if the evaluation feedback 222 submitted by all of the intermediate raters 220 (or at least some of the designated intermediate raters) indicates that the content 202 depicts objectionable material, the evaluation apparatus 170 may classify the content 202 as depicting objectionable material. Similarly, if the evaluation feedback 222 submitted by all of the intermediate raters 220 (or at least some of the designated intermediate raters) indicates that the content 202 does not depict objectionable content, the evaluation apparatus 170 may classify the content 202 as not depicting objectionable material. Further, the evaluation device 170 may continue to determine whether the content 202 meets the conditions for public distribution, needs further evaluation, or does not meet the conditions for public distribution in a manner similar to that described above. In addition, the evaluation device 170 may again determine whether the content should be modified before further distribution to additional rating entities (e.g., additional intermediate raters 220 or additional raters at another level of the hierarchy).
The evaluation device 170 may continue to pass the content 202 to additional sets of rating entities to collect additional evaluation feedback about the content 202. For example, after passing content 202 to an intermediate rater 220, the evaluation apparatus 170 may continue to pass content 202 to a set of common raters (also referred to as common raters) 230. The common rater 230 may be a rating entity that is not employed and has not registered to rate content. For example, a generic rater 230 may be a regular user to whom content 202 is presented, e.g., in a video sharing site, in a time slot of a web page or application, or in another online resource. Common raters 230 may be selected in a manner similar to that described above with reference to intermediate raters 220.
The presentation of the content 202 may include a request for assessment feedback 232 (e.g., ending with requesting the assessment feedback 232), and a control for submitting the assessment feedback. For example, the content 202 provided to the average rater 230 may be a 5 second video clip that ends with an end description 250 (e.g., final content presentation), the end description 250 asking the average rater 230 to specify how objectionable they rate the video clip. As shown, the average rater may select a number of stars to express how objectionable they are to the video clip. Other techniques may be used to solicit and obtain assessment feedback 232 from the general raters 230. For example, the end description 250 may ask the average rater 230 whether the video clip depicts violence or another type of content that may violate specified content criteria. Further, the assessment device 170 can follow more specific requests, such as reasons why the average rater 230 considered the content to be objectionable (e.g., violence, adult subject matter, heavy alcohol consumption, etc.), to obtain more detailed assessment feedback 232.
As discussed in more detail below, the evaluation device 170 may determine whether a consensus is achieved between the average raters 230 (or other rating entities) that the content 202 depicts objectionable material or that the content 202 does not depict objectionable material. In some cases, it may be determined whether consensus has been achieved between the common raters 230 in a manner similar to that described above with reference to the intermediate raters 220. Further, the evaluation device 170 may proceed to determine whether the content 202 meets the conditions for public distribution, needs further evaluation, or does not meet the conditions for public distribution in a manner similar to that described above. Furthermore, the evaluation means 170 may again determine whether the content should be modified before further distribution to additional rating entities.
At any point in the hierarchical evaluation process (e.g., at an intermediate rater level or a general rater level), the evaluation apparatus 170 may determine that no consensus has been reached between the rating entities. In response, the evaluation device 170 may modify the makeup of the rating entities to which the content 202 is passed to achieve consensus among the rating entities and/or determine similarities between subsets of rating entities that are submitting matching evaluation feedback. For example, while it may not be possible to agree on the initially selected set of intermediate raters 220 as a whole, analysis of the evaluation feedback 222 received from the intermediate raters 220 may reveal that intermediate raters 220 in one particular geographic region consistently classify content 202 as depicting objectionable material, while intermediate raters 220 in a different particular geographic region consistently classify content 202 as not depicting objectionable material. Such information may be used to determine how content 202 is distributed in different geographic areas and/or whether content alerts should be attached to the content. Modification of the set of rating entities will be discussed in more detail below.
The evaluation means 170 uses the evaluation feedback to determine whether the content 202 violates the content criterion. As discussed above, the content criteria specify that material depicted by media uploaded to a service that specifies the content criteria is not allowed. For example, a video sharing site may have content criteria that prohibit adult-themed content, while an advertisement distribution system may prohibit content depicting drug usage or extreme violence. In some implementations, the evaluation device 170 can compare the results of the evaluation feedback 222 and 232 and/or the initial evaluation to the content criteria to determine whether the content 202 depicts material prohibited by the content criteria. When the evaluation device 170 determines (e.g., based on the comparison) that the content 202 depicts material that is not permitted by the content criteria, the content 202 is deemed to violate the content criteria and distribution of the content 202 is prevented. When the evaluation device 170 determines (e.g., based on the comparison) that the content 202 does not depict material that is prohibited by the content criteria, the content 202 is deemed to be in compliance with the content criteria, and distribution of the content 202 may continue.
In some cases, the content criteria for a particular service will differ on a geographic basis or on some other basis. In these cases, the evaluation device 170 may formulate distribution policies on a per geographic area basis or on some other basis. For example, content depicting drug usage may be completely restricted/blocked in one geographic region and distributed with content alerts in another geographic region.
To facilitate the use of distribution policies on a per geographic area basis, the evaluation device 170 may create different sets of rating entities to evaluate content for different geographic areas. For example, the evaluation device 170 may create a first set of rating entities that evaluate the content 202 for geographic area a and a second set of rating entities that evaluate the content 202 for geographic area B. In some implementations, the rating entities in the first set may all be located in geographic area a, while the rating entities in the second set may all be located in geographic area B. This delineation of rating entities in each group ensures that the feedback assessment received from each group will accurately reflect the rating entities' assessment of the content 202 in the relevant geographic region. Alternatively or additionally, the ratings entities in each group may be trained or learned about content criteria for the respective geographic area and provide evaluation feedback consistent with the content criteria.
The evaluation means 170, upon receiving evaluation feedback from each of the two sets of rating entities, determines whether the content 202 violates any content criteria specific to the geographic area a or the geographic area B. For example, the evaluation device 170 may determine that the content 202 does not violate the content criterion for geo-location a, but violates the content criterion for geo-location B by evaluating the feedback. In this case, the evaluation device may distribute the content 202 to users in the geographic area a while preventing distribution of the content 202 in the geographic location B.
In some implementations, the evaluation of the content requires that the entities in the set of rating entities have a certain skill. For example, an audio clip in a particular language. To assess whether there are any vulgar words or comments in the audio clip that are considered objectionable, the ratings entity should be able to understand the particular language. In these implementations, information regarding the language spoken and/or understood by the ratings entity may be considered when forming the ratings entity set to ensure that the ratings entity can accurately determine whether the audio clip depicts an objectionable language.
More generally, to determine whether the content 202 depicts objectionable material that violates content criteria, the evaluation device 170 may determine attributes that a ratings entity needs to have in order to effectively analyze the content 202. For example, content may only be classified for a particular content criterion in dependence on a ratings entity that has been trained for the particular content criterion or has previously accurately classified the content. In this example, the evaluation device 170 may create a set of rating entities to include only those rating entities having an appropriate level of knowledge of the specified content criteria.
In some cases, the evaluation of the content 202 by the set of rating entities may not result in a consensus being reached as to the classification of the content 202 (e.g., whether the content depicts objectionable material). For example, the set of rating entities may differ in their classification of the content 202, which may be considered an impasse between the two cases where the content 202 is considered objectionable and the content 202 is not considered objectionable. In this case, the evaluation device 170 may add a new (e.g., additional rating entities) rating entity to the set of rating entities until consensus is achieved (e.g., some of the designated rating entities sort the content in the same manner).
FIG. 3 is a block diagram 300 depicting management of a set of rating entities 330, which may include: when no consensus is reached regarding the classification of the content, the rating entity is added to the set of rating entities 330. The collection of rated entities 330 is formed from a pool of rated entities 310 that can be used to analyze content. In some implementations, the set of rating entities 330 may be initially formed to include a diverse set of rating entities (e.g., from various different geographic regions), and evaluation feedback regarding a particular portion of content may be received from the initial set of rating entities. If consensus is reached based on evaluation feedback received from the initial set of rating entities, the evaluation means may proceed to formulate a distribution policy based on the evaluation feedback. When consensus is not achieved using the assessment feedback from the initial set of rating entities, the assessment apparatus may modify the set of rating entities in an effort to obtain consensus, as will be discussed in more detail below.
For purposes of example, assume that the evaluating device selects ratings entities R1-R6 to create ratings entity set 330. Ratings entities R1-R6 may be selected to have different attributes to create a diverse set of ratings entities to initially analyze a particular portion of content. For example, the ratings entity may be from at least two different geographic regions.
In this example, the evaluation device provides a particular portion of the content to each rating entity (e.g., R1-R6) in the set of rating entities 330 and receives evaluation feedback from each of those rating entities. It is assumed that the evaluation feedback received from the rating entity does not agree on the classification of a particular portion of the content. For example, assume that the assessment feedback from R1-R3 classifies content as depicting objectionable material, and the assessment feedback from R4-R6 classifies content as depicting non-objectionable material. In this case, the evaluation device may take action to attempt to reach consensus.
In some implementations, the evaluation device may add additional rating entities to the set of rating entities 330 in an attempt to reach a consensus regarding the classification of the content. For example, the rating entity R11 may be added to the set of rating entities 330 by the rating means, provide a particular portion of the content to R11, and receive rating feedback from R11. In this example, the assessment feedback from R11 will break the impasse, and the assessment means may simply consider consensus achieved based on the impasse, for example, by classifying content based on the assessment feedback from R11. However, in some embodiments, the evaluation device does not simply require a plurality of tickets to determine agreement. For example, the evaluation device may need to evaluate at least 70% (or another specified portion, e.g., 60%, 80%, 85%, 90%, etc.) of the feedback matches to consider reaching a consensus. Thus, to achieve consensus, the evaluation device may select more than one additional rating entity to be added to the set of rating entities 330.
When adding more rating entities to the set of rating entities 330 results in reaching a consensus, the evaluation device may classify the content based on the consensus and proceed to formulate a distribution policy based on the consensus. When adding more rating entities to the set of rating entities does not result in a consensus being achieved, the evaluation means may determine whether there are common attributes between those entities that have submitted matching evaluation feedback, and then take an action based on the determination.
Continuing the example above, assume that R1, R2, and R3 are all from geographic area A, and R4, R5, and R6 are all from geographic area B. In this example, the evaluation device may compare the attributes of the ratings entities and determine that all ratings entities from geographic area a classify the content as depicting objectionable material, while all ratings entities from geographic area B classify the content as depicting non-objectionable material. In this example, the evaluation device may formulate a per-geographic-area distribution policy in which content may be distributed in geographic area a and blocked from being distributed in geographic area B (or distributed with a content alert). Alternatively or additionally, the evaluation device may add additional rating entities to the set of rating entities to confirm the relevance between the geographical location of the rating entity and the evaluation feedback.
For example, the rating entity pool 310 may be searched by the evaluation device for additional rating entities located in geographic area A and additional rating entities located in geographic area B. Content may be provided to these other rating entities, and assessment feedback from these other rating entities may be analyzed to determine whether consensus has been achieved between rating entities from geographic area a and between rating entities from geographic area B. When consensus is reached between subsets of a set of rating entities, a geography-based distribution policy may be formulated, as discussed elsewhere herein.
The above example refers to identification of geographic-based differences in content classifications, however, the similarity of ratings entities between content classifications may be related to any number of ratings entity attributes. For example, a rating entity that has previously rated a particular type of content at least a specified number of times may rate the particular type of content (or another type of content) more similarly than a rating entity that has not rated the particular type of content frequently or at all. Similarly, the classification of content by the rating entity may differ based on the generation of the rating entity. For example, a baby boomer may have a very similar classification of a particular portion of content, but different from a millennium generation classification of a particular portion of content. As discussed in more detail below, the evaluation device may identify attributes that are common among those rating entities that submit matching evaluation feedback (e.g., submitting the same classification of a particular portion or type of content), and use those identified similarities in creating a set of rating entities to analyze additional content.
FIG. 4 is a block diagram 400 depicting managing a set of rated entities based on entity attributes. In FIG. 4, a set of rating entities that will analyze a portion of content will be created based on a pool of rating entities 410, which pool of rating entities 410 may include all rating entities available to analyze content. In some implementations, the set of rating entities is created by the evaluation device based on one or more attributes of the rating entities. For example, the evaluation means may use historical information on previous content analysis to determine attributes of rating entities deemed to need to agree between rating entities regarding the classification of the portion of content. More specifically, previous analysis of similar content may have revealed that the classification of the type of content to be rated may vary on a geographic basis, a generation basis, or an empirical basis. The evaluation apparatus may use information revealed from previous content analysis to create a different set of rating entities to evaluate the portion of content, which may provide context-specific classification for the portion of content (e.g., whether the content depicts objectionable content in a different context, such as when delivered to a different audience).
For purposes of example, assume that the evaluation device has determined that the portion of content to be analyzed by the ratings entity is related to a particular genre of content, and that a previous analysis of the content for the particular genre indicates that the evaluation feedback received regarding the content for the particular genre differs based on the geographic region and generation basis of the ratings entity. In this example, the evaluation device can use the historical information to create a plurality of rating entity sets that will evaluate the portion of content and facilitate developing distribution policies on a context basis (e.g., geographic region of distribution and/or likely or intended audience).
More specifically, the rating means may create a first set of rating entities 420 and a second set of rating entities 430, which will provide rating feedback for the portion of content, respectively. Continuing with the example above, the evaluation device may select those ratings entities from geographic area a and baby boomer from the entity community 410 and create a first set of ratings entities 420. For example, rated entities in dashed circle 425 have such a combination of attributes that the evaluation means includes these rated entities in the first set of rated entities 420. The evaluation device may also select those entities from the geographical area B and the millennium generation from the entity population 410. For example, rating entities within dashed circle 435 have such a combination of attributes that the evaluating device includes the rating entities in the first set of rating entities 430. In this example, the evaluation device creates the set of rating entities based on historical information indicating that these attributes are highly relevant to different classifications of content for a particular genre, such that creating the set of rating entities based on these attributes is deemed necessary to achieve consensus among the rating entities in each set. The evaluation means may also create a control set of rating entities or first create a diversified initial set of rating entities as discussed above and then determine the attributes needed to reach a consensus only if the consensus is not reached.
Continuing the example, the evaluation means provides content to each of the rating entities in the first 420 and second 430 sets of rating entities and obtains evaluation feedback from the rating entities. The rating means then determines how each set of rating entities classifies the content, e.g. based on a consensus of the rating feedback it receives from the rating entities in each set of rating entities 420, 430.
For purposes of example, assume that a first set of rating entities classifies the portion of content as depicting objectionable material deemed to violate content criteria, and a second set of rating entities classifies the portion of content as depicting objectionable material. In this example, the evaluation device may index the portion of content to the context of the classification (e.g., rating the geographic and generational attributes of the entity) as well as the classification itself. Indexing content in this manner enables the evaluation device to formulate a distribution strategy on a per context basis. For example, for a given distribution opportunity (e.g., a content request or a push message), the evaluation device may collect contextual information (e.g., geographic and/or generational information related to the intended audience) and distribute the content or prevent distribution based on the classification indexed to that particular context.
As discussed above, content that has been deemed to include objectionable content may be modified prior to further distribution to the ratings entity. In some implementations, the content is modified in a manner that reduces the negative impact of the content on the rating entity that is evaluating the content. For example, as discussed above, content may be pixilated or blurred visually and modified audibly to reduce volume, silence, beep, or reduce the presentation of audibly objectionable material (e.g., cursing, screaming, etc.). Additionally or alternatively, the content may be segmented such that less than the entire content is provided for each rating entity, referred to as a sub-portion of the content. In addition to reducing the impact of objectionable content on rating entities, the evaluation of content by different rating entities (e.g., parallel rating entities) evaluating sub-portions of the content may also be completed within a fraction of the time it takes for a single rating entity to evaluate the entire duration of the content, thereby reducing the delay in distributing the content due to the evaluation process.
FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting the distribution of sub-portions of content to a subset of rating entities. Fig. 5 depicts a video clip 510 having a length of 3 minutes to be evaluated by a set 520 of rating entities. The set of rating entities 520 may be created by the evaluation device using any suitable technique, including the techniques discussed above.
To facilitate faster evaluation of the video clip 510 and reduce the negative impact of objectionable content on rating entities in the set 520 of rating entities, the evaluation means may parse the video clip 510 into a plurality of different sub-portions and provide the different sub-portions to different subsets of rating entities in the set 510 of rating entities. The sub-portion of video clip 510 may have a duration that is less than the total duration of video clip 510. In FIG. 5, video clip 510 is parsed into three sub-portions 512, 514, and 516. Those different sub-portions 512, 514 and 516 may be passed to three different subsets 522, 524 and 526 of rating entities, respectively. For example, sub-portion 512 may be passed to subset 522, sub-portion 514 may be passed to subset 524, and sub-portion 516 may be passed to subset 526. In fig. 5, a video clip 3 minutes in length is divided into three portions, and each portion of the video clip has a duration of 1 minute. The duration of each sub-portion may be any suitable duration (e.g., 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, 1 minute, etc.). As discussed above, the evaluation means receives evaluation feedback for each of the sub-portions 512, 514 and 516 and determines whether the content violates any content criterion based on the evaluation feedback. In some implementations, the video clip 510 (or other content) is considered to violate the content criterion when the evaluation feedback for any of the sub-portions 512, 514, and 516 indicates that the content criterion was violated.
In some implementations, the evaluation device throttles the amount of content distributed to the rating entity, which may also reduce the negative impact of objectionable content on the rating entity. For example, the evaluation device may determine an amount of content distributed to the rating entity within a pre-specified amount of time and compare the determined amount to a threshold amount of time. The evaluation means will prevent further content from being distributed to the rating entity if the amount of content distributed to a particular rating entity within a pre-specified amount of time is greater than a threshold value. For example, if the pre-specified amount of time is 1 hour and the threshold amount of content is 15 images, the hierarchical evaluation process will distribute 15 or fewer images to a particular rating entity for evaluation in one hour.
In some implementations, content distributed to the rating entity is limited based on the bad score. In such an implementation, the bad score of the content quantifies the extent to which the content is distributed to the rating entity within a pre-specified amount of time. For example, the evaluation means may determine a bad score for content provided to a particular rating entity (or set of rating entities) based on the amount and/or strength of objectionable content that has been communicated to (or evaluated by) the particular rating entity. The bad score increases with the duration of the objectionable material and/or the strength of the objectionable material that has been communicated to the rating entity.
The strength of the objectionable material may be based on the type of objectionable material depicted (e.g., casualty drinking and extreme violent action), and each type of objectionable material may be mapped to an undesirable value. The combination of duration and intensity may result in an overall objectionable score for content that has been delivered to a particular rating entity. The overall impairment score may be compared to a specified maximum acceptable impairment score, and when the impairment score reaches the maximum acceptable impairment score, the evaluation device may prevent further distribution of the content to the particular rating entity until its impairment score falls below the maximum acceptable impairment score. In some embodiments, the bad fraction will decrease over time according to a decay function.
Fig. 6 is a flow diagram of an example multi-layered scalable media analysis process 600. The operations of process 600 may be performed by one or more data processing apparatus or computing devices, such as evaluation apparatus 170 discussed above. The operations of process 600 may also be implemented as instructions stored on a computer-readable medium. Execution of the instructions may cause one or more data processing apparatus or computing devices to perform the operations of process 600. The operations of process 600 may also be implemented by a system comprising one or more data processing apparatus or computing devices and a memory device storing instructions that cause the one or more data processing apparatus or computing devices to perform the operations of process 600.
The likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material is determined 602. In some implementations, determining the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material using the first evaluation rule. The first evaluation rule may include one or more content criteria and/or other rules that specify unacceptable content for distribution on the platform implementing process 600. For example, a first evaluation rule may specify that excessive violence and/or drug use may be a violation of content guidelines, which may prevent distribution of the content.
As discussed in detail above, in some implementations, the likelihood of objectionable material is a numerical value representing an overall likelihood that the content 202 does not meet the content criteria. For example, the likelihood of the objectionable material may be a number ranging from 0 to 10, where a number closer to 0 indicates that the content has a determined lower likelihood of depicting the objectionable material and a number closer to 10 indicates that the content has a higher likelihood of depicting the objectionable material.
In some implementations, the likelihood of objectionable material may be determined by an automated rating entity utilizing various content detection algorithms. For example, the automated rating entity may utilize skin detection algorithms, blood detection algorithms, object identification techniques, voice recognition techniques, and other suitable techniques to identify particular objects or attributes of the media items and classify the media items based on the analysis.
It is determined whether the likelihood is above a specified modification threshold (604). In some embodiments, the determination is made by comparing the likelihood to a modification threshold. The modification threshold is a value at which the content is deemed to include objectionable content. When the modification threshold is reached, it may be highly certain that the content includes objectionable content.
When the likelihood that the content depicts the objectionable material is above a specified threshold, the content is modified to attenuate the depiction of the objectionable material (606). As discussed above, the content may be modified, for example, by pixelating, blurring, or otherwise diminishing the vividness and/or clarity of the visually objectionable material. The content may also be modified by beeping, muting, reducing the volume, or attenuating the audible presentation of the objectionable audio content. In some implementations, the modification of the content may include parsing the content into sub-portions, as discussed in detail throughout this document. When the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable content is below a specified threshold, an unmodified version of the content may be maintained and analyzed, as discussed in more detail below.
A set of rated entities is generated (608). The set of ratings entities includes those rating entities that will further evaluate whether the content violates content criteria, including a further determination as to whether the content includes objectionable material. In some implementations, a set of rated entities is generated to provide a diverse set of rated entity attributes. For example, a set of rating entities may be generated to include rating entities from different geographic regions, different generations, and/or different experience levels.
In some implementations, a set of rating entities is generated based on an aspect of the content to be evaluated. In this way, aspects of the content to be evaluated by the set of rating entities may be determined. For example, the determination may be made based on aspects of the content that have not been evaluated and/or aspects of the content that have not reached a minimum acceptable rating confidence. For example, if a particular aspect of the content has been evaluated, but the confidence of the classification of that aspect does not meet the minimum acceptable rating confidence, a set of rating entities may be generated in a manner suitable for evaluating that particular aspect of the content (e.g., by including rating entities that have been trained to evaluate that particular aspect, or rating entities with experience in evaluating that particular aspect).
In some implementations, the set of rated entities is generated such that rated entities in the set of rated entities have a specified set of attributes. For example, one or more entity attributes deemed necessary to achieve consensus among a set of rated entities may be determined, and the set of rated entities may be created to include only entities having the one or more entity attributes deemed necessary to achieve consensus among the set of rated entities in a particular context. For example, as discussed above, when it is being evaluated whether content is suitable for distribution in geographic area a, the set of rating entities may be selected to include only rating entities from geographic area a, such that evaluation feedback from the set of rating entities will reflect whether the content contains objectionable material according to the social norms of geographic area a.
In some implementations, multiple sets of rating entities may be generated to compare evaluation feedback from different sets of rating entities created based on different rating entity attributes. For example, a second set of rating entities may be generated in addition to the set of rating entities generated based on the geographic attributes of geographic area a. A second set of rated entities may be generated such that rated entities in the second set do not have at least one of the one or more entity attributes. For example, the second set of rated entities may be required to have geographic attributes other than geographic area a, or at least one attribute that is different from all entities in the first set of rated entities (e.g., having geographic attributes of geographic area a).
The content is passed to a set of rating entities (610). In some implementations, content is delivered to a single set of rating entities, while in other implementations, content is delivered to multiple different sets of rating entities. The content may be passed to a set of rating entities for further evaluation based on the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material. When the likelihood that the content portrays objectionable content does not reach a level that would prevent the distribution of the content, the content may be passed to a set of rating entities. As discussed above, content may be passed to a rating entity when the likelihood that the content depicts objectionable material is less than a threshold objectionable. Content may be passed to the set of rating entities based on other factors, such as previous classifications of the identified content (e.g., being classified as depicting objectionable material or a particular type of content).
When the likelihood of objectionable content does not meet the modification threshold at 604, an unmodified version of the content is passed to the rating entity. When the likelihood of objectionable content reaches a modification threshold at 604, the content may be modified, as discussed above, by passing the modified content to the set of rating entities instead of the unmodified content before passing the content to the set of rating entities.
In some implementations, the content can optionally be parsed into sub-parts (612). The parsing may be performed prior to passing the content to the set of rating entities. Parsing may be performed, for example, by segmenting the content into smaller portions of the content, each of which includes less than all of the content. For example, as discussed above, a single video (or any other type of media) may be parsed into multiple sub-portions, each having a duration that is less than the duration of the video. When parsing the content before passing it to the set of rating entities, each smaller portion (sub-portion) of the content may be passed to a different subset of entities in the set of entities for evaluation in parallel in a manner similar to that discussed above.
Evaluation feedback is received indicating whether the content violates the content criterion (614). Evaluation feedback is received from the set of rating entities. The indication of whether the content violates the content criterion may take a variety of forms. For example, the evaluation feedback may specify a vote that supports or opposes the content as being objectionable. For example, a vote of "yes" with respect to content may refer to a vote in which the content depicts objectionable material, while a vote of "no" with respect to content may refer to a vote in which the content does not depict objectionable material. Alternatively or additionally, the evaluation feedback may specify the type of material that the content depicts, and/or the particular content criteria that the content violates. For example, the assessment feedback may specify whether the content depicts violence or drug use.
In some implementations, the assessment feedback can be used to determine rating entity attributes needed to reach a consensus regarding the assessment of the content. For example, after obtaining assessment feedback from each of a plurality of different sets of rating entities (or multiple rating entities in the same set of rating entities) indicating whether the content violates a content distribution policy, it is determined whether one or more entity attributes are needed to agree on whether the content is objectionable (e.g., in a particular distribution context).
In some implementations, when the assessment feedback obtained from the set of rating entities is different from the assessment feedback received from another set of entities, the determination reveals that the one or more attributes are needed to achieve consensus. For example, it may be determined that rating entities in geographic area A classify content as depicting objectionable material, while rating entities in geographic area B classify content as depicting non-objectionable material. In this example, in the context of a geographic area, attributes of geographic area a are needed to reach a consensus as to whether content contains objectionable material for social norms associated with geographic area a.
In some implementations, the determined review does not require the one or more attributes to achieve consensus when the evaluation feedback obtained from one set of rating entities matches the evaluation feedback received from another set of entities. Referring to the example above, if both sets of rating entities classify content in the same way, the geographic attributes of geographic area a are not considered necessary to achieve consensus.
When the content is parsed into sub-portions, separate evaluation feedback will be received for each smaller portion from the different subsets of entities to which the smaller portion is passed, as discussed with reference to 612. As discussed above, the evaluation feedback for each smaller portion (e.g., sub-portion) will be used to determine the overall classification of the content.
A distribution policy is formulated based on the evaluation feedback (616). In some implementations, the formulating of the distribution policy includes preventing distribution of the content when the evaluation feedback indicates that the content violates the content criterion. In some implementations, the formulating of the distribution policy includes distributing the content when the evaluation feedback indicates that the content does not violate the content criterion.
In some implementations, the distribution policy is a geographic-based distribution policy that specifies different distribution policies for different geographic regions. In these embodiments, the formulation of the distribution policy will be based on the geographic region to which the content is intended to be distributed. For example, when it is determined that the content violates a first distribution policy for a first geographic region but does not violate a second distribution policy for a second geographic region, distribution of the content in the first geographic region will be blocked based on violating the first content distribution policy, while distribution of the content in the second geographic region will be performed based on the content not violating the second content distribution policy, regardless of whether the content violates the first content distribution policy for the first geographic region.
The amount of content delivered to the set of rating entities is limited (618). As discussed above, the internal volume may be limited to reduce the impact of objectionable materials on the rating entity. The limiting of the flow may be performed for each different entity in the set of rating entities. For throttling, an amount of content that has been delivered to the different entity within a pre-specified amount of time may be determined, a bad score that quantifies an improper degree of content that has been delivered to the different entity within the pre-specified amount of time may be determined, and delivery of additional content to the different entity may be prevented when (i) the amount of content that has been delivered to the different entity within the pre-specified amount of time exceeds a threshold amount or (ii) the bad score exceeds a maximum acceptable bad score.
FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an example computer system 700 that may be used to perform the operations discussed above. The system 700 includes a processor 710, a memory 720, a storage device 730, and an input/output device 740.

A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
A processor adapted to execute a computer program comprises: for example, both general purpose microprocessors and special purpose microprocessors. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with the instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such a device. Moreover, a computer may be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game player, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive), to name a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including: by way of example, semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; as well as CD-ROM discs and DVD-ROM discs. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having: a display device for displaying information to a user, for example, a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor; and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which a user may provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices may also be used to provide for interaction with a user; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user may be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, the computer may interact with the user by sending documents to a device used by the user and receiving documents from the device (e.g., by sending web pages to a web browser on the user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser).
Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component (e.g., as a data processor), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front-end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification), or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include local area networks ("LANs") and wide area networks ("WANs"), the internet (e.g., the internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
The computing system may include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, the server sends data (e.g., an HTML page) to the client device (e.g., for displaying the data to a user interacting with the client device and receiving user input from the user). Data generated on the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) may be received from the client device at the server.
