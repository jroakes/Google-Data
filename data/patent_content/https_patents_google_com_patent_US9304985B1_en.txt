Definitions
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Content item slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or to a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- the content can then be provided to the user on any devices associated with the user such as a personal computer (PC), a smartphone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or some other user device.
- One type of content provided can be a textual advertisement that includes a title portion and one or more lines of text in a body portion, which can include a visual URL (uniform resource link).
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing creatives.
- the method comprises identifying, using one or more processors, a creative for processing, the creative including a title portion and a body portion, where the body portion includes a visual uniform resource locator (URL), the visual URL comprising a visual portion and a link to a resource.
- the method further comprises evaluating the visual URL for inclusion in the title portion, including determining when promotion of the visual URL satisfies one or more promotion criterion, and if so, promoting the visual URL for inclusion in the title portion.
- the method further comprises providing the creative including the title portion with the promoted visual URL.
- the method can further comprise reducing a link associated with the visual URL to a simple domain, where providing the creative including the promoted visual URL includes providing a visual URL having an associated link to the simple domain.
- Providing the visual URL can include providing a modified version of the visual URL that is directed to the simple domain.
- Providing the modified version can include removing a domain reference from the visual URL prior to promotion.
- the domain reference can be of the form of a “.X” reference, where X refers to a top-level domain.
- Promoting can comprise emphasizing text associated with the visual URL including emphasizing by using all uppercase characters or all lowercase characters or capitalizing one or more individual words in the visual URL.
- One of the one or more promotion criterion can include display criteria related to a size of the visual URL and available promotion space in the title portion. Evaluating the visual URL can include determining when, if promoted, the visual URL would violate one or more predetermined restrictions on promotion and not promoting the visual URL if a violation would occur.
- One predetermined restriction can relate to a length of the title portion.
- One predetermined restriction can relate to content that can be included in the title portion.
- One predetermined restriction can relate to redundant content, and the method can further comprise determining when the title portion includes one or more words included in the visual URL and not promoting the visual URL when redundancy is found. The method can further comprise determining when the redundancy is partial redundancy and promoting the visual URL when partial redundancy is determined.
- One predetermined restriction can relate to policy restrictions.
- the method can further comprise determining when promotion should occur including evaluating one or more metrics associated with the creative or delivery of the creative.
- One metric can relate to a location of where the creative is to be served.
- One metric can relate to a user to whom the creative is to be displayed.
- One metric can relate to an environment associated with the serving of the creative.
- One metric can relate to a relative projected performance of the creative with and without content added to the title portion.
- Providing the creative can include providing estimated performance information for the creative.
- Providing the estimated performance information for the creative can include providing a relative performance change projection.
- the method can further include determining a location of where the creative is to be served to a user, and promoting unless the location is on a predetermined list of locations where promotion is not desirable.
- the method can further comprise receiving a request for content, and providing the creative responsive to the request.
- the body portion can include one to three lines of text.
- Promoting the visual URL can include appending the visual URL to the end of the title portion.
- Promoting the visual URL can further include adding a delimiter to the title portion between text of the title portion and the promoted visual URL. The delimiter can separate the text of the title portion from the promoted visual URL.
- Promoting the visual URL can include constructing a reference for the title portion after promotion. The reference can be directed to a first resource. The link can be directed to a second different resource.
- Providing the creative can include storing the creative.
- Providing the creative can include providing the creative responsive to a received request for a creative to fill a slot.
- the method comprises identifying, using one or more processors, a creative for processing, the creative including a title portion and a body portion, where the body portion includes a visual uniform resource locator (URL), the visual URL having a visual portion and including a link to a resource.
- the method further comprises evaluating the body portion including determining when a textual portion of the body portion includes a complete phrase, the evaluating including applying a test to one or more words in the body portion.
- the method further comprises promoting, using the one or more processors, the complete phrase into the title portion.
- the method further comprises, when a complete phrase is not located or after the complete phrase has been promoted, evaluating the visual URL for inclusion in the title portion including determining when promotion of the visual URL satisfies one or more promotion criterion, and when so, promoting the visual URL for inclusion in the title portion.
- the method further comprises providing the creative including the title portion with the promoted complete phrase and/or visual URL.
- promoting content from a body portion to a title portion can increase interaction rates for content, including click-through rates.
- a sentence or a visual URL that is promoted to the first line of the creative may entice the user to click on the creative, e.g., to obtain more information or to make a purchase.
- promotion of content can improve the quality of a creative by identifying and promoting a sentence that might otherwise appear to the user as disjoint information. For example, the user may be able to read a sentence or a complete thought where none was obvious before.
- promotion of a visual URL can entice the user to interact with a presented content item (e.g., select a corresponding link or to navigate to a landing page or some other Web location associated with the content item).
- promotion of content can also include the removal of redundant information, which can provide a creative that is more compact and free of repeated keywords or other extraneous information.

- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- a content item can be of the form of an advertisement. While reference is made to an advertisement, other forms of sponsored content are possible.
- a content item includes criteria (i.e., specifying when the content item is shown) and a creative (i.e., what is shown).
- content refers to subject matter that is requested by a user/device and delivered responsive to a content request.
- Content is also used to refer to the portion of a creative that may be promoted, e.g., to the first line of the creative.
- the creative can include a title portion and a body portion, e.g., including 1-3 lines.
- the body portion can include a visual uniform resource locator (URL) that has a visual portion (e.g., text or image content seen by the user) and includes a link to a resource.
- a decision of whether to promote the visual URL can occur either before or after decisions to promote other content, e.g., after a decision of whether to promote a complete phrase from the body portion.
- multiple content portions can be promoted.
- the entire visual URL can be promoted, or the URL can be simplified or truncated to remove all but the domain information and/or redundant information.
- the visual URL is www.exampleshoes.com/index/XYZ
- the promoted portion can be www.exampleshoes.com.
- the promoted portion of a visual URL can remove the reference to the World Wide Web (e.g., the “www” portion).
- the promoted content may or may not be removed from where it was promoted.
- a shortened, modified version of a visual URL can appear in the title portion, while the visual URL in the body portion can remain unchanged (e.g., not deleted).
- content that can be promoted is a group of one or more words that constitute a complete phrase (e.g., a complete sentence that ends in an end-of-line punctuation mark (or “terminator”)).
- a complete portion of text can be promoted if it is determined that a period is missing (omitted intentionally or otherwise) from a textual portion.
- the determination can include evaluating probability data for N-word phrases from a corpus of creatives having (or not having) periods at given locations.
- Other content or portions of the creative can also be promoted. Promotion of content may be intended to occur only in specific cases, such as when the promotion is most likely to have a positive result, e.g., by improving the experience and/or likelihood of an engagement by the user to whom the content is provided.
- creatives can include plural individual elements.
- a creative can include a title portion and a body portion (e.g., two or more lines of text and, optionally, the visual URL).
- the title portion can occupy the first, top or most prominent position of the creative.
- the title portion can be presented in a different font, bolded, or otherwise emphasized relative to the remaining portions of the creative.
- the title portion is one line of text and is of the form of an actionable item (e.g., is a link to a landing page associated with the creative).
- the body portion can include, for example, plural lines of text (e.g., two) and be positioned just below the title portion.
- the visual URL can include a link to a resource associated with the creative (e.g., a link to a landing page associated with the creative).
- no visual URL is included in a creative.
- the visual URL occupies a third (e.g., bottom) line of the creative. While reference is made to top, middle and bottom locations above with respect to a creative, other orientations are possible for configuring the respective elements.
- other elements can be included in a creative.
- the visual URL can occupy part or all of the body portion, such as if the length of the URL is such that the URL will not fit entirely on one line.
- the body portion of a creative can be evaluated, for example, to determine when the body portion includes content (e.g., one or more words) that can be added to the title portion.
- content e.g., one or more words
- the title portion of the creative provided by a content sponsor may initially include only the name of the product or service associated with the creative.
- the body portion may include descriptive text or other information that, if promoted to the title portion, may make the creative more elicit interaction with the creative or more likely to catch the user's attention.
- the content promoted from the body portion can include words located entirely within the second line.
- promotion of content from the body portion can include content from different sections of the body portion (e.g., from the visual URL or from the rest of the body portion).
- promotion can include promotion in other locations of the creative (e.g., promotion within the body portion or promotion of content from the visual URL to another part of the body portion).
- the creative can be provided, e.g., in response to a request for content such as a request to fill an advertisement slot on a web page.
- creatives in which content is promoted can be provided (e.g., as suggestions) to content sponsors, e.g., in user interfaces that they use to create and/or update creatives.
- the content sponsor may initially specify a title portion and a body portion (e.g., that contains a visual URL) as content to be included in a creative.
- the user interface can then display, to the content sponsor, one or more different modified versions of the creative, each version reflecting promotion of content, e.g., the visual URL to the title portion.
- the content sponsor can select which version(s) of the creative will be included in the campaign.
- the act of promoting can, for example, move or copy content from one portion of the creative to another.
- promoting can include moving or copying content to the title portion from other portions of the creative.
- the original second line can be removed from the body portion.
- Other content can be shifted, e.g., by moving the remaining part of the body portion up a line).
- a visual URL or a complete phrase is promoted that spans parts of lines two and three of the creative, then the remaining (un-promoted) portions of the body portion can be combined to create a new line that replaces the original two lines.
- content e.g., a phone number
- promoting content can occur conditionally or only after the content is modified in some way, e.g., to remove redundant or unnecessary information.
- a check can be performed to determine if candidate promotion content is already included in the target location (e.g., in the original title). When promotion would result in redundant information presentation, the promotion can be blocked or candidate promotion content can be modified. This can prevent the occurrence of blank spaces, unnecessary capitalization, repeated words and/or phrases in the title portion after promotion has occurred.
- the visual URL may not be promoted, based on the redundancy.
- partial redundancy can be acceptable and will not restrict promotion, e.g., if the redundant content pertains to the name of a product or is other content that is considered to be acceptable or beneficial if repeated in the creative.
- the decision of whether to promote can be based on analysis that involves N-grams, or phrases of words having different numbers of N words each. For example, if the phrase “we sell great shoes” is included in the creative, but the phrase does not end with punctuation, probability data associated with a database of creatives can be evaluated to determine a likelihood of whether a period should be inferred at the end of the text (e.g., after “shoes”) or at some other position in the text.
- the probability data can include individual probabilities that represent a likelihood that a period or other end-of-sentence punctuation mark is implied after “we,” after “we sell,” after “we sell great,” and finally after “we sell great shoes.”
- the probabilities can be generated based on patterns determined from other creatives that include the text “we,” “we sell.”, “we sell great,” and “we sell great shoes.”
- the probabilities can be determined ahead of time, e.g., pre-evaluated data from a corpus of historical creatives.
- the probabilities can represent the likelihood that a delimiter is likely to occur before or after a word in the creative.
- the probability can be based on formulas or calculations that consider the number of occurrences of a sequence of words in the corpus of creatives that include (or don't include) a delimiter in a particular position.
- a probability of a terminator in that position can be 90%. Using this probability, for example, it can be assumed that if the phrase “we sell great shoes” (e.g., without a terminator after “shoes”) appears in a creative being evaluated for promotion, there is a very good chance that promoting the phrase to the title portion of the creative will succeed in displaying a complete phrase to the user when the advertisement is displayed.
- promotion can occur in other types of content items and include other types of content.
- the other types of content that can be promoted can include content that provides a visual display to the user (e.g., an image) or content that provides some level or interactivity with the user (e.g., a link to a video, an animation, music, or some other media content).
- some portions of the creative can be demoted, e.g., if they are determined to be less likely of interest to the user or for other reasons.
- additional content can be created and added to or replace existing content of a particular creative.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content items.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content items in response to requests.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and publishers 109 .
- the content management system 110 can manage and provide content items, such as advertisement, or other resources.
- the content management system 110 and its subordinate parts can be implemented in any of several different locations and inter-connected using the network 102 .
- the example environment 100 and/or the content management system 110 further includes plural engines.
- a creative identification engine 115 can identify a content item (e.g., an advertisement including its respective creative) for processing.
- a creative evaluation engine 120 can evaluate a body portion of the creative, for example, to determine when the body portion includes one or more words or other content that can be added to the title portion.
- a promotion engine 130 can promote the content (e.g., a complete phrase and/or a visual URL) into the title portion.
- a visual URL engine 132 can be used to determine when to promote all or part of the visual URL to the title portion. For example, the visual URL engine 132 can determine if the visual URL satisfies one or more promotion criterion.
- the one or more promotion criterion can include display criteria related to a size of the visual URL, e.g., in comparison to available promotion space in the title portion.
- the visual URL engine 132 can determine when promotion of the visual URL would violate one or more predetermined restrictions on promotion, and decide not to promote the visual URL if a violation would occur.
- Example restrictions can relate to a length of the title portion, types of content that can be included in the title portion, and/or the existence of redundant content.
- the visual URL engine 132 can evaluate one or more metrics associated with the creative and/or its delivery to determine if promotion should occur.
- Example metrics can relate to a geographic location of where the creative is to be served, a particular user or demographic to whom the creative is to be displayed, an environment associated with the serving of the creative, and/or a relative projected performance of the creative with and without content added to the title portion.
- the visual URL engine 132 can also be used to determine how the visual URL is promoted into the title portion.
- a link associated with the visual URL can be reduced to a simple domain, and when the creative is provided that includes the promoted visual URL, a visual URL can be provided that has an associated link to the simple domain.
- a modified version of the visual URL can be created that is directed to the simple domain, e.g., by removing a domain reference that is in the form of a “.X” reference (e.g., where “X” refers to a top-level domain such as .com, .org, etc.)
- An N-gram probability engine 133 can determine probabilities that an end-of-sentence punctuation mark (or “terminator”) is located at any of plural locations within N-word phrases that form a creative. For example, the N-gram probability engine 133 can evaluate a historical database of creatives (e.g., creatives 121 ) to determine the probabilities and store the probabilities (e.g., as N-gram probabilities 124 ) for later use in evaluating a particular creative for promotion of content.
- evaluating the body portion can include evaluating various sequences of words in the complete portion of text. For example, each sequence can be a contiguous set of words in the complete portion of text that start from a first location in the body portion.
- each sequence can be described as including words w 1 , w 2 . . . w j having locations 0, 1, 2 . . . j occurring on boundaries of the words.
- Evaluating can include accounting for probabilities associated with each of the sequences.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can use the N-gram probabilities 124 when evaluating the body portion of the creative, for example, to determine if a portion of text is to be promoted (where the promotion is, for example, a complete thought or sentence).
- the evaluation can occur when there is insufficient punctuation to determine a portion to promote, and may not need to be executed when sufficient punctuation does exist (e.g., the portion of text already ends with a period).
- a redundancy engine 145 can determine redundant portions of text, e.g., to prevent the promotion of redundant content and/or to reduce the amount of redundant information in promoted content.
- the redundancy engine 145 can use information from redundancy metrics 126 , e.g., including information about Boolean/binary indicators (e.g., “Is the title portion contained in the body portion?”), counts of words, stop words, word stems, penalties associated with repeated use of the same word, weights associated with the length of words, and other information, as described above.
- a request handler 135 can provide the content item in response to a request for content by the user.
- the content item that is provided may or may not include promoted content.
- Other engines and other functions are possible.
- whether or not content is promoted can depend, at least in part, on analyzing the creative, including performing n-gram analysis.
- the n-gram analysis can include the use of probabilities that one-, two- and/or three-word combinations of words are likely to include an end-of-line punctuation mark and/or lead to identification of a complete concept, phrase or sentence.
- the n-gram analysis can be used to promote content that spans multiple lines (e.g., two lines in the body portion), or to recognize (e.g., using probabilities) that the inclusion (or exclusion) of an end-of-line punctuation mark does (or does not) indicate a complete concept, phrase or sentence that can be promoted.
- the n-gram analysis can include the use of scores or probability formulas that use products of probabilities that correspond to various n-grams associated with one or more words that may be promoted.
- the promotion analysis can include analysis of the words and structure of the creative, for example to determine parts of speech, capitalization and explicit and implicit punctuation. Other analysis is possible.
- the environment 100 can include plural data stores.
- the data store of creatives 121 can store creatives that are provided by content sponsors 108 .
- the creatives for example, can be in the original form provided by the content sponsors 108 , i.e., without having any of the content in the creatives promoted to other parts of the creative (e.g., the title portion).
- the creatives 121 can also store creatives in which content has been promoted (e.g., by promoting a full sentence to the title portion of the creative).
- creatives stored in this type of promoted format can include promoted formats of creatives that have been suggested to (and selected by) content sponsors in a content sponsor interface.
- the data store of creatives 121 can store different versions of the same creative, e.g., one in the form that is originally provided by the content sponsor 108 , and one or more versions of the creative in which content has been promoted.
- a data store of language structures and patterns 122 can store information that can be used to evaluate content for possible promotion.
- language structures and patterns 122 can store a domain of possible end-of-line punctuation marks (e.g., a period, exclamation point, question mark, or other punctuation mark(s)).
- the language structures and patterns 122 can store information that can be used to detect false positives that result from end-of-sentence punctuation marks occurring at the end of a sentence.
- the language structures and patterns 122 or a different data store can store information about parts of speech and n-grams.
- a data store of restrictions 123 can store information that can identify when to restrict the promotion of content.
- one type of restriction can relate to the length of a title, e.g., the restriction having the meaning “do not promote content if the resulting title would exceed a threshold length of N characters or occupies S horizontal space.”
- Other example restrictions can relate to content that should not be included in the title portion (e.g., certain words, phrases, product names, etc.) and policy restrictions (e.g., policies that designate that trademark names are not to appear on the first line of a creative).
- content- and policy-related restrictions can be different for each content sponsor. Other types of restrictions can be used.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or web page, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 can access the cache and/or the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- the search results 118 include the content itself, such as a map, or an answer, such as in response to a query for a store's products, phone number, address or hours of operation.
- the content management system 110 can generate search results 118 using information (e.g., identified resources) received from the search system 112 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., ads) can be presented.
- slots on search results pages or other web pages can include content slots for content items that have been provided as part of a reservation process.
- a publisher and a content item sponsor enter into an agreement where the publisher agrees to publish a given content item (or campaign) in accordance with a schedule (e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X) or other publication criteria.
- a schedule e.g., provide 1000 impressions by date X
- content items that are selected to fill the requests for content slots can be selected based, at least in part, on priorities associated with a reservation process (e.g., based on urgency to fulfill a reservation).
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals and behavioral signals.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their content with a resource.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or web page, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used. For example, the user's selection of a visual URL that has been promoted to the title portion can be considered a conversion.
- the likelihood that a conversion will occur can be improved, such as by providing a content item (e.g., an advertisement) in which selected content has been promoted to the first line (or title portion) of the content item. For example, if a complete phrase (e.g., a call to action) or a visual URL appears in the title portion, the user may be more likely to engage with the content item, and that engagement can lead to a conversion.
- a content item e.g., an advertisement
- a complete phrase e.g., a call to action
- a visual URL appears in the title portion
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out or otherwise accept privacy policies relating to the collection of such data.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 2A shows an example system 200 for promoting content in a creative.
- the creative can be provided by the content management system 110 to the device 106 , as described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- One example sequence of steps is now shown using the system 200 . Other sequences are possible.
- the content management system 110 can receive a request for content 202 at step 1 .
- the request for content 202 can be a request to fill a content item slot 204 (e.g., an advertisement slot on a web page 206 ).
- the request for content 202 can be a request for search results (e.g., search results 118 ) that are responsive to a search query (e.g., the query 116 ).
- Other forms of requests are possible, such as requests for directions, requests for a map, requests for information, etc.
- a background process can execute and invoke components of the system to create or update creatives 121 , e.g., including promoting a portion of content (e.g., a complete phrase and/or a visual URL) to the title portion of the creative.
- creatives 121 e.g., including promoting a portion of content (e.g., a complete phrase and/or a visual URL) to the title portion of the creative.
- a creative 210 a is identified for processing.
- the creative 210 a that is identified can be an advertisement creative that the content management system 110 identifies as associated with an eligible content item (e.g., responsive to the request for content 202 ) or that the content management system 110 selects in response to the request for content 202 .
- the creative 210 a can be a first or next creative to be processed, e.g., such as in a batch of creatives that are being updated to promote content to the title potions.
- the creative 210 a (e.g., an advertisement for an example shoe entity) can include plural portions, such as, but not limited to, a title portion 212 (e.g., “Example Shoe Entity”) and a body portion 214 that includes a visual URL 216 .
- the body portion 214 can include two lines of text.
- the body portion 214 includes the second and third lines of text within the creative 210 a , e.g., “We sell great” and “shoes Half off for 2 days only.”
- the visual URL 216 can include a link to a website for the example shoe entity (e.g., www.exampleshoes.com) or a link to a resource or landing page associated with the example shoe entity (e.g., to an online order form).
- the creative 210 a is evaluated for promotion.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can evaluate the body portion 214 to determine when the body portion 214 includes content (e.g., one or more words, a phrase or sentence) that can be added or moved to the title portion 212 .
- the visual URL engine 132 can evaluate the visual URL 216 for possible promotion to the title portion 212 .
- the visual URL engine 132 can determine if the visual URL satisfies one or more promotion criterion, including display criteria as described above.
- the visual URL engine 132 can base a decision on whether to promote the visual URL 216 on whether promotion of the visual URL 216 would violate one or more predetermined restrictions on promotion, as described above.
- Example restrictions, as described above, can relate to a length of the title portion 212 , types of content that can be included in the title portion 212 , and/or the existence of redundant content (e.g., anywhere in the creative 210 a ).
- the visual URL engine 132 can evaluate one or more metrics associated with the creative 210 a that are related, e.g., to a geographic location of where the creative is to be served, a particular user or demographic to whom the creative is to be displayed, an environment associated with serving of the creative, and/or a relative projected performance of the creative with and without content added to the title portion 212 .
- the evaluation performed by the creative evaluation engine 120 can include determining whether text (e.g., “We sell great shoes”) that is part of the body portion 214 constitutes a sentence.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can use information from the language structures and patterns 122 , e.g., that identifies a domain of possible end-of-line punctuation marks (e.g., a period, exclamation point, question mark, or other punctuation mark(s)).
- more than one punctuation mark can characterize the end of a line, such as an exclamation point (or one or more other end-of-line punctuation marks) followed by one or more single or double quotes.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can account for spaces that appear after a non-space end-of-line punctuation mark.
- parts of speech can be used in evaluating content that may be promoted. For example, a line that ends with a preposition is not likely to be a complete phrase or sentence and therefore, by itself, may not be a good candidate for promotion.
- the evaluation can include determining, during the evaluation of the body portion, a likelihood that the body portion includes text that constitutes a complete phrase. For example, a decision can be made to promote the text when the likelihood is above a pre-determined threshold (e.g., 95% chance that the text is a sentence).
- a pre-determined threshold e.g. 95% chance that the text is a sentence.
- different thresholds can be used for creatives of different content sponsors 108 .
- the creative evaluation engine 120 may determine that the one or more words embody a call to action associated with the creative. Examples of a call to action include “Check out today's sales,” “Try our great-fitting styles,” “Attend our daily podcast,” “Customize your environment” or other attention-grabbing phrases or sentences that request the user perform some action.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can use a dictionary of terms, including verbs, that are likely to be imperative commands or requests used in a call to action. When detected, calls to action can be promoted into the title portion.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can evaluate the body portion 214 , including determining when the body portion 214 includes a complete portion of text, e.g., a sentence or phrase that can span multiple lines in the body portion 214 .
- the body portion 214 may include a sequence of j words w 1 , w 2 Associated with the j words are locations 0, 1, 2 . . . j occurring on boundaries of the words.
- the sequence of words in this example is “We sell great shoes,” where j is 4.
- w i refers to “we”
- w 2 refers to “sell”
- w 3 refers to “great”
- w 4 refers to “shoes.”
- the locations 0-4 occur at word boundaries, including before the first word “we” (position 0) and after the fourth word “shoes” (position 4).
- there may be no punctuation in the sequence of words such as a terminator after “shoes.” Nevertheless, the creative evaluation engine 120 can evaluate the sequence of words, including determining a probability at each location 0-4 that a complete portion of text concludes at the given location.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can use probabilities associated with a likelihood that a terminator occurs at various locations among the words. For example, the probabilities can be used, among the other ways described in this document, to determine whether a complete portion of text is likely to constitute a complete phrase that can be promoted. In some implementations, when multiple different promotable complete portions of text exist in the same creative, the probabilities can be used to identify a specific complete portion of text that is most likely to constitute a complete phrase.
- probabilities p 1 , p 2 , . . . p n can be associated with N-grams of different lengths N, the terms of which overlap, or are adjacent to, a position within the sequence of words. For example, to determine if a complete phrase (e.g., “We sell great shoes”) can be promoted, N-grams can be identified that are based on the position of an end-of-sentence punctuation mark (or “terminator”). In some implementations, the determination can be based on probabilities derived from a corpus of creatives having text that includes all or part of the complete phrase, e.g., using N-grams.
- the probabilities can be used to identify a probable location of the terminator within the sequence of words. In some implementations, the probabilities can be based on information evaluated from historical creatives that, for each N-gram, counts the occurrences with (and without) a terminator in a particular location. In some implementations, the creatives that are evaluated can be limited to creatives that include end-of-sentence punctuation at the end of the first line in the body portion, the second line of the body portion, or other places in the creative which are deemed to have a high confidence level of containing a complete phrase.
- Example probabilities that N-grams associated with “we sell great shoes” contain a terminator at a certain position include: P [“we sell great shoes”,4] (1) P [“sell great shoes”,3] (2) P [“great shoes”,2] (3) P [“shoes half off”,1] (4) P [“shoes half”,1] (5) P [“half off for”,0] (6) P [“half off”,0] (7)
- Probability (1) for example, can be understood to refer to ‘the probability that a terminator occurs in position 4, or after the fourth word “shoes” in “we sell great shoes.”’ These example probabilities can be selected, for example, because they each represent different N-grams associated with positions in which the terminator occurs in the position after “shoes.” Further, the words in each of the N-grams are included in the body portion of the creative being evaluated for promotion of content.
- the probabilities and/or other probabilities for N-grams associated with “We sell great shoes” can be combined in a probability formula: p 1 *p 2 * . . . *p n >(1 ⁇ p 1 )*(1 ⁇ p 2 )* . . . *(1 ⁇ p n ) (8)
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can use the probability formula (8) to determine, in addition to other criteria described in this document, whether “We sell great shoes” represents a promotable content item (e.g., is a complete phrase or sentence or is likely to be a complete phrase or sentence based on individual probabilities associated with N-grams).
- p 1 can be associated with probability (1)
- p 2 can be associated with probability (2)
- so on including any other probabilities associated with the existence (or nonexistence) of a terminator after “shoes.”
- Other formulas can be used.
- the probability formula (8) or other formulas can include additional terms that can smooth out or normalize the computed products of the probabilities.
- the probability formula (8) can also include a p 0 term, e.g., set at a default value, that can be used on either or both sides of the formula (e.g., as 1 ⁇ p 0 on the right side).
- the inclusion of these and other additional terms can offset fluctuations in, or dominance by, other terms.
- the inclusion of additional terms can prevent the evaluation of probability formulas from resulting in zero or dividing by zero.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 when evaluating the body portion 214 to determine the content (e.g., one or more words) that can be promoted, can determine whether the promotion would violate one or more predetermined restrictions (e.g., restrictions 123 ). For example, the creative evaluation engine 120 can make a determination not to promote the one or more words when they are on a predetermined restriction list or blacklist.
- predetermined restrictions e.g., restrictions 123
- Another example restriction can be related to the length of the title portion 212 .
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can decide not to promote or modify proposed promotion content.
- the combined length of the existing title portion 212 and the one or more words to be promoted e.g., “We sell great shoes”
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can decide not to promote.
- a threshold size that the creative evaluation engine 120 uses to decide whether or not to promote can be based on the number of characters in the title portion 212 that would result once the candidate promoted content (e.g., one or more words) is promoted.
- the restriction-based decisions based on the length of the title portion 212 can account for any characters (e.g., spaces, vertical lines, or delimiters) that are to be inserted between the original title portion 212 and the content to be promoted.
- restrictions used by the creative evaluation engine 120 can relate to the type of content that should not be included in the title portion 212 (e.g., certain words or phrases) and policy restrictions (e.g., a policy that designates that trademark names are not to appear on the first line of a creative).
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can evaluate text at the beginning, middle, or anywhere within the body portion of the creative to identify one or more words that may violate a restriction.
- each content sponsor 108 can specify content- and policy-related restrictions that are unique to that content sponsor 108 .
- the “Example Shoe Entity” may have a policy (e.g., identified in an advertising campaign by the content sponsor 108 ) to avoid the promotion of particular trademark terms into the first line of the creative.
- a different entity may have no restrictions on trademark terms, but may have restrictions based on the specific content or type of content that should not be promoted.
- information used by the creative evaluation engine 120 and/or the visual URL engine 132 to decide among multiple kinds of promotion can be learned over time, e.g., based on metrics for user engagements with content, such as clicks.
- the metrics may identify the scenarios in which it is more advantageous to promote the visual URL versus the second line of the creative versus doing nothing at all. Other criteria can be used to decide which content is to be promoted.
- the promotion engine 130 can promote the content.
- the promoted content can include the visual URL 216 that is determined to be promotable by the visual URL engine 132 or a complete phrase identified by the creative evaluation engine 120 .
- the result of the promotion is the creative 210 b .
- the title portion 212 is modified to include a modified visual URL 216 b , e.g., “Exampleshoes.com” shortened from “www.exampleshoes.com/index/XYZ” in the visual URL 216 .
- the complete phrase 214 a can be promoted to the title portion 212 .
- the creative 210 b includes three lines, where the original title portion 212 and the modified visual URL 216 b have been combined, with a delimiter 218 separating the two portions. While the modified visual URL 216 b in this example is capitalized, other ways of emphasizing/differentiating the visual URLs can be used, including, e.g., using all lowercase characters (e.g., “exampleshoes.com”) or capitalizing individual words (e.g., “ExampleShoes.com”).
- a delimiter e.g., a period or exclamation point
- the evaluation of the creative includes an analysis based on parts of speech and indicates that the promoted complete phrase 214 a is likely to be a question (e.g., “want great shoes” or “do you want great shoes”)
- the delimiter can be a question mark.
- content can be promoted so as to combine lines of text.
- a new first line 214 c of a modified body portion 214 b in the creative 210 b can combine the first two lines (e.g., “We sell great” and “shoes Half off for 2 days only”) of the body portion 214 of the creative 210 a .
- This example creative 210 a shows promotion of two types of content: the modified visual URL 216 b and the promotion of “shoes Half off for 2 days only” to the new first line 214 c of the modified body portion 214 b.
- step 5 the creative 210 b is provided, including the title portion 212 , e.g. with the promoted content.
- step 5 can occur, for example, when the content management system 110 provides a content item 220 (e.g., the creative 210 b ) in response to the request for content 202 . If for some reason no promotion occurred, e.g., when the creative evaluation engine 120 and/or the visual URL engine failed to identify content to promote, then the content item 220 provided by the content management system 110 can be the original (e.g., four-line) creative 210 a .
- Providing the creative 210 b can include presenting it to the user along with responsive results or providing the creative to a content sponsor for approval.
- the creative can be stored. For example, storing the creative with content promoted to the title portion can be part of a background or batch process that updates several creatives at once.
- storing the creative can include providing estimated performance information for the creative.
- the estimated performance information can include metrics that identify and compare the performance of the creative with and without promotion.
- the estimated performance information for the creative can include providing a relative performance change projection, e.g., a numerical projection that indicates that the creative is likely to perform better (e.g., by a certain percentage) with content promoted to the title portion than without promotion.
- a relative performance change projection e.g., a numerical projection that indicates that the creative is likely to perform better (e.g., by a certain percentage) with content promoted to the title portion than without promotion.
- FIG. 2B is a block diagram of a system 230 for pre-evaluating a historical database of creatives 121 to determine probabilities that portions of text conclude at a given location.
- the probabilities can be N-gram probabilities 124 that are stored and used later to evaluate creatives to determine complete portions of text that can be promoted, e.g., as described above with reference to in FIG. 2A .
- the N-gram probability engine 133 can perform the pre-evaluation periodically (e.g., weekly or monthly) or as new creatives 121 are available.
- N-grams (e.g., sequential groups of N words) can be used to determine the N-gram probabilities 124 , where N can be 1 or greater.
- the N-gram probability engine 133 can evaluate 1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams and so on from the text of each of the creatives 121 .
- the N-gram probability engine 133 can record whether or not an end-of-sentence punctuation mark (or a “terminator” such as a period, question mark, exclamation point, etc.) occurs just before the N-gram, between any of the words, or at the end of the N-gram.
- an end-of-sentence punctuation mark or a “terminator” such as a period, question mark, exclamation point, etc.
- these positions can be represented by numbered positions zero (just before the first word), 1 through N ⁇ 1 (after words 1 through N ⁇ 1), and N (after the last word).
- the N-gram probability engine 133 can parse the text of the creatives 121 to evaluate N-grams. As a result, the N-gram probability engine 133 can determine counts 232 of occurrences in creatives 121 that have (or do not have) terminators at positions 0 to N.
- Pos[W,i] can represent a count of creatives (e.g., 27,000) with a period at position i in a sequence of words W.
- Neg[W,i] can represent a count of creatives (e.g., 3 , 000 ) without a terminator at position i.
- the sequence of words W includes w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , w 4 or “we sell great shoes.”
- Counts 232 a and 232 b for example, represent the number of creatives 121 a with and without terminators, respectively, at position zero.
- Counts 232 c and 232 d for example, represent the number of creatives 121 a with and without terminators, respectively, at position 4.
- the creatives 121 a may include any occurrences of “we sell great shoes” that may or may not have interspersed punctuation.
- a creative that includes “we sell great shoes” would be considered to qualify for inclusion in the creatives 121 a , and so would a creative that includes “shoes that we sell. Great shoes at great prices!”
- creatives 121 that include “selling great shoes” or just “we sell” would not be included in the creatives 121 a (unless they also include qualifying phrases).
- restrictions can be applied to count only exact occurrences of sequences as opposed to just occurrences where all the words are present, just not in the desired order.
- Counts 232 e and 232 f represent the number of creatives 121 b with and without, respectively, terminators at position zero.
- Counts 232 g and 232 h represent the number of creatives 121 b with and without, respectively, terminators at position one.
- w 4 is chosen as the term to represent “shoes” in order to match the w 4 term “shoes” in the w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , w 4 in the “we sell great shoes” example.
- the N-gram probability engine 133 can evaluate creatives 121 for N-grams up to a threshold value of N. For example, if N is 10, there may be very few creatives that each contains the same 10-word phrase. In some implementations, the N-gram probability engine 133 can evaluate creatives for increasing values of N until, for example, statistically small (e.g., less than 1000) Pos and Neg counts occur.
- probability formulas 234 can be used that are functions of Pos and Neg counts.
- One example probability that a terminator is located at position 0 in the word sequence w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , w 4 can be represented by:
- the preceding formula is a probability formula 234 a that includes terms from counts 232 a and 232 b .
- the probability formula 234 a shows that the probability for a terminator existing at the given location zero is equal to the number of positive occurrences (e.g., P[“w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 ”,0]) divided by a sum of the number of positive occurrences and the number of negative occurrences (e.g., Neg[“w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 ”,0]).
- the probability formula 234 a can be represented by the N-gram probability 124 a (e.g., P[“w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 ”,0], or P[“we sell great shoes”,0).
- probability formula 234 b uses the terms from counts 232 c and 232 d associated with the terminator being located in the fourth position (e.g., after w 4 , or “shoes” in the phrase “we sell great shoes”).
- counts such as the counts 232 a and 232 b that represent the number of positive and negative occurrences, respectively can be multiplied by a fixed scalar greater than 1 (e.g., 20) before they are used in probability formulas such as probability formula 234 a . For example, this can result in smoothing the effect of large or small values in any of the terms in the formulas.
- probabilities are not calculated or stored unless the sum of the positive and negative occurrences exceeds a threshold value (e.g., 2,000). For example, if counts 232 a and 232 b total less than 2,000, then the probability formula 234 a is not evaluated or results stored. Using a threshold can increase a confidence level in the probabilities that are calculated.
- a scalar (e.g., 1 ) can be added to terms in the probability formula (9).
- the probability for a terminator occurring at the given location zero in “w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 ” can be given by:
- the inclusion of a scalar to formula (10) or to other formulas can account for situations in which sparse data exists, e.g., low Pos and/or Neg counts of words.
- the scalar can smooth the results of the calculations.
- the scalar can automatically discount itself when the counts are high, but when counts are low, the scalar can dominate the equation.
- FIG. 3A is a flowchart of an example process 300 for promoting a visual URL in a creative.
- the content management system 110 and/or its subordinate components can perform steps of the process 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.
- FIGS. 1-2B are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of the process 300 .
- the process 300 can be initiated, for example, when the content management system 110 receives the request for content 202 , as described above with respect to FIG. 2A .
- a creative is identified for processing, the creative including a title portion and a body portion, where the body portion includes a visual uniform resource locator (URL) that comprises a visual portion and a link to a resource ( 302 ).
- the content management system 110 can identify the creative 210 a , e.g., a creative associated with an advertisement for shoes.
- the creative 210 a includes the title portion 212 and the body portion 214 that includes the visual URL 216 in addition to text.
- the visual portion is what the user sees (e.g., “www.exampleshoes.com/index/XYZ”) when an impression of the creative occurs.
- a link portion for example, which may or may not include the same path as the associated visual portion, is a link to a corresponding resource, e.g., the URL to which the user is directed upon selection of the visual portion.
- identification of the creative 210 a can occur subsequent to receipt by the content management system 110 of a request for content (e.g., the request for content 202 that is related to shoes).
- the creative 210 a that is identified by the content management system 110 can be associated with an eligible content item or a selected content item (e.g., an advertisement for shoes) that is responsive to the request for content 202 .
- the creative includes the title portion 212 (e.g., “Example Shoe Entity”), two lines of text in the body portion 214 (e.g., “We sell great” and “shoes Half off for 2 days only”), and a visual URL 216 (e.g., www.exampleshoes.com).
- the visual URL is evaluated for inclusion in the title portion, including determining if promotion of the visual URL would satisfy one or more promotion criterion ( 304 ).
- the visual URL engine 132 can determine if the visual URL 216 satisfies one or more promotion criterion, as described above.
- a decision to promote a visual URL may occur after evaluation of other content for promotion.
- content from the body portion may be promoted to the title portion prior to the promotion of the visual URL.
- promotion engine 130 can promote the visual URL 216 to the title portion 212 .
- the modified visual URL 216 b is promoted to the title portion 212 .
- promotion can include adding a delimiter to the title portion between text of the title portion and the promoted content.
- the creative 210 b includes the delimiter 218 that separates the original title portion 212 (e.g., “Example Shoe Entity”) from the modified visual URL 216 b.
- the act of promotion can include constructing a link for the title portion after promotion.
- the link that is constructed can be the same or a shortened version of a link to the resource (e.g., a URL) corresponding to the modified visual URL 216 .
- the link that is constructed in the title portion during promotion can be directed to a first resource (e.g., www.exampleshoes.com), and the visual URL can be directed to a second different resource (e.g., www.exampleshoes.com/index/XYZ). For example, it may be determined that users are more likely to click on the shortened URL.
- the link that is constructed is anchor text for the resource set forth in the visual URL.
- the content management system 110 can then provide the creative 210 b containing the promoted content.
- the creative 210 b can be the content item 220 that the content management system 110 provides in response to the request for content 202 .
- the creative is provided without content being promoted ( 312 ).
- the creative 210 a e.g., with un-promoted content
- the creative 210 a can be the content item 220 that the content management system 110 provides in response to the request for content 202 .
- FIG. 3B is a flowchart of an example process 320 for determining whether to promote a complete phrase or a visual URL in a creative.
- the content management system 110 and/or its subordinate components can perform steps of the process 320 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.
- FIGS. 1-2B are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of the process 320 .
- a creative is identified for processing that includes a title portion and a body portion, where the body portion includes a visual uniform resource locator (URL) that has a visual portion and includes a link to a resource ( 322 ).
- the content management system 110 can identify the creative 210 a , e.g., a creative associated with an advertisement for shoes.
- the creative 210 a includes the title portion 212 and the body portion 214 that includes the visual URL 216 in addition to text.
- the text for example, may contain a complete phrase that may be determined to be promotable to the title portion 212 .
- the body portion is first evaluated to determine whether there is a complete phrase that can be promoted.
- the body portion is evaluated including determining when a textual portion of the body portion includes a complete phrase, the evaluating including applying a test to one or more words in the body portion ( 324 ).
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can evaluate the body portion 214 to determine if “We sell great shoes” constitutes a sentence.
- the determination can be made, e.g., based on using probabilities associated with N-grams that correspond to words in the body portion of the creative. For example, one or more probabilities associated with each word can serve as a test to determine the likelihood that a sentence ends at that word.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can use the probability formula (8) (e.g., p 1 *p 2 * . . . *p n >(1 ⁇ p 1 )*(1 ⁇ p 2 )* . . . *(1 ⁇ p n )) to determine, in addition to other criteria described in this document, whether “We sell great shoes” represents a promotable content item, as described above.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can determine whether “We sell great shoes” is likely to be a complete phrase or sentence, e.g., based on individual probabilities associated with N-grams.
- p 1 can be associated with probability (1)
- p 2 can be associated with probability (2), and so on, including any other probabilities associated with the existence (or nonexistence) of a terminator after “shoes.”
- Other formulas can be used.
- the creative evaluation engine 120 can determine whether promotion should occur, e.g., by evaluating one or more metrics associated with the creative or delivery of the creative.
- one metric can relate to a location of where the creative is to be served, e.g., the country in which the user currently resides.
- the user's location can be determined using global positioning system (GPS) capabilities of the user's mobile device, by location information provided by the user (e.g., an address provided by the user in a user profile), or in other ways.
- GPS global positioning system
- content sponsors can specify that promotion of content in their content items is not to occur in certain countries or in other situations specified by the content sponsor.
- another metric can relate to a user to whom the creative is to be displayed. For example, promotion may not occur if the language of the user is Chinese, Japanese or Korean or some other language, e.g., for which it has been determined that promotion of content to the title portion does not result in better performance (e.g., increased click-throughs, etc.).
- Some implementations can use a metric that relates to an environment associated with the serving of the creative. For example, for non-mobile devices (e.g., home personal computers), it may be been determined that users prefer that promotion does not occur. However, users of mobile devices may generally prefer that promotion does occur.
- the decision to promote or not promote based on environment can be based, at least in part, on statistics derived from historical user engagements for content that is provided with and without promoted content.
- Some implementations can include metrics that relate to the creative's performance, e.g., on a creative-by-creative basis.
- performance-related metrics can indicate a relative projected or predicted performance of the creative with and without content added to the title portion.
- promotion can occur if it is determined that promoting the content is likely to cause the creative to perform at least slightly better than the creative without promoting.
- the body portion includes a textual portion that constitutes a complete phrase. If the textual portion of the body portion includes a complete phrase ( 326 ), then the complete phrase is promoted into the title portion ( 328 ). For example, the promotion engine 130 can promote the complete phrase 214 a to the title portion 212 . As a result, the title portion 212 can become “Example Shoe Entity
- the visual URL engine 132 can evaluate the visual URL 216 for possible promotion to the title portion 212 . For example, the visual URL engine 132 can determine if the visual URL 216 satisfies one or more promotion criterion, including display criteria as described above. In some implementations, the visual URL engine 132 can base a decision on whether to promote the visual URL 216 on whether promotion of the visual URL 216 would violate one or more predetermined restrictions on promotion.
- Example restrictions can relate to a length of the title portion 212 , types of content that can be included in the title portion 212 , and/or the existence of redundant content (e.g., anywhere in the creative 210 a ).
- the visual URL engine 132 can evaluate one or more metrics associated with the creative 210 a that are related, e.g., to a geographic location of where the creative is to be served, a particular user or demographic to whom the creative is to be displayed, an environment associated with the serving of the creative, and/or a relative projected performance of the creative with and without content added to the title portion 212 .
- the visual URL satisfies one or more promotion criterion ( 332 )
- the visual URL is promoted for inclusion in the title portion ( 334 ).
- the modified visual URL 216 b has been promoted to the title portion 212 in the creative 210 a .
- the reference to the World Wide Web e.g., the “www” portion
- the URL has been truncated to remove all but the domain information (e.g., removing “/index/XYZ”).
- the creative is provided, including the title portion with the promoted complete phrase and/or visual URL ( 336 ). For example, if the complete phrase 214 a was promoted, then the content management system 110 can then provide the creative 210 b containing the promoted complete phrase. If the visual URL 216 (or the modified visual URL 216 b ) was promoted, then the content management system 110 can then provide the creative 210 b containing the promoted visual URL 216 . In either example, the creative 210 b can be the content item 220 that the content management system 110 provides in response to the request for content 202 , e.g., to fill the content item slot 204 .
