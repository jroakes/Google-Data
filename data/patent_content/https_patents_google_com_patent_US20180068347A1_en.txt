Abstract
Systems and methods for generating a browsing area of a web browser include receiving a request for a new browsing area and allocating a portion of the new browsing area for a function. The function may populate the allocated portion of the new browsing area with retrieved content.
Description
- Websites and other online sources may provide content to client devices relating to any number of different topics. For example, a first website may be devoted the latest golf equipment and a second website may be devoted to automobiles. Users having an interest in a particular topic may navigate to an online content source providing content related to that topic. In some cases, a user may utilize a search engine to find online content. For example, a user may search the Internet for reviews of the latest golf equipment and the search engine may return a listing of websites devoted to reviews of golf equipment. The user may navigate between the various websites in the listing to view the various websites.
- Implementations of the systems and methods for generating a browsing area in a web browser are described herein. One implementation is a computerized method for generating a browsing area of a web browser. The method includes receiving, at a processing circuit, a request for a new browsing area of the web browser. The method also includes allocating, by the processing circuit, a portion of the new browsing area for a function. The method further includes retrieving, via a network interface, content selected by a content selection engine for the function, in response to receiving the request for a new browsing area. The method yet further includes populating the allocated portion of the new browsing area with the retrieved selected content.
- Another implementation is a system for generating a browsing area of a web browser. The system includes a processing circuit operable to receive a request for a new browsing area of the web browser. The processing circuit is also operable to allocate a portion of the new browsing area for a function. The processing circuit is further operable to retrieve, via a network interface, content selected by a content selection engine for the function, in response to receiving the request for a new browsing area. The processing circuit is yet further operable to populate the allocated portion of the new browsing area with the retrieved selected content.
- A further implementation is a tangible computer-readable storage medium having instructions therein, the instructions being executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform operations. The operations include receiving a request for a new browsing area of the web browser. The operations also include allocating a portion of the new browsing area for a function. The operations further include retrieving, via a network interface, content selected by a content selection engine for the function, in response to receiving the request for a new browsing area. The operations also include populating the allocated portion of the new browsing area with the retrieved selected content.
- These implementations are mentioned not to limit or define the scope of this disclosure, but to provide examples of implementations to aid in understanding thereof.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims, in which:
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system in accordance with a described implementation; -
FIG. 2 is an illustration of an electronic display showing an example web browser; -
FIG. 3 is an example illustration of a new browsing area being generated by a web browser; -
FIG. 4 is an example illustration of content being included in a new browsing area of a web browser; and -
FIG. 5 is an example process for generating a new browsing area of a web browser. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- According to aspects of the present disclosure, an electronic device may access content remotely via a network. For example, a personal computer may be used to retrieve a webpage from a content source via the Internet. In various implementations, an electronic device may execute a web browser application configured to request the content and to display retrieved content. For example, a user of the electronic device may navigate to a particular webpage by specifying a uniform resource locator (URL) to the web browser. The web browser may then request and retrieve webpage data from the network location that corresponds to the URL.
- In various implementations, a web browser may be configured to utilize a plurality of browsing areas. In general, a browsing area refers to an area of a displayed web browser in which retrieved content may be displayed. For example, a web browser may display a retrieved webpage within a particular window and/or tab of the web browser. Multiple browsing areas allow for content from disparate sources to remain active within the web browser at the same time. In some cases, two or more browsing areas may be displayed at the same time. In other cases, a user may switch between browsing areas to quickly display different content. For example, a first webpage may be opened in a first tab and a second webpage may be opened in a second tab. In such a case, a user may alternate between tabs to view the first or second webpage.
- A web browser may be configured to open and/or close browsing areas in response to receiving input from an interface device, according to various implementations. For example, a user may operate a mouse, keyboard, touchscreen display, or other form of interface device to request that a new window or tab be opened by the web browser. In some implementations, a new browsing area may be blank (e.g., displaying only whitespace) when the browsing area is first generated. In other implementations, at least a portion of a new browsing area may be allocated for additional functions and/or content. For example, a newly opened window in a web browser may display suggested content for a user (e.g., a link to a website frequently visited by the user, a retrieved advertisement, etc.).
- For situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about a user, or may make use of personal information, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control which programs or features collect such information, the types of information that may be collected (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, a user's current location, etc.), and/or how third-party content may be selected by a content selection service and presented to the user. Certain data, such as a device identifier, may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters) used by the content selection service to select third-party content. For example, a device identifier may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information about its corresponding user can be determined from it. In another example, a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a precise location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content selection service.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , a block diagram of acomputer system 100 in accordance with a described implementation is shown.System 100 includes aclient 102 which communicates with other computing devices via anetwork 106.Client 102 may execute a web browser or other application (e.g., a video game, a messaging program, etc.) to retrieve content from other devices overnetwork 106. For example,client 102 may communicate with any number ofcontent sources 108, 110 (e.g., a first content source through nth content source), which provide electronic content toclient 102, such as webpage data and/or other content (e.g., text documents, PDF files, and other forms of electronic documents). In some implementations,computer system 100 may also include acontent selection engine 104 configured to select content to be provided toclient 102. For example,content selection engine 104 may select which content fromcontent sources client 102. In another example,content selection engine 104 may itself provide selected content toclient 102. -
Network 106 may be any form of computer network that relays information betweenclient 102,content sources content selection engine 104. For example,network 106 may include the Internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, satellite network, or other types of data networks.Network 106 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computer, servers, routers, network switches, etc.) that are configured to receive and/or transmit data withinnetwork 106.Network 106 may further include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections. For example,client 102 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to other computing devices innetwork 106. -
Client 102 may be any number of different types of electronic devices configured to communicate via network 106 (e.g., a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a digital video recorder, a set-top box for a television, a video game console, combinations thereof, etc.).Client 102 is shown to include aprocessor 112 and amemory 114, i.e., a processing circuit.Memory 114 may store machine instructions that, when executed byprocessor 112cause processor 112 to perform one or more of the operations described herein.Processor 112 may include a microprocessor, ASIC, FPGA, etc., or combinations thereof.Memory 114 may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providingprocessor 112 with program instructions.Memory 114 may include a floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic disk, memory chip, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory, optical media, or any other suitable memory from whichprocessor 112 can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable computer programming language such as, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, HTML, XML, Python and Visual Basic. -
Client 102 may include one or more user interface devices. A user interface device may be any electronic device that conveys data to a user by generating sensory information (e.g., a visualization on a display, one or more sounds, etc.) and/or converts received sensory information from a user into electronic signals (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a pointing device, a touch screen display, a microphone, etc.). The one or more user interface devices may be internal to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a built-in display, microphone, etc.) or external to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a monitor connected toclient 102, a speaker connected toclient 102, etc.), according to various implementations. For example,client 102 may include anelectronic display 116, which displays webpages and other forms of content received fromcontent sources content selection engine 104. -
Content sources client 102. For example,content sources client 102,content sources processors memories processors content source 108 may include instructions such as web server software, FTP serving software, and other types of software that causecontent source 108 to provide content vianetwork 106. -
Content selection engine 104 may be one or more electronic devices connected to network 106 and configured to select content to be provided toclient 102.Content selection engine 104 may be a computer server (e.g., an FTP server, file sharing server, web server, etc.) or a combination of servers (e.g., a data center, a cloud computing platform, etc.).Content selection engine 104 may include a processing circuit including aprocessor 120 and amemory 122 that stores program instructions executable byprocessor 120. In cases in whichcontent selection engine 104 is a combination of computing devices,processor 120 may represent the collective processors of the devices andmemory 122 may represent the collective memories of the devices. In other implementations, the functionality ofcontent selection engine 104 may be integrated intocontent sources network 106. - In some implementations, a user of
client 102 may elect to allowcontent selection engine 104 to identify and store data relating toclient 102 and the user. For example, the user may elect to receive content selected bycontent selection engine 104 that may be more relevant to him or her. In one implementation, a device identifier forclient 102 may be randomized and contain no personally-identifiable information about the user ofclient 102. Thus, the user ofclient 102 may have control over how information is collected and used bycontent selection engine 104, in various implementations. - If the user of
client 102 elects to receive relevant content,content selection engine 104 may store a device identifier to representclient 102. A device identifier may be associated with one or more other device identifiers, in some implementations. For example, a device identifier associated withclient 102 may also be associated with a device identifier for the user's mobile phone. Such an association may be made, for example, by the user ofclient 102 logging into the same online account or profile from different devices, according to some implementations. In various implementations, a device identifier may be, but is not limited to, a cookie, a network address, an email address, a screen name or other alias, a hardware-based identifier (e.g., an identifier based on the device's MAC address, etc.), or a universally unique identifier (UUID). -
Content selection engine 104 may select relevant content (e.g., an advertisement or other form of online content) based on a device identifier. In some implementations,content selection engine 104 may store history data indicative of webpages visited byclient 102 and analyze the content of the webpages to identify themes in which the user may be interested. For example,client 102 may be used to access a number of webpages devoted to golf. In such a case, an interest category of golf may be assigned to a device identifier associated withclient 102. Golf-related content may then be selected bycontent selection engine 104 to enhance the browsing experience of the user. In some implementations,content selection engine 104 may conduct a content auction to allow different content sources to compete to provide relevant content toclient 102. For example, online retailers of golf equipment may compete in a content auction to provide an advertisement toclient 102, if an interest category of golf is assigned to the device identifier associated withclient 102. In further implementations, the content auction may be a placement auction for a particular content space displayed by a web browser (e.g., banner area along the top of the web browser, a space displayed along the side of the web browser, an area of a new window of the web browser, etc.). - Relevant content may be provided to
client 102 bycontent sources content selection engine 104. For example,content selection engine 104 may select relevant content fromcontent source 110 to be included with a webpage served bycontent source 108. In another example,content selection engine 104 may provide the selected content directly toclient 102. In some implementations,content selection engine 104 may select content stored inmemory 114 ofclient 102. For example, previously provided content from a content source may be stored inmemory 114, content may be loaded into memory 114 (e.g., as part of the installation of an application), or may exist as part of the operating system ofclient 102. In such cases,content selection engine 104 may provide an indication of the selection toclient 102. In response,client 102 may retrieve the selected content frommemory 114 and display it onelectronic display 116. - In various implementations, a web browser on
client 102 may be configured to generate a browsing area in response to receiving input from an interface device ofclient 102. For example, the web browser may generate a browsing area when the web browser is opened, a new tab is requested, or a new window is requested. In some implementations, a newly generated browsing area may include links to suggested content based on history data stored inmemory 114. For example, links to the most frequently visited websites byclient 102 may be displayed in a newly generated browsing area based on browsing history stored inmemory 114. In further implementations,client 102 may request content fromcontent selection engine 104 in response to receiving a request for a new browsing area. In such a case,content selection engine 104 may select content, such as an advertisement, to be displayed in the newly generated browsing area. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , an illustration is shown ofelectronic display 116 displaying anexample web browser 200.Web browser 200 may be displayed onelectronic display 116 in response toprocessor 112 executing instructions stored inmemory 114. In various implementations,electronic display 116 may be located inside or outside of the same housing as that ofprocessor 112 and/ormemory 114. For example,electronic display 116 may be an external display, such as a computer monitor, television set, or any other stand-alone form of electronic display. In other examples,electronic display 116 may be integrated into the housing of a laptop computer, mobile device, or other form of computing device having an integrated display. - As shown,
web browser 200 may include aninput field 202 configured to receive a network address. A network address may be a URL, Internet Protocol (IP) address, file transfer protocol (FTP) address, or other similar form of data that identifies a device located on a network. For example, the URL http://www.example.com/sports.html may be entered intoinput field 202. In another example, http://192.0.43.10/sports.html may be entered instead to use the IP address of the content source that serves the website for www.example.com.Web browser 200 may send a request for content to the network address specified ininput field 202. For example,web browser 200 may request webpage data from www.example.com, such as the file, sports.html. In general, webpage data may include text, hyperlinks, layout information, and other data that may be used to provide the framework for the visual layout of a webpage byweb browser 200. -
Web browser 200 may includebrowsing area 204 in which retrieved content may be displayed onelectronic display 116. In some implementations, retrieved webpage data may be one or more files of webpage code written in a markup language, such as the hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible HTML (XHTML), extensible markup language (XML), or any other markup language. The webpage data may include data that specifies where indicia appear inbrowsing area 204, such astext 206. In other words,web browser 200 may process the webpage data to render the webpage inbrowsing area 204. In some implementations, webpage data may include links to additional data and/or scripts that causeweb browser 200 to retrieve additional content. For example, the file, “sports.html,” may include one or more instructions used byprocessor 112 to retrieve images 208-212 from their respective content sources. -
Web browser 200 may include a number of controls associated with navigating between webpages. For example,web browser 200 may include the ability to go back or forward to other webpages using inputs 214 (e.g., a back button, a forward button, etc.).Web browser 200 may also include inputs to control the processing of a webpage (e.g., a stop button, a refresh button, a zoom button, etc.). In some implementations,web browser 200 may include one ormore scroll bars display area 204 that are currently not being displayed by electronic display 116 (e.g., parts of a webpage that are currently off-screen). For example, a webpage may be formatted to be larger than the screen ofelectronic display 116. In such a case,scroll bars electronic display 116. -
Web browser 200 may include various inputs configured to control the display ofweb browser 200 onelectronic display 116. In some cases,web browser 200 may include aninput 216 configured to causeweb browser 200 to be minimized onelectronic display 116. Selection ofinput 216, for example, may cause other applications, file system windows, and/or a desktop of an operating system to be displayed onelectronic display 116.Web browser 200 may include aninput 218 configured to causeweb browser 200 to be maximized onelectronic display 116. Selection ofinput 218 may causeonly web browser 200 to be displayed (e.g., other applications, folders, desktops, etc., may be hidden from view).Web browser 200 may also include aninput 220 configured to cause the window ofweb browser 200 to be closed. - According to various implementations,
web browser 200 may be configured to generate a new browsing area in response to receiving a request for a new browsing area. In some implementations,web browser 200 may generate a new browsing area within a new window, in response to receiving a selection of aninput 230 or via selection of a keypad hotkey. In further implementations,web browser 200 may generate a new browsing area within a new tab in response to receiving a selection of a keypad hotkey or aninput 228. In general, a new window differs from a new tab in that navigational controls are duplicated for a new window. For example, selection ofinput 230 may causeweb browser 200 to generate a new window that includes duplicates ofinputs 214,scroll bars input 228 may cause a new tab to be displayed adjacent to atab 226 in whichbrowsing area 204 is displayed. In such a case, the new tab may utilize the same controls as that oftab 226, such asinputs - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , an example illustration of a new browsing area being generated byweb browser 200 is shown. In various implementations,browsing area 304 may be generated as part of anew tab 300 byweb browser 200. For example,web browser 200 may createtab 300 in response to receiving a selection ofinput 228. Having multiple tabs open inweb browser 200 may allow for multiple browsing sessions to be active at the same time. For example,tab 226 may retain the browsing session for browsing area 204 (e.g., the webpage located at http://www.example.com/sports.html). Similarly, a second webpage may be retrieved via input of a network address into aninput field 302 associated withtab 300. The second webpage may then be displayed indisplay area 304. If multiple tabs are open inweb browser 200, selection of a tab (e.g.,tab 226,tab 300, etc.) may cause its respective browsing area to be displayed onelectronic display 116. - In some implementations,
browsing area 304 may be blank when it is generated byweb browser 200. For example,browsing area 304 may appear as a solid color (e.g., white or another color) or display a background graphic, whentab 300 is created byweb browser 200. In further implementations, a webpage may be automatically (i.e., without further interaction from a user) retrieved and displayed inbrowsing area 304 whentab 300 is created. For example,web browser 200 may include a parameter that specifies a default webpage to be retrieved and displayed when a new tab and/or window is opened. In another example, a browsing session may be duplicated in a newly opened tab or window (e.g., the webpage being displayed intab 226 may be automatically loaded inbrowsing area 304 whentab 300 is opened). - According to various implementations, at least a portion of
browsing area 304 may be allocated for a particular function ofweb browser 200 when browsingarea 304 is generated. The function may be within the code forweb browser 200, may be a plug-in forweb browser 200, may be a script or other form of code executed byweb browser 200, or may be a stand-alone application executed byweb browser 200. For example, afirst area 306 may be allocated for a first function and asecond area 308 may be allocated for a second function. Rather than displaying a generic background or returning a particular webpage whentab 300 is opened,areas browsing area 304 may be populated with cached content (i.e., content already stored inmemory 114 of client 102), content retrieved via a network, a video game, a chat application, one or more bookmarks (e.g., one or more links to webpages stored as parameters for web browser 200), a media file (e.g., a sound file, a video file, etc.), or the like. In further implementations, a portion ofbrowsing area 304 may be populated with suggested content, if the user ofweb browser 200 elects to receive suggested content. -
Web browser 200 may be configured to utilize one or more parameters to control which function populates a particular portion ofbrowsing area 304. In some implementations, the user ofweb browser 200 may manually set a parameter. For example, the user ofweb browser 200 may select to view a chat program whenever a new browsing area is opened byweb browser 200. In other implementations, a function forbrowsing area 304 may be selected automatically (i.e., without further input from a user). For example, a user ofweb browser 200 may elect to receive suggestions and may frequently check an email account. In such a case,web browser 200 may populate an area of a newly opened browsing area with an email function based on the user's frequent checking of the email account. Thus, the type of function used to populate a portion of a newly opened browsing area may be selected based on its relevance to the user ofweb browser 200. - In some implementations, a user may elect to receive relevant content in a newly opened browsing area of
web browser 200. For example,area 306 may be populated with a link to a webpage that has not been previously visited byweb browser 200. Such a link may be suggested byweb browser 200 based on themes of previously visited webpages. For example, assume thatweb browser 200 is used to visit a number of webpages devoted to hang gliding.Web browser 200 may then present a link in a newly opened browsing area to a different webpage that is also devoted to hang gliding. In another example, a newly opened browsing area ofweb browser 200 may be populated with an advertisement for a sale that may be of interest to the user ofweb browser 200. In some implementations,web browser 200 may request suggested content from a remote device via a network, such ascontent selection engine 104. In such a case,content selection engine 104 may analyze webpages or other online actions for a device identifier associated with the request and select the relevant content. Thus, content used to populate a portion of a newly opened browsing area may also be selected based on its potential relevance to a user ofweb browser 200. In other implementations, content may be selected for a newly opened browsing area ofweb browser 200 randomly and/or without regard to interest categories associated with a device identifier. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , an example illustration of content being included in a new browsing area ofweb browser 200 is shown. In some implementations, a newly opened browsing area, such asbrowsing area 304, may be populated by one or more functions. As shown, assume thattab 300 has been opened recently via selection ofinput 228. In response to the selection ofinput 228,web browser 200 may generatebrowsing area 304 and allocateareas browsing area 304. - In one example,
area 306 ofbrowsing area 304 may be populated by a function that lists the most visited websites byweb browser 200. For example, assume that the most frequently visited websites byweb browser 200 include a search engine website, a social network website, and a website that provides the latest sports scores. In such a case,area 306 may be populated with a graphical interface 402 that includes links to the most visited websites. For example, interface 402 may include afirst link 404 to the search engine website, asecond link 406 to the social networking website, and athird link 408 to the sports-related website. Selection of any of links 404-408 may then cause the respective website to be loaded intobrowsing area 304. In some implementations, links 404-408 may be selected based on local history forweb browser 200. For example,web browser 200 may store webpage data (e.g., images, HTML files, cookies, an index of webpage visits, etc.) in a local cache and retrieve at least a part of the webpage from local memory to reduce the loading time of the webpage. In other implementations, the user ofweb browser 200 may allow a remote device to store information about the online history ofweb browser 200. For example, the user ofweb browser 200 may allow a synchronization service and/orcontent selection engine 104 to store and use history data regarding the browsing history ofweb browser 200. - In another example,
area 308 ofbrowsing area 304 may be populated by a function that displays suggested content 410 (e.g., an advertisement for a boat).Content 410 may be static content (e.g., simply an image or text) or may include a hotlink (e.g., selection ofcontent 410 redirectsweb browser 200 to a webpage). For purposes of this example, assume that the user ofweb browser 200 has elected to view suggested content in a newly created browsing area and/or to allowing browsing history data to be used to suggest relevant content. In some implementations, a request for suggested content may be sent fromweb browser 200 tocontent selection engine 104 in response to selection of input 228 (i.e., in response to receiving a request for a new browsing area). The request may include a device identifier used bycontent selection engine 104 to select relevant content based on the identifier. For example,content selection engine 104 may retrieve browsing history data stored bycontent selection engine 104 that is associated with the device identifier.Content selection engine 104 may analyze the browsing history data to identify one or more potential interests for the device identifier and select relevant content based on an identified interest. In other implementations, the request tocontent selection engine 104 may also include the browsing history data. For example,content selection engine 104 may selectcontent 410 based on an identified interest category of sailing. In various implementations,content selection engine 104 may providecontent 410 toweb browser 200 or provide data toweb browser 200 configured to causeweb browser 200 to retrieve content 410 (e.g., from local memory or a networked content source). - A newly created browsing area may incorporate any number different functions and/or content, regardless of how the browsing area is presented by
web browser 200. For example, while browsingarea 304 is shown inFIG. 4 as being part of a newly openedtab 300,browsing area 304 may also be presented within a newly opened window. In some implementations, a tab or window may be configured to display multiple browsing areas. For example,tab 300 may include two or more browsing areas. Each browsing area may be configured to independently display content, in some cases. For example, a first browsing area may be used to review a first webpage and a second browsing area may be used to review a second webpage. When each browsing area is created, at least a portion of one or both browsing areas may be populated by a function. For example, a portion of a first browsing area may include a suggested advertisement selected based on its potential relevance to the user ofweb browser 200. - Referring now to
FIG. 5 , anexample process 500 for generating a new browsing area of a web browser is shown. In various implementations,process 500 is performed by a computing device executing a web browser. In some implementations,process 500 may be used in conjunction with the selection of online content for a device identifier. For example, content may be selected for a device identifier based on one or more interest categories identified based on browsing history data for the device identifier. -
Process 500 includes receiving a request for a new browsing area of a web browser (block 502). In some cases, a request may correspond to the selection of a button, menu, or other graphical input field of the web browser. In other cases, a request may correspond to a voice command, selection of a hotkey (e.g., CTRL+T, CTRL+N, etc.), or similar input from a user interface device. In various implementations, the request may correspond to a request to open a new tab, window, or other graphical area of the web browser. For example, a pointing device may be used to select a “New Tab” button of the web browser. In further implementations, the request may correspond to launching the web browser itself. -
Process 500 includes allocating a portion of the browsing area for a function (block 504). In response to receiving a request for a new browsing area, a new browsing area may be generated having at least a portion of the area allocated for a function. In general, the function may be any program code that populates the allocated portion of the browsing area with one or more graphical objects. For example, the function may be a chat program, email program, bookmark utility, content selection function, etc. In some implementations, one or more parameters may be used by the web browser to control which function populates the allocated portion of the browsing area. For example, a user of the web browser may manually select the function or the web browser may automatically select the function based on previous use of the web browser. -
Process 500 includes retrieving data associated with the function (block 506). In some implementations, data may be retrieved from a local memory. For example, a function that lists recently or frequently opened websites may retrieve data relating to the websites from a local memory of the device that executes the web browser. In some implementations, the function may retrieve data from a remote device. For example, a function that suggests content may request suggested content (e.g., the address of a webpage, an advertisement, etc.) from a content selection engine via a network. In some implementations, a parameter may affect which data is retrieved by a function. For example, a user of the web browser may elect to receive relevant content. In such a case, the content selection engine may analyze history data indicative of online actions performed by a device identifier (e.g., visiting a webpage, receiving content devoted to a particular theme, selecting an advertisement, making an online purchase, etc.) to determine one or more interest categories. An identified interest category for the device identifier may then be used to select the content returned to the function. -
Process 500 includes providing the data in the new browsing area of the web browser (block 508). Data retrieved by a function associated with an allocated portion of a new browsing area may be displayed in the allocated portion. For example, opening a new tab or window of the web browser may cause suggested content, such as an advertisement, to be displayed in a portion of the newly created browsing area. In another example, an email function may display a list of email messages that are part of an inbox. In a further example, a chat function may display a list of users that are currently available to chat in the allocated portion of the new browsing area. In some implementations, multiple portions of a new browsing area may be populated with data from multiple functions. - Implementations of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
