Definitions
- Digital media content such as pictures, music, documents, and video has become an indispensable part of people's daily lives. Due to the rapid development and wide deployment of wireless networks and wireless products, content sharing over a wireless network may become an efficient way to distribute media content. However, sharing and distribution is still not user-friendly.
- Three-way calling among communication devices shares voice calls among three parties.
- the steps to initiate a three-way call are tedious and complicated.
- the caller While the caller is on a two-way call using a cellular communication device, he or she may wish to invite a third party to the communication.
- the caller may press a three-way call button on the device and input the telephone number of the third party. Then, the second party will be placed on hold. After a connection with the third party is established, the caller can press the three-way button again to link the second party back to the communication.
- a device with two existing call connections cannot initiate or accept another call with a fourth party to augment the three-way communication to a four-way communication.
- PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network
- An alternative technique to the above-described three-way calling technique may include a caller on an existing two-way call setting up a point-to-point Bluetooth connection in addition to the PSTN call.
- a caller on an existing two-way call setting up a point-to-point Bluetooth connection in addition to the PSTN call.
- users may not utilize a point-to-point Bluetooth connection to add a third party to a two-way call.
- Mobile communication device users may wish to share more than just voice calls. While setting up a point-to-point Bluetooth connection allows users to share some of the above-mentioned content such as calls, pictures, music, documents, and video, most users find the Bluetooth pairing process complicated and tedious plus the transfer of content difficult.

- Bluetooth class 2 is 2.5 mW (4 dBm). It can provide up to 1 Mbps data rate with 10 meters coverage.
- the transmission power for WiFi 802.11b is 100 mW (20 dBm).
- Bluetooth can provide a good service quality and consume less power than other short-range wireless transports. Although it consumes more power, WiFi may be a better choice for video content that requires more bandwidth. However, most users are not aware of the technical differences between Bluetooth and WiFi wireless links and do not know which type of wireless link is most appropriate for particular situations.
- content such as calls, music, video, documents, and games
- two or more devices automatically determine the feasibility of sharing the content and negotiate to find an efficient manner in which to do so.
- the short-range set-up and content transfer between devices may be transparent to the users.
- a better choice of transport may be selected without user input.
- a first user's device application is active, at least a first user's device and a second user's device substantially automatically configure to share the content corresponding to the active application of the first device over a short-range wireless communication link.
- the active application of the first device may be, for example, a voice call, music playback, a document, video, or photo image display.
- Configuration information that is stored in memory, such as RAM, is used to configure the transport of a short-range wireless transceiver.
- Each device includes a near field communication (NFC) device that, when in range, initiates communication between the devices so that the devices may share content.
- the NFC is used to transfer configuration information so that two short-range transceivers of different devices set up compatible transport configurations.
- the configuration information conveys transport configurations to promote compatibility.
- the users of NFC-enabled devices may have limited or minimal personal interactions—just enough to establish that one or more users may bring the devices within range so that the NFC devices may initiate the communication.
- the users may “tap-to-configure” their devices for content sharing. Accordingly, the need for complicated and tedious processes to share content may be eliminated.
- a mobile communication device includes an NFC device and at least one short-range transceiver such as a Bluetooth transceiver or a WiFi transceiver.
- the NFC device may be configured to: transmit parameters such as configuration information and available bandwidth of it short-range wireless transceivers; transmit application type information; and receive another device's configuration information, available bandwidth, and application type information.
- a processor determines the configuration needed (and possibly the best suited) to transmit or receive digital content at an appropriate bandwidth.
- a short-range transceiver of the mobile communication device having a wireless transport configuration set in accordance with the determined configuration information, and also having an available bandwidth, may transmit data such as digital content appropriate to the active application type previously transmitted via the NFC.
- the application type information includes a maximum of one application indicator that indicates a highest priority application software program that is running on the processor.
- an application that is active on the first device may be opened and become active on the second device so that the data received from the first device via a short-range transport will be accessible to the user of the second device.
- the users of NFC-enabled devices may have limited or minimal interactions to share content.
- One or more users bring the devices within range so that the NFCs may initiate setting up short-range communication between the devices; and the appropriate transport, application, and digital content is determined without each user having to set up the transport and select the content application manually. Accordingly, the need for complicated and tedious processes for setting up two or more devices to share content may be eliminated.
- the above-described configuration process may be used for configuring a plurality of devices.
- the below-described method may include implementing a point-to-multipoint (P2M) connection in which the first wireless device has a short-range wireless point-to-point (P2P) connection with a second wireless communication device and at least one other short-range wireless P2P connection with a third wireless communication device. Therefore, more than two devices may share content such as calls, music, video, documents, and games.
- P2M point-to-multipoint
- P2P point-to-multipoint

- the mobile communication device 102 may include a cellular antenna 112 and corresponding cellular transceiver 114 .
- the cellular transceiver may support, for example, voice communication, the capability of transferring digital data, SMS messaging, Internet access, multi-media content access, and/or voice over internet protocol (VoIP).
- VoIP voice over internet protocol
- the user interface 116 allows a user access to the content of an application running on the device 102 .
- the user interface 116 may include a display 103 and a keypad 105 .
- a speaker 107 and microphone 109 may be part of a user interface 116 for voice calls, a speech recognition application, and for other audio applications. It is understood that any type of user interface 116 is within the scope of this discussion.
- Device 102 includes a near field communication (NFC) device 104 that (when in range of another NFC-enabled device) may initiate compatible configurations between two mobile communication devices so that the devices can share content.
- NFC near field communication
- an RFID is an example of an NFC device.
- Two mobile communication devices, each having compatible NFC devices may quickly transfer small amounts of information between them when in range. As will be described below, a minimum amount of information allows two devices to configure compatibly so that they may share content wirelessly at short range.
- At least one NFC device 104 is in communication with a controller 117 that may, in turn, be in communication with a processor 120 .
- the processor 120 may be a real-time voice processor for voice call sharing.
- a real-time voice processor 120 may be utilized because speech processing can be performed in a different manner than a music player at an application layer. It is understood that a processor 120 may be utilized for any suitable purpose.
- the NFC device 104 transmits short-range transceiver configuration information 122 , available bandwidth 124 for each transport configuration, and active application type information 126 .
- the NFC device 104 can also receive another device's configuration information, available bandwidth, and application type information from the other communication device's NFC device. If the controller 117 can match transport configurations, corresponding bandwidths, and application types to determine that the two devices can share content wirelessly, the two devices may implement state machines in parallel as will be described later. If the parallel state machines each conclude that content can be transferred wirelessly between the two devices, the controller 117 initiates communication between the two devices via a selected short-range transceiver.
- the mobile communication device 102 includes at least one short-range transceiver 106 that can be, for example, of the Bluetooth or WiFi type. Additional short-range transceivers 108 and 110 may provide more transport options between two or more devices. Of course, a short-range transceiver may be of any suitable type.
- the mobile communication device 102 further includes a memory 128 and modules 130 that carry out certain processes of the methods as described herein.
- Modules may include, for example, a Bluetooth available bandwidth module 164 and a WiFi available bandwidth module 168 that keep track of bandwidth utilizations by the device 102 for each transport, as well as modules to determine the content type and availability of applications, such as a voice call module 133 , an image module 135 , a music module 137 , and/or a video module 139 .
- Steps of methods may involve modules and other modules (not discussed here) may be inferred by the methods discussed herein.
- the modules can be implemented in software, such as in the form of one or more sets of pre-stored instructions, and/or hardware.
- the modules may be installed at the factory or can be installed after distribution by, for example, a downloading operation. The operations of the device in accordance with the modules will be discussed in more detail below.
- Software applications 132 may be stored in memory 128 such as ROM and may include, for example, a call application, an image application, an audio application, a video application, a word processing application, and other applications. It is understood that any content processing application is within the scope of this discussion. One or more types of content processing applications may be executed by the controller 117 .
- Short-range transceiver software stacks 134 include a WiFi stack that would be loaded onto WiFi transceiver 106 , a Bluetooth stack that would be loaded onto Bluetooth transceiver 108 and/or other short-range wireless communication software stacks that may be loaded onto another type of transceiver 110 .
- the software stacks 134 may be in different memory structures.
- the shared memory 138 may be the same as or a subset of memory 128 , or may be independent of memory 128 .
- the software stacks 134 and the applications 132 may be stored in the memory 128 and may be updated separately.
- the configuration information 136 may be updated either upon power up of the device 102 or when the transport configuration has been changed by a device monitor 140 which may be a component of the controller 117 .
- the device monitor 140 tracks information relating to the short-range wireless transceivers 106 , 108 , 110 , and the applications 132 . It records this information as device state information.
- the application information 132 may be updated either when a “tap-to-configure” action (discussed below) occurs or when content sharing is established.
- the communication by the NFC device 104 of configuration information 122 , available bandwidth 124 , and application type information 126 can be accessed via the NFC device 104 transponder link.
- a device record list that can store NFC-communicated information resides in memory 128 .
- this device 102 may find an appropriate configuration for content sharing with the other device, bring up the appropriate software stack 134 , establish a short-range wireless connection, bring up the application 132 corresponding to the content to be shared, and start to share the content via the established short-range transceiver, for example, 106 , 108 , or 110 .
- a synchronization mechanism 118 automatically determines the selection, configuration, and setup of a short-range transceiver 106 , 108 , or 110 , automatically selects and configures corresponding applications 132 for the sharing of content, and automatically synchronizes the sharing procedure.
- the device monitor 140 monitors and modifies the device state information, including configuration information 136 , when the device state and/or configuration changes.
- FIG. 2 depicts a “tap-to-configure” example including a first device 202 , a second device 241 , and a third device 242 .
- the first device 202 is in a two-way voice call with a remote communication device (not shown) via a network 246 .
- the devices 202 , 241 , and 242 may each be implemented as wireless communication device 102 in accordance with FIG. 1 .
- the network 246 may be any type of wireless network including an ad hoc or wireless personal area network, a WiFi or wireless local area network, and a cellular or wireless wide area network. Likewise, the network 246 may be of any suitable configuration. The depiction of a network in FIG. 2 is simplified for illustrative purposes.
- mobile communication devices may include features such as still and video cameras, video streaming and two-way video calling, email functionality, Internet browsers, music players, FM radios with stereo audio, games, word processors, and organizers.
- Content for feature applications that may run on a mobile communication device includes, for example, voice content type, image content type, audio content type, video content type, and document and text content type.
- voice communication is transmitted via the network 246 to the device 202 .
- a short-range wireless connection between device 202 and 241 may be set up to share the voice communication.
- a “tap-to-configure” 244 between device 202 and device 242 sets up a connection between device 202 and 242 substantially transparently to the users.
- the NFC device 104 (see FIG. 1 ) of mobile communication device 202 transmits to the second device 241 short-range transceiver 106 , 108 and 110 parameters such as configuration information 122 and available bandwidth 124 , plus application type information 126 , and receives the second device's configuration information 122 , available bandwidth 124 , and application type information 126 .
- the NFC device 104 of mobile communication device 202 may transmit configuration information 122 , available bandwidth 124 , and application type information 126 to a third device 242 , and receive the third device's configuration information, available bandwidth, and application type information. It is understood that other information and/or parameters may be exchanged during a “tap-to-configure” action.
- a “tap-to-configure” characteristic allows a small amount of information to be transmitted between two NFC devices of two mobile communication devices.
- users may tap, nearly tap, and/or bring together to a predetermined distance (that can be determined by the configuration of the NFC devices), their devices without being required to hold the mobile communication devices together for an extended period.
- the NFC device 104 can provide information to determine an appropriate short-range transport (via a short-range transceiver 106 , 108 and/or 110 ) for transmitting and receiving digital content from one device to the other device.
- the transport could be for example, Bluetooth, WiFi, and/or another transport.
- the available bandwidth of the transports may be a determining factor in selecting a particular transport.
- a voice call sharing application software program may be selected and configured on two devices such as 202 and 241 for transmitting voice content from the first wireless communication device to the second wireless communication device over a short-range wireless communication link to result in a 3-way call.
- the “tap-to-configure” characteristic may simplify the process of connection establishment and content sharing over wireless local connectivity such as Bluetooth or WiFi.
- the NFC devices assist to substantially automatically set up compatible short-range wireless transceivers.
- the wireless short-range transceivers are set up to share the content corresponding to the active application of the first device 202 between the first device 202 and second device 241 .
- Another software program on the second device 241 may be initiated to facilitate the voice call sharing.
- the processor 120 may be a real-time voice processor for voice call sharing. Real-time voice processors on both devices 202 and 241 may be utilized because speech processing may be performed in a different manner than a music player at an application layer. Therefore, with a “tap-to-configure” 243 motion, the devices 202 and 241 may automatically select and configure corresponding applications for both devices for sharing content, and may automatically synchronize the sharing procedure among the participating devices 202 , 241 .
- FIG. 2 further illustrates various relationships that a plurality of devices may have with one another while in short-range communication with one another.
- a “tap-to-configure” 244 motion with device 242 sets up a second short-range wireless connection between device 202 and device 242 . It is understood that any number of devices may have a connection set up between them with a “tap-to-configure” motion as long as bandwidth is available.
- device 202 is in a “point-to-multipoint” (P2M) configuration with devices 241 and 242 .

- the devices may touch or otherwise come within range of one another 336 so that their respective NFC devices establish a near-field communication link 348 .
- Information passed from device 302 and received by device 341 through the transponder link 348 may include the first device's configuration information, available bandwidth, and application type information.
- information passed from device 341 and received by device 302 through the transponder link 349 may include the second device's configuration information, available bandwidth, and application type information.
- An NFC device 104 (see FIG. 1 ) may transmit and receive information at, for example, 400 KB/sec. The data format for the communication between devices in accordance with their respective NFC device is discussed in detail below.
- FIG. 4 is a high-level diagram of different possible components of the configuration information 422 , the available connectivity capabilities 424 , and the application type 426 that a wireless communication device 402 may transmit via its NFC device 104 (see FIG. 1 ) to another wireless communication device.
- the disclosed methods and devices make use of the sharing of short-range device configuration information, bandwidth availability information, content information, and application information to automatically synchronize the content sharing between two or more NFC-compatible wireless devices to provide high-quality short-range content sharing and save battery power.
- a specific data format is used to encapsulate the NFC-transmitted information. It is understood that any appropriate data format may be employed.
- the NFC-transmitted data may include, for example, the short-range wireless transceiver capability of the mobile devices, the detailed configuration information of each short-range wireless transceiver, the type and detailed configuration information of the application consuming the sharing content, and the type, size, pointer and other relevant information of the sharing content.
- a method for content sharing may be able to fulfill the following functionalities: automatically record and update the NFC-transmitted information, transfer the NFC-transmitted information among participants, automatically synchronize the configuration and setup of the short-range wireless connection, automatically select and configure corresponding applications for the sharing content, and automatically synchronize the sharing procedure among mobile devices.
- a generic method and apparatus may provide the above functionalities along with a high quality user experience and battery life savings.
- a solution for the sharing task may be carried out transparently to the users or with minimal user interaction.
- a device record list can store entries of NFC-communicated information. As mentioned above, the device record list is in memory 128 (see FIG. 1 ). Each entry of the device record list may have a unique device ID and the NFC-transmitted information for that device. The unique device ID may be a combination of the Bluetooth device address and the WiFi MAC address or may be other information that can identify the device.
- the NFC-transmitted information of the record may include (i) a permanent part and (ii) a variable part. An example of a permanent part of the NFC-transmitted information is the device's local connectivity capabilities. An example of a variable part of the NFC-transmitted information is a device's state reflecting current main activity, e.g. “VOICE CALL” or “PLAYING AUDIO.”
- the second device can record the unique device ID and other information and configure its short-range communication interface (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi or other connectivity modules 134 (see FIG. 1 )) for execution by the controller 117 to effect operation of the short-range transceivers. If the second device finds a matching record for the first device's ID, it can update the variable part of the record upon receiving peer NFC-transmitted information.

If multiple applications or functions are active, a user interface may prompt the user with options from which to choose. For example, after two phones “tap-to-configure,” a user of one phone may choose to join a telephone call in which the other phone is engaged.
- the application indicator may be, for example, a call sharing application indicator 433 , an image viewer application indicator 435 , an audio player application indicator 437 , a video player application indicator 439 , or a document and text editing application indicator (not shown).

- FIG. 5 is a signal flow diagram illustrating a Bluetooth connection using a virtual link key and NFC information sent between a first wireless communication device 502 and a second wireless communication device 541 .
- the devices 502 , 541 may both be implemented as a wireless communication device 102 of FIG. 1 .
- the processor 120 (see FIG. 1 ) may be a real-time voice processor for voice call sharing.
- a real-time voice processor 120 is assumed in this example because sharing a voice call locally requires capability for processing voice audio streams from two or more different places simultaneously inside the device 502 .
- the device combines inbound audio from multiple channels together before sending it to the speaker.
- the master device 502 may have control over client devices, for example device 541 , for enhanced functions such as muting incoming or outgoing audio from/to a client participant, and/or tearing down the connection with the client.

- Device 502 generates a virtual link key Kv 571 and saves it to its NFC shared memory 138 (see FIG. 1 ).
- a virtual link key Kv is a randomized 128-bit number generated by the communication processor of the master device upon the touch of the two devices. This process may be more secure compared with using a link key 454 (see FIG. 4 ) because the virtual link key is generated anew every time the two devices touch via NFC.
- information including configuration information, available bandwidth, and application type information is transmitted 548 from device 541 and received by device 502 .
- information including configuration information, available bandwidth, and application type information is transmitted 549 from device 502 and received by device 541 .
- Transmission steps 548 and 549 can alternately occur in the reverse order or simultaneously. That is, a communication controller or processor of the master device (e.g., device 502 ) reads the NFC-transmitted information of the second device (e.g., device 541 ) via NFC during the “tap-to-configure” 543 user action. The communication controller or processor of device 541 also reads the NFC-transmitted information of the first wireless communication device 502 via NFC during the “tap-to-configure” 543 .

- Device 502 and device 541 determine a wireless communication channel in accordance with their respective short-range transceivers (e.g. Bluetooth transceivers) and determine the available bandwidth in accordance with their respective available Bluetooth bandwidth module 164 , as well as determine the content type and availability of applications in accordance with their respective applications modules, such as a voice call module 133 . That is, device 502 and device 541 both independently reach a state machine START state 576 , 577 again as the result of finding the connection channel successfully.
- the NFC information may be updated but not necessarily re-transmitted (as will be discussed in more detail below).
- the first wireless communication device 502 established 578 a short-range transport such as a Bluetooth connection, with the second wireless communication device 541 .
- the device's 502 audio processor's stream routing component may control the audio mix and audio split. It may combine the audio input from the local connectivity component of device 541 and the cellular communication component of the remote device (not shown) before it sends the combined audio to the speaker. It may pick up the audio from the microphone and split it to the local connectivity components in use and to the cellular communication component if device 502 is directly involved in the cellular call. Processor 120 (see FIG. 1 ) of device 502 may also accept requests from the communication processor or controller 117 to mute, and/or increase/decrease voice volume for different channels.
- a control module can discard the data from/to that individual connection and resume it later upon request by device 502 .
- Device 502 may keep track of the whole connection network to control device 541 (and any other devices which are not directly connected to it), or allow device 541 (or another device) to control mute, and/or increase/decrease voice volume for other devices.
- a device 502 may use AT commands (including non-standard AT commands) to mute the microphone of a directly-connected device 541 .
- AT commands including non-standard AT commands
- a directly-connected device 541 can be used as a relay to send commands to indirectly-connected devices as addressed.
- a directly-connected device may be instructed to implement its received call control commands “downstream” to other devices.
- the audio processor 120 may also accept requests from its communication processor or controller 117 to mute audio paths, increase/decrease voice volume for the different paths, or to exert any other type of control on the audio stream.
- the audio processor of device 502 may also be able to provide various forms of signal processing on the composite audio streams depending on which path it is operating upon.
- the composite uplink audio stream to a short-range wireless transceiver such as Bluetooth transceiver 108 (see FIG. 1 ) and the short-range connectivity components may have echo cancellation, noise suppression, and any other digital filtering necessary or desirable.
- the audio sent from the audio processor of device 541 to the codec speaker of device 541 may also have some type of audio shaping performed on it to make the audio sound clean to the user of device 541 . It may also have sidetone added for comfort.
- the voice call is shared 581 and 582 between devices 502 and 541 via their respective short-range wireless transceivers. If either device 502 or device 541 fails to successfully con figure 579 or 580 their audio path, an error message may be reported to the user interface. If the voice call sharing is ended 583 , 584 because either one of the users hangs-up the call or the connection drops for any reason, the controller 117 (see FIG. 1 ) of device 502 and device 541 may update 585 , 586 the NFC information, which is not necessarily re-transmitted with the released connection resource.
- the described signal flow diagram is an embodiment of the voice call sharing. It is understood that any number of alternative applications may follow the same or similar process. For example, in another embodiment, images, music, documents, or video may be similarly shared.
- the single call sharing scenario can also be extended to a second case where both mobile phones are in separate cellular network calls with different parties.
- both parties might wish to share the ongoing calls with each other, effectively creating a 4-way conference call with the two separate cellular network calls via the local connectivity component.
- Such a scenario may be likely to occur among friends, family members, and work colleagues in a variety of situations. Touching the two mobile phones together is a natural and intuitive way for persons to share the separate ongoing call(s) with each other.
- FIG. 6 depicts an example of call sharing between co-located devices.
- the devices are co-located so that they may “tap-to-configure” to set up their communication. Also in this example, they communicate over short-range wireless transports such as Bluetooth or WiFi, which means if they move out of range, they will lose their connection.
- Device 602 is in communication with a remote party via a cellular network 646 , and so the devices can share this remote party call with a variety of co-located devices.
- device 602 is in a “point-to-multipoint” (P2M) configuration with co-located devices 641 and 642 .
- P2M point-to-multipoint

- the state S ij indicates the device starts to share media using application type i over transport j.
- the sequence of application types is random.
- the sequence of the transports is listed by priority for each application type. Transport j has higher priority than transport j+1. For each given application type i, the transport m has the lowest priority.

- the P2PSM 1000 will transition to the End state 1095 , which will automatically sink to the Start state 1094 .
- the reason for separating the End state 1095 from the Start state 1094 is that it may be necessary to call some special processes at the End state 1095 , such as an error handling process.
- Specific policies for failure conditions can have special requirements for certain types of content or for certain network topologies.

- the BT configuration payload can contain, for example, six parameters: a byte indicating the type of configuration data (defines the usage of the BT Authentication Value parameter: discovery only, PIN, or public key), the 6-byte Bluetooth Device address of the sending device, the 3-byte Class of Device, a 16-byte value to be used in creating the PIN for the subsequent Bluetooth connection, a short name length field, and a short name.
- FIG. 15 is a table that specifies the format of the combined “Wla,” “WiFi conf length,” and “WiFi configuration” fields 1329 shown in FIG. 13 .
- the WiFi configuration record contains the record type “Wla”, the length in bytes of the configuration, and the configuration payload.
- the WiFi configuration payload shall contain two mandatory parameters according to: the WLAN standard (such as IEEE Standard 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or a combination thereof) and the Service Set Identifier (SSID).
- SSID Service Set Identifier
- Several optional parameters may include: a Connection Mode (Infrastructure or Ad-hoc) and RF Channel Id, Encryption type and corresponding keys, and the Ethernet MAC address of the peer.
- FIG. 16 is a table that specifies the format for the combined “St,” “State info length,” and State information” fields 1340 shown in FIG. 13 .
- the type of the state information record is “St”.
- the state info_length is an unsigned integer indicating the number of octets of the state information. It is understood that any variations in the NFC-transmitted information is within the scope of this discussion.
- the pairing between devices may be transparent to the users.
- a better choice in a transport may be selected without much user input.
- At least the first wireless communication device and a second wireless communication device may substantially automatically initiate communication to share the content corresponding to the active application of the first wireless communication device between the first device and second device using a short-range communication link.
- Each device includes a near field communication (NFC) device that (when in range of the other NFC device) may initiate communication between the wireless communication devices so that the devices may share content.
- NFC near field communication
- the users of NFC enabled devices may have little or minimal interactions except that one or more users may bring the devices within range (e.g., “tap-to-configure”) so that the NFCs may initiate the pairing between the devices. Accordingly, the need for complicated and tedious processes to share content may be eliminated.
Abstract
Description
Γ has 3×m elements, where m is the number of transports the mobile device has. Tj indicates whether the transport of type j is fully occupied or not. Tj=1 indicates the transport of type j is fully occupied. The full occupation may be because there is no more channels available or there is no bandwidth left. Tj=0 indicates the transport of type j is still available for further uses. Lj is the number of connections existing for transport of type j. For example, if the Bluetooth transport is associated with i=1, L1=4 indicates that four Bluetooth connections exist. Pj is the accumulated throughput used on the transport of type j, given as a percentage.
In this example, the WiFi transport is associated with j=2. L2=2 indicates there are two WiFi connections. P2=40 indicates that 40% of the WiFi data rate is used and there is 60% bandwidth left, which is 11 Mbps×60%=6.6 Mbps.

(a 3×m dimension matrix with all 0s).
Γ0 signifies that none of the transports of the device are occupied, that there are no connections with other devices, and that no bandwidth is consumed. Table 2 provides a specification of ω in accordance with an embodiment.
TABLE 2 | ||||
State | Input | Output | ||
NON | TOUCH | Γ = Γ0 | ||
P2P | A × Γ × B = 0 | Γ = Γ0 | ||
P2P | RESET | Γ = Γ0 | ||
P2P | TOUCH | Γ = Γ | ||
P2M | A × Γ × B = 1 | Γ = Γ | ||
P2M | TOUCH | Γ = Γ | ||
P2M | RESET | Γ = Γ0 | ||
Thus, in certain situations the Synchronism Mechanism State Machine output Γ is reset to Γ0 and in other situations the output of the high-level Synchronism Mechanism State Machine remains the same at Γ.

S22 | Share audio content over WiFi connection. |
S31 | S31 - Share video content over Bluetooth connection. |
S32 | S32 - Share video content over WiFi connection. |
In this example, the Bluetooth transport has higher priority than the WiFi transport because Bluetooth consumes less power, which is important for mobile device battery life. Thus, the Bluetooth is explored first (e.g., SX1=BT, SX2=WiFi) in this example.
