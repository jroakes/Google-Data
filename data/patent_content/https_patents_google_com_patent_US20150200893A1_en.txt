Definitions
- Collaboration is often helpful in drafting media, including documents, presentations, spreadsheets, images, and other productions. Even if a document drafter is intimately familiar with every topic broached in the document, the drafter cannot know how other people will interpret the writing without asking them.
- Collaboration tools are thus a key feature of applications for producing media. Such applications generally offer the ability to track how different users edited a file, allowing the users to readily identify which parts of their file require revision. But collaborating in standalone programs can make collaboration unwieldy. A user must wait for collaborators to send a file to see the latest edits to and comments on the file, and as a collaborative group grows in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to be sure that a given version is the most up-to-date file available.
- Web applications improve on standalone programs in part by allowing real-time collaboration.
- An online word processor like Google Docs stores documents on a server, providing the latest version to users accessing the document and updating the version as users edit the document. Multiple users can therefore edit a document at the same time, allowing real-time collaboration even when the collaborators are geographically dispersed.
- web applications like standalone applications, require users to independently identify collaborators.
- the systems and methods described herein relate to identifying and communicating with potential collaborators.
- the systems and methods described herein may identify potential collaborators who are well-positioned to offer the assistance the user needs but need not be known to the user.
- the systems and methods described herein can restrict collaborator access to those parts of the document relevant to the user need for assistance.
- the systems and methods described herein relate to, in one aspect, a system for identifying a collaborator, providing the collaborator with a portion of the document related to the user collaboration request, and receiving a response from the collaborator.
- the system described herein relates to identifying and collaborating with third-party collaborators.
- the system includes a user database, a document processor, a document database, a request identification processor, a natural language processor, and a message processor.
- the user database stores at least one user permitted to edit a document, which is displayed by the document engine and stored by the document database.
- the user database may also store a membership of a user in a group, a collaborator rating of a user, expertise of a user in a subject matter, some other information regarding the user as a collaborator, or some combination thereof.
- expertise may be determined by a subject matter of a document the user is authorized to edit.
- the request identification processor identifies a user request for collaboration and a portion of the document associated with the request.
- the natural language processor identifies a request subject matter associated with the user request and a document subject matter associated with the document.
- the document subject matter is also stored in the document database.
- the message processor identifies a candidate pool of at least one receiving collaborator based on at least one of the request subject matter and the document subject matter. In certain embodiments, the candidate pool is further based on membership in at least one group of at least one user permitted to edit the document, a collaborator rating, or other suitable identifying information.
- the message processor generates a message related to the user request and sends the message to at least one receiving collaborator in the candidate pool.
- the message processor grants the at least one responding collaborator access to the portion of the document associated with the request.
- the message processor further receives a response from a responding collaborator and provides the response to the requesting user, in certain embodiments by embedding the response within the document.
- the message processor may change a collaborator rating based on a user reply to the collaborator response.
- the message processor may also rescind collaborator access in response to a predetermined criteria, which may include a user action or, in embodiments in which the system includes a timer, in response to the passage of a predetermined length of time.
- the method described herein identifies and requests assistance from third-party collaborators.
- the method may include providing, at a server, a document generated by at least one user and having content including a document subject matter.
- the server receives a request from the at least one user, the request having a request subject matter, and identifies at least one of the document subject matter and the request subject matter.
- the server may use at least one of the document subject matter and the request subject matter as the basis for identifying a candidate pool of at least one receiving collaborator, such as by comparing at least one of the document subject matter and the request subject with one or more documents generated by one or more receiving collaborators.
- the server may restrict the candidate pool to members of a group of the at least one user.
- identification information for the candidate pool is received from the at least one user.
- the server sends a message related to the request to at least one receiving collaborator in the candidate pool, in some embodiments including the user request in the message.
- the server grants the at least one responding collaborator access to a portion of the document.
- the responding collaborator may be a receiving collaborator, or may be outside the candidate pool.
- the server may rescind collaborator access to the document, such as when a predetermined length of time has passed, when the collaborator provides a response, or under some other suitable condition.
- the server receives a response from a responding collaborator and sends the response to the at least one user, in certain embodiments by embedding the response within the document and providing the document to the user.
- the server may receive a user rating of the response.
- the candidate pool may be determined by the ratings the user has received for a response.

- FIG. 4 is an illustrative flow chart of a process 400 for third-party collaboration on a document.
- process 400 begins with step 401 , in which server 106 receives a request 110 .
- the request identification processor 210 identifies the request 110 and forwards request 110 to natural language processor 212 .
- natural language processor 212 identifies at least one subject matter of request 110 and the document 104 in which request 110 was made, and the portion 108 to which request 110 relates is identified as well. Steps 401 and 402 thus prepare process 400 to identify and contact potential collaborators, which begins with step 403 .
- Step 403 identifies a candidate pool of at least one receiving collaborator 112 a .
- the candidate pool is identified from the user database 204 on the basis of familiarity in at least one subject matter identified in step 402 , as described in relation to FIG. 2 .
- the candidate pool may further be identified on a basis of previous collaboration with at least one user 102 , by an indicator of whether a candidate is connected to server 106 , by membership in a group 114 of at least one user 102 , or through other suitable criteria for identifying a receiving collaborator 112 a .
- step 403 may also identify a website 116 on which to solicit the assistance of an Internet collaborator 112 c .

- the message may be generated by combining at least one set phrase and at least one subject matter identified in step 402 .
- step 405 provides the at least one collaborator 112 with the request 110 and the portion 108 , as described in relation to FIG. 3C .
- step 406 determines if a collaborator 112 has provided a response 305 within a predetermined amount of time. If not, third-party collaboration process 400 returns to step 403 .
- the candidate pool may be broadened in response to third-party collaboration process 400 returning to step 403 , such as by including users familiar with subjects related to at least one subject matter of document 104 and request 110 , by including users not in group 114 , or by otherwise loosening the restrictions on the candidate pool.
- step 407 provides response 305 to at least one user 102 , which may include inserting response 305 in document 104 as described in relation to FIG. 3D , sending response 305 to user 102 by email or instant message, or providing response 305 to at least one user 102 through some other suitable method.
- Step 408 receives a reaction to response 305 from at least one user 102 .
- the at least one user 102 may indicate whether response 305 resolved request 110 , and may make a follow-up 307 .
- process 400 may proceed to step 412 .
- step 409 determines whether the at least one user 102 has made a follow-up 307 .

But if the at least one user 102 did not make a follow-up 307 , process 400 continues to step 411 , which determines whether the at least one user 102 indicated that response 305 resolved request 110 .
- process 400 returns to step 406 to receive a second response 305 that may meet request 110 .
- step 412 may amend user database 204 to prevent further access of request 110 or portion 108 by a collaborator 112 , ending process 400 .
- collaborator access to any portion of document 104 may also be rescinded after a predetermined length of time or in response to an action by at least one user 102 .
- request 110 is unanswered for a week, or if the at least one user 102 deletes request 110
- process 400 may proceed to step 412 .

Abstract
In response to a user request, a server identifies and facilitates communication with a third-party collaborator who may not be known to the user. Potential collaborators are identified by familiarity with a subject matter of a document or user request. The potential third-party collaborator is allowed to see the context of the user request, and the user may ask a third-party collaborator a follow-up question.
Description
- Collaboration is often helpful in drafting media, including documents, presentations, spreadsheets, images, and other productions. Even if a document drafter is intimately familiar with every topic broached in the document, the drafter cannot know how other people will interpret the writing without asking them. Collaboration tools are thus a key feature of applications for producing media. Such applications generally offer the ability to track how different users edited a file, allowing the users to readily identify which parts of their file require revision. But collaborating in standalone programs can make collaboration unwieldy. A user must wait for collaborators to send a file to see the latest edits to and comments on the file, and as a collaborative group grows in size, it becomes increasingly difficult to be sure that a given version is the most up-to-date file available.
- Web applications improve on standalone programs in part by allowing real-time collaboration. An online word processor like Google Docs stores documents on a server, providing the latest version to users accessing the document and updating the version as users edit the document. Multiple users can therefore edit a document at the same time, allowing real-time collaboration even when the collaborators are geographically dispersed. But web applications, like standalone applications, require users to independently identify collaborators.
- The collaboration features of modern file-generating applications are only useful when a user knows an appropriate collaborator. Users must know a collaborator before they can provide access to the collaborator, whether that access is provided by transmitting a file or an Internet link. But the less familiar a subject is to a user, the less likely the user is to know the people who would provide the most useful collaboration regarding the subject. Word processors currently in use, whether web-based or not, cannot identify possible collaborators and request their assistance with a limited portion of a document.
- Therefore there is a need for file-generating applications which can efficiently find collaborators.
- Accordingly, the systems and methods described herein relate to identifying and communicating with potential collaborators. By identifying the subject of a document and the nature of the need for assistance, the systems and methods described herein may identify potential collaborators who are well-positioned to offer the assistance the user needs but need not be known to the user. Moreover, the systems and methods described herein can restrict collaborator access to those parts of the document relevant to the user need for assistance.
- It is a realization of the inventors that outside collaborators are most helpful when they know the context in which the need for help arose. Consequently, the systems and methods described herein relate to, in one aspect, a system for identifying a collaborator, providing the collaborator with a portion of the document related to the user collaboration request, and receiving a response from the collaborator.
- In certain embodiments, the system described herein relates to identifying and collaborating with third-party collaborators. The system includes a user database, a document processor, a document database, a request identification processor, a natural language processor, and a message processor. The user database stores at least one user permitted to edit a document, which is displayed by the document engine and stored by the document database. In certain embodiments, the user database may also store a membership of a user in a group, a collaborator rating of a user, expertise of a user in a subject matter, some other information regarding the user as a collaborator, or some combination thereof. In some embodiments in which the user database stores a user expertise, expertise may be determined by a subject matter of a document the user is authorized to edit. The request identification processor identifies a user request for collaboration and a portion of the document associated with the request. The natural language processor identifies a request subject matter associated with the user request and a document subject matter associated with the document. The document subject matter is also stored in the document database. The message processor identifies a candidate pool of at least one receiving collaborator based on at least one of the request subject matter and the document subject matter. In certain embodiments, the candidate pool is further based on membership in at least one group of at least one user permitted to edit the document, a collaborator rating, or other suitable identifying information. The message processor generates a message related to the user request and sends the message to at least one receiving collaborator in the candidate pool. In response to at least one responding collaborator responding to the message, the message processor grants the at least one responding collaborator access to the portion of the document associated with the request. The message processor further receives a response from a responding collaborator and provides the response to the requesting user, in certain embodiments by embedding the response within the document. In certain embodiments, the message processor may change a collaborator rating based on a user reply to the collaborator response. In certain embodiments, the message processor may also rescind collaborator access in response to a predetermined criteria, which may include a user action or, in embodiments in which the system includes a timer, in response to the passage of a predetermined length of time.
- According to another aspect, the method described herein identifies and requests assistance from third-party collaborators. In certain embodiments, the method may include providing, at a server, a document generated by at least one user and having content including a document subject matter. The server receives a request from the at least one user, the request having a request subject matter, and identifies at least one of the document subject matter and the request subject matter. The server may use at least one of the document subject matter and the request subject matter as the basis for identifying a candidate pool of at least one receiving collaborator, such as by comparing at least one of the document subject matter and the request subject with one or more documents generated by one or more receiving collaborators. In certain embodiments, the server may restrict the candidate pool to members of a group of the at least one user. In certain embodiments, identification information for the candidate pool is received from the at least one user. The server sends a message related to the request to at least one receiving collaborator in the candidate pool, in some embodiments including the user request in the message. In response to at least one responding collaborator responding to the message, which may include following an Internet link, the server grants the at least one responding collaborator access to a portion of the document. In certain embodiments, the responding collaborator may be a receiving collaborator, or may be outside the candidate pool. In certain embodiments, the server may rescind collaborator access to the document, such as when a predetermined length of time has passed, when the collaborator provides a response, or under some other suitable condition. The server receives a response from a responding collaborator and sends the response to the at least one user, in certain embodiments by embedding the response within the document and providing the document to the user. In certain embodiments, the server may receive a user rating of the response. In such embodiments, the candidate pool may be determined by the ratings the user has received for a response.

In certain embodiments, several portions of adocument 104 may relate to a single subject matter. A subject matter or content associated with a subject matter may be determined based on context. For example, a subject matter may be identified by a heading or sub-heading of a section ofdocument 104, and the section may be associated with the identified subject matter. Auser 102 may also identify one or more subject matters.User 102 may identify the one or more subject matters by tagging one or more sections, headings, or any desired portion ofdocument 104.User 102 may perform such tagging through one or more prompts insystem 100. In certain embodiments, the tagged subject matter may be stored in metadata ofdocument 104. Auser 102 may desire assistance with one or more subject matters located in one ormore portions 108 ofdocument 104. As an illustrative example, auser 102 writing an essay explaining how slavery ended in the U.S. may desire outside assistance regarding those parts of the essay focused on the U.S. Civil War. -
Portion 108 may include any part ofdocument 104. In certain embodiments,portion 108 is a part or parts ofdocument 104 to whichrequest 110 relates.Portion 108 may be explicitly identified by at least oneuser 102, identified byserver 106 through a search ofdocument 104 for content related to the subject matter ofrequest 110, or identified through some other suitable method. In certain embodiments,portion 108 may include two sections of content separated by a third section of content. As an illustrative example, if auser 102 makes arequest 110 for advice on the introduction and conclusion of an essay,portion 108 may include the first and final paragraphs of the essay. Similarly, ifrequest 110 regards how a minor character is developed in a novella,portion 108 may include paragraphs from the first, fourth, and eighth chapters of the novella. -
Request 110 may be generated by auser 102 to promptserver 106 to identify acollaborator 112 forportion 108.User 102 may transmitrequest 110 toserver 106 through a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) POST request, through an e-mail addressed to a predetermined e-mail address, using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) web development techniques, or using some other appropriate communications protocol. In certain embodiments,server 106 may provideuser 102 with Javascript or other suitable computer code implementing a document editing application with a request feature. In such embodiments, the request feature may detect a predetermined sequence of user actions, which may includeuser 102 selecting a portion ofdocument 104 with an on-screen cursor, selecting an on-screen menu option corresponding to making arequest 110, or other suitable actions foruser 102 to generate arequest 110. The request feature may respond to the predetermined sequence of actions by generating an input window, in whichuser 102 may provide text explaining the nature ofrequest 110. Such explanatory text may be provided byuser 102 typing, byuser 102 choosing from a list of keywords, or by some other appropriate method foruser 102 providing explanatory text. The request feature may transmit the provided text toserver 106 in response to detecting an end-of-input signal, such as auser 102 clicking on a submission button, auser 102 clicking outside the input window, auser 102 pressing a “return” key, or some other suitable indication thatuser 102 has preparedrequest 110. -
Request 110 may include one or more keywords, sentences, or paragraphs elaborating thecollaboration user 102 desires. Much asdocument 104 includes one or more document subject matters, the text ofrequest 110 represents one or more request subject matters. A request subject matter is a subject matter on which theuser 102 desires collaboration. As an illustrative example, arequest 110 asking how Commodore Perry opened trade with Japan includes request subject matters of Commodore Perry and Japan. The request subject matter may be the same as or substantially similar to one or more document subject matters. In certain embodiments, the request subject matter may not be the same as the document subject matter, but may be based on one or more document subject matters. The request subject matter may be determined in similar ways to the document subject matter. In response to receiving arequest 110,server 106 may contact one or more receivingcollaborators 112 a. - A receiving
collaborator 112 a may be a user ofcollaboration system 100 identified byserver 106 as likely to provide useful collaboration related torequest 110. To the extent that a receivingcollaborator 112 a has expertise in (i.e., is familiar with) such a relevant subject matter, the receivingcollaborator 112 a is likely to provide useful collaboration in response torequest 110. Therefore,server 106 may identify a receivingcollaborator 112 a by identifying a user ofcollaboration system 100 with expertise in a subject matter ofrequest 110. In certain embodiments,server 106 may also identify a receivingcollaborator 112 a by identifying a user ofcollaboration system 100 with expertise in a subject matter of thedocument 104 in which request 110 was made. As an illustrative example, aserver 106 receiving arequest 110 related to quantum mechanics in the context of adocument 104 about Albert Einstein may contact a receivingcollaborator 112 a who has expertise in quantum mechanics, Einstein, or the history of science. In certain embodiments, there may be a different number of receivingcollaborators 112 a than are depicted. Areas of expertise may be user-provided, identified through the subject matter ofother documents 104 associated with receivingcollaborator 112 a, or identified through some other suitable method. In certain embodiments, receivingcollaborator 112 a may also be identified by previous collaboration with auser 102, whethercollaborator 112 a is actively connected toserver 106, membership in one ormore groups 114 of users ofcollaboration system 100 associated with auser 102, or other suitable criteria. In certain embodiments, membership in agroup 114 of auser 102 may be identified by theuser 102, imported by the server from a social network website, which may include Google+, or professional network website, which may include LinkedIn, or by some other suitable method for identifying who is a member of agroup 114 ofuser 102.Server 106 may contact receivingcollaborator 112 a with an instant message, a pop-up window, a text message, an email, or some other suitable communication. In certain embodiments, a receivingcollaborator 112 a may forward a message fromserver 106 to one or more indirect-contact collaborators 112 b. - An indirect-
contact collaborator 112 b may be a person identified by at least one receivingcollaborator 112 a as being likely to help withrequest 110. As an illustrative example, if an art history student forwards arequest 110 regarding Picasso to a colleague who is writing a dissertation on cubism, the first art history student may be a receivingcollaborator 112 a while the colleague may be an indirect-contact collaborator 112 b. A receivingcollaborator 112 a may identify an indirect-contact collaborator 112 b by providingserver 106 with contact information for the indirect-contact collaborator 112 b, by providing the indirect-contact collaborator 112 b a link to request 110, or by some other suitable method for identifying the indirect-contact collaborator 112 b. In certain embodiments, there may be a different number of indirect-contact collaborators 112 b than are depicted. -
Server 106 may also or alternatively contact anInternet collaborator 112c regarding request 110 through a message posted to awebsite 116, an Internet website suitable for disseminating a request, such as a social networking website, a professional networking website, a microblogging website, a question-and-answer website, or other suitable website.Server 106 posts the message, which may include content or a subject matter ofrequest 110, and may indicate how theInternet collaborator 112 c may respond to therequest 110.Internet collaborator 112 c may respond to the request by filling out an Internet form linked to in the message, by emailing a response to an email address provided in the message, by becoming a user ofsystem 100 and responding in the same fashion as a receivingcollaborator 112 a, or by some other suitable method of responding. In certain embodiments,server 106 may retrieve a response posted byInternet collaborator 112 c to thewebsite 116. In certain embodiments,server 106 does not post the message towebsite 116 unless certain predetermined conditions have been met, such as at least oneuser 102 indicating thatrequest 110 may be posted publicly, a predetermined length of time passing withoutserver 106 receiving a response to therequest 110, or some other suitable condition. - In response to receiving a
request 110 associated with adocument 104,server 106 may identify a candidate pool of at least one receivingcollaborator 112 a, which may include identifying a user ofcollaboration system 100 with expertise in a subject matter ofdocument 104 orrequest 110 as described in relation toFIG. 2 . In certain embodiments, the candidate pool may be restricted by membership in agroup 114.Server 106 sends a message related torequest 110 to at least one member of the candidate pool. In certain embodiments, the message may be forwarded to an indirect-contact collaborator 112 b or posted onwebsite 116. In response to at least onecollaborator 112 responding to the message, which may include clicking a link,server 106 provides the at least onecollaborator 112 with access torequest 110 and atleast portion 108 ofdocument 104.Server 106 receives at least one response to the request from at least onecollaborator 112, and provides the at least one response to the at least oneuser 102. In certain embodiments,server 106 provides the at least one response to the at least oneuser 102 by inserting the at least one response intodocument 104. -

If auser 102 is authorized to access and edit adocument 104,document engine 206 providesuser 102 with the most recent document content available and records user-provided content indocument database 208.Request identification processor 210 processes the document content to identify auser request 110, whilenatural language processor 212 processes the document content and identified requests to determine the document and request subject matters.Message processor 214 contacts at least one potential collaborator to solicit a response to arequest 110, and may make further contact attempts based on the output oftimer 216. In certain embodiments, the elements ofsystem 200 may be implemented in circuitry on separate physical computing devices, such as servers, general purpose processors, mainframes, or clusters of computing devices, and coupled via a network. -
Communications port 202 may be a network port that receives data from and transmits data to auser 102 and acollaborator 112, allowingsystem 200 to facilitate collaboration between the two. Data may include document content, arequest 110, a response to arequest 110, and other data related todocument 104, andcommunications port 202 may be linked to theuser 102 and thecollaborator 112 through a network.Communications port 202 may be a 100BASE-TX port, a 1000BASE-T port, a 10GBASE-T port, or some other suitable network port. In certain embodiments, there may be a different number of ports than are depicted. -
User database 204 may be a computer-readable and -writable medium storing information about a user of requestingsystem 200, which may include a list of subjects the user has expertise in, whichgroups 114 the user is a member of, and other identifying information that may be used to identify the user as apotential collaborator 112. In certain embodiments,user database 204 may include information rating the user as acollaborator 112, which may include how often the user has acted as acollaborator 112, how often other users have been satisfied with collaboration provided by the user, or other appropriate measures of how effective the user is as acollaborator 112.User database 204 further indicates which documents the user may access or edit throughdocument engine 206. -
Document engine 206 may be a computer processor that provides users of requestingsystem 200 access to document content and records changes or additions to document content indocument database 208. In certain embodiments,document engine 206 may be a collaborative document editing system.Document engine 206 also relays document content to requestidentification processor 210 to identify a user request and tonatural language processor 212 to identify at least one document subject matter. In response to at least one member of the candidate pool contacted bymessage processor 214 accessing a link, accepting a prompt, or otherwise indicating a willingness to review arequest 110,document engine 206 allows the at least one member to access therequest 110 and theportion 108 ofdocument 104 related to therequest 110, which are stored indocument database 208. -

In some embodiments, afirst user 102 may editdocument 104 while asecond user 102 is accessingdocument 104. -
Request identification processor 210 may be a computer processor that identifies arequest 110 within content submitted to documentengine 206.Request identification processor 210 may identify arequest 110 by searching content received bysystem 200 for a predetermined regular expression, an alphanumerical code associated with arequest 110, or some other appropriate flag identifying content as arequest 110. In certain alternate embodiments, requestidentification processor 210 may identify content received through a predetermined transfer protocol as arequest 110. Such embodiments may include an e-mail sent to a predetermined e-mail address, an HTTP POST request including a predetermined request tag, or some other suitable transfer protocol. In response to identifying arequest 110, requestidentification processor 210 sends the content of the request tonatural language processor 212 to identify the request subject matter. -
Natural language processor 212 may be a computer processor that determines the subject matters of adocument 104 and arequest 110.Natural language processor 212 may identify a subject matter of text as a key word or phrase, known as a token, of the text. Tokens may be identified by removing a predetermined set of words, which may include articles and prepositions, from the text, by comparing words to a dictionary to identify parts of speech and combine nouns or verbs with words modifying them, by searching for predetermined phrases within the text, or by some other suitable method of token identification. In certain embodiments,natural language processor 212 may refine a list of tokens according to the frequency of the tokens within the text, the frequency of the tokens withindocument database 208, or according to some other predetermined criteria. In certain embodiments,natural language processor 212 may identify a subject matter of non-text content of adocument 104 by converting the non-text content into text and identifying a subject matter of the converted text as above. Images of text may be converted into text using optical character recognition, such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,175,394, which is incorporated herein in entirety by reference. Text describing an image may be provided by searching an image database for a reference image similar to the image and providing a predetermined description associated with the reference image, or through some other suitable method for providing text describing an image. Spoken words may be converted into text through a speech recognition technique, which may include taking a series of time-windowed Fourier transforms of an audio recording and performing a statistical analysis of each Fourier transform to find which words have been spoken, or through some other suitable technique for transcribing a recording of spoken words. Similarly, text describing an audio file may be provided by searching a database of audio recordings for a reference sound with a similar time-windowed Fourier transform to a time-windowed Fourier transform of the audio file and providing a predetermined text associated with the reference sound, or through some other suitable method for providing text describing an audio file. In certain embodiments,natural language processor 212 may also or alternatively identify a subject matter of at least one of adocument 104 or arequest 110 through metadata provided by auser 102. Metadata may be data associated with but not included in the content of thedocument 104 or therequest 110, and may indicate a subject matter associated with thedocument 104 or therequest 110. - In certain embodiments,
natural language processor 212 may also identifyportion 108 ofdocument 104 by identifying which content ofdocument 104 includes a token matching at least one token ofrequest 110. The subject matters identified bynatural language processor 212 serve as a basis formessage processor 214 identifying a candidate pool of receivingcollaborators 112 a. -
Message processor 214 may be a computer processor for addressing, sending, and receiving messages related torequest 110. To address a message related torequest 110,message processor 214 may searchuser database 204 to identify a candidate pool of receivingcollaborators 112 a with expertise in at least one subject matter identified bynatural language processor 212. Expertise may be identified by association with a predetermined number ofdocuments 104 sharing the at least one subject matter, users who have responded to aprevious request 110 associated with the at least one subject matter, or who are otherwise identified as familiar with the at least one subject matter inuser database 204. In certain embodiments, the candidate pool may also include receivingcollaborators 112 a with expertise in at least one allied subject matter, a subject matter related to the at least one subject matter identified bynatural language processor 212. As an illustrative example, a candidate pool to resolve arequest 110 regarding epic poems may include a receivingcollaborator 112 a with expertise regarding Homer, Virgil, or John Milton. An allied subject matter may be a subject matter that is an expertise of at least a predetermined fraction of users with expertise in the at least one subject matter, a subject matter that is a document subject matter of at least a predetermined fraction ofdocuments 104 with a document subject matter including the at least one subject matter, or a subject matter otherwise associated with the at least one subject matter. In certain embodiments, the candidate pool may also be restricted to users belonging to agroup 114 of at least oneuser 102, to users with a similar collaborator rating as at least oneuser 102, or to users who meet some other appropriate identifying characteristic.

FIG. 4 is an illustrative flow chart of aprocess 400 for third-party collaboration on a document. Referring toFIG. 1 ,process 400 begins withstep 401, in whichserver 106 receives arequest 110. Referring toFIG. 2 , instep 402 therequest identification processor 210 identifies therequest 110 and forwards request 110 tonatural language processor 212. As described in relation toFIG. 2 ,natural language processor 212 identifies at least one subject matter ofrequest 110 and thedocument 104 in which request 110 was made, and theportion 108 to whichrequest 110 relates is identified as well.Steps process 400 to identify and contact potential collaborators, which begins withstep 403. - Step 403 identifies a candidate pool of at least one receiving
collaborator 112 a. The candidate pool is identified from theuser database 204 on the basis of familiarity in at least one subject matter identified instep 402, as described in relation toFIG. 2 . The candidate pool may further be identified on a basis of previous collaboration with at least oneuser 102, by an indicator of whether a candidate is connected toserver 106, by membership in agroup 114 of at least oneuser 102, or through other suitable criteria for identifying a receivingcollaborator 112 a. In certain embodiments,step 403 may also identify awebsite 116 on which to solicit the assistance of anInternet collaborator 112 c. Instep 404,message processor 214 sends a message requesting a response to request 110 to at least one member of the candidate pool identified instep 403. In certain embodiments, the message may be generated by combining at least one set phrase and at least one subject matter identified instep 402. In response to at least onecollaborator 112 responding to the message ofstep 404 as described in relation toFIG. 3B ,step 405 provides the at least onecollaborator 112 with therequest 110 and theportion 108, as described in relation toFIG. 3C . In certain embodiments, if acollaborator 112 then provides contact information for an indirect-contact collaborator 112 b,message processor 214 will add the indirect-contact collaborator 112 b to the candidate pool and third-party collaboration process 400 will return to step 403. To improve the probability of receiving aresponse 305,step 406 determines if acollaborator 112 has provided aresponse 305 within a predetermined amount of time. If not, third-party collaboration process 400 returns to step 403. In certain embodiments, the candidate pool may be broadened in response to third-party collaboration process 400 returning to step 403, such as by including users familiar with subjects related to at least one subject matter ofdocument 104 andrequest 110, by including users not ingroup 114, or by otherwise loosening the restrictions on the candidate pool. - If third-
party collaboration process 400 receives aresponse 305,step 407 providesresponse 305 to at least oneuser 102, which may include insertingresponse 305 indocument 104 as described in relation toFIG. 3D , sendingresponse 305 touser 102 by email or instant message, or providingresponse 305 to at least oneuser 102 through some other suitable method. Step 408 receives a reaction toresponse 305 from at least oneuser 102. As depicted inFIG. 3D , the at least oneuser 102 may indicate whetherresponse 305 resolvedrequest 110, and may make a follow-up 307. In certain embodiments, if no reaction is received within a predetermined amount of time,process 400 may proceed to step 412. - In response to
server 106 receiving a reaction instep 408,step 409 determines whether the at least oneuser 102 has made a follow-up 307. If so, step 410 transmits the follow-up 307 to the at least one respondingcollaborator 112 and returns to step 406 to receive a response to the follow-up 307. In certain embodiments,step 410 may also provideresponse 305 and follow-up 307 to at least oneother collaborator 112 to clarify theoriginal request 110. But if the at least oneuser 102 did not make a follow-up 307,process 400 continues to step 411, which determines whether the at least oneuser 102 indicated thatresponse 305 resolvedrequest 110. If not,process 400 returns to step 406 to receive asecond response 305 that may meetrequest 110. If the at least oneuser 102 is satisfied, step 412 may amenduser database 204 to prevent further access ofrequest 110 orportion 108 by acollaborator 112, endingprocess 400. In certain embodiments, collaborator access to any portion ofdocument 104 may also be rescinded after a predetermined length of time or in response to an action by at least oneuser 102. As an illustrative example, ifrequest 110 is unanswered for a week, or if the at least oneuser 102 deletesrequest 110,process 400 may proceed to step 412.

FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a computing device that can be used to implement or support the any of the components of the system ofFIG. 1 , and for performing any of the processes described herein.Server 106 may be implemented on one ormore computing devices 500 having suitable circuitry, and auser 102 and acollaborator 112 may communicate withserver 106 through one ormore computing devices 500 having suitable circuitry. In certain aspects, a plurality of the components ofsystem 100 may be included within onecomputing device 500. In certain implementations, a component and a storage device may be implemented acrossseveral computing devices 500. - The
computing device 500 comprises at least one communications interface unit, an input/output controller 510, system memory, and one or more data storage devices. This can support a communications port such ascommunications port 202 ofFIG. 2 . The system memory includes at least one random access memory (RAM 502) and at least one read-only memory (ROM 504). Thememory 504 can support the user database ofFIG. 2 , for example. All of these elements are in communication with a central processing unit (CPU 506) to facilitate the operation of thecomputing device 500. Thecomputing device 500 may be configured in many different ways. For example, thecomputing device 500 may be a conventional standalone computer or alternatively, the functions ofcomputing device 500 may be distributed across multiple computer systems and architectures. InFIG. 5 , thecomputing device 500 is linked, via network or local network, to other servers or systems. - The
computing device 500 may be configured in a distributed architecture, wherein databases and processors are housed in separate units or locations. Some units perform primary processing functions and contain at a minimum a general controller or a processor and a system memory. In distributed architecture implementations, each of these units may be attached via thecommunications interface unit 508 to a communications hub or port (not shown) that serves as a primary communication link with other servers, client or user computers and other related devices. The communications hub or port may have minimal processing capability itself, serving primarily as a communications router. A variety of communications protocols may be part of the system, including, but not limited to: Ethernet, SAP, SAS™, ATP, BLUETOOTH™, GSM and TCP/IP. - The
CPU 506 comprises a processor, such as one or more conventional microprocessors and one or more supplementary co-processors such as math co-processors for offloading workload from theCPU 506.CPU 506 TheCPU 506 is in communication with thecommunications interface unit 508 and the input/output controller 510, through which theCPU 506 communicates with other devices such as other servers, user terminals, or devices. Thecommunications interface unit 508 and the input/output controller 510 may include multiple communication channels for simultaneous communication with, for example, other processors, servers or client terminals. - The
CPU 506 is also in communication with the data storage device. The data storage device may comprise an appropriate combination of magnetic, optical or semiconductor memory, and may include, for example,RAM 502,ROM 504, flash drive, an optical disc such as a compact disc or a hard disk or drive. TheCPU 506 and the data storage device each may be, for example, located entirely within a single computer or other computing device; or connected to each other by a communication medium, such as a USB port, serial port cable, a coaxial cable, an Ethernet cable, a telephone line, a radio frequency transceiver or other similar wireless or wired medium or combination of the foregoing. For example, theCPU 506 may be connected to the data storage device via thecommunications interface unit 508. TheCPU 506 may be configured to perform one or more particular processing functions. - The data storage device may store, for example, (i) an
operating system 512 for thecomputing device 500; (ii) one or more applications 514 (e.g., computer program code or a computer program product) adapted to direct theCPU 506 in accordance with the systems and methods described here, and particularly in accordance with the processes described in detail with regard to theCPU 506; or (iii) database(s) 516 adapted to store information that may be utilized to store information required by the program. The depicteddatabase 516 can be any suitable database system, including the commercially available Microsoft Access database, and can be a local or distributed database system. The design and development of suitable database systems are described in McGovern et al., A Guide To Sybase and SQL Server, Addison-Wesley (1993). - The
operating system 512 andapplications 514 may be stored, for example, in a compressed, an uncompiled and an encrypted format, and may include computer program code. The instructions of the program may be read into a main memory of the processor from a computer-readable medium other than the data storage device, such as from theROM 504 or from theRAM 502. While execution of sequences of instructions in the program causes theCPU 506 to perform the process steps described herein, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions for implementation of the processes of the present disclosure. Thus, the systems and methods described are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software. - Suitable computer program code may be provided for performing one or more functions in relation to facilitating collaboration as described herein. The program also may include program elements such as an
operating system 512, a database management system and “device drivers” that allow the processor to interface with computer peripheral devices (e.g., a video display, a keyboard, a computer mouse, etc.) via the input/output controller 510. - The term “computer-readable medium” as used herein refers to any non-transitory medium that provides or participates in providing instructions to the processor of the computing device 500 (or any other processor of a device described herein) for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media and volatile media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical, magnetic, or opto-magnetic disks, or integrated circuit memory, such as flash memory. Volatile media include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which typically constitutes the main memory. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM or EEPROM (electronically erasable programmable read-only memory), a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other non-transitory medium from which a computer can read.
- Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the CPU 506 (or any other processor of a device described herein) for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer (not shown). The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over an Ethernet connection, cable line, or even telephone line using a modem. A communications device local to a computing device 500 (e.g., a server) can receive the data on the respective communications line and place the data on a system bus for the processor. The system bus carries the data to main memory, from which the processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory may optionally be stored in memory either before or after execution by the processor. In addition, instructions may be received via a communication port as electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals, which are exemplary forms of wireless communications or data streams that carry various types of information.
- As discussed above, a function relating to facilitating collaboration can be realized as a software component operating on a conventional data processing system such as a Unix workstation. In that embodiment, the function can be implemented as a C language computer program, or a computer program written in any high level language including C++, Fortran, Java or BASIC. See The C++ Programming Language, 2nd Ed., Stroustrup Addision-Wesley. Additionally, in an embodiment where microcontrollers or DSPs are employed, the function relating to facilitating collaboration can be realized as a computer program written in microcode or written in a high level language and compiled down to microcode that can be executed on the platform employed. The development of such network traffic control systems is known to those of skill in the art, and such techniques are set forth in Digital Signal Processing Applications with the TMS320 Family, Volumes I, II, and III, Texas Instruments (1990). Additionally, general techniques for high level programming are known, and set forth in, for example, Stephen G. Kochan, Programming in C, Hayden Publishing. Developing code for the DSP and microcontroller systems follows from principles well known in the art.

The computer readable medium may comprise a storage medium having instructions stored thereon/in which may be used to control, or cause, a computer to perform any of the processes of an embodiment. The storage medium may include, without limitation, any type of disk including floppy disks, mini disks (MDs), optical disks, DVDs, CD-ROMs, micro-drives, and magneto-optical disks, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, DRAMs, VRAMs, flash memory devices (including flash cards), magnetic or optical cards, nanosystems (including molecular memory ICs), RAID devices, remote data storage/archive/warehousing, or any other type of media or device suitable for storing instructions and/or data thereon/in. Additionally, the storage medium may be a hybrid system that stored data across different types of media, such as flash media and disc media. Optionally, the different media may be organized into a hybrid storage aggregate. In some embodiments different media types may be prioritized over other media types, such as the flash media may be prioritized to store data or supply data ahead of hard disk storage media or different workloads may be supported by different media types, optionally based on characteristics of the respective workloads. Additionally, the system may be organized into modules and supported on blades configured to carry out the storage operations described herein.
- Stored on any one of the computer readable medium (media), some embodiments include software instructions for controlling both the hardware of the general purpose or specialized computer or microprocessor, and for enabling the computer or microprocessor to interact with a human user and/or other mechanism using the results of an embodiment. Such software may include without limitation device drivers, operating systems, and user applications. Ultimately, such computer readable media further includes software instructions for performing embodiments described herein. Included in the programming (software) of the general-purpose/specialized computer or microprocessor are software modules for implementing some embodiments.
