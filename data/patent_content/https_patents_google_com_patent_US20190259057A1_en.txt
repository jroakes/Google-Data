Definitions
- Computer applications and other systems sometimes offer various modes that differ in complexity and offer different levels of access to available features.
- an “advanced” mode may present an assortment (e.g., all) of the available features while a “simple” mode may present some subset of those features and provide a more simplified interface to the system.
- users may need to choose between different interface modes. For example, a user may need to upgrade from a simple mode to an advanced mode in order to gain access to a particular feature. This transition may be abrupt, since the different interface modes may offer vastly different feature sets and differ in complexity and functionality.
- a computer-implemented method comprises: providing a user interface that exposes an application feature of an advertising management application; identifying a graduation trigger based on advertisements associated with a user account, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional application feature; and modifying the user interface to expose the additional application feature based on the graduation trigger.
- a system comprises an advertising management module with which users maintain advertising accounts.
- the advertising management module is configured to: provide a user interface that exposes an advertising feature; identify a graduation trigger based on advertisements associated with a user account, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional feature; and modify the user interface to expose the additional feature based on the graduation trigger.
- a system comprises: means for providing, through a user interface, access to an application feature of an advertising management application; means for identifying a graduation trigger based on advertisements associated with a user account, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional application feature; and means for providing, through the user interface, access to the additional application feature in response to the identified graduation trigger.
- a computer readable medium stores a computer program.
- the computer program includes instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor to: provide, through a user interface, access to an application feature of an advertising management application; identify a graduation trigger, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional application feature; and provide, through the user interface, access to the additional application feature in response to the identified graduation trigger.
- a computer-implemented method comprises: providing, through an interface, access to a feature of an application providing sponsored-content to users; identifying a graduation trigger based on at least sponsored-content associated with a user account, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional feature; and providing, through the interface, access to the additional feature in response to the identified graduation trigger.

- features of an application are gradually provided or exposed to users through an application frontend as the features become useful or relevant to the user. In this fashion, users may follow a gradual or progressive path through application functionality rather than choosing between simple and advance application modes.
- entry points in a user interface for exposing more complex features can be identified, so that advanced features of the application can be provided to those users who need them as those users need them.
- Users may be provided with descriptions of available features and options for adopting or utilizing additional features.
- Features can gradually become available, and some features may be exposed depending on the adoption of other features. For example, if a first feature of an application is adopted by a user, then an additional feature may be exposed based on that adoption.
- features and interfaces can be gradually removed or simplified. For example, features can be removed as those features become irrelevant. A determination to remove or simplify features and interfaces may be made based on explicit user commands, inferred information, user account status, feature usage information, and other criteria.
- help items can be exposed or provided to users.
- the help items can include help bubbles, callouts, mini-tutorials, and the like. Access to a help center can also be provided.
- Various other tools, messages, tutorials and the like can also be exposed to users. These other items (e.g., help items) can be exposed at various times, such as when additional features are exposed. For example, a tutorial explaining an additional feature may be exposed when that additional feature is exposed.

- the frontends may be configured as web applications that provide users with network access to features available in the AMS 106 .
- the interface modules in the AMS 106 may be configured to gradually or progressively expose features of the AMS 106 to users as features become useful or relevant to the users.
- an advertiser frontend may initially provide a user interface (e.g., a GUI) exposing a set of basic advertising features to an advertiser 102 .
- the advertiser frontend may then dynamically and gradually expose additional features to the advertiser 102 as those additional features become relevant.
- the relevance of additional features may be based on various factors, including advertiser account and ad performance statistics maintained by various systems in the AMS 106 .
- the interface modules may communicate with various systems in the environment 100 to determine feature relevance and identify bases for exposing additional features.
- an advertiser frontend may initially provide a user interface exposing features for creating a single textual ad, selecting keywords for the ad, selecting a single geographic region for ad placement, setting currency and bids and setting monthly budgets. Since this initial feature set allows an advertiser to create only a single ad, the user interface may be presented with a simplified structure showing only the single ad and its keywords. The advertiser frontend may then provide an option for accessing additional features that would enable the advertiser to create additional ads. If the advertiser 102 then adopts this additional feature and creates additional ads, the advertiser frontend may modify the user interface and expose additional features relevant to multiple ads. The user interface could arrange the ads in a hierarchical organization. For example, the user interface could allow the advertiser to create multiple ads under a single initiative or campaign.
- the advertiser frontend may then provide an option for accessing additional features for creating multiple campaigns. If the advertiser selects this option, then the user interface can change to group ads and their keywords into ad groups, which can be part of multiple ad initiatives or campaigns. In this fashion, the advertiser frontend exposes features and interface complexity for creating and managing multiple ads to those users interested in creating multiple ads while allowing an advertiser with a single ad to use a simplified interface and feature set.
- the advertiser frontend may initially expose features that automatically optimize bidding for advertisers. The advertiser frontend may then provide an option for manually entering bids. If the advertiser chooses to manually enter bids, then the frontend may expose additional features related to keyword bidding. In this fashion, users may follow a gradual path through application functionality. Additional details of gradually exposing features is discussed below in connection with FIGS. 2-9 .

Other data flows may therefore occur in the environment 100 and, even with the data flow 200 , the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. Further, the illustrated events may overlap and/or may exist in fewer steps. Moreover, certain events may not be present and additional and/or different events may be included.
- the publisher 104 can send an ad request to the AMS 106 prior to sending a content page to the user access device 108 .
- the AMS 106 may respond by sending relevant ads to the publisher 104 .
- the publisher 104 may combine the received ads with requested content in the content page and then send the content page, including the ad portion, to the user access device 108 for display to a user.
- Other modifications to the data flow 200 are also possible.
- the AMS 106 may target ads to the user access devices 108 based on search terms provided by the user access devices 108 .
- the AMS 106 may provide searching services and receive search terms directly from the user access devices.
- the AMS 106 can also receive search terms from a dedicated searching system that receives user search requests.
- the AMS 106 may target ads to the user access devices based on the received search terms and ad keywords provided by the advertisers.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example feature transition process 300 .
- the process 300 may be performed by one or more elements in the AMS 106 , such as the advertiser frontend module.
- the process 300 can be performed by other systems in conjunction with or instead of the AMS 106 .
- the process 300 may expose an initial feature set of an application ( 310 ), identify a graduation trigger ( 320 ), and expose a graduated feature set based on the graduation trigger ( 330 ).
- Exposing an initial feature set of an application may include establishing a session between a user and the application. For example, a user can login into an advertising application provided by the AMS 106 to establish a session with the application. Establishing a session may involve performing various known identification and authentication procedures.
- Exposing an initial feature set ( 310 ) may involve providing a user interface (e.g., a GUI) that exposes or presents a limited set or subset of features available from the application.
- a user interface e.g., a GUI
- the AMS 106 may expose a basic set of features for creating a single textual ad, selecting keywords, selecting a single region for ad placement, and setting currency and pricing.
- the initial feature set may be determined based on stored user account information.
- the user account information may include an access level specifying a set of features.
- each feature of the application may be associated with a set of rules. The stored account information may be analyzed using the rules to determine the initial feature set.
- the process 300 may identify a graduation trigger ( 320 ). Identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying a basis for exposing an additional feature of the application to a user as well as additional user interface complexity associated with the additional feature.
- the basis for exposing an additional feature may be identified or determined, for example, from explicit instructions received from a user and/or from an analysis of information associated with users (e.g., user account structure).
- Identifying a graduation trigger ( 320 ) may also involve identifying a basis for removing or simplifying a feature of the application or a user interface.
- the basis for removing or simplifying features and interfaces may be identified or determined, for example, from instructions received from a user and/or from an analysis of various information.
- graduation triggers may include user commands and/or selections.
- a user of the initial feature set may input a command to access an additional feature not available in the initial feature set. This command may indicate a user need for the additional feature and serve as a basis for exposing the additional feature.
- an advertiser using the initial feature set may input a command to create multiple ads. This selection may provide a basis for exposing additional features and user interface complexity associated with creating and managing multiple ads.
- a user of the initial feature set may input a command to remove a feature in the initial feature set. This selection may serve as a basis for removing or simplifying the feature or interface.
- Identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying activities associated with a user of the initial feature set.
- Activity-based graduation triggers may include various user activities, such as user selections of certain options and attempts by users to perform functions not include in the initial feature set. These activities may provide a basis for exposing additional features.
- identifying an activity-based graduation trigger may involve identifying that a user performs an action multiple times. For example, the identifying may involve identifying that a user has edited six keyword bids in a row. This activity may serve as a basis for exposing a feature for editing bids in bulk (e.g., increasing bids by 10%, which saves time).
- identifying an activity-based graduation trigger may involve identifying that a user pauses all their ad campaigns every day. This activity may serve as a basis for exposing a feature that allows a user to set the time of day when their ad campaigns will run, thus eliminating the manual effort.
- Identifying activity-based graduation triggers can also include identifying a lack of usage of a feature. For example, the identifying may involve identifying that a user of the initial feature set has not used a particular feature of the initial feature set for certain period of time. This usage information may serve as a basis for removing or simplifying features of the initial feature set.
- Graduation triggers may also be based on time. Identifying a time-based graduation trigger may involve identifying the expiration of an amount of time. For example, identifying a time-based trigger may involve identifying that an account of an advertiser using the initial feature set has been active for three-months. This may serve as a basis for exposing an additional feature, such as a feature commonly used by other advertisers at that point in time.
- the amount of time used for the trigger may be predetermined or dynamically determined.
- the trigger time may be determined based on feature usage associated with users. For example, the trigger time may be based on a determination that several advertisers 102 began using an ad conversion tracking feature three months after establishing an account with the AMS 106 .
- Identifying a graduation trigger may involve collaborative filtering. This may involve aggregating account information or feature usage information for multiple users and fitting a particular user's information to that aggregated information.
- collaborative filtering may involve comparing the initial feature set provided to a first user with an aggregated “model” feature set.
- the model feature set may represent an aggregation of features being provided to other similarly situated users. Discrepancies between the initial feature set and the model feature set may serve as a basis for exposing additional features to the first user.
- information related to the performance of ads from multiple advertisers could be aggregated to identify average performance markers.
- the performance of ads from a given advertiser using the initial feature set could be compared with the average performance markers. Discrepancies between the advertiser's ad performance and the average performance markers may serve as a basis for exposing additional features.
- identifying a graduation trigger ( 320 ) may involve identifying transactions associated with a user of the initial feature set. For example, trends can be identified based on a user's transaction history. These trends may serve as a basis for exposing additional features to the user.
- Identifying a graduation trigger may additionally or alternatively involve identifying triggers based on various performance statistics.
- Performance statistics can include financial performance statistics, usage statistics, return on investment statistics, and the like. With advertising, performance statistics can include, for example, general ad performance, ad performance with respect to location, and ad performance with respect to publisher sites.
- identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that an ad is performing above average on particular publisher site. This trigger may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to site targeting.
- identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that an ad is performing above average in a specific location. This may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to location-based ad targeting.
- Identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying a graduation trigger based on the content of an ad, the structure of an ad and/or the targeting of an ad. For example, identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that an ad created by an advertiser using the initial feature set is a textual ad. This may serve as a basis for exposing additional features that allow advertisers to create graphics for ads. In another example, identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying certain words included in an ad and comparing those words with information stored in a database to determine potential markets for the ad. An identification of potential untapped markets may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to ad targeting.
- identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that an advertiser using the initial feature set has targeted an ad to a particular location. For example, the identifying may involve determining that the ad is targeted to a 25 mile radius of a business location.
- These triggers may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to ad targeting, such as features that allow advertisers to promote location-based products and services to local customers in a given area.
- identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying the adoption of another feature.
- the initial feature set may include an option for an advertiser to manually enter bids rather than use an automatic bid optimizer. If the advertiser begins manually entering bids, additional bidding and ad positioning features may be useful to the advertiser.
- identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that the advertiser is manually entering bids. This activity may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to bidding an ad positioning.
- identifying a graduation trigger may further involve identifying an additional application feature based on an identified graduation trigger.
- an additional feature for adding multiple campaigns may be identified based on the trigger of a user selection or command to add multiple ads.
- the process 300 may identify an additional application feature for tracking conversions based on the trigger of an expiration of a time period (e.g., three months).
- identifying an additional application feature based on a trigger may involve inferring a need or usefulness for additional features based on the triggers. This may involve accessing associations or correlations between graduation triggers and additional features. For example, an expiration of a three-month time period may be associated with an additional feature for tracking conversions while an expiration of a six-month time period may be associated with an additional feature for adding graphics to ads. In another example, a certain performance aspect of an ad may be associated with a keyword tool or other analytical feature. Other techniques can also be used to identify and infer usefulness of additional applications.
- Identifying additional features based on the triggers may also involve accessing stored rules associated with additional features.
- the rules may specify certain constraints on access to additional features. For example, the rules may specify that certain features are not available to certain user groups.
- the associations and rules may, for example, be stored in one or more repositories maintained by the AMS 106 .
- the process 300 may expose a graduated feature set based on the identified graduation trigger ( 330 ).
- the graduated feature set may include a feature set that is different than the initial feature set.
- the graduated feature set can include additional features not included in the initial feature set.
- the graduated feature set can include features for allowing an advertiser 102 to create multiple campaigns, create multiple ad groups within each campaign, add graphics to ads, view detailed reports and analyses, select multiple regions for placement of an ad, access various keyword and other targeting tools, etc.
- one or more features included in the initial feature set may be absent from the graduated feature set or simplified in the graduated feature set.
- an initial feature may be replaced by a graduated feature or removed or simplified for some other reason (e.g., lack of relevancy, user instructions, lack of use by user, etc.).
- graduated features included in the graduated feature set can be exposed at the same time.
- graduated features may be exposed at different times, with some features only being exposed if other features are adopted by users.
- the process 300 may continually identify graduation triggers and expose graduated feature sets.
- exposing a graduated feature set may include selecting features to include in the graduated feature set. This selection may be based on the identified graduation triggers. The selection could also be performed using various associations between triggers and features and rules associated with the features.
- Exposing the graduated feature set ( 330 ) may involve presenting to a user of the initial feature set one or more selectable options (e.g., links) for adopting or utilizing an additional feature.
- the selectable options may be presented in a user interface providing access to the initial feature set.
- a user interface generated by the advertiser frontend and providing access to the initial feature set may present a selectable link to features associated with creating multiple ads or multiple campaigns. This is illustrated in the example user interface display 400 of FIG. 4 .
- the display 400 may be provided by the advertiser frontend and may expose features included in the initial feature set, such as features 410 , 420 , 430 and 440 .
- the display 400 may also present a link 450 to an additional feature for creating multiple ads.
- exposing the graduated feature set ( 330 ) may involve modifying the structure and complexity of a user interface exposing the initial feature set. This is illustrated in FIG. 5 , which depicts example interface structures 510 , 520 and 530 that can be used with an advertising application provided by the AMS 106 .
- the interface structure 510 in FIG. 5 may be associated with the initial feature set. If the initial feature set allows an advertiser to create only a single ad, the interface structure 510 may include account settings 512 , a single ad 514 , and its keywords 516 .
- the settings 512 may include user e-mail addresses and other contact information, passwords, billing information, user preferences and other user information.
- the interface structure 510 may be modified so that it is similar to the interface structure 520 .
- the interface structure 520 includes the settings 512 .
- the interface structure 520 further includes a campaign 522 , which may include one or more ads 514 , 524 and their keywords 516 , 526 .
- the campaign 522 may include information such as a campaign name, start/end dates for the campaign, budget information, campaign distribution preferences, language and location targets, and other information.
- the interface structure 520 may be modified so that it is similar to the interface structure 530 .
- the interface structure 530 includes the settings 512 as well as multiple campaigns 522 .
- the structure 530 also includes one or more ad groups 532 for each campaign. Ads (e.g., 514 , 524 ) and their keywords (e.g., 516 , 526 ) are arranged in the ad groups 532 .
- the ad groups 532 may allow an advertiser to organize ads within a campaign. In this fashion, the structure and complexity of a user interface may gradually progress or change as additional features are exposed to users.
- exposing the graduated feature set ( 330 ) may involve allowing users to access functionality associated with the graduated feature set. This may involve modifying a user interface that exposes the initial feature set to provide such access.
- FIGS. 6 and 7 show example user interface displays 600 and 700 that provide access to functionality associated with graduated features. The display 600 provides access to campaign management features, and the display 700 provides access to a graphics feature. Exposing the graduated feature set ( 330 ) may involve generating these interface displays as the respective features are exposed.
- the process 300 may also expose or trigger other items to users. These other items can be exposed or triggered, for example, based on graduation triggers or features in the initial and/or graduated feature sets. As an example, various messages, tools, help bubbles, callouts, tutorials and the like can be exposed as additional features are exposed. Access to a help center can also be provided. These additional items may, for example, provide an explanation of the additional features and provide guidance for using the additional features.
- FIGS. 3-7 are consistent with example implementations.
- the sequence of events in FIG. 3 is an example and not intended to be limiting. Other processes may therefore be used and, even with the process depicted in FIG. 3 , the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. Further, the illustrated events may overlap and/or may exist in fewer steps. Moreover, certain events may not be present and additional events may be included in the illustrated processes.

Abstract
A user interface exposes an application feature of an advertising management application. A graduation trigger is identified, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional application feature. The user interface is modified to expose the additional application feature based on the graduation trigger.
Description
- This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/949,194 filed Jul. 11, 2007, and entitled “GRADUATED FEATURE TRANSITIONS,” the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
- Computer applications and other systems sometimes offer various modes that differ in complexity and offer different levels of access to available features. For example, an “advanced” mode may present an assortment (e.g., all) of the available features while a “simple” mode may present some subset of those features and provide a more simplified interface to the system.
- To utilize certain features, users may need to choose between different interface modes. For example, a user may need to upgrade from a simple mode to an advanced mode in order to gain access to a particular feature. This transition may be abrupt, since the different interface modes may offer vastly different feature sets and differ in complexity and functionality.
- In one general aspect, a computer-implemented method comprises: providing a user interface that exposes an application feature of an advertising management application; identifying a graduation trigger based on advertisements associated with a user account, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional application feature; and modifying the user interface to expose the additional application feature based on the graduation trigger.
- In another general aspect, a system comprises an advertising management module with which users maintain advertising accounts. The advertising management module is configured to: provide a user interface that exposes an advertising feature; identify a graduation trigger based on advertisements associated with a user account, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional feature; and modify the user interface to expose the additional feature based on the graduation trigger.
- In another general aspect, a system comprises: means for providing, through a user interface, access to an application feature of an advertising management application; means for identifying a graduation trigger based on advertisements associated with a user account, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional application feature; and means for providing, through the user interface, access to the additional application feature in response to the identified graduation trigger.
- In another general aspect, a computer readable medium stores a computer program. The computer program includes instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor to: provide, through a user interface, access to an application feature of an advertising management application; identify a graduation trigger, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional application feature; and provide, through the user interface, access to the additional application feature in response to the identified graduation trigger.
- In another general aspect, a computer-implemented method comprises: providing, through an interface, access to a feature of an application providing sponsored-content to users; identifying a graduation trigger based on at least sponsored-content associated with a user account, the graduation trigger providing a basis for exposing an additional feature; and providing, through the interface, access to the additional feature in response to the identified graduation trigger.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings as well as from the claims.
- The accompanying drawings show features of implementations consistent with this disclosure and, together with the corresponding description, help explain principles associated with the disclosure.

FIG. 10 is a block diagram of an example user access device configuration. - The following description refers to the accompanying drawings, in which, in the absence of a contrary representation, the same numbers in different drawings represent similar elements.
- In some implementations, features of an application are gradually provided or exposed to users through an application frontend as the features become useful or relevant to the user. In this fashion, users may follow a gradual or progressive path through application functionality rather than choosing between simple and advance application modes. In some examples, entry points in a user interface for exposing more complex features can be identified, so that advanced features of the application can be provided to those users who need them as those users need them. Users may be provided with descriptions of available features and options for adopting or utilizing additional features. Features can gradually become available, and some features may be exposed depending on the adoption of other features. For example, if a first feature of an application is adopted by a user, then an additional feature may be exposed based on that adoption.
- In some implementations, features and interfaces can be gradually removed or simplified. For example, features can be removed as those features become irrelevant. A determination to remove or simplify features and interfaces may be made based on explicit user commands, inferred information, user account status, feature usage information, and other criteria.
- In some implementations, other actions or items may be gradually exposed in addition to application features. In some examples, various help items can be exposed or provided to users. The help items can include help bubbles, callouts, mini-tutorials, and the like. Access to a help center can also be provided. Various other tools, messages, tutorials and the like can also be exposed to users. These other items (e.g., help items) can be exposed at various times, such as when additional features are exposed. For example, a tutorial explaining an additional feature may be exposed when that additional feature is exposed.
- With reference to
FIG. 1 , anexample advertising environment 100 may include one ormore advertisers 102, one ormore publishers 104, an ad management system (AMS) 106, and one or more user access devices 108, which may be coupled to anetwork 110. Theenvironment 100 is merely an example, and this disclosure is not limited to advertising. Other forms of content, including other forms of sponsored content, can be delivered by the system. Further, aspects of this disclosure may be used with various other advertising and non-advertising environments, systems and devices. - Each of the
elements FIG. 1 may be implemented or associated with hardware components, software components, or firmware components or any combination of such components. Theelements - The
advertisers 102 may include any entities that are associated with advertisements (“ads”). An advertisement or an “ad” refers to any form of communication in which one or more products, services, ideas, messages, people, organizations or other items are identified and promoted (or otherwise communicated). Ads are not limited to commercial promotions or other communications. An ad may be a public service announcement or any other type of public notice, such as a public notice published in printed or electronic press or a broadcast. An ad may be referred to or include sponsored-content. - Ads may be communicated via various mediums and in various forms. In some examples, ads may be communicated through an interactive medium, such as the Internet, and may include graphical ads (e.g., banner ads), textual ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one of more of any of such components, or any form of electronically delivered advertisement. Ads may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. Ads could also be communicated through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, radio channels, television channels, print media, and other media.
- The
advertisers 102 may provide (or be otherwise associated with) products and/or services related to ads. Theadvertisers 102 may include or be associated with, for example, retailers, wholesalers, warehouses, manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, educational establishments, financial establishments, technology providers, energy providers, utility providers, or any other product or service providers or distributors. - The
advertisers 102 may directly or indirectly generate, maintain and/or track ads, which may be related to products or services offered by or otherwise associated with the advertisers. Theadvertisers 102 may include or maintain one or moredata processing systems 112, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. Theadvertisers 102 may include or maintain one or more processes that run on one or more data processing systems. - The
publishers 104 may include entities that generate, maintain, provide, present and/or otherwise process content in theenvironment 100. In some implementations, thepublishers 104 may include content providers with an Internet presence, such as online publication and news providers (e.g., online newspapers, etc.), online service providers (e.g., financial service providers, health service provider, etc,), and the like. The term “content” refers to various types of web-based and/or otherwise presented information, such as articles, discussion threads, reports, analyses, financial statements, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds (e.g., RSS feeds), television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, printed publications, etc. - The
publishers 104 may receive requests from the user access devices 108 (or other elements in the environment 100) and provide or present content to the requesting devices. The publishers may provide or present content via various mediums and in various forms, including web based and non-web based mediums and forms. Thepublishers 104 may generate and/or maintain such content and/or retrieve the content from other network resources. - In addition to content, the
publishers 104 may be configured to integrate or combine retrieved content with ads that are related or relevant to the retrieved content for display to users. These relevant ads may be provided from theAMS 106 and be combined with content for display to users. As described further below, the user access devices 108 may also process ads for display to users. In some examples, thepublishers 104 may retrieve an article for display on a particular user access device 108 and then forward the article to the user access device 108 along with code that causes one or more ads from theAMS 106 to be displayed to the user. In other examples, thepublishers 104 may retrieve an article, retrieve one or more relevant ads (e.g., from theAMS 106 or the advertisers 102), and then integrate the ads and the article to form a content page for display to the user. - In some implementations, one or more of the
publishers 104 may represent a content network that is associated with theAMS 106. In such an implementation, theadvertisers 102 may be able to present ads to users through this content network. - The
publishers 104 may include or maintain one or moredata processing systems 114, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. They may include or maintain one or more processes that run on data processing systems. In some examples, thepublishers 104 may include one ormore content repositories 124 for storing content and other information. - The
AMS 106 manages ads and provides various services to theadvertisers 102, thepublishers 104, and the user access devices 108. TheAMS 106 may store ads in anad repository 126 and facilitate the distribution of ads through theenvironment 100 to the user access devices 108. In some configurations, theAMS 106 may include or access functionality associated with the AdWords™ and AdSense™ systems provided by Google, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.). TheAMS 106 may include one or moredata processing systems 116, such as servers or embedded systems, coupled to thenetwork 110. It could also include one or more processes, such as server processes. - The
AMS 106 may include or access one or more crawling, indexing and searching modules (not shown). These modules may browse accessible resources (e.g., the World Wide Web, publisher content, data feeds, etc.) to identify, index and store information. The modules may browse information and create copies of the browsed information for subsequent processing. The modules may also check links, validate code, harvest information, and/or perform other maintenance or other tasks. - Searching modules may search information from various resources, such as the World Wide Web, publisher content, intranets, newsgroups, databases, and/or directories. The search modules may employ one or more known search or other processes to search data. In some implementations, the search modules may index crawled content and/or content received from data feeds to build one or more search indices. The search indices may be used to facilitate rapid retrieval of information relevant to a search query.
- The
AMS 106 provides various advertising management features to theadvertisers 102. In some examples, theAMS 106 may include features for advertisers similar to those in the AdWords™ system provided by Google, Inc. TheAMS 106 advertising features may allow users to set up user accounts, set account preferences, create ads, select keywords for ads, create campaigns or initiatives for multiple products or businesses, view reports associated with accounts, analyze costs and return on investment, target customers in different regions, target ads to particular publishers, track financial information, track ad performance, estimate ad traffic, access keyword tools, add graphics and animations to ads, etc. - The
AMS 106 may allow theadvertisers 102 to create ads and input keywords for which those ads will appear. In some examples, theAMS 106 may provide ads to user access devices or publishers when keywords associated with those ads are included in a user request or requested content. TheAMS 106 may also allow theadvertisers 102 to set “bids” for ads. A bid may represent the maximum amount an advertiser is willing to pay for each ad impression, user click-through of an ad or other interaction with an ad. A click-through can include any action a user takes to select an ad. Theadvertisers 102 may also choose a currency and monthly budget. - The
AMS 106 may also allow theadvertisers 102 to view information about ad impressions, which may be maintained by theAMS 106. The term ad “impression” refers to any form of presentation of an ad such that it is viewable to a user. In some examples, an ad impression may occur when an ad is displayed on a display device of a user access device. TheAMS 106 may be configured to determine and maintain the number of ad impressions relative to a particular website or keyword. TheAMS 106 may also determine and maintain the number of click-throughs for an ad as well as the ratio of click-throughs to impressions of an ad. - The
AMS 106 may also allow theadvertisers 102 to select and/or create conversion types for ads. A “conversion” may occur when a user consummates a transaction related to a given ad. A conversion could be defined to occur when a user clicks on an ad, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. In another example, a conversion could be defined as the display of an ad to a user and a corresponding purchase on the advertiser's web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days). TheAMS 106 may store conversion data and other information in aconversion data repository 136. - The
AMS 106 may allow theadvertisers 102 to input description information associated with ads. This information could be used to assist thepublishers 104 in determining ads to publish. Theadvertisers 102 may additionally input a cost/value associated with selected conversion types, such as a five dollar credit to thepublishers 104 for each product or service purchased. - The
AMS 106 may provide various features to thepublishers 104. TheAMS 106 may allow thepublishers 104 to search and select specific products and services as well as associated ads to be displayed with content provided by thepublishers 104. For example, thepublishers 104 may search through ads in thead repository 126 and select certain ads and block or filter out other ads. TheAMS 106 may contextually determine or recommend specific items and ads based on, for example, relevance to the publishers site content. TheAMS 106 may also determine specific items and ads based on user information and behavior, such as particular search queries performed on a search engine website, a geographical location of the user, etc. TheAMS 106 may store user-related information (e.g., personal profiles of users, geographic locations of users, ad context information) in ageneral data repository 146. A combination of these and other approaches can also be used to provide ads to thepublishers 104. - The
AMS 106 may be configured to target ads created by theadvertisers 102 to the user access devices 108 directly or through thepublishers 104. TheAMS 106 may target ads to aparticular publisher 104 or a requesting user access device 108 when a user requests search results or loads content from thepublisher 104. - In some configurations, the
AMS 106 may target ads using a searching portion and a content portion. The searching portion may include one or more elements for providing various searching features to the user devices 108 and targeting ads to users based on search terms. The content portion may include one or more elements for targeting ads to users based on content rather than specific terms. The content portion may target ads based on content provided by thepublishers 104. - The
AMS 106 may be configured to identify relevant ads for targeting using various information, such as ad keywords, content keywords, geographic information, web page identifiers and/or content indices. As an example, theAMS 106 can receive a URL of a requested content page (e.g., from the user access device 108 or the publisher 104). TheAMS 106 may match the URL to indexed content keywords associated with the URL to determine a user interest. TheAMS 106 may then match the user interest with ads in therepository 126 relevant to the interest. TheAMS 106 may, for example, use ad keywords from theadvertisers 102 and/or other ad information to identify the ads. TheAMS 106 could compare ad keywords from theadvertisers 102 or other information to content keywords and/or content in the content page to identify relevant ads. In some examples, the ad selections and preferences specified by thepublishers 104 can be used by theAMS 106 when it selects relevant ads. - In some implementations, the
AMS 106 may manage and process financial transactions among and between elements in theenvironment 100. For example, theAMS 106 may credit accounts associated with thepublishers 104 and debit accounts of theadvertisers 102. These and other transactions may be based on conversion data, impressions information and/or click-through rates received and maintained by theAMS 106. - The
AMS 106 may include one or more interface or frontend modules for providing the various features to advertisers, publishers, and user access devices. For example, theAMS 106 may provide one or more advertiser frontends for allowing advertisers to create and manage ads and one or more publisher frontends for allowing publishers to select ads for presentation. In some examples, the frontends may be configured as web applications that provide users with network access to features available in theAMS 106. - The interface modules in the
AMS 106 may be configured to gradually or progressively expose features of theAMS 106 to users as features become useful or relevant to the users. For example, an advertiser frontend may initially provide a user interface (e.g., a GUI) exposing a set of basic advertising features to anadvertiser 102. The advertiser frontend may then dynamically and gradually expose additional features to theadvertiser 102 as those additional features become relevant. The relevance of additional features may be based on various factors, including advertiser account and ad performance statistics maintained by various systems in theAMS 106. In some implementations, the interface modules may communicate with various systems in theenvironment 100 to determine feature relevance and identify bases for exposing additional features. - As an example of a progressive feature exposure, an advertiser frontend may initially provide a user interface exposing features for creating a single textual ad, selecting keywords for the ad, selecting a single geographic region for ad placement, setting currency and bids and setting monthly budgets. Since this initial feature set allows an advertiser to create only a single ad, the user interface may be presented with a simplified structure showing only the single ad and its keywords. The advertiser frontend may then provide an option for accessing additional features that would enable the advertiser to create additional ads. If the
advertiser 102 then adopts this additional feature and creates additional ads, the advertiser frontend may modify the user interface and expose additional features relevant to multiple ads. The user interface could arrange the ads in a hierarchical organization. For example, the user interface could allow the advertiser to create multiple ads under a single initiative or campaign. - The advertiser frontend may then provide an option for accessing additional features for creating multiple campaigns. If the advertiser selects this option, then the user interface can change to group ads and their keywords into ad groups, which can be part of multiple ad initiatives or campaigns. In this fashion, the advertiser frontend exposes features and interface complexity for creating and managing multiple ads to those users interested in creating multiple ads while allowing an advertiser with a single ad to use a simplified interface and feature set.
- As another example, the advertiser frontend may initially expose features that automatically optimize bidding for advertisers. The advertiser frontend may then provide an option for manually entering bids. If the advertiser chooses to manually enter bids, then the frontend may expose additional features related to keyword bidding. In this fashion, users may follow a gradual path through application functionality. Additional details of gradually exposing features is discussed below in connection with
FIGS. 2-9 . - Continuing to refer to
FIG. 1 , the user access devices 108 may include any devices capable of receiving information from thenetwork 110. The user access devices 108 could include general computing components and/or embedded systems optimized with specific components for performing specific tasks. Examples of user access devices include personal computers (e.g., desktop computers), mobile computing devices, cell phones, smart phones, media players/recorders, music players, game consoles, media centers, media players, electronic tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs), television systems, audio systems, radio systems, removable storage devices, navigation systems, set top boxes, other electronic devices and the like. The user access devices 108 can also include various other elements, such as processes running on various machines. - The
network 110 may include any element or system that facilitates communications among and between various network nodes, such aselements network 110 may include one or more telecommunications networks, such as computer networks, telephone or other communications networks, the Internet, etc. Thenetwork 110 may include a shared, public, or private data network encompassing a wide area (e.g., WAN) or local area (e.g., LAN). In some implementations, thenetwork 110 may facilitate data exchange by way of packet switching using the Internet Protocol (IP). Thenetwork 110 may facilitate wired and/or wireless connectivity and communication. - For purposes of explanation only, certain aspects of this disclosure are described with reference to the discrete elements illustrated in
FIG. 1 . The number, identity and arrangement of elements in theenvironment 100 are not limited to what is shown. For example, theenvironment 100 can include any number of geographically-dispersedadvertisers 102,publishers 104 and/or user access devices 108, which may be discrete, integrated modules or distributed systems. Similarly, theenvironment 100 is not limited to asingle AMS 106 and may include any number of integrated or distributed AMS systems or elements. - Furthermore, additional and/or different elements not shown may be contained in or coupled to the elements shown in
FIG. 1 , and/or certain illustrated elements may be absent. In some examples, the functions provided by the illustrated elements could be performed by less than the illustrated number of components or even by a single element. The illustrated elements could be implemented as individual processes run on separate machines or a single process running on a single machine. -
FIG. 2 illustrates anexample data flow 200 within theenvironment 100. Thedata flow 200 is an example only and not intended to be restrictive. Other data flows may therefore occur in theenvironment 100 and, even with thedata flow 200, the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. - In the
data flow 200, theAMS 106 provides an ad feature set 202 to one ormore advertisers 102. The feature set 202 can include features for creating ads, selecting keywords, targeting locations for ads, setting currency and bids and setting monthly budgets. TheAMS 106 may receivead settings 204 from theadvertisers 102. Thead settings 204 may include, for example, information for creating an ad, ad keywords, location targeting information, and pricing information. - During the
data flow 200, aparticular publisher 104 may receive acontent request 206 from a particular user access device 108. Thecontent request 206 may, for example, include a request for an article on a given topic (e.g., automobiles). In response to therequest 206, thepublisher 104 may retrieve relevant content (e.g., an automobile article) from thecontent repository 124 or some other source. - The
publisher 104 may respond to thecontent request 206 by sending acontent page 208 or other presentation to the requesting user device 108. Thecontent page 208 may include the requested content 210 (e.g., the automobile article) as well as a code “snippet” 207 associated with an ad. A code “snippet” refers, for example, to a method used by one device (e.g., a server) to ask another device (e.g., a browser running on a client device) to perform actions after or while downloading information. In some examples, a code “snippet” may be implemented in JavaScript® code or may be part of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or other web page markup language or content. - The
AMS 106 may provide thecode snippet 207 to thepublisher 104 and/or the user access device 108. The code snippet can originate and/or be provided from other sources. As the requesting user device 108 loads thecontent page 208, thecode snippet 207 causes the user device 108 to contact theAMS 106 and receive additional code (e.g., Java Script® or the like), which causes thecontent page 208 to load with anad portion 212. - The
ad portion 212 may include any element that allows information to be embedded within thecontent page 208. In some examples, thead portion 212 may be implemented as an HTML element, such an I-Frame (inline frame) or other type of frame. Thead portion 212 may be hosted by theAMS 106 or thepublisher 104 and may allow content (e.g., ads) from theAMS 106 or thepublisher 104 to be embedded inside thecontent page 208. Parameters associated with the ad portion 212 (e.g., its size and shape) can be specified in the content page 208 (e.g., in HTML), so that the user access device 108 can present thecontent page 208 while thead portion 212 is being loaded. Other implementations ofad portion 212 may also be used. - The
ad portion 212 may send theAMS 106 formatting andcontent information 214. Thisinformation 214 may include information describing the manner (e.g., how, when, and/or where) in which ads can be rendered by the user access devices 108. Theinformation 214 may also include ad attributes and parameters, such as size, shape, color, font, presentation style (e.g., audio, video, graphical, textual, etc.), etc. Theinformation 214 may also specify a quantity of ads desired. - The formatting and
content information 214 can also include information associated with thecontent 210 displayed incontent page 208. Such information may include a URL (Universal Resource Locator) associated with the requestedcontent page 208. In some implementations, theinformation 214 can include the requested content itself, a category corresponding to the requested content or the content request, part or all of thecontent request 206, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, and the like. - In response to the information 215, the
AMS 106 may provide the user access device 108 withad information 216. Thead information 216 may include one ormore ads 225 for placement in thead portion 212 of thecontent page 208. Thead information 216 may also include a signed or encoded specification of an ad. - The
ad information 216 may include ads that are relevant to user interest. TheAMS 106 may retrieve and provide relevant ads based on theinformation 214 received from the user access device 108. TheAMS 106 may retrieve thead information 216 from thead repository 126. TheAMS 106 may retrieve relevant ads using information from a crawling module, various keywords, various statistical associations between ads and content, and/or preference information associated with the publishers. - The
ad portion 212 may populate with ads included in theinformation 216, such asads 225. Thead portion 212 and the displayedads 225 may occupy a portion of thecontent page 208, which may be distinct from other content (e.g., the content 210) in thecontent page 208. - When a user clicks on the displayed
ad 225, an embedded code snippet may direct the user access device 108 to contact theAMS 106. During this event, the user access device 108 may receive an information parcel, such as a signed browser cookie, from theAMS 106. This information parcel can include information, such as an identifier of the selectedad 225, an identifier of thepublisher 104, and the date/time thead 225 was selected by the user. The information parcel may facilitate processing of conversion activities or other user transactions. - The user access device 108 may then be redirected to the
advertiser 102 associated with the selectedad 225. The user access device 108 may send arequest 218 to the associatedadvertiser 102 and then load alanding page 220 from theadvertiser 102. The user may then perform a conversion action at thelanding page 220, such as purchasing a product or service, registering, joining a mailing list, etc. A code snippet, which may be provided by theAMS 106, may be included within a conversion confirmation page script, such as a script within a web page presented after the purchase. The user access device 108 may execute the advertiser code snippet, which may then contact theAMS 106 and report conversion data to theAMS 106. The conversion data may include conversion types and numbers as well as information from cookies. The conversion data may be maintained in theconversion data repository 136. - During
data flow 200, one or more frontend modules in theAMS 106 may perform one or more actions to gradually expose features of theAMS 106 to theadvertisers 102 as features become useful or relevant. For example, the frontend modules may gradually add features to the ad feature set 202, for example, as those additional features become useful to the advertisers. Other criteria for adding features to the ad feature set are possible, including those associated with sophistication of the user, amount of time the product has been accessed/enabled, number of ads requested, etc. In some examples, the frontend modules may change the ad feature set 202 based on account information associated with theadvertisers 102, the ad performance with respect to particular publishers, ad performance with respect to a specific location, aggregated information from multiple advertiser accounts, the expiration of certain preset time periods, and other information. -
FIG. 2 is an example only and not intended to be restrictive. Other data flows may therefore occur in theenvironment 100 and, even with thedata flow 200, the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. Further, the illustrated events may overlap and/or may exist in fewer steps. Moreover, certain events may not be present and additional and/or different events may be included. - In alternative data flows, the
publisher 104 can send an ad request to theAMS 106 prior to sending a content page to the user access device 108. TheAMS 106 may respond by sending relevant ads to thepublisher 104. Thepublisher 104 may combine the received ads with requested content in the content page and then send the content page, including the ad portion, to the user access device 108 for display to a user. Other modifications to thedata flow 200 are also possible. - In alternative data flows, the
AMS 106 may target ads to the user access devices 108 based on search terms provided by the user access devices 108. In these dataflows, theAMS 106 may provide searching services and receive search terms directly from the user access devices. TheAMS 106 can also receive search terms from a dedicated searching system that receives user search requests. TheAMS 106 may target ads to the user access devices based on the received search terms and ad keywords provided by the advertisers. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an examplefeature transition process 300. In some implementations, theprocess 300 may be performed by one or more elements in theAMS 106, such as the advertiser frontend module. Theprocess 300 can be performed by other systems in conjunction with or instead of theAMS 106. Theprocess 300 may expose an initial feature set of an application (310), identify a graduation trigger (320), and expose a graduated feature set based on the graduation trigger (330). - Exposing an initial feature set of an application (310) may include establishing a session between a user and the application. For example, a user can login into an advertising application provided by the
AMS 106 to establish a session with the application. Establishing a session may involve performing various known identification and authentication procedures. - Exposing an initial feature set (310) may involve providing a user interface (e.g., a GUI) that exposes or presents a limited set or subset of features available from the application. For example, the
AMS 106 may expose a basic set of features for creating a single textual ad, selecting keywords, selecting a single region for ad placement, and setting currency and pricing. The initial feature set may be determined based on stored user account information. For example, the user account information may include an access level specifying a set of features. In other examples, each feature of the application may be associated with a set of rules. The stored account information may be analyzed using the rules to determine the initial feature set. - The
process 300 may identify a graduation trigger (320). Identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying a basis for exposing an additional feature of the application to a user as well as additional user interface complexity associated with the additional feature. The basis for exposing an additional feature may be identified or determined, for example, from explicit instructions received from a user and/or from an analysis of information associated with users (e.g., user account structure). - Identifying a graduation trigger (320) may also involve identifying a basis for removing or simplifying a feature of the application or a user interface. The basis for removing or simplifying features and interfaces may be identified or determined, for example, from instructions received from a user and/or from an analysis of various information.
- In some examples, graduation triggers may include user commands and/or selections. For example, a user of the initial feature set may input a command to access an additional feature not available in the initial feature set. This command may indicate a user need for the additional feature and serve as a basis for exposing the additional feature. As an example, an advertiser using the initial feature set may input a command to create multiple ads. This selection may provide a basis for exposing additional features and user interface complexity associated with creating and managing multiple ads.
- In other example, a user of the initial feature set may input a command to remove a feature in the initial feature set. This selection may serve as a basis for removing or simplifying the feature or interface.
- Identifying a graduation trigger (320) may involve identifying activities associated with a user of the initial feature set. Activity-based graduation triggers may include various user activities, such as user selections of certain options and attempts by users to perform functions not include in the initial feature set. These activities may provide a basis for exposing additional features.
- In some examples, identifying an activity-based graduation trigger may involve identifying that a user performs an action multiple times. For example, the identifying may involve identifying that a user has edited six keyword bids in a row. This activity may serve as a basis for exposing a feature for editing bids in bulk (e.g., increasing bids by 10%, which saves time).
- In other examples, identifying an activity-based graduation trigger may involve identifying that a user pauses all their ad campaigns every day. This activity may serve as a basis for exposing a feature that allows a user to set the time of day when their ad campaigns will run, thus eliminating the manual effort.
- Identifying activity-based graduation triggers can also include identifying a lack of usage of a feature. For example, the identifying may involve identifying that a user of the initial feature set has not used a particular feature of the initial feature set for certain period of time. This usage information may serve as a basis for removing or simplifying features of the initial feature set.
- Graduation triggers may also be based on time. Identifying a time-based graduation trigger may involve identifying the expiration of an amount of time. For example, identifying a time-based trigger may involve identifying that an account of an advertiser using the initial feature set has been active for three-months. This may serve as a basis for exposing an additional feature, such as a feature commonly used by other advertisers at that point in time.
- The amount of time used for the trigger may be predetermined or dynamically determined. In some examples, the trigger time may be determined based on feature usage associated with users. For example, the trigger time may be based on a determination that
several advertisers 102 began using an ad conversion tracking feature three months after establishing an account with theAMS 106. - Identifying a graduation trigger (320) may involve collaborative filtering. This may involve aggregating account information or feature usage information for multiple users and fitting a particular user's information to that aggregated information. As an example, collaborative filtering may involve comparing the initial feature set provided to a first user with an aggregated “model” feature set. The model feature set may represent an aggregation of features being provided to other similarly situated users. Discrepancies between the initial feature set and the model feature set may serve as a basis for exposing additional features to the first user.
- As another example of collaborative filtering, information related to the performance of ads from multiple advertisers could be aggregated to identify average performance markers. In this example, the performance of ads from a given advertiser using the initial feature set could be compared with the average performance markers. Discrepancies between the advertiser's ad performance and the average performance markers may serve as a basis for exposing additional features.
- In some implementations, identifying a graduation trigger (320) may involve identifying transactions associated with a user of the initial feature set. For example, trends can be identified based on a user's transaction history. These trends may serve as a basis for exposing additional features to the user.
- Identifying a graduation trigger (320) may additionally or alternatively involve identifying triggers based on various performance statistics. Performance statistics can include financial performance statistics, usage statistics, return on investment statistics, and the like. With advertising, performance statistics can include, for example, general ad performance, ad performance with respect to location, and ad performance with respect to publisher sites. As an example, identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that an ad is performing above average on particular publisher site. This trigger may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to site targeting. As another example, identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that an ad is performing above average in a specific location. This may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to location-based ad targeting.
- Identifying a graduation trigger (320) may involve identifying a graduation trigger based on the content of an ad, the structure of an ad and/or the targeting of an ad. For example, identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that an ad created by an advertiser using the initial feature set is a textual ad. This may serve as a basis for exposing additional features that allow advertisers to create graphics for ads. In another example, identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying certain words included in an ad and comparing those words with information stored in a database to determine potential markets for the ad. An identification of potential untapped markets may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to ad targeting.
- In yet another example, identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that an advertiser using the initial feature set has targeted an ad to a particular location. For example, the identifying may involve determining that the ad is targeted to a 25 mile radius of a business location. These triggers may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to ad targeting, such as features that allow advertisers to promote location-based products and services to local customers in a given area.
- In some implementations, identifying a graduation trigger (320) may involve identifying the adoption of another feature. As an example, the initial feature set may include an option for an advertiser to manually enter bids rather than use an automatic bid optimizer. If the advertiser begins manually entering bids, additional bidding and ad positioning features may be useful to the advertiser. In this example, identifying a graduation trigger may involve identifying that the advertiser is manually entering bids. This activity may serve as a basis for exposing additional features related to bidding an ad positioning.
- In some implementations, identifying a graduation trigger may further involve identifying an additional application feature based on an identified graduation trigger. For example, an additional feature for adding multiple campaigns may be identified based on the trigger of a user selection or command to add multiple ads. In another example, the
process 300 may identify an additional application feature for tracking conversions based on the trigger of an expiration of a time period (e.g., three months). - In some implementations, identifying an additional application feature based on a trigger may involve inferring a need or usefulness for additional features based on the triggers. This may involve accessing associations or correlations between graduation triggers and additional features. For example, an expiration of a three-month time period may be associated with an additional feature for tracking conversions while an expiration of a six-month time period may be associated with an additional feature for adding graphics to ads. In another example, a certain performance aspect of an ad may be associated with a keyword tool or other analytical feature. Other techniques can also be used to identify and infer usefulness of additional applications.
- Identifying additional features based on the triggers may also involve accessing stored rules associated with additional features. The rules may specify certain constraints on access to additional features. For example, the rules may specify that certain features are not available to certain user groups. The associations and rules may, for example, be stored in one or more repositories maintained by the
AMS 106. - The
process 300 may expose a graduated feature set based on the identified graduation trigger (330). The graduated feature set may include a feature set that is different than the initial feature set. The graduated feature set can include additional features not included in the initial feature set. For example, the graduated feature set can include features for allowing anadvertiser 102 to create multiple campaigns, create multiple ad groups within each campaign, add graphics to ads, view detailed reports and analyses, select multiple regions for placement of an ad, access various keyword and other targeting tools, etc. In some examples, one or more features included in the initial feature set may be absent from the graduated feature set or simplified in the graduated feature set. For example, an initial feature may be replaced by a graduated feature or removed or simplified for some other reason (e.g., lack of relevancy, user instructions, lack of use by user, etc.). - Multiple features included in the graduated feature set can be exposed at the same time. In addition, graduated features may be exposed at different times, with some features only being exposed if other features are adopted by users. Further, as illustrated in
FIG. 3 , theprocess 300 may continually identify graduation triggers and expose graduated feature sets. - In some implementations, exposing a graduated feature set may include selecting features to include in the graduated feature set. This selection may be based on the identified graduation triggers. The selection could also be performed using various associations between triggers and features and rules associated with the features.
- Exposing the graduated feature set (330) may involve presenting to a user of the initial feature set one or more selectable options (e.g., links) for adopting or utilizing an additional feature. In some examples, the selectable options may be presented in a user interface providing access to the initial feature set. As an example, a user interface generated by the advertiser frontend and providing access to the initial feature set may present a selectable link to features associated with creating multiple ads or multiple campaigns. This is illustrated in the example
user interface display 400 ofFIG. 4 . Thedisplay 400 may be provided by the advertiser frontend and may expose features included in the initial feature set, such asfeatures display 400 may also present alink 450 to an additional feature for creating multiple ads. - In some implementations, exposing the graduated feature set (330) may involve modifying the structure and complexity of a user interface exposing the initial feature set. This is illustrated in
FIG. 5 , which depictsexample interface structures AMS 106. - The
interface structure 510 inFIG. 5 may be associated with the initial feature set. If the initial feature set allows an advertiser to create only a single ad, theinterface structure 510 may includeaccount settings 512, asingle ad 514, and itskeywords 516. Thesettings 512 may include user e-mail addresses and other contact information, passwords, billing information, user preferences and other user information. - If an additional feature for creating multiple ads is exposed, then the
interface structure 510 may be modified so that it is similar to theinterface structure 520. Like thestructure 510, theinterface structure 520 includes thesettings 512. Theinterface structure 520 further includes acampaign 522, which may include one ormore ads keywords campaign 522 may include information such as a campaign name, start/end dates for the campaign, budget information, campaign distribution preferences, language and location targets, and other information. - If an additional feature for creating multiple campaigns is exposed, then the
interface structure 520 may be modified so that it is similar to theinterface structure 530. Theinterface structure 530 includes thesettings 512 as well asmultiple campaigns 522. Thestructure 530 also includes one ormore ad groups 532 for each campaign. Ads (e.g., 514, 524) and their keywords (e.g., 516, 526) are arranged in thead groups 532. Thead groups 532 may allow an advertiser to organize ads within a campaign. In this fashion, the structure and complexity of a user interface may gradually progress or change as additional features are exposed to users. - Referring again to
FIG. 3 , exposing the graduated feature set (330) may involve allowing users to access functionality associated with the graduated feature set. This may involve modifying a user interface that exposes the initial feature set to provide such access.FIGS. 6 and 7 show example user interface displays 600 and 700 that provide access to functionality associated with graduated features. Thedisplay 600 provides access to campaign management features, and thedisplay 700 provides access to a graphics feature. Exposing the graduated feature set (330) may involve generating these interface displays as the respective features are exposed. - In addition to exposing the graduated feature set, the
process 300 may also expose or trigger other items to users. These other items can be exposed or triggered, for example, based on graduation triggers or features in the initial and/or graduated feature sets. As an example, various messages, tools, help bubbles, callouts, tutorials and the like can be exposed as additional features are exposed. Access to a help center can also be provided. These additional items may, for example, provide an explanation of the additional features and provide guidance for using the additional features. -
FIGS. 3-7 are consistent with example implementations. The sequence of events inFIG. 3 is an example and not intended to be limiting. Other processes may therefore be used and, even with the process depicted inFIG. 3 , the illustrated events and their particular order in time may vary. Further, the illustrated events may overlap and/or may exist in fewer steps. Moreover, certain events may not be present and additional events may be included in the illustrated processes. -
