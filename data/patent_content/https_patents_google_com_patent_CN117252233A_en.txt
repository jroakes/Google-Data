Description
Description of the division
The present application belongs to the divisional application of the Chinese patent application 201880029807.4 with the application date of 2018, 05 and 02.
Technical Field
The present application relates to a virtual assistant that configures recommended actions when facilitating an existing session.
Background
Some computing platforms may provide a user interface through which a user may chat, speak, or otherwise communicate with a virtual computing assistant (e.g., also referred to as a "smart personal assistant" or simply "assistant") to cause the assistant to output information, respond to the user's needs, or otherwise perform certain operations to assist the user in completing tasks. While some assistants may be very complex and configured to perform various real world or virtual tasks, a user may not always be aware of all of the functionality provided by the assistant. The user can only request information or let the assistant perform certain tasks that the assistant can handle.
Disclosure of Invention
In general, the techniques of this disclosure may enable an assistant to output information regarding one or more additional actions that the assistant may initiate while facilitating an existing session with a user, without requiring the user to request such information from the assistant. That is, the assistant may actively direct the user to additional capabilities of the assistant related to the user's existing session even without an explicit user request for such information. For example, once the assistant has received permission to maintain or access information associated with the user, the assistant may determine that the departure time of the user's flight reservation is delayed based on the user information. In addition to generating an output informing the user of the flight delay, the assistant may generate additional output that provides rescheduling of the dinner reservation or ground traffic to adjust the delay without receiving user input. In this manner, the assistant is configured to output an initiated session, output additional information, or output a related offer to perform additional actions (e.g., reschedule dinner or ground traffic) in order to facilitate an existing session with the user. Thus, the described techniques may improve the usability of an assistant by reducing the amount of user input required for the user to discover various actions and for the assistant to perform.
In one example, the present disclosure is directed to a method comprising determining, based on information associated with a user of a computing device, an event for initiating interaction between the user and an assistant executing on the computing device, wherein the assistant is configured to perform a plurality of actions; based on the event, selecting at least one action associated with the event from a plurality of actions; and determining whether to output a notification of the event based on the at least one action, wherein the notification includes an indication of the event and a request to perform the at least one action associated with the event. The method further includes, in response to determining to output the notification of the event, sending the notification of the event to the assistant for output during interaction between the user and the assistant.
In another example, the disclosure relates to a computing device comprising an output device; at least one processor; and at least one memory. The memory includes instructions that, when executed, cause the at least one processor to execute an assistant configured to: determining, based on information associated with a user of the computing device, an event for initiating an interaction between the user and an assistant, wherein the assistant is configured to perform a plurality of actions; based on the event, selecting at least one action associated with the event from a plurality of actions; determining, based on the at least one action, whether to output a notification of the event, wherein the notification includes an indication of the event and a request to perform the at least one action associated with the event; and in response to determining to output the notification of the event, outputting, via the output device, the notification of the event during the interaction between the user and the assistant.
In another example, the disclosure relates to a computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, cause at least one processor of a digital assistant system to: determining, based on information associated with a user of the computing device, an event for initiating interaction between the user and an assistant executing on the computing device, wherein the assistant is configured to perform a plurality of actions; based on the event, selecting at least one action associated with the event from a plurality of actions; and determining whether to output a notification of the event based on the at least one action, wherein the notification includes an indication of the event and a request to perform the at least one action associated with the event. The instructions, when executed, further cause the at least one processor of the digital assistant system to send a notification of the event to the assistant for output during interaction between the user and the assistant in response to determining to output the notification of the event.
In another example, the disclosure is directed to a system comprising means for determining, based on information associated with a user of a computing device, an event for initiating an interaction between the user and an assistant executing on the computing device, wherein the assistant is configured to perform a plurality of actions; means for selecting, based on the event, at least one action associated with the event from a plurality of actions; and means for determining whether to output a notification of the event based on the at least one action, wherein the notification includes an indication of the event and a request to perform the at least one action associated with the event. The system further includes means for sending, in response to determining to output the notification of the event, the notification of the event to the assistant for output during interaction between the user and the assistant.
The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

Detailed Description
Fig. 1 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example system executing an example virtual assistant, according to one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The system 100 of fig. 1 includes a digital assistant server 160 in communication with a search server system 180 and computing devices 110A and 110B (collectively computing devices 110) via a network 130. Although system 100 is shown as being distributed among digital assistant server 160, search server system 180, and computing device 110, in other examples, the features and techniques attributed to system 100 may be performed internally by local components of computing device 110. Similarly, digital assistant server 160 may include certain components and perform various techniques that are otherwise attributed to search server system 180 and/or computing device 110 in the following description. Although fig. 1 illustrates two computing devices 110, any suitable number of one or more computing devices 110 may be used.
Network 130 represents any public or private communication network, such as cellular, wi-Fi, and/or other types of networks, for transmitting data between computing systems, servers, and computing devices. The digital assistant server 160 may exchange data with the computing device 110 via the network 130 to provide virtual assistant services accessible to the computing device 110 when the computing device 110 is connected to the network 130. The digital assistant server 160 may exchange data with the search server system 180 via the network 130 to access search services provided by the search server system 180. Computing device 110 may exchange data with search server system 180 via network 130 to access search services provided by search server system 180.
Network 130 may include one or more hubs, network switches, network routers, or any other network device that are operatively coupled to each other to thereby provide for the exchange of information between server systems 160 and 180 and computing device 110. Computing device 110, digital assistant server 160, and search server system 180 may use any suitable communication technology to send and receive data over network 130. Computing device 110, digital assistant server 160, and search server system 180 may each be operatively coupled to network 130 using a respective network link. The links coupling computing device 110, digital assistant server 160, and search server system 180 with network 130 may be ethernet or other types of network connections, and these connections may be wireless and/or wired connections.
Digital assistant server 160 and search server system 180 represent any suitable remote computing system (such as one or more desktop computers, laptop computers, mainframes, servers, cloud computing systems, etc.) capable of sending information to and receiving information from a network (such as network 130). Digital assistant server 160 hosts (or at least provides access to) virtual assistant services. The assistant server system 180 hosts (or at least provides access to) the search service. In some examples, digital assistant server 160 and search server system 180 represent cloud computing systems that provide access to their respective services via the cloud.
Computing device 110 represents a mobile or non-mobile computing device of a person configured to access virtual assistant services provided via network 130. Examples of computing device 110 include a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, server, mainframe, set-top box, television, wearable device (e.g., computerized watch, computerized eyeglass, computerized glove, etc.), home automation device or system (e.g., smart thermostat or security system), personal Digital Assistant (PDA), gaming system, media player, electronic book reader, mobile television platform, car navigation or infotainment system, or any other type of mobile, non-mobile, wearable and non-wearable computing device configured to execute or access a virtual assistant and receive information via a network, such as network 130.
Computing device 110 may communicate with digital assistant server 160 and/or search server system 180 via network 130 to access virtual assistant services provided by digital assistant server 160 and/or to access search services provided by search server system 180. In providing virtual assistant services, the digital assistant server 160 may communicate with the search server system 180 to obtain information needed to complete a task.
In the example of fig. 1, digital assistant server 160 includes an assistant module 122B and a user information data store 124B. Computing device 110A includes User Interface Component (UIC) 112, user Interface (UI) module 120, assistant module 122, and user information data store 124A. Search server system 180 includes a search module 182. Although not shown, computing device 110B may include similar components and/or modules as computing device 110A.
Modules 120, 122A, 122B, and 182 may perform operations described using software, hardware, firmware, or a mixture of hardware, software, and firmware residing in or executing at one of computing device 110A, digital assistant server 160, or search server system 180. Computing device 110A, digital assistant server 160, and search server system 180 may execute modules 120, 122A, 122B, and 182 having multiple processors or multiple devices. Computing device 110A, digital assistant server 160, and search server system 180 may execute modules 120, 122A, 122B, and 182 as virtual machines executing on underlying hardware. Modules 120, 122A, 122B, and 182 may execute as one or more services for an operating system or computing platform. Modules 120, 122A, 122B, and 182 may execute as one or more executable programs at an application layer of a computing platform.
UIC 112 of computing device 110 may serve as an input and/or output device for computing device 110A. UIC 112 may be implemented using a variety of techniques. For example, UIC 112 may use a presence-sensitive input screen, microphone technology, infrared sensor technology, a camera, or other input device technology used in receiving user input to act as an input device. UIC 112 may act as an output device configured to present output to a user using any one or more of a display device, speaker technology, haptic feedback technology, or other output device technology used in outputting information to a user.
UI module 120 may manage user interactions with UIC 112 and other components of computing device 110A and may interact with digital assistant server 160 to provide assistant services via UIC 112. UI module 120 may cause UIC 112 to output a user interface when a user of computing device 110A views the output and/or provides the input at UIC 112. For example, as shown in fig. 1, UI module 120 may send instructions to UIC 112 that cause UIC 112 to display user interface 114 on the display of UIC 112.
The user interface 114 includes text of a session between a user of the computing device 110A and an assistant provided by the assistant module 122A. In the example of fig. 1, the user interface 114 is a graphical user interface. In some examples, the user interface 114 may be an audible user interface. The user interface 114 may include various forms of virtual assistant information such as audible sound, vibration, text, graphics, content cards, images, and the like.
When a user interacts with the user interface 114 at different times and while the user and computing device 110A are in different locations, the UI module 120 and UIC 112 may receive one or more indications of input (e.g., voice input, touch input, non-touch input or presence-sensitive input, video input, audio input, etc.) from the user. UI module 120 and UIC 112 may interpret the input detected at UIC 112 and may relay information regarding the input detected at UIC 112 to assistant module 122A and/or one or more other associated platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing at computing device 110A, for example, to cause computing device 110A to perform functions.
UI module 120 may receive information and instructions from one or more associated platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing at computing device 110A and/or one or more remote computing systems (such as server systems 160 and 180). Additionally, UI module 120 may act as an intermediary between one or more associated platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing at computing device 110A and various output devices (e.g., speakers, LED indicators, audio or haptic output means, etc.) of computing device 110A to produce output (e.g., graphics, flashing lights, sounds, haptic responses, etc.) through computing device 110A. For example, UI module 120 may cause UIC 112 to output user interface 114 based on data received by UI module 120 from digital assistant server 160 via network 130. UI module 120 may receive information (e.g., audio data, text data, image data, etc.) and instructions as input from digital assistant server 160 and/or assistant module 122A for presentation as user interface 114.
Assistant module 122A and assistant module 122B may collectively maintain user information data stores 124A and 124B as part of a virtual assistant service accessed via computing device 110. The assistant module 122B and the user information data store 124B represent server-side or cloud implementations of the exemplary assistant, while the assistant module 122A and the user information data store 124A represent client-side or local implementations of the exemplary assistant. In some examples, some or all of the functionality attributed to assistant module 122A may be performed by assistant module 122B, and vice versa.
Collectively referred to as assistant modules 122, assistant modules 122A and 122B may perform a system configured to automatically and without requiring user interaction actively guide a user of a computing device to meaningful or other useful information that may be of current interest to the user. The assistant module 122 may be configured to output information regarding one or more additional actions that the assistant is configured to perform when facilitating an existing session with the user without the user requesting such information from the assistant. For example, the assistant provided by the assistant module 122 may actively direct the user to additional capabilities of the assistant related to the user's existing session even in the absence of an explicit user request for such information.
The assistant modules 122 may each include a software agent configured to execute as an intelligent personal assistant that may perform tasks or services for a person, such as the user of the computing device 110. The assistant module 122 may perform these tasks or services based on: user input (e.g., detected at UIC 112), context awareness (e.g., based on location, etc.), and/or the ability to access other information (e.g., weather or traffic conditions, news, stock prices, sports scores, user schedules, traffic schedules, retail prices, etc.) from various information sources (e.g., stored locally at computing device 110, digital assistant server 160, or obtained via search services provided by search server system 180, including push notification services). The assistant module 122 may perform artificial intelligence and/or machine learning techniques to automatically identify and complete one or more tasks on behalf of a user. The assistant module 122 may rely on other applications (e.g., third party applications), services, or other devices (e.g., televisions, automobiles including autopilots, watches, home automation systems, entertainment systems, etc.) to perform one or more tasks.
Upon receipt of explicit user consent, assistant module 122 may automatically maintain information associated with the user, or a pointer to the location of the information associated with the user (e.g., stored by an information source located at computing device 110, server system 160 or 180, or by any other server or device located elsewhere on network 130), for example, during execution of operations to support a session with the user of computing device 110. The assistant module 122 may maintain information associated with the user or pointers to the information as user information data stores 124A and 124B (collectively, "user information data store 124"). The data store 124 may enable an assistant executed by the assistant module 122 to quickly access user information required by the assistant to complete real-world tasks, virtual tasks, or otherwise respond to the instant and/or future needs of the user of the computing device 110.
For example, the information associated with the user may be information obtained during a session between the user and the assistant, calendar information, contact information, user interests, user preferences, and any other information associated with the user that may be used by the assistant module 122 to actively guide the user to meaningful information. Examples of information sources associated with a user may include, but are not limited to, intelligence built into an email system, user interactions with the assistant module 122, user interactions and application use cases on a device associated with the user (e.g., computing device 110), or other information sources.
The term "session" as used throughout this specification refers to a conventional interaction between a user of a computing device and an assistant executing at or accessible from the computing device, as compared to interactions that may occur during initial setup, installation, first use, etc. In other words, a session is generated during the user's use of the assistant every day while the user is performing tasks other than setting up the assistant. A session, as used herein, does not refer to a user answering a question as part of setting an application or providing preset field information that populates a user interface.
In operation, the assistant module 122 may provide an assistant executing on the computing device 110 or accessible from the computing device 110. The assistant may be configured to initiate a session with the user or begin a conversation with the user, query the user for information, and suggest actions that the assistant may perform on behalf of the user, even if the user is unaware of the actions. The assistant may be configured to recommend a valuable action to the user that is related to the user's existing session without the user explicitly requesting it. For example, assistant module 122B may determine whether to begin a conversation with the user and select the conversation to begin. Assistant module 122B can cause assistant module 122A to initiate a conversation and obtain user authorization for assistant module 122A to perform an action related to the conversation.
The assistant module 122 can determine an event for triggering an interaction (e.g., a session or dialogue) between a user of the computing device 110 and an assistant executing at the computing device 110 based on information associated with the user of the computing device 110. The assistant module 122 may only analyze information associated with the computing device 110 and/or the user of the computing device 110 if the user positively agrees to use or collect such information. The assistant module 122 may further provide an opportunity for the user to withdraw consent, and in such a case, the assistant module 122 may cease collecting or otherwise retaining information associated with the computing device 110 or the user of the computing device 110. The assistant module 122 may analyze personal information of the user (e.g., data store 124), including, but not limited to: search history and online interactions, previous interactions with assistants (e.g., "call mom (call Kathy)", "call Kathy (call Kathy)") and interactions with other applications and third party entities executing at computing device 110 or accessible from computing device 110. The assistant module 122B may know from which "surface" or device the user is more likely to interact with the assistant at any given time and send event notifications to that particular surface.
For example, after the assistant module 122 has received access from the user to grant maintenance or have information associated with the user, the assistant module 122B may maintain user information in the data store 124B, including information about upcoming travel plans for the user of the computing device 110. The travel plan may indicate that the user has reserved seats on a particular flight that was originally scheduled to take off within about twelve hours from the current time. The agent executing at assistant module 122B may be configured to obtain updates associated with the travel itinerary from search server system 180. For example, the agent of the assistant module 122B may send a query to the search module 182 for status information regarding a particular flight, and in response, the agent of the assistant module 122B may receive information indicating that the particular flight was delayed for thirty minutes from its originally scheduled departure time.
The search module 182 may implement searching (e.g., internet searching) for information related to the search query (e.g., weather or traffic conditions, news, stock prices, sports scores, user schedules, traffic schedules, unmanned vehicle reservations, retail prices, etc.) from various information sources (e.g., stored locally or remotely by the search server system 180). After performing the search, the search module 182 may output information returned from the search (e.g., search results, links to the search results, etc.) to the digital assistant server 160 or the computing device 110. The search module 182 may perform a search for information determined (e.g., based on contextual information associated with the computing device 110A) to be relevant to the search query generated by the search module 182. The search module 182 may perform a search based on a search query received by the search module 182 from the digital assistant server 160 or the computing device 110A (e.g., as part of a task that the virtual assistant is performing on behalf of the user of the computing device 110).
The assistant module 122B may determine that the flight delay is an event for initiating interaction with a user of the computing device 110. The assistant module 122B may send information to the assistant module 122A to trigger notification of the event.
In response to receiving the event trigger from the assistant module 122B, the assistant module 122A may select at least one action associated with or related to the event based on the event and from a plurality of actions that the assistant module 122A is configured to perform. For example, assistant module 122A may be configured to perform a number of actions including, but not limited to: scheduling services (e.g., traffic, including unmanned vehicle reservations, home or car related maintenance/service, food distribution, pet care, walk with pet, house guard, career, distribution, travel reservations, and any or all other services), exchanging communications (e.g., calendar invitations, emails, text-based messages, social media network messages, phone or video calls, and any or all other communications), purchasing merchandise (e.g., online shopping, flower delivery, purchasing event tickets, and any or all other purchasing related actions), and other actions. The assistant module 122A may perform a number of actions depending on other applications or agents executing at the computing device 110A or accessible by the computing device 110A. The assistant module 122A may perform a number of actions depending on other applications or agents executing at the computing device 110A or accessible from the computing device 110A.
The assistant module 122A may select any one or more of a plurality of actions to be related to the event. For example, the assistant module 122A may score the capabilities or actions of the assistant module 122A for a particular type of event based on feedback obtained by other assistants regarding what type of action the particular type of event performs on behalf of the user of other computing devices. The assistant module 122A may score each of the plurality of actions and select one or more higher scoring actions as potentially relevant to the event. For example, based on the information stored at the data store 124A, the assistant module 122A may determine that the user has booked ground traffic, such as an unmanned vehicle, at the final destination of the flight in addition to the flight reservation. The assistant module 122A may determine that the action of scheduling or rescheduling ground traffic is an action related to a flight delay event that is typically performed by an assistant based on how other users interact with other assistants.
Not all events may be events worth notifying the user. Thus, before outputting a notification of an event at the current time, the assistant module 122A may determine whether to output a notification of an event. The assistant module 122A may limit notifications of certain events or customize notifications of certain events for a particular context to ensure that the user will find value in the notification. As one example, assistant module 122A may determine whether to output a notification of an event based at least in part on a combination of how close in time a previous interaction occurred between the user and the assistant and how frequently the previous interaction occurred between the user and the assistant.
For example, based on information stored in user information data store 124A, assistant module 122A may determine that when the user wakes up, the user interacts with the assistant at a threshold interval or threshold frequency on average (e.g., approximately once per hour per day). Since the last session between the user and the assistant occurred within a threshold interval (e.g., just fifteen minutes ago) before the current time, the assistant module 122A may determine to prohibit outputting a notification of half-hour flight delays for flights not scheduled to take off another twelve hours or more. In some examples, because the last session between the user and the assistant occurred greater than or equal to a threshold interval (e.g., one hour ago) before the current time, the assistant module 122A may determine to output a notification of the half-hour flight delay for flights not scheduled to take off within another twelve hours or more.
In response to determining to output the notification of the event, the assistant module 122A may output the notification of the event. The notification may include an indication of the event and a request to perform at least one of the above selected actions associated with the event. For example, the assistant module 122B may send a notification of the event to the assistant module 122A for output during interaction between the user and the assistant via UIC 212. The assistant module 122A may output the notification as part of the user interface 114 and include part of the conversation text shown in fig. 1. The assistant module 122A can cause the notification to include an indication of a request to perform one or more actions related to the event on behalf of the user. For example, the indication of the event may correspond to the displayed or spoken text "Your flight tonight to Topeka was cancelled due to bad weather (due to bad weather, your flight to the bracket card has been cancelled in the evening)", and the indication of the request to perform the at least one action may correspond to the displayed or spoken text "Would you like me to reschedule the ground transportation you had reserved? (do you wish me to reschedule your scheduled ground traffic.
To prevent inadvertent output of personal or sensitive information, the assistant module 122A may generate signaling of the notification instead of actually outputting the notification. For example, in response to receiving a notification from assistant module 122B, assistant module 122A may cause UIC 112 to output an alert to indicate that the assistant has information to you. The alert may correspond to the text "I have something for you. Area you here? (do i tell you do. The output of UIC 112 may actively inform the user that meaningful information is available.
In some examples, the assistant module 122 may prohibit outputting the notification until the assistant module 122 determines that the user has received and agreed to such signaling. For example, when assistant module 122A receives an indication of consent from the user (e.g., microphone determination of UIC 112 indicates "Yes, I' sphere (Yes, me here)"), receives an indication that the user has activated the display of UIC 112, and/or receives data indicating that the user has interacted with computing device 110A in some other manner (e.g., lifting the device, pressing a button, etc.) to indicate consent, assistant module 122B may determine that the user has consented to the session.
In any event, after outputting the notification of the event and the request to perform at least one action, the assistant module 122A may detect user input when the user responds to the request. In the example of fig. 1, the assistant module 122A may receive spoken or written user input corresponding to the text "Yes, please reschedule my ride (Yes, please reschedule my itinerary)" via the camera or microphone of UIC 112. In response to determining that the spoken or written user input corresponds to a confirmation of the request, the agent of the assistant module 122A may reschedule the scheduled ground traffic reservation to adjust the flight delay.
In some examples, the action may be associated with a third device different from the devices executing any of the assistant modules 122. The assistant module 122A may implement or perform the action by sending information to the third device to cause the third device to complete the action. For example, the ground transportation service may be associated with an application executing at computing device 110B. Assistant module 122A may send a message to the application via network 130 with a request to reschedule the service. In response to the application confirming that the ground traffic has been scheduled, the computing device 110B may output a notification indicating a new time for the ground traffic.
In this manner, the assistant module 122 can actively guide the user to other actions or capabilities of the assistant without having to flood the user with trivial information or require the user to provide input related to such actions or capabilities. Because the exemplary assistant will actively guide the user to meaningful information, the user does not have to spend time guiding the assistant with a particular query. Thus, an exemplary assistant according to the present disclosure may complete tasks faster and/or respond to a user faster than other assistants. By actively guiding the user to meaningful information, the assistant may look natural, less awkward, and make the user more pleasant.
Among the several benefits provided by the above-described methods are: (1) By actively directing the user to the actions or capabilities of the assistant, without relying on specific queries from the user or the user spending time learning the actions or capabilities via knowledge or other means, the processing complexity and time of the device actions may be reduced. Explicit user requests for information about the capabilities of the assistant, e.g. by voice input, can be avoided. This may result in no need for a computer device on which the assistant is implemented to handle such requests, and thus, particularly over time and multiple sessions, the computing device benefits from substantial savings in computer resources associated with implementing the assistant; (2) Meaningful information and information associated with the user may be stored locally, thereby reducing the need for complex and memory-consuming transport security protocols on the user device for private data; (3) Because the exemplary assistant directs the user to actions or capabilities, the user can request fewer specific queries, thereby reducing the need for query rewrites and other computationally complex data retrieval on the user device; and (4) network usage may be reduced because as the number of specific queries is reduced, the data required by the assistant module to respond to a specific query is also reduced. For example, data traffic between the client computing device 110 from which the assistant may output information and the remote server 180 from which the client device may seek information may be reduced. In addition to or instead of such a reduction caused by fewer specific queries, the reduction in network data traffic may result from an overall reduction in the amount of time required for a communication channel between a particular client device 110 and a remote server 180 to remain open to facilitate a particular session. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that by automatically facilitating a session with a user by providing information without requiring the user to request information from an assistant, the overall efficiency of the session may be improved from a technical resource perspective, as the user is not required to explicitly find the information through a separate session operation. Furthermore, the duration of the session may be reduced, which may close the communication channel earlier than would otherwise be the case, thereby freeing up network resources.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computing device configured to execute an exemplary virtual assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Computing device 210 of fig. 2 is described below as an example of computing devices 110A and/or 110B of fig. 1. Fig. 2 illustrates only one particular example of computing device 210, and in other examples many other examples of computing device 210 may be used, and may include a subset of the components contained in exemplary computing device 210 or may include additional components not shown in fig. 2.
As shown in the example of fig. 2, computing device 210 includes a User Interface Component (UIC) 212, one or more processors 240, one or more communication units 242, one or more input components 244, one or more output components 246, and one or more storage components 248.UIC 212 includes an output component 202 and an input component 204. Storage component 248 of computing device 210 includes UI module 220, assistant module 222, user information data store 224, one or more application modules 226, and context module 230.
Communication channel 250 may interconnect each of components 212, 240, 242, 244, 246, and 248 for inter-component communication (physically, communicatively, and/or operatively). In some examples, communication channel 250 may include a system bus, a network connection, an interprocess communication data structure, or any other method for communicating data.
The one or more communication units 242 of the computing device 210 may communicate with external devices by sending and/or receiving network signals over one or more networks via one or more wired and/or wireless networks. Examples of communication unit 242 include a network interface card (e.g., such as an ethernet card), an optical transceiver, a radio frequency transceiver, a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver, or any other type of device capable of transmitting and/or receiving information. Other examples of communication unit 242 may include a short wave radio, a cellular data radio, a wireless network radio, and a Universal Serial Bus (USB) controller.
One or more input components 244 of the computing device 210 may receive input. Examples of inputs are haptic, audio and video inputs. In one example, the input component 244 of the computing device 210 includes a presence-sensitive input device (e.g., touch sensitive screen, PSD), mouse, keyboard, voice response system, camera, microphone, or any other type of device for detecting input from a person or machine. In some examples, the input component 244 may include one or more sensor components, one or more position sensors (GPS component, wi-Fi component, cellular component), one or more temperature sensors, one or more motion sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope), one or more pressure sensors (e.g., barometer), one or more ambient light sensors, and one or more other sensors (e.g., microphone, camera, infrared proximity sensor, hygrometer, etc.). Other sensors (to name a few other non-limiting examples) may include heart rate sensors, magnetometers, glucose sensors, olfactory sensors, compass sensors, pedometer sensors.
One or more output components 246 of computing device 110 may generate output. Examples of outputs are haptic, audio and video outputs. In one example, output component 246 of computing device 210 includes a PSD, a sound card, a video graphics adapter card, speakers, a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), or any other type of device for generating output to a person or machine.
The UIC 212 of the computing device 210 may be similar to the UIC 112 of the computing device 110 and includes an output component 202 and an input component 204. The output component 202 can be a display component, such as a screen on which information is displayed by the UIC 212, and the input component 204 can be a presence-sensitive input component that detects objects at and/or near the display component 202. The output component 202 and the input component 204 may be a speaker and microphone pair or any other combination of one or more input and output components, such as the input component 244 and the output component 244. In the example of fig. 2, UIC 212 may present a user interface (such as user interface 114 of fig. 1).
Although illustrated as an internal component of computing device 210, UIC 212 may also represent an external component that shares a data path with computing device 210 for sending and/or receiving inputs and outputs. For example, in one example, UIC 212 represents a built-in component of computing device 210 (e.g., a screen on a mobile phone) that is located within and physically connected to an outer package of computing device 210. In another example, UIC 212 represents an external component of computing device 210 that is located outside of and physically separate from the packaging or housing of computing device 210 (e.g., a monitor, projector, etc. that shares a wired and/or wireless data path with computing device 210).
One or more storage components 248 within computing device 210 may store information for processing during operation of computing device 210 (e.g., computing device 210 may store data accessed during execution at computing device 210 by modules 220, 222, 230, and 226 and data store 224). In some examples, the storage component 248 is temporary storage, meaning that the primary purpose of the storage component 248 is not long-term storage. The storage component 248 on the computing device 210 may be configured to store information as volatile memory for a short period of time, and thus not retain stored content if powered down. Examples of volatile memory include Random Access Memory (RAM), dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), static Random Access Memory (SRAM), and other forms of volatile memory known in the art.
In some examples, storage component 248 further includes one or more computer-readable storage media. In some examples, storage component 248 includes one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media. The storage component 248 may be configured to store more information than is typically stored by volatile memory. The storage component 248 may be further configured to store information as non-volatile storage, long term, and retain information after power on/off cycles. Examples of non-volatile memory include magnetic hard disks, optical disks, floppy disks, flash memory, or the form of electrically programmable memory (EPROM) or electrically erasable programmable memory (EEPROM). Storage component 248 can store program instructions and/or information (e.g., data) associated with modules 220, 222, 230, and 226 and data store 224. Storage component 248 may include memory configured to store data or other information associated with modules 220, 222, 230, and 226 and data store 224.
The one or more processors 240 may implement functions and/or execute instructions associated with the computing device 210. Examples of processor 240 include an application processor, a display controller, an auxiliary processor, one or more sensor hubs, and any other hardware configured to act as a processor, processing unit, or processing device. Modules 220, 222, 230, and 226 may be operable by processor 240 to perform various actions, operations, or functions of computing device 210. For example, the processor 240 of the computing device 210 may retrieve and execute instructions stored by the storage component 248 that cause the processor 240 to execute the operational modules 220, 222, 230, and 226. The instructions, when executed by the processor 240, may cause the computing device 210 to store information within the storage component 248, e.g., at the data store 224.
UI module 220 may include all of the functionality of UI module 120 of fig. 1 and may perform operations similar to UI module 120 to execute an assistant as part of computing device 210. UI module 220 may manage user interactions with UIC 212 and other components of computing device 210. UI module 220 may cause UIC 212 to output a user interface when a user of computing device 210 views the output and/or provides the input at UIC 212.
User information data store 224 is an example of user information data store 124A of FIG. 1. The assistant module 222 may include all of the functionality of the assistant module 122 of fig. 1 and may perform operations similar to the assistant module 122 to execute the assistant as part of the computing device 210 and to maintain and access user information in the user information data store 224. In some examples, the assistant module 222 may execute locally (e.g., at the processor 240) to provide assistant functionality. In some examples, the assistant module 222 may serve as an interface to remote assistance services accessible to the computing device 210. For example, the assistant module 222 may be an interface or Application Programming Interface (API) of the assistant module 122B of the digital assistant server 160 of fig. 1.
The one or more application modules 226 represent all of the various individual applications and services executing at the computing device 210 and accessible from the computing device 210 that may be accessed by the assistant to provide information to the user and/or perform tasks or actions. Many examples of application module 226 may exist and include fitness applications, calendar applications, search applications, map or navigation applications, travel applications (e.g., planning, booking, ticketing, etc.), social media applications, gaming applications, email applications, chat or messaging applications, internet browser applications, or any other application that may execute on computing device 210. An assistant (such as assistant module 222) executing on computing device 210 may cause application 226 to execute instructions for performing a plurality of actions associated with the assistant. In other words, the assistant may rely on the application module 226 to perform a number of actions on behalf of the assistant.
Upon receiving explicit consent to store and utilize personal information (e.g., information stored in data store 224) from a user, context module 230 may process and analyze the context information associated with computing device 210 to define a context 210 of computing device 210 or a context of a user of computing device 210. The context module 230 may encrypt or otherwise process the information being analyzed and/or stored to remove the user's true identity before storing or utilizing the person. For example, this information may be processed by the context module 230 such that any personally identifiable information is removed when stored or transmitted to a remote computing device (e.g., the digital assistant server 160) for processing. If the user affirmatively agrees to use or collect such information, the context module 230 may only analyze the information associated with the computing device 210 and/or the user of the computing device 210. The context module 230 may further provide an opportunity for the user to withdraw consent, and in such a case, the context module 230 may cease collecting or otherwise retaining information associated with the computing device 210 or the user of the computing device 210.
The context of computing device 210 may specify one or more characteristics associated with computing device 210 and/or a user of computing device 210, and his or her physical and/or virtual environment, at various locations and times. For example, the context module 230 may determine, from a particular time, a physical location associated with the computing device 210 at the particular time as part of the context of the computing device 210 based on the context information associated with the computing device 210. As the context information changes (e.g., based on sensor information indicating movement over time), the context module 230 may update the physical location in the determined context of the computing device 210.
The types of information defining the context of a computing device at a particular location and/or time are too numerous to list. As some examples, the context of the computing device may specify: acoustic fingerprints, video fingerprints, location, movement track, direction, speed, organization name, street address, location type, building, weather conditions and traffic conditions for different locations and times. The context of the computing device may further include calendar information defining meetings or events associated with the respective locations and times, web page addresses viewed at the respective locations and times, text input (e.g., search or browsing history) made in the data fields of web pages viewed at the respective locations and times, and other application usage data associated with the respective locations and times. The context of the computing device may further include: information about audio and/or video streams accessed or broadcast in the presence of a computing device at various locations and times, television or cable/satellite broadcasts accessed or broadcast in the presence of a computing device at various locations and times, and information about other services accessed by the computing device at various locations and times.
The context module 230 may share the context of the computing device 210 with the assistant module 222, from which the assistant module 222 may determine whether to output a notification of an event. The context module 230 may respond to a request from the assistant module 222 for a current context or state associated with the computing device 210 by outputting data to the assistant module 222 specifying the current state or context of the user.
In operation, the assistant module 222 can determine an event for initiating interaction between the user and the assistant based on information associated with the user of the computing device. For example, the assistant module 222 may monitor a data source, such as the data store 224, to detect changes in information, which may represent events worth notifying the user. Examples of data sources include message accounts, calendars, social media accounts, and other sources of information. Examples of events include appointment augmentation, cancellation or modification (e.g., invitations, meetings, anniversaries, etc.), events (e.g., shipping notices, flight delays), announcements (e.g., tour dates, etc.), and other types of events.
The data store 224 may include references to private or public calendars. The assistant module 222 may detect events related to a calendar when an appointment on the calendar is added, deleted, modified, satisfied, or missed. For example, the assistant module 222 may determine the event in response to determining that the dentist sent a cancel notification to cancel an appointment on the calendar based on the personal calendar. The assistant module 222 may determine the event in response to determining that a holiday, birthday, or anniversary is upcoming based on the public calendar.
Data store 224 may include references to e-mail or text messages, voice messages, video messages, and the like. The assistant module 222 can determine events based on information included in such communications. For example, the assistant module 222 may determine the event in response to determining that the scheduled appointment has been canceled or delayed based on an email from a service provider (e.g., an airline, a cable provider, etc.). Alternatively, the assistant module 222 may determine the event in response to determining that the package has been mailed based on an email from the retailer.
The assistant module 222 can select at least one action associated with the event based on the event and from a plurality of actions. For example, the model of the assistant module 222 may receive an event or event type as input and output one or more actions associated with the event. The model may be a machine learning type model (e.g., a neural network), a rule-based model, or other type of model that matches actions to events.
The model may assign a likelihood (e.g., score, probability, etc.) that indicates a relationship between an action and an event and/or how closely the action may be performed with respect to the event. For example, the model may be trained on observations of various events and user activities of a user causing a computing device to perform actions in response to the events. In the event that explicit consent is obtained from the user, the model may analyze the user device interactions to develop rules that indicate what actions the user will take and when such actions should be taken for a particular event or event type.
For example, the model may be trained on user interaction data that indicates that the user received a flight delay notification, and at 90% of the time, the user would send a message to a buddy. The model may be further trained on user interaction data indicating that the user is 80% of the time, which would cause the device to send a message to a spouse or important others. Thus, the model may create rules indicating that the action that is worth recommending whenever a flight delay notification is to be output may be an action to send a message to a spouse or important others.
As another example, the model may be trained on user interaction data that indicates that most users of other devices examine fantasy sports scores after receiving score updates for the game currently in progress. The model may be further trained on user interaction data indicating that 80% of the time, as the primary way for the user to examine the fantasy score, the user causes the device to open a popular fantasy sports application. Thus, the model may create rules indicating that whenever a sports score notification is to be output and a popular fantasy sports application is installed on the computing device, the action that is worth recommending may be the action of running the fantasy sports application after the score is displayed.
In some cases, the model may be based on a dependency graph. For example, the dependency graph of the model may include a root node that may be a flight. Depending on the root node, it may be a traffic node, accommodation node, conference node, dining node, etc. Edges between the root node and each of these nodes may be dependencies, such as arrival times, available subscriptions, and so on. If the edge cannot be traversed, the model may trigger a suggested action. In some examples, the suggested actions themselves may be nodes of a dependency graph with various dependencies (e.g., how late, no alternatives, etc.) and weights, and may provide the highest weighted possible path to the user (and, if appropriate, alternative lower weight actions). The graph of the model may first be presented as a template to which user data may be added, and may be modified by the system (e.g., using machine learning, manual input from a user, etc.). Many other examples of the model exist.
In any case, when the assistant module 222 generates such rules, the input of the rules may be an event or event type, and the output of each rule may indicate the degree of likelihood that each available action is associated with a particular event. The assistant module 222 may rank the plurality of actions it performs based on the degree of likelihood assigned to each action to determine the highest ranked action(s). In other words, the assistant module 222 may rank each of the plurality of actions based on the event and select at least one action with the highest ranking.
In some examples, if the degree of likelihood of all actions does not meet the threshold, the assistant module 222 may determine that there are no actions related to the event. For example, if any of a plurality of actions that the assistant module 222 may perform are not more than 50% likely to be associated with a particular event, the assistant module 222 may determine that there are no action worth suggesting during notification of the particular event.
In some examples, if the degree of likelihood of a single action satisfies a threshold, the assistant module 222 may determine that there is a single action related to the event. For example, if only one of the plurality of actions that may be performed by the assistant module 222 has a likelihood of greater than 90% being associated with a particular event, the assistant module 222 may determine that there is a single action worth suggesting during notification of the particular event.
In some examples, if the degree of likelihood of two or more actions meets a threshold, the assistant module 222 can determine that there are multiple actions related to the event. For example, if two or more of the plurality of actions that may be performed by the assistant module 222 each have a greater than 95% likelihood of being associated with a particular event, the assistant module 222 may determine that there are a plurality of actions worth suggesting during notification of the particular event.
In some examples, the model used by the assistant module 222 to select at least one action associated with an event based on the event and from a plurality of actions may be table or graph based. For example, the assistant module 222 can look up an event or event type on a table or graph and determine which one or more actions associated with the event are included in the table or graph.
Some assistants may provide a voice-only interface, may have few documents attached, or may be otherwise limited to teach the user assistant what can be done. It can be difficult for some users to discover the actions or capabilities of the assistant. The assistant module 222 may be configured to teach the user about its capabilities when the actions or capabilities may be beneficial or otherwise advantageous to the user. The assistant module 222 can determine whether to output a notification of an event that includes a suggested action in order to increase the likelihood that not only the notification is interesting but the user is likely to authorize the suggested action suggested by the assistant. In this way, the assistant module 222 may suggest a truly useful action in the event that the likelihood that the user may reject the suggestion is low. The assistant module 222 will have taught the user new actions even if the user does not authorize the actions.
For example, the assistant module 222 can determine whether to output a notification of an event based at least in part on a degree of likelihood that a user will accept a request to perform an action associated with the event. The assistant module 222 may determine the degree of likelihood based on the context of the user, the context of the computing device 222, information stored at the user information data store 224, or a combination thereof, as well as any other information accessible to the assistant module 222.
For example, the assistant module 222 can determine whether to output a notification of an event based at least in part on how recently a previous interaction occurred between the user and the assistant. If the previous interaction occurred within a threshold period of time (e.g., five minutes), the assistant module 222 may determine that the user will accept the request to perform the action to a lesser extent, and conversely, is more likely to reject the request. If the previous interaction occurred outside of the threshold period of time, the assistant module 222 may determine that the user will accept the request to perform the action to a high degree of probability and thus be more likely to accept the request.
The assistant module 222 can determine whether to output a notification of an event based at least in part on the context of the computing device 210. For example, if the context indicates that the user is interacting with the computing device 210 (e.g., viewing the UIC 212 and/or providing input to the UIC 212), the assistant module 222 may determine that the user will accept the request to perform the action to a high degree of probability and thus be more likely to accept the request. If the context indicates that the user is not interacting with computing device 210 (e.g., computing device 210 is coupled to a wireless communication unit of a moving vehicle, computing device 210 is lying on a table or in a pocket of the user, computing device 210 is in a movie theater, etc.), assistant module 222 may determine that the user will accept the request to perform the action to a low degree and, therefore, is more likely not to output a notification with the request.
In some examples, the assistant module 222 can assign a severity level to an event and increase or decrease the degree of likelihood that the user will accept a request to perform an action based on the severity level. For example, if the event is a flight delayed less than a threshold amount of time (e.g., 1 hour, half hour, etc.), the assistant module 222 may determine that the event is not a severe event based on determining that the severity level of the event is low. However, if the flight is delayed by greater than or equal to a threshold amount of time (e.g., 1 hour, half hour, etc.), the assistant module 222 may determine that the event is a severe event based on determining that the severity level of the event is a medium or high level.
In some examples, the threshold amount of time may be based on an actual event. For example, the threshold amount of time may be a percentage of the total time of flight (i.e., the duration of the flight itself). If the flight is delayed for 1 hour, but the flight is 10 hours, the assistant module 222 may assign a low or medium severity level. While if the flight is delayed by half an hour and the flight is only 1 hour, the assistant module 222 may assign a high severity level to the event so that it is currently more likely to output a notification that includes a suggested action (e.g., notifying a friend or spouse to go home late).
In response to determining to output the notification of the event, the assistant module 222 may output the notification of the event during interaction between the user and the assistant via the UIC 212. The notification may include an indication of an event and a request to perform at least one action associated with the event.
For example, if the assistant module 222 determines that a dental appointment on a calendar is canceled (e.g., by pushing an email or notification to the user), the assistant module 222 may determine to output a cancellation notification. The output may be a voice notification that includes a request to call the dentist for rescheduling. In response to receiving a user input at UIC 212 indicating that the user wishes the assistant to call the dentist, assistant module 222 can invoke a telephone application from application module 226 to dial the dentist office on behalf of the user.
As another example, if the assistant module 222 determines that the flight is delayed for five hours, the assistant module 222 may determine to output a cancellation notification. The output may be a voice notification that includes a request to cancel or reschedule ground traffic (such as an unmanned car) booked at the destination. In response to receiving a user input at UIC 212 indicating that the user wishes for the assistant to cancel or reschedule the ground traffic, assistant module 222 may send a message to the ground traffic service to cancel or reschedule the subscription.
As another example, the assistant module 222 may determine to output a cancellation notification when the flight is delayed for five hours. The output may be a voice notification including a telephone request, text message, email, or wife that otherwise contacts the user. In response to receiving user input at UIC 212 indicating that the user wishes the assistant to contact the user's wife, assistant module 222 may determine contact information for the user's wife and send a message to the wife informing her of the delay.
As another example, if the assistant module 222 determines that there are more than one week or more than one episode, the assistant module 222 may determine to output a notification of the event. The output may be a voice notification that includes a request to order flowers for a girlfriend of the user. In response to receiving user input at UIC 212 indicating that the user wishes to assistant to order flowers, assistant module 222 may determine contact information for the user's girlfriend and order flowers online to be assigned to the girlfriend's address.
In this manner, the assistant module 222 may enhance discoverability of features, capabilities, or actions that the assistant module 222 may perform so that a user of the computing device 210 may obtain more benefits or uses from existing features. The assistant module 222 teaches actions in the grammar of the user's native language. In some examples, multiple actions are suggested by notification, or a single action is suggested. In response to receiving confirmation that the user wishes the assistant to take an action, the assistant module 222 may perform the action and/or direct the user to a companion application, such as one of the application modules 226, from which the action may be performed.
Fig. 3 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary operations performed by one or more processors executing an exemplary virtual assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Hereinafter, fig. 3 is described in the context of computing device 100 of fig. 1. For example, operations 300-308 may be performed by assistant module 122A while executing at one or more processors of computing device 110A, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.
In operation, computing device 110A may receive consent from the user to utilize and store personal information (300). For example, in response to identifying potential personal information, assistant module 122A may cause UI module 120 to request permission from the user to store and utilize personal information obtained during interactions between assistant module 122A and the user. It should be appreciated that the computing device 110A may not require user consent each time the assistant module 122A wants to utilize or store personal information. For example, if computing device 110A receives an agreement once per year, once per day, or even only once (e.g., after initial product purchase, setup, etc.), computing device 110A may consider the previous agreement as an agreement to utilize and store personal information in the future. As one example of how the user may provide consent, the user may provide a voice input "yeah chat's ok to store information about me (yes, information about my may be stored)" detected by UIC 212, and in response to the voice input, assistant module 122A may begin maintaining a personal record about the user at data store 122A.
Computing device 110A may determine an event for initiating an interaction based at least in part on the personal information (302). For example, the assistant module 122A can receive a notification (e.g., data) from the digital assistant server 160 indicating an event for initiating an interaction between the user of the computing device 110A and the assistant. The notification may include a message received from a friend by a message account of the user. The message may include a question asking the user if he or she wants to go to happy hours.
Computing device 110A may select at least one action associated with the event based on the event (304). For example, the model of the assistant module 122A may determine that the happy time light is a late type of event, thus sending a message home to let the family know that the late is an action associated with the happy time light. Additionally, the model of the assistant module 122A may determine to record that the live news broadcast that the user typically views after work hours is an action associated with a happy time.
Computing device 110A may determine whether to output a notification of the event based on the at least one action (306). For example, the assistant module 122A may prohibit generation of notifications of events until the context (e.g., time) of the computing device 110A when the assistant module 122A believes that the user is most likely to want the assistant to perform at least one action. Assistant module 122A may determine that the user is in a meeting room ready to begin a meeting based on contextual information about computing device 110A. The assistant module 122A may determine that the happy time event is a low severity event and because the user is unlikely to want the assistant to now perform an action instead of outputting a notification of the event, the assistant module 122A should prohibit outputting the notification until a later time (308, no).
At a later time, e.g., after a meeting, assistant module 122A may determine that the user is in his or her office based on the contextual information about computing device 110A. The assistant module 122A may determine that the light event is a low severity event despite the happiness, and that the user is more likely to want the assistant to now perform an action when the user is alone in his or her office. Thus, the assistant module 122A may determine that the current time is a good time to generate an event notification (308, yes).
Computing device 110A may output a notification (310). For example, the assistant module 122A can determine that the user is interacting with the computing device 110B (e.g., a laptop computer) while in his or her office. Computing device 110A may send a notification of a happy hour that includes suggestions for: the message is sent home to know late, and to record live news broadcasts that the user typically views after work. Computing device 110B may display a graphical indication of the notification that alerts the user to the happy time invitation, and a selectable button for the user to select whether to have the assistant send a message home and/or record news on a home digital video recorder.
After outputting the notification (310), computing device 110A may receive data from computing device 110B indicating that the user has agreed to assistant module 122A perform one or both actions suggested by the event notification (312). For example, computing device 110B may share an indication of a voice command received from a user indicating that the user wishes the assistant to send a message home and/or record news.
In response to receiving the user input, the assistant module 122A may perform an action agreed to by the user (314). For example, the assistant module 122A can invoke an application executing on at least one processor configured to perform an action, the application being different from the assistant. For example, to send a message home, the assistant module 122A may send data to a messaging application that sends a message to the user's family via the user's messaging account.
In some examples, assistant module 122A may perform this action. For example, to control a digital video recorder, the assistant module 122A may send data to an API configured to control a remote control application of the digital video recorder. The assistant module 122A may directly configure the video recorder to record the news broadcast by sending an input to the API.
Fig. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computing system configured to execute an exemplary virtual assistant, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure. Hereinafter, the digital assistant server 460 of fig. 4 is described as an example of the digital assistant server 160 of fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows only one particular example of digital assistant server 460, and in other examples many other examples of digital assistant server 460 may be used, and may include a subset of the components contained in exemplary digital assistant server 460 or may include additional components not shown in fig. 4.
As shown in the example of fig. 4, digital assistant server 460 includes one or more processors 440, one or more communication units 442, and one or more storage devices 448. Storage 448 includes an assistant module 422, a user information data store 424, and a search module 482.
Processor 440 is similar to processor 240 of computing system 210 of fig. 2. The communication unit 442 is similar to the communication unit 242 of the computing system 210 of fig. 2. The storage device 448 is similar to the storage device 248 of the computing system 210 of fig. 2. Communication channel 450 is similar to communication channel 250 of computing system 210 of fig. 2, and thus each of components 440, 442, and 448 may be interconnected for inter-component communication. In some examples, communication channel 450 may include a system bus, a network connection, an interprocess communication data structure, or any other method for communicating data.
The search module 482 of the digital assistant server 460 is similar to the search module 182 of the search server system 180 and may perform integrated search functions on behalf of the digital assistant server 460. That is, the search module 482 may perform search operations on behalf of the assistant module 422. In some examples, the search module 482 may be connected with an external search system (such as search system 180) to perform search operations on behalf of the assistant module 422. When invoked, the search module 482 may perform search functions (such as generating search queries and performing searches based on search queries generated on various local and remote information sources). The search module 482 may provide results of the performed search to a calling component or module. That is, the search module 482 may output search results to the assistant module 422.
User information data store 424 is similar to user information data store 224 of fig. 2 and is configured to store information that is already known by the user associated assistant module 422 about the user of the computing device during a session between the user and the assistant provided by assistant module 422. The assistant module 422 can rely on information stored at the data store 424 to determine events and select actions related to the events for inclusion in notifications sent by the assistant module 422.
The assistant module 422 may include some or all of the functionality of the assistant module 122 of fig. 1 and the assistant module 222 of the computing device 210 of fig. 2. The assistant module 422 may perform operations similar to the assistant modules 122 and 222 for providing assistant services that may be accessed via a network, such as the network 130. That is, the assistant module 422 may serve as an interface to a remote assistant service accessible to computing devices that communicate with the digital assistant server 460 over a network. For example, the assistant module 422 may be an interface or API of the assistant module 122B of the digital assistant server 160 of fig. 1.
In operation, the assistant module 422 can analyze information contained in the user information data store 424 as well as information received from the search module 482 for events worth notifying the user. When the assistant module 422 detects an event and selects a recommended action related to the event, the assistant module 422 may select to trigger notification of the event based on a combination of factors including how often the assistant module 422 begins to interact with the user and the likelihood of successful interaction.
The assistant module 422 may generate a "surface-generated approach" notification that is more likely to draw the attention of the user. For example, if the user is associated with a home assistant device and has recently interacted with a home assistant, the assistant module 422 may cause the home assistant to generate an alert based on the voice notification. The voice notification may be generated in the language of the home assistant apparatus. For example, a voice notification may be sent to a home device to generate a message such as "Hello Viki, your flight has been delayed by three hours.shield I cancel the limo reservation? Your, viki, your flight has been delayed for three hours. Should the caravan reservation be cancelled? ". If the user is associated with a mobile phone and interacts with the assistant via the mobile phone, the assistant module 422 may send a notification to the mobile phone that a "cancel button" to cancel the caravan reservation is graphically displayed on the screen. In some cases, for example, for high value events or events with high severity levels, the assistant module 422 may send notifications with actions to multiple surfaces simultaneously.
