Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to wireless communications and, more particularly, to reselection by an idle mode wireless communication terminal in a wireless communication system based on a signal quality metric measured or estimated at the wireless communication terminal.
- Some heterogeneous wireless communication networks for example, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, comprise a macro cell-eNB (MeNB) and a home-eNB (HeNB) cell having overlapping bandwidth (BW) deployments that may subject user equipment (UE) to interference.
- 3GPP 3rd Generation Partnership Project
- UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
- LTE Long Term Evolution
- Some HeNBs are closed subscriber groups (CSG) that serve only UE belonging to the Group.
- Idle mode reselection behavior for LTE Release 8 (Rel-8) is specified in TS 36.304 v8.5.0.
- the existing reselection criterion for LTE Rel-8 uses reference signal received power (RSRP) from the serving cell as a mechanism to trigger reselection evaluation of neighboring base stations. This method is effective in recognizing when the UE moves out of a base station coverage area, but the RSRP will not trigger reselection evaluation when the UE is subject to interference from a neighboring base station, for example, when an idle mode UE camped on a MeNB is subject to interference from a neighboring HeNB.
- RSRP reference signal received power
- FIG. 1 illustrates a first scenario wherein a UE camped on a MeNB is subject to interference from the HeNB when the UE is located near a HeNB.
- FIG. 2 illustrates another scenario wherein a UE camped on a HeNB is subject to interference from a MeNB that is located near the HeNB.
- Such interference may result in a missed page and the associated consequences (e.g., missed network-originated calls, etc.) by an idle mode UE.
- R2-092416 entitled “Usage of IFRI with Cell Reselection to CSG cells” describes a mechanism wherein a UE camped on a MeNB attempts to reselect to a different carrier, i.e., performs inter-frequency reselection, upon detecting that an intra-frequency reselection indicator (IFRI) bit is set by a neighboring HeNB, wherein the set IFRI bit indicates that the HeNB and MeNB share a common carrier frequency. It has also been suggested that an idle mode UE camped on the MeNB “bar” the shared carrier frequency for a fixed duration (e.g., 300 sec) from reselection when the IFRI bit is set by the HeNB. In some systems, for example, LTE Release 9 (Rel-9), the SIB transmission must be decoded before the UE can determine whether the IFRI bit is set.
- a fixed duration e.g. 300 sec
- An alternate solution to interference in the scenario of FIG. 1 is to trigger inter-frequency reselection evaluation when the reference signal received quality (RSRQ) of the serving cell or base station falls below a threshold.
- RSRQ reference signal received quality
- This proposal suffers from various drawbacks including, among others, lack of agreement on how to measure interference and the fact that the reliability of paging channel reception is dependent on various factors such as the transmit antenna configuration of the serving base station, the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) code rate or aggregation level, frequency-dependent interference from the HeNB (eg., due to fractional frequency reuse), etc. resulting in a scenario that the RSRQ is not a good indicator of paging channel performance.
- PDCCH physical downlink control channel
- the RSRQ-based proposal although in principle can trigger macro cell UEs (MUEs) with potentially poor paging performance to start inter-frequency reselection evaluations, the RSRQ metric as it is defined in LTE Rel-8 will likely lead to a failure in fulfillment of this objective.
- the interference measurement used for estimating RSSI in the specification is not well defined (e.g., no specification on which RBs or subframes are used, whether RSRP should be narrowband or wideband, etc.) and as a result, different UE implementations might end up behaving differently.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a portion of a first prior art wireless communication network.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a portion of a second prior art wireless communication network.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a periodic paging signal received by a user terminal operating in idle mode.
- FIG. 4 illustrates process flow diagram

- an idle mode UE camped on a base station is configured to receive a paging channel or portion thereof while camped on the base station.
- the MUE 104 is camped on the MeNB 102 and in FIG. 2 the HUE 206 is camped on the HeNB 204 .

- FIG. 3 illustrates periodic paging occasions 302 , wherein each paging occasion comprises at least one sub-frame 310 at least a portion of which is received by the UE during the paging occasions as discussion further below.
- the exemplary sub-frame has time and frequency dimensions.
- an idle mode UE camped on a base station receives a downlink transmission including a reference signal from the base station.
- the reference signal is also referred to as a pilot signal.
- the reference or pilot signals are located in a control region 320 of the sub-frame 310 .
- the reference signals, PDCCH and other information are interleaved on symbols in the control region.
- the UE receives one or more reference or pilot signals during one or more paging occasions.
- the controller of FIG. 2 is a digital processor configured by digital instructions stored in memory to cause the transceiver to receive the reference signal during the paging occasions while camped on the serving base station in idle mode.
- the functionality performed by the controller may be implemented by a hardware equivalent circuit.

- the UE measures the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) for a sub-band in the frequency dimension of the sub-frame for the corresponding paging occasion (PO).
- the term sub-band may refer to a group of sub-carriers or to a set of contiguous resource blocks.
- the sub-band may correspond to one sub-carrier (15 kHz) or to a group of sub-carriers. More generally, a wideband measurement of the RSRP may be made by the UE.

- EESM Effective Exponential Sum of SINR
- LTE Rel-8 the serving eNB transmits the antenna configuration to the UE employed for PDCCH transmissions, for example, SIMO, SFBC or SFBC-FSTD.
- the transmission configuration indicates how PDCCH codewords are physically transmitted on antenna ports and resource elements (REs) and this information is necessary for the UE to compute the DCI format 1C BLER.
- REs resource elements
- the BLER of a pre-determined PDSCH payload or MCS level may be used and the principles for deducing the interference and the transmission parameters described above may be used.
- the BLER of a hypothetical PDSCH payload or an MCS level may be determined based on a reference signal to noise ratio (RS-SINR) evaluated at a sub-band (or sub-carrier) level.
- RS-SINR reference signal to noise ratio
- the quality metric of the hypothetical paging channel reception is based on the reference signal and based on the estimated or measured interference from one or more neighboring base stations.
- HeNB 106 interferes with transmissions from MeNB 102 in FIG. 1 .
- the quality metric is computed using the cell-specific reference signal (CRS).
- CRS cell-specific reference signal
- side information such as the transmission mode (e.g., SIMO, SFBC, and SFBC-FSTD), the number of control symbols, power boost used on PDCCH REs, BW, etc. are necessary for the computation of BLER.
- the sub-carriers on which the cell specific reference signal (CRS) is transmitted do not contain any other transmission from that cell.
- the pilot power and interference subcarrier power is computed either by coherent/non-coherent processing or by employing channel estimation and canceling off the serving cell transmission from the received signal to estimate the interference.
- channel estimation may be based on two 1-D MMSE estimators, which are separable in time and frequency, or based on a 2-D MMSE estimator.
- the sub-carrier level RSRP is determined. This processing is typically carried out on a sub-band basis.
- the sub-band has a granularity of 6 physical resource blocks (PRBs) for a downlink (DL) bandwidth (BW) of 10 MHz.
- PRBs physical resource blocks
- BW downlink bandwidth
- the BLER determination based on the RS-SINR typically involves the following steps.
- the set of REs that “carry” the codeword in the time-frequency grid within the sub-frame is determined from the set of transmission parameters (e.g., aggregation level, number of control symbols, transmission mode—SIMO, SFBC, SFBC-FSTD, etc.).
- the channel coefficients corresponding to the set of REs that “carry” the hypothetical codeword is obtained.
- the average sub-band level interference power is determined, for example, by coherent/non-coherent accumulation.
- the channel coefficients corresponding to the set of REs that “carry” the hypothetical codeword is obtained from channel estimation and interpolation.
- a single metric like the EESM or MMIB is computed from the PDCCH-SINR computed above.
- the EESM/MMIB is a non-negative real number obtained from the set of PDCCH-SINR estimates corresponding to the PDCCH REs.
- a lookup table or a mapping function is used to determine BLER from EESM/MMIB.
- the UE determines whether to perform reselection evaluation of one or more neighboring base stations based on the estimated quality metric.
- the reselection evaluation of neighboring base stations is generally performed when the estimated quality metric is below a threshold.
- the quality metric is based on the BLER of the DCI format 1C or other transmission
- the reselection evaluation is performed when the BLER exceeds a specified threshold, which may be determined based on empirical data or simulations.
- the quality metric may be expressed as (1—BLER).
- the serving cell transmits the threshold on the quality metric to be used by the UE on its system information broadcast.
- the serving cell transmits the threshold to be used on a radio resource control (RRC) configuration message. In both cases, the UE is required to decode this information prior to triggering reselection evaluation.
- RRC radio resource control
- the UE performs the reselection evaluation of neighboring base stations when the estimated quality metric is below a threshold.
- the quality metric of a hypothetical paging channel reception is estimated for each of the neighboring base stations based on a corresponding reference signal of the neighboring base station and based on the corresponding interference for the neighboring base station.
- the quality metric of the neighboring base stations may be estimated during the paging occasions as discussed above. In some instances the UE may estimate the quality metric of the neighboring base stations more frequently.
- the quality metric of the hypothetical paging channel for each of the neighboring base stations may be estimated by determining the BLER for a DCI format 1C transmission based on RSRP or one of the alternatives discussed above.
- the UE reselects based on the reselection evaluation.
- the UE reselects to a neighboring base station having a highest ranked hypothetical paging reception, assuming reselection is allowed.
- the UE may reselect to a highest ranked neighboring base station on a carrier that is the same as a carrier of the serving base station if the neighboring base station is allowed. If a highest ranked neighboring base station is not allowed, the UE reselects to another neighboring base station on a carrier that is different than a carrier of the serving base station.
- An alternate ranking criterion could include ranking based on reference signal received power corresponding to the neighboring base station. The UE reselects to the neighboring base station with the highest ranked reference signal received power if the base station is allowed.
- the UE receives a downlink transmission from the base station including a system information broadcast (SIB) message.
- SIB system information broadcast
- the UE estimates the quality metric of a hypothetical paging channel reception based on the SIB message instead of the reference signal.
- SIB-1 has a TTI of 80 ms (transmission/re-transmissions).
- the SIB-x are addressed by DCI format 1C.
- the UE can physically try to decode the SIB-x codewords and from the failed CRC checks, and can compute the BLER associated with DCI format 1C transmission (assuming that the DCI format 1C error event dominates the overall error event and that PDSCH BLER is not the bottleneck).
- the UE reselects to the highest ranked neighboring base station based on ranking criterion.
- the ranking criterion could include reference signal received power or quality of a hypothetical paging channel reception, if the neighboring base station remains the highest ranked base station for a certain duration of time.
- the duration of time for evaluating whether the neighboring base station is the highest ranked base station may be signaled by the serving base station.
- the UE also computes BLER corresponding to hypothetical codeword transmissions from non-serving cell (denoted as eNB2, eNB3, etc.). For this, the UE may need to make assumptions on where the POs will be and in addition may need to read the MIB/SIB-1/SIB-2/etc. of eNB2, eNB3, etc. to determine various parameters like the DL BW, transmit antenna configuration and paging channel configuration (if such a thing is defined in LTE Release 9), etc. Alternately, the serving cell eNB1 may indicate the necessary parameters as part of the neighbor cell list information.
- UE If the BLER estimate for eNB1 exceeds the threshold, then UE reselects to the allowed non-serving eNB (i.e., one cell among eNB2, eNB3, etc.) that has the lowest BLER estimate. This alternative allows for reselection to a cell that enables best paging channel reception for a UE in idle mode.
- the UE estimates the quality metric of a hypothetical paging channel reception for each of the neighboring base stations and the serving base station based on the block error rate associated with the DCI format 1C transmission associated with the corresponding SIB message for each of the neighboring base stations and the serving base station, respectively. It is not necessary for the UE to decode the SIB message. The UE is only required to decode the DCI format 1C transmission addressing the SIB message transmission to estimate the BLER.
