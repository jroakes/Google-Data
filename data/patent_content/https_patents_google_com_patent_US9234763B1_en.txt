- the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for identifying and selecting personalized waypoints for presentation on a map.
- a client device such as a smartphone or a desktop computer can operate a browser, mapping application, or a geographic information system to provide maps and/or other geographic imagery and data to a user.
- a user can request a map or driving directions to a particular address.
- a map can be provided in response to a web search query that implicitly calls for geographic results, such as when the search includes the name of a business having a physical location.
- the client device can communicate with a host server over a network in order to obtain the appropriate geographic information to provide to the user.
- mapping applications or other means for obtaining geographic information are particularly useful is when a user is exploring an area with which the user is relatively unfamiliar. For example, the user can be on vacation, work travel, or simply in an unfamiliar location within their home city. As a result, the user can use a mapping application to navigate about the area of exploration and receive other useful geographic information.
- mapping application can require the user to determine the location of each expected event relative to the locations of the other expected events on an individualized basis.
- the user may land at the destination airport and perform a search for the location of the hotel.
- the user would then be required to perform a second search to determine the first location at which she is expecting to attend the meeting, perform a third search to determine the second location at which she is expecting to meet with friends, and so on.
- synthesizing the results of two or more searches can be a difficult task, causing the user to be unsure of where each of the locations is relative to the others.
- One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a host server for providing geographic information.
- the host server is configured to perform operations.
- the operations include receiving a search query from a client device.
- the client device has been associated with a user account.
- the operations include, in response to the received search query, identifying a point of interest.
- the operations include obtaining a plurality of candidate waypoints from a database. Each of the candidate waypoints has been identified by analyzing data associated with the user account.
- the operations include determining a score for each of the candidate waypoints using a scoring formula and selecting at least one of the candidate waypoints for presentation on a map displaying the point of interest.

- the scoring formula can score each candidate waypoint on a number of criteria or parameters to provide a general indication of whether it is reasonable to display such candidate waypoint in conjunction with the identified point of interest search result.
- a candidate waypoint that receives a higher score is more likely to be a useful item, location, or event to show alongside the search result.
- the scoring formula used at ( 314 ) can provide a score to a candidate waypoint based at least in part on a distance between the candidate waypoint and the point of interest.
- a candidate waypoint is more likely to be a useful item or location to show alongside the search result if it reasonably close in distance from the identified point of interest search result. Therefore, a candidate waypoint can receive a higher score if it is closer to the point of interest and receive a lower score if it is farther in distance from the point of interest.
- the distance between the candidate waypoint and the point of interest can equal a linear distance between the two locations, a driving, walking, or transit distance between the two locations according to a routing, or a duration of travel between the two locations according to one of a variety of travel methods.
- the scoring formula used at ( 314 ) can provide a score to a candidate waypoint based at least in part on how likely the user is to want directions between the candidate waypoint and the point of interest search result. For example, if the point of interest is an airport, then the user is more likely to want directions between the airport and a candidate waypoint that represents a hotel. As another example, if the point of interest is a restaurant, then the user is less likely to want directions between the point of interest and a candidate waypoint that is another restaurant.
- scoring each candidate waypoint at ( 314 ) can include determining a first distance scaling component, determining a second distance scaling component, and/or determining a suitability component.
- the score provided at ( 314 ) can be the sum of such components.
- the first distance scaling component can scale the distance between the candidate waypoint being scored and the point of interest based on a first category assigned to the candidate waypoint.
- the first distance scaling component can equal a first weighted distance divided by the distance between the candidate waypoint and the point of interest.
- the first weighted distance can provide a number based on the first category assigned to the candidate waypoint being scored.
- the first weighted distance can parameterize how far a user is likely to travel to or from the candidate waypoint.
- the first category assigned to the candidate waypoint is an airport category
- the first weighted distance may be relatively greater, such as 30 kilometers, 19 miles, or 20 minutes, as the user is likely to be willing or required to travel a larger distance to catch a flight.
- the first category assigned to the candidate waypoint is a restaurant category
- the first weighted distance may be relatively less, such as 2 kilometers, 1.5 miles, or 5 minutes, as the user is likely to want to travel only a small distance to visit a restaurant.
- a bus stop category may receive a 1 kilometer distance and a train station may receive a 10 kilometer distance.
- the first weighted distance can provide an appropriate distance based on the first category assigned to the candidate waypoint being scored.
- the number provided by the first weighted distance can be in units that are homogenous to the expression of the distance between the candidate waypoint and the point of interest.
- the first weighted distance can be obtained from a table stored in memory that maps categorizations to distance values.
- the second distance scaling component can scale the distance between the candidate waypoint being scored and the point of interest based on a second category assigned to the point of interest.
- the second distance scaling component can equal a second weighted distance divided by the distance between the candidate waypoint and the point of interest.
- the second weighted distance can provide a number based on the second category associated with the point of interest.
- the second weighted distance can parameterize how far the user is likely to travel to or from the point of interest search result.
- the number provided by the second weighted distance can be in units that are homogenous to the expression of the distance between the candidate waypoint and the point of interest.
- the second weighted distance can be obtained from a table stored in memory that maps categorizations to distance values. Such values can be the same as or different from those provided for the first weighted distance.
- the suitability component can provide a value indicative of a likelihood that the user desires directions between the location and the point of interest based on the first category assigned to candidate waypoint being scored and the second category assigned to the point of interest.
- the suitability component can reference a look-up table that provides a suitability score for each potential combination of the first and second categories.
- the suitability component may provide a score of 1.5 for a combination of a hotel and an airport, a score of 0.5 for a combination of a restaurant and a restaurant, and a score of 1 for a combination of a hotel and a restaurant.
- the suitability component can also include a weighting coefficient.
- the current position of the client device can influence one or more components or aspects of the scoring formula. For example, if it is determined that the current location of the client device is a restaurant, then candidate waypoints that represent other restaurants can receive a lower score, as the user is less likely to want to visit consecutive restaurants.
- a time can be associated with some or all of the candidate waypoints and the scoring formula can include a component that analyzes a difference between a current time and the time associated with the candidate waypoint being scored. For example, a candidate waypoint can receive a higher score if its associated time is imminent and can receive a lower score if its associated time is a significantly distant from the current time.
- scoring components discussed above can be considered in isolation or in other combinations and are not necessarily used at a single time to provide a single score. Scores provided by the above discussed components can be positive or negative in nature. Furthermore, weightings, coefficients, or other components of the scoring formula can be trained against data having a known accuracy or categorization to optimize the scoring formula.
- one or more of the candidate waypoints can be selected at ( 316 ) for presentation on a personalized map alongside the point of interest. For example, the two candidate waypoints that receive the highest scores can be selected at ( 316 ).
- the host server can transmit mapping data to the client device and the client device can use such mapping data to present the personalized map to the user.
- the client device can present the personalized map on a display.
- the respective locations of the point of interest and the selected waypoints can be indicated using any suitable form of indicator.
- Textual information can be provided such as names, reviews, or keywords.
- An estimated trip duration can be provided for one or more forms of transportation for each candidate waypoint.
- the user can be given the option of selecting and subsequently receiving directions to or from each presented waypoint and the point of interest. Alternatively, such directions can be overlaid on the map in a faded fashion.
- the current location of client device can be displayed on the map and can influence the directionality of any offered directions between a waypoint and a point of interest search result.
- the offered directions can generally provide navigation from the closer of the two locations to the more distant of the two locations from the perspective of the user.
- the resulting map can provide additional personalized waypoints that represent locations at which an event is expected to occur (e.g. a sporting event for which the user has purchased tickets) or locations that may be helpful for a user who is in an unfamiliar area (e.g. the location of the hotel at which she is staying or the airport from which she is departing).
- locations at which an event is expected to occur e.g. a sporting event for which the user has purchased tickets
- locations that may be helpful for a user who is in an unfamiliar area e.g. the location of the hotel at which she is staying or the airport from which she is departing.
