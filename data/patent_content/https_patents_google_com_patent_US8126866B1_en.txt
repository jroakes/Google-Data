Definitions
- Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention relate generally to information retrieval and, more particularly, to improving results of search engines.
- the software performs functions desired by the user.
- the software may be “scumware” that was designed to do damage to a user's computer, monitor a user's actions, display unwanted advertising or popups, or perform other unwanted or undesirable actions on the user's computer system.
- Web sites that include or are otherwise associated with scumware are to be avoided.
- One aspect is directed to a method for responding to a search query.
- the method includes receiving the search query and comparing the received search query to a document index, the document index including indications of which documents in the document index are associated with scumware.
- the method further includes responding to the search query with search results determined based on a comparison of the search query to the document index and based on the indications of which of the documents in the document index are associated with scumware.
- Another aspect is directed to a method that includes receiving a search query from a user and generating search results for the search query to obtain documents that are relevant to the search query.
- the method further includes formatting the search results as a web page that includes a list of documents relevant to the search query, the web page including visual indicators associated with those of the relevant documents that have been determined to be associated with scumware.
- the method further includes transmitting the web page to the user.
- Yet another aspect is directed to a system including logic to store information labeling web documents as whether the web documents are associated with scumware.
- the system further includes logic to respond to requests from a toolbar executing on a client computer and in communication with the logic to store information.
- the requests relate to whether a web site being browsed by a user of the client computer is associated with scumware.
- the toolbar informs the user of the client computer when the logic to store information indicates, in response to the request, that the web site is associated with scumware.

- a network 105 such as the Internet, that connects users to web sites.
- a number of different web sites 110 through 113 are shown.
- Some of the web sites, web sites 111 and 113 are “normal” web sites that do not contain any scumware that is available to be downloaded.
- Others of the web sites, such as web sites 110 and 112 are web sites associated with scumware. Most users would prefer to avoid scumware web sites 110 and 112 .
- Search engine 120 may generally operate to crawl and index web sites 110 - 113 . Users (not shown) connected to network 110 may transmit search terms (called a search query herein) that relate to a topic in which they are interested to search engine 120 . Search engine 120 may respond by returning a list of documents, or links to documents, that are relevant to the search query.
- search query search terms
- search engine 120 may determine which of sites 110 - 113 are associated with scumware and take this information into account when returning search results.
- Search engine 120 may, for example, exclude scumware sites 110 and 112 from the search results, regardless of how relevant sites 110 and 112 otherwise are to the search query.
- search engine 120 may, for example, demote scumware sites 110 and 112 in the ranking of sites returned in the search results and/or visually flag scumware sites 110 and 112 when these sites are returned to a user.

- hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the present invention. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations of search engine 225 relating to updating database 235 .
- Database 235 may store an index, such as an inverted index, of documents available from network 240 .
- Search engine 225 may scan web documents for possible scumware (act 401 ).
- Scumware as this term is used herein, broadly refers to any program designed to damage or do other unwanted actions on a computer system. Common examples of scumware include viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, adware, and malware. When determining whether to classify software as scumware, a number of factors may be considered.
- Exemplary factors that tend to indicate scumware include whether the software: changes browser settings such as the default search provider or home page without user permission; changes machine configuration in any way that affects security without user permission; creates or modifies ‘hosts’ files to divert domain references; displays popup/popunder advertisements when program is not running or displays the advertisements in a way that do not appear to be connected to the program; displays popup/popunder advertisements that cannot be closed by clicking a “close” (e.g., red X) button in the upper right of the window; modifies the layered service provider (LSP) stack by inserting additional referenced code without user permission; installs itself even when the user selects “no” in response to question asking to install; installs without notifying user; cannot be uninstalled through normal operating system uninstall procedure or provides no separate uninstall option; includes mechanisms to thwart removal by anti-spyware removal tools; defends against removal or change in its registry entries; monitors the registry and rewrites its settings as the user deletes them; includes an uninstaller
- the scanning performed in act 401 to detect scumware may be performed using a number of different techniques.
- Scumware detection utilities such as spyware detection programs, are known in the art.
- Scumware may generally be detected by, for instance, matching names of files stored at web sites to lists of known scumware files and/or matching file properties (e.g., file size, date, publisher) with known scumware files.
- Other scumware detection techniques may be based on file signatures, such as pattern matching portions of files to known scumware signatures, or based on heuristic detection techniques.
- Yet other scumware detection techniques scan the system registry to look for registry modifications that match those made by known scumware.
- methods of scumware distribution can be detected using similar techniques on numerous types of documents. For example, detecting that a webpage is exploiting a browser security loophole can be accomplished by checking script code in the webpage against known code snippets. Scumware detection techniques and programs are known in the art and will thus not be described in additional detail
- scumware When scanning a web page, scumware may be identified based on using one or more of the techniques described above. In some situations, not all of the techniques may be applicable. For example, when simply scanning the contents of a page (including files available for download at the page) by search engine 225 , registry scanning may not be an applicable technique. In some, implementations, however, instead of simply scanning a page by examining the contents of a page, the page may be visited as an end user would visit the page (e.g., by emulating a browser with typical configurations) and installing programs from the site. In this situation, registry scanning may also be an applicable technique for locating scumware.
- the scumware may be directly incorporated into the site (such as in the HTML code or script of the site), may be downloaded from the site (such as by downloading an executable file from the site), or may be included at another site linked-to by the site.
- the scanning performed in act 401 may be done as search engine 225 crawls the web pages (i.e., at crawl time, prior to indexing). In other implementations, the scanning may be performed separately from crawling, such as after the web page is in the index, or may be performed on versions of web pages that were previously stored by search engine 225 . In yet another possible implementation, the scanning may be performed when a web page is requested (lazy evaluation). In still other implementations, the scanning may be performed by a third party or another process and search engine 225 may import the results.
- Sites that include scumware may be noted in database 235 (act 402 ).
- the document index may include an indication for sites that contain scumware.
- the indication of whether a site contains scumware may be a value that corresponds to a level of severity of scumware at the site, a value that corresponds to a level of confidence by the search engine that the site includes scumware, or a value indicating the type of scumware present at the site.
- search engine 225 may receive search queries and respond by transmitting relevant documents or links to relevant documents to users.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations of search engine 225 in returning search results to a user.
- Search engine 225 may receive a search query (act 501 ). Based on the search query, search results, such as list of links to documents relevant to the search query, may be generated (act 502 ). The search results may be generally obtained by matching the terms in the search query to documents in database 235 that contain the terms. The results may take into account whether the matching web pages are associated with scumware (act 502 ). In one implementation, web pages that were determined to include scumware ( FIG. 4 ) may be excluded from the results. In another implementation, the web pages that were determined to include scumware may be demoted or deemphasized when ranking the list of returned results. The results of the search query may then be returned to the user (act 503 ).
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations of search engine 225 in returning search results to a user consistent with another aspect of the invention.
- Search engine 225 may receive a search query (act 601 ). Based on the search query, search results, such as list of links to documents relevant to the search query, may be generated (act 602 ). The search results may be generally obtained by matching the terms in the search query to documents in database 235 that contain the terms. The search results may be returned to the user in a manner that highlights or otherwise informs the user of documents that were determined to be associated with scumware (act 603 ).
- the potential scumware documents e.g., web pages or web sites
- whether a document corresponds to a scumware site is taken into account when ranking or determining whether a document matches a search query.
- whether a document corresponds to a scumware site is displayed or otherwise presented to the user as part of the search result document. It can be appreciated that in some implementations, combinations of these two techniques could be used at the same time.
- the user may be given the option to select how the user would like search engine 225 to handle possible scumware sites, such as an option to be given a visual indicator of scumware sites or to remove scumware sites from search results.
- FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating exemplary search results for a search generated consistent with an implementation of the acts shown in FIG. 6 .
- the search query “free software” was submitted.
- results 701 - 704 are shown.
- Each result, such as result 701 may include a link 710 to the relevant document; a snippet of text 712 describing the contents of the document; a link 714 to a “cached” version of the document, which is a copy of the document stored by search engine 225 /database 235 ; and a link 716 to a list of documents similar to document 701 .
- result 703 is a document that was determined to be associated with scumware.
- result 703 is marked with an icon 720 that visually indicates to the user that the web page corresponding to result 703 may include or be associated with scumware.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating exemplary search results for a search generated consistent with another implementation of the acts shown in FIG. 6 .
- the search query “free software” was submitted and four results 801 - 804 are shown.
- result 803 is a document that was previously determined to include scumware that can be downloaded.
- result 804 refers to a web site that does not directly include scumware but that includes one or more links that lead to sites that include scumware.
- Results 803 and 804 may be marked with different icons indicating their differing levels of scumware severity. As shown, result 803 is marked with a first scumware icon 820 and result 804 is marked with a second scumware icon 825 .
- FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating exemplary search results for a search generated consistent with another implementation of the acts shown in FIG. 5 or 6 .
- Toolbar 910 may include one or more search boxes, software buttons, and/or menu elements selectable by a user to initiate different functions by toolbar 910 .
- a user may activate a function of toolbar 910 by entering information into a search box 915 and/or selecting one of the software buttons and/or menu elements.
- Toolbar 910 may include, for example, a security threat warning indicator 920 that may visibly change when the user visits a site associated with scumware.
- a value to display for security threat warning 920 may be obtained by toolbar 910 from search engine 225 .
- the intensity of the visual warning display by toolbar 915 may vary based on the confidence of the site being scumware or based on a level of harmfulness, severity, or type of the scumware.
- Toolbar 910 can include other indicators (not shown), such as, for example: the number of links on the web site or web page that lead to scumware or the shortest number of links from the current site to a scumware site.
- search engine 225 may store (cache) copies of web documents. Users may view the cached versions of the web documents by clicking on the “cached” links, such as link 714 , associated with the search results. Search engine 225 may clean scumware from any cached documents and thus be able to guarantee to its users that its cached results are scumware free, even when the original document is associated with scumware.
- the search engine described above was has primarily described as a search engine that indexes web sites on a network (e.g., the Internet) and returns search results to users via the network.
- the search engine may be implemented as a local search engine that executes on and returns search results based on documents stored at the local computer.
- FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating an implementation of a local (“desktop”) search engine.
- Desktop search engine 1025 may be an application executing on a client 210 .
- Desktop search engine 1025 may generally operate to scan and index local files 1040 on client 210 .
- Desktop search engine 1025 may maintain a document index 1035 corresponding to the scanned local files 1040 .
- desktop search engine 1025 may detect files that correspond to scumware, such as a downloaded virus, adware application, or trojan.
- Desktop search engine 1025 may inform the user of client 210 of the scumware, such as by immediately informing the user of the presence of the scumware or by informing the user of the presence of the scumware in conjunction with search results relating to the scumware.
- Search engine 225 may protect users from scumware included on or associated with web sites indexed by the search engine.
- the search engine may, for instance, take the presence of scumware into account when ranking or determining whether a document matches a search query.
- the search engine may display or otherwise indicate to when a search result is likely to include or be associated with scumware.
- logic may be implemented as “logic” or as a “component” that performs one or more functions.
- This logic or component may include hardware, such as an application specific integrated circuit or a field programmable gate array, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
