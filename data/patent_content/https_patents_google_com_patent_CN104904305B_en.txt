With reference to Fig. 6, it will now be described and carry DL used in data from one or more network entities to UE on DL carrier waves
The T/F figure of subframe.The horizontal scale of Fig. 6 represents frequency, and vertical scale indicates the time.Horizontal scale is divided into can
To be allocated for the multiple frequency chunks or OFDM subcarriers (" subcarrier ") of transmission.The vertical scale of Fig. 6 is divided into can be with
It is allocated for the multiple time blocks or OFDM symbol (" symbol ") of transmission.Subframe is divided into time-frequency resources block (RB).
Generally for normal CP, each RB is 12 subcarriers of 7 symbols.Subframe is divided into always to be 1 millisecond long and each is
Two time slots of 0.5ms.In turn, each RB can be divided into multiple resource elements (RE).Each RE is that 1 subcarrier multiplies 1
A symbol.
If DL subframe includes the reference signal of dry type.Network entity is to UE transmitted reference signals, so that UE is able to carry out
Various functions.One this reference signal is channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS), and UE uses the channel state information
Reference signal determines channel state information (CSI).UE is by CSI report to network entity.It is not necessary to be sent out in all subframes
Penetrate CSI-RS.
Referring again to FIGS. 6, other reference signals in UL subframe include demodulated reference signal (DM-RS), wherein RE is claimed

(CRS), location reference signals (PRS), primary synchronization signal (PSS) and secondary synchronization signal (SSS).
CSI-RS configurations are supplied to UE by network entity via RRC signaling.The rrc layer of UE provides CSI-RS configuration information
To the physical layer (for example, " higher level signaling ") in UE.
With reference to Fig. 7, the structure of uplink carrier will now be described.UL carrier waves 700 have frequency range from first edge 716
Cross the channel width 732 of second edge 720.Carrier wave 700 also has the frequency range being made of transmission bandwidth configuration 734.
Transmission bandwidth configuration starts from first edge 722 and ends at second edge 724.The first edge 716 of channel width and transmission
It is the first spectral emissions area 708 between the first edge 722 of band width configuration.The second edge 720 and transmission bandwidth of channel width
It is the second spectral emissions area 710 between the second edge 724 of configuration.
Referring now still to Fig. 7 A, in the case of transmission bandwidth is configured in the uplink of cell or downlink, channel width
732 be the RF bandwidth for supporting single RF carrier wave.Channel width is usually weighed with MHz, and is typically used as transmitter and receiver RF
It is required that reference.Transmission bandwidth configuration 734 is the highest transmission belt allowed in given channel bandwidth uplink or downlink
Wide (for example, according to professional standard or government control).(for example, when carrier wave is E-UTRA/LTE carrier waves) in some cases,
Transmission bandwidth configuration is weighed with resource block unit.
With reference to Fig. 7 B, polymerization carrier wave 750 is shown.Carrier wave 750 has aggregate channel bandwidth 780 and aggregation transfer band width configuration
782.Polymerization carrier wave 750 is made of three component carriers 752,754 and 756.As shown in Figure 7 B, the identical of Fig. 7 A descriptions is being combined
Element be present in carrier wave 750.Specifically, there are the spectrum hairs except the configuration of the transmission bandwidth of each of three component carriers
The RB 760 for penetrating area but being defined in the channel width of each in three carrier waves.
Referring now still to Fig. 7 B, aggregate channel bandwidth 780 is RF bandwidth, and in RF bandwidth, UE can emit and/or receive multiple
Continuous polymerization carrier wave.Aggregation transfer band width configuration 782 is allowed in given aggregate channel bandwidth uplink or downlink
Maximum transmission bandwidth (for example, according to professional standard or government control).In some cases (for example, when carrier wave is E-UTRA/
When LTE carrier waves), transmission bandwidth configuration is weighed with resource block unit.
Use HARQ
UE in the embodiment of the present invention, which is described, now with reference to Fig. 3 and Figure 14 uses the knot of soft buffer under the mode of soft buffer
Structure.With reference to Fig. 3, transceiver 302 receives signal via carrier wave (for example, UL carrier waves, DL carrier waves or D2D carrier waves).Transceiver 302 will
Signal passes to processor 304, and in this example, processor 304 is baseband processor.In transceiver 302 and processor 304
One or more includes Signal Processing Element 1400, is shown in Figure 14.
Signal processing unit 1400 can be implemented as the combination of hardware, software or both.Signal Processing Element 1400 is by group
Knit functional block.These blocks are described in fig. 14, and their function will now be described.Transceiver 302 (Fig. 3) receives signal,
The signal is demodulated, and given TB is generated and receives log-likelihood ratio (LLR).HARQ composition elements 1408 will receive
LLR is combined with the storage LLR of the TB from precedent transmission.In block 1410, combination LLR is decoded by processor 304, and can be by
It is transmitted to another processing (for example, higher being sent to, to be further processed).It, will if TB is not successfully decoded
The combination LLR of the TB is stored in the subregion 314 of soft buffer 1412.
If TB is not successfully decoded in block 1410, UE can emit HARQ feedback on line link on it.It is soft
Buffering area 1412 keeps the combination LLR of TB until UE again attempts to decode TB.
Instruction UE is being received not successfully after the HARQ feedback to receiving TB, transmitting entity (is not shown) in Figure 14
Trial re-emits TB.The TB re-emitted is such as preceding by identical functional block, but is attempted when in block 1410UE to sending out again
When the TB penetrated is decoded, UE will retrieve the LLR of TB from its memory 1414, and claimed using HARQ composition elements 1408
For the LLR of the storage of the LLR received and TB is combined in the processing of " soft to be combined ".Combination LLR is provided to decoder
1410, decoder 1410 decodes TB and the TB being successfully decoded is supplied to higher level to be further processed.
Soft buffer 1412 can also be referred to as HARQ memories or harq buffer device.Due to there are multiple HARQ procedures,
So that (usually in DCI format associated with TB using explicit segment signal signal (for example, downlink chain
Road), or via subframe numbers, System Frame Number etc. implicitly determine (for example, uplink)) HARQ processing index or HARQ identity
It can be used for HARQ composition elements 1418, to be correctly combined operation.Uplink is transmitted, UE 1418 uses implicit
HARQ processing indexes correctly determine the bits of coded transmitted for uplink.
If UE is configured as the transmission mode that each HARQ processing is up to a TB (or per mono- TB of TTI),
Then as shown in figure 14, the soft buffer of UE can be divided into 8 subregions 1414.If UE is configured as each HARQ processing most
There are two the transmission modes of TB (or per two TB of TTI), then each of 8 subregions 1414 to be further divided into for more tools
Soft buffer for the first subregion 1414A and the second subregion 1414B or UE can be divided into 16 subregions.
In the LTE embodiments of the present invention, determine that the soft buffer of UE configures at least partially by its classification.Reference table 1,
For example, the UE of classification -3 is estimated to provide 1237248 soft channel positions, wherein each soft channel position can store log-likelihood
Than (LLR).
For FDD, for giving component carrier, UE has 8 HARQ processing in DL.Based on transmission mode, UE can
One or two transmission block (corresponding to HARQ processing) is received in TTI.Sum that therefore, UE can be based on soft channel bit,
Maximum number, the transmission mode etc. of HARQ processing determine the amount of storage of the transmission block each received.Similarly, NE1 can be compiled only
Code and emits it and know that UE those of can handle and/or store coded-bit.
In some cases, if UE has the amount of storage deficiency for giving transmission block, and there is decoding failure, then
UE can select to store some LLR, and abandon some other LLR.In other cases, if not available store or do not deposit
Storage is considered as necessary and is used for transmission block, if decoding unsuccessfully occurs, UE can abandon corresponding with the transmission block all
LLR.Network entity emits coding bit number would generally this thing happens when being more than the memory capacity of UE.Typical case packet
It includes：(1) when carrier wave polymerization is used (for example, UE supports two or more carrier waves, and at 8 HARQ of each carrier wave
Reason), and (2) are when using tdd (for example, UE supports each carrier wave up to 15 HARQ processing).For FDD and for uplink
Link, for giving component carrier, when UE is not configured in UL-MIMO transmission modes, UE has 8 HARQ processing (when UE quilts
In UL-MIMO transmission modes, UE has 16 HARQ processing for configuration).For TDD, use is determined based on TDD UL/DL configurations
In the number that the HARQ of uplink is handled.
With reference to table 1, it is further assumed that define UE classifications 3 in LTERel-8/9 in the case of limited buffers rate-matched (LBRM)
Soft buffer size.In the case of LBRM, for the subset of big TB sizes, allows UE to provide and require soft buffer less than maximum
The soft buffer sizes of each TB of size, to realize 1/3 female code check.For example, with the standard compliant LTE of 2 space layer operations
Classification 3UE should support maximum TB sizes 75376.For this TB size, in the case of given 1237248 total soft channel bit
(that is, soft buffer size corresponding with these bits), to each of two possible TB in TTI, UE is only capable of providing
77328 soft channel bits.For the TB sizes, this is equivalent to about 0.97 effective female code check (ECR) or minimum achievable coding
Rate.Effectively mother's code check can be defined as the number of coded bits that can be stored in information bit divided by soft buffer.
It should be noted that effectively female code check can be with encoding rate used by FEC encoder (for example, turbo codes) not
Together, because the two is to define from different perspectives.There can be 1/3 code check of turbo codes (FEC encoder), wherein the code
Some for being shortened or exporting parity check bit are truncated (due to the limitation of soft buffer storage), to cause effectively female code check big
In 1/3.For example, if output parity check bit 50% is truncated, ECR about 2/3, and turbo code checks are 1/3.For TB
It is identical as female code check 1/3 to be sized less than about 25456, ECR, it means that LBRM need not be used.
In the LTE embodiments of the present invention, the soft channel amount of bits for encoding TB determines as follows：
Wherein, NsoftIt is soft channel total number of bits, if UE is configured as being based on that there is order to be more than 1 (such as transmission mode
3,4 or spatial reuse 8) receive PDSCH transmission, then KMIMOEqual to 2, otherwise, KMIMOEqual to 1, MDL_HARQIt is DL HARQ processing
Maximum number (that is, HARQ processing on downlink direction), and MlimitIt is equal to 8 constant, KCIt is to depend on UE classes
The value (coming from 1,2 or 5) of the UE abilities of the number of space layer is not supported and for the component carrier of transmitting transmission block.If UE is used
Signal notifies Rel-10UE classifications (6,7, one of 8), then it is also signaled after corresponding second category (4, one of 5) is used for
To compatibility (for example, allowing in Rel-8/9 network operation Rel-10 type 6UE).N for being encoded to TBsoftValue is based on use
The UE classifications of signal notice, the maximum number of plies etc. that UE is supported on certain components carrier wave.It, can be by above-mentioned identical on the sides UE
Formula provides the number for the soft channel bit that UE is provided for storing TB on carrier wave, but NsoftReplace with Nsoft/Ncell,
In, NcellIt is for the number of the UE component carriers configured.
When UE emits transmission block to network entity on uplink, because there is network entity enough memories to provide
Source, so usually not applying LBRM.Therefore, uplink is transmitted, in the case where LBRM is transparent, passes through turbine code mother
Code check provides the number of the coded-bit for transmission block.This is implied downlink direction (in the case of LBRM) and identical
The ratio matching process of uplink direction (i.e. w/o LBRM) is asymmetric.
D2D is communicated
In an embodiment of the present invention, UE participates in D2D communications using the resource of UL or DL carrier waves.UE can also use UE not
The resource of other carrier waves for being communicated with network entity participates in D2D communications.
In an embodiment of the present invention, UE can be in the frame structure using UL carrier waves or the time-frequency resources of DL carrier waves
On participate in each other D2D communication.In some embodiments, frame structure is based in tdd frame.D2D frames/subframe can in network
Frame/subframe of communication between element and UE is entirely different.
In various embodiments of the present invention, when UE participates in D2D communications, channel that UE passes through definition similar with PUSCH
Emit data, such as D2D-SCH (D2D- shares channel) or PUCCH-D2D to each other.PUCCH-D2D can be counted as configuring
D2D share channel another example.
RB couples of the RB for the distribution of D2D links can be adjacent to each other in subframe, or can be detached in frequency.One
In the case of a little, when UE participates in D2D communications, UE is by the independent physical channel exclusively for D2D communication definitions (for example, D2D-
SCH) emit data to each other.
RB couples of the RB for D2D-SCH assignments can be adjacent to each other in subframe, or can be detached in frequency.For
RB couples of RB of D2D-SCH assignments can be close to RB couples of the RB assigned for PUSCH.For the PUSCH RB assigned and it is D2D-SCH
The RB of assignment can share identical UL carrier waves.The D2D links of user data and control information are carried between UE to be happened at
The link of D2D-SCH or similar definition.The configuration of D2D links can be similar with PUSCH, PDSCH or PUCCH.Due to a UE
Emit to another UE, therefore PDSCH can be appropriate, is similar in conventional cellular communication network launches to UE.
It determines whether to communicate using D2D
Embodiment according to the invention, UE are based on determining to deal with into D2D patterns.It can be by one or more UE
And/or it is dealt with by network entity to carry out this decision.When the ue is in an idle mode, UE or network entity can make this
It determines, in idle mode, other than being used to send or receive location information, paging signal and urgency signal, UE is usually not
It is communicated with network 100.When UE is in connection mode, UE or network entity can also make the determination, in connection mode, net
Network 100 has obtained the information about particular UE, and keeps the information.
Once having determined that UE startups communicate with one another in D2D patterns, any one of one or more UE can be from network
Entity requests allow to start D2D communications, or in the case where no reception is asked, network entity order one or more UE into
Enter D2D patterns.In an embodiment of the present invention, it makes decision at least partially by core 106.However, it is to be appreciated that even if core
The resource of the heart 106 participates in determining to make, and whether UE can enter the decision (for example, the order communicated into D2D) of D2D communications
From network entity communication to UE.
According to an embodiment of the invention, determine whether UE should be communicated using D2D based on the one or more of many factors,
The factor includes：UE is closer to each other, the reference signal strength that one of UE is received from other UE, and network entity is from one in UE
Or the intensity of multiple received signals, detection input by user.
In one embodiment, the public safety network letter that UE or network entity are detected based on UE and/or network entity
The intensity of number (for example, public safety UE reference signals) carries out D2D determinations.Result as the intensity detected, in that case it can be decided that
UE by the maximum transmission power for reducing them or they complete D2D will be avoided to communicate.For example, if public safety network is believed
Number weak, then UE or network entity can determine that D2D is avoided to communicate.If public safety network signal is strong, UE or network entity
It can determine to carry out D2D communications.However, in case of emergency (for example, UE calling 911s), UE can be allowed to be issued in D2D patterns
Penetrate key message, such as its position.In the case, UE will use limited specified resource group (subframe and/or resource
Block) it is communicated.
In an embodiment of the present invention, network entity based on each UE participate in D2D communication ability and based on each UE it is same
When participate in the ability of D2D and conventional cellular communication and determine whether to establish D2D connections between UE.Before making the determination, net
Network entity can be established with one or more UE and be connected.In this case, it is possible to be connected to used in UE with network entity
D2D communications are carried out on the identical carrier wave of carrier wave.
Referring to Fig.1, network entity and UE can ask from core 106 and receive information, to assist to carry out D2D determinations.Net
Network entity can by from core (its can keep UE position record and/or subscription information) request position information, or use
GPS location report from UE determines the degree of closeness between UE.Network entity can be sent out by obtaining description from UE2 by UE1
The report of the intensity for the reference signal penetrated determines, for example, intensity of the UE2 from 1 received signals of UE.UE can also be used by net
The DM-RS configurations for other UE that network entity is sent out determine that they are closer to each other.DM-RS is used as the reference letter that UE combination threshold values use
Number to determine that they are closer to each other.
In some cases, UE can be operated in different community, but it is close enough and between them have it is sufficiently strong
Signal carry out D2D communications.For example, in Fig. 1, even if UE1 is in C1, UE 3 is in C2, UE 2 and UE3 and can also use
D2D is communicated.In the case, the network entity of C1 may need the network entity via backhaul network and C2 to be led to
Letter, to coordinate the foundation of this D2D communications.
Reference signal for discovery
According to an embodiment of the invention, the UE with D2D abilities can be with transmitted reference signal, to allow other with D2D-
The UE of ability has found them.It can be used as finding the signal of the reference signal of purpose for D2D there are the UE of many types.
In an embodiment of the present invention, UE by emit wherein only embedded DM-RS have non-power level zero energy PUSCH or
PDSCH come realize D2D find reference signal.Alternatively, UE uses SRS, SR, HARQ feedback information to be used as and refers to signal.It substitutes
Ground, UE can emit the beacon signal that definition is found exclusively for D2D.Find that the beacon signal of definition can be reflected exclusively for D2D
UE is mapped to for the identical positions RE into the T/F of network entity transmitting UL DM-RS or SRS.
Reference signal can also include intensional data.For example, UE can use SR or HARQ feedback information as reference
Signal.Each there is a bit field, UE can make to use it to indicate the information about itself for SR and HARQ feedback, such as
Its receiver types ability, power control information, mobility information (for example, being that equipment is static), or related its are used to lead to
Preferred/required D2D operation modes of letter.
In an embodiment of the present invention, network entity excessively provides existing channel, in order to provide UE transmitted reference signals institute
The resource block used.In this embodiment, UE emits on the resource block on or near the edge that the transmission bandwidth of carrier wave configures
Reference signal.Transmission bandwidth configuration is the resource block of the communication configuration for typical UE to network comprising network entity.It is not
All resource blocks in transmission bandwidth configuration must all be used in given time.Example is shown in Fig. 7 A and 7B.
In another embodiment of the invention, network entity defines additional resource block, and UE can be in the additional resource block
Upper transmitted reference signal.The resource block of these additional definitions in the channel width of carrier wave, but transmission bandwidth configuration except.
These resource blocks are in the frequency of the near border of spectral transmission mask.In some cases, with those of in channel width frequency
Rate is compared, and the transmission energy ratio of these frequencies is relatively low.Example is shown in Fig. 7 A and 7B.
UE can determine whether feasible method has much for D2D communications using reference signal.In one embodiment, UE
Change the power level of reference signal using slope scheme.For example, with reference to figure 8A, UE1 transmitted reference signals.UE1 is in continuous phase
Adjacent symbol/subframe variation increases the energy of reference signal.UE2 receives reference signal, and each symbol of measuring reference signals
Number or each subframe energy.Then, UE2 determines whether the energy in the reference signal that it is detected reaches at least predeterminated level
(for example, scheduled according to communication standard used in UE1 and UE2).Then, UE2 based on the reference signal energy detected into
Row D2D feasibilities determine.If the reference signal energy that UE2 is detected does not reach predeterminated level, it is logical that UE 2 does not start D2D
Letter.If the energy level detected reaches threshold value really, UE 2 starts D2D communications.Alternatively, UE 2 is to network entity report
The highest reference signal power level that UE2 can be received is accused, and network entity determines whether that D2D communications should occur, and
One or two of UE is ordered to participate in D2D communications.
In another embodiment, reference signal can be emitted with predetermined power level.Predetermined power level is likely lower than
The D2D maximum power levels of permission.Predetermined work(level can be power level known to all UE in cell, and can be with base
It is determined in the signal received from network entity associated with cell.For example, all UEs of the network entity into the cell
Permission reference signal power level of the broadcast for D2D communications.It is small that this effectively allows network entity control to be attached to the service
The range of D2D communications between the UE in area.
In another embodiment, UE in the serving cell communicated with network entity using specific RAT can be to
Network entity reports measurement related with another RAT or other information, and network entity can use the information to determine UE
It is close.For example, UE can to network entity report to they be " visible " wireless access point service set identifier
(SSID) or other media access controls ID (MAC ID) (for example, signal strength or other measurement of correlations (such as RSRP or
RSRQ or RSSI) be more than threshold value), and if the base station determine that two UE can see identical access point (that is, two UE reports
Identical SSID or MAC-ID), then it can configure equipment and open their D2D reference signals.More generally, UE can be to net
The report of network entity is the small cell identifier of the cell of " visible " to UE, and if the base station determine that two UE can see
Identical cell, then it can configure equipment and open their D2D reference signals.

Idle mode, but be populated so that for network entity, they are known.
The time-frequency resources for distributing to UE can be the subset of UL resources, or can be the subset of DL resources.Example
Such as, network entity can distribute one or more resource blocks of UL subframe or DL subframe.The resource block of these distribution can be with the period
Occur, such as each frame, subframe or time slot.Data flow is created using RB, UE1 and the UE2 of these distribution, for example, data flow quilt
It is configured to time-multiplexed subframe or time slot, wherein each subframe or time slot use UL carrier waves or a RB of DL carrier waves.UE makes
The RB of UL or DL carrier waves can be on any subcarrier of UL or DL carrier waves.However, in certain embodiments, what UE was used
RB is derived from UL carrier waves.These RB are selected from the PUCCH of UL carrier waves, therefore these RB are located at highest and lowest frequency of UL carrier waves
Carrier wave.
Referring now still to Fig. 8 A, the carrier wave that resource is distributed for UE1 and UE2D2D is first carrier.UE1 or UE2 is used for and network reality
The carrier wave of body communication is the second carrier wave.In addition, UE1 and UE2 can be used and first carrier or the second carrier wave nonoverlapping
Three carrier waves communicate under D2D patterns.
Referring to Fig.1 2, the example how network 100 initiates D2D communications will now be described.As shown, UL carrier waves are designated as
First carrier, and DL carrier waves are designated as the second carrier wave.In step 1200, UE1 is communicated with NE1 foundation.This step can be at it
It is had been carried out for a long time (for example, via RACH) before remaining step.In step 1201, NE1 is based on said one or multiple
Criterion determines the need for or it is expected the communications of the D2D between UE1 and UE2.
If NE1, which is determined, needs or it is expected D2D, in step 1202, NE1 orders UE1 opens its reference signal.If
UE2 is connected to NE1, then in step 1204, NE1 asks the information of the link-quality about the UE2 reference signals measured from UE2.
If it happens that UE2 is not connected to NE1, then NE1 can ask UE2 and NE1 to connect via back haul system and core 106
It connects.Core 106 can enable this processing by paging UE2 via another network element (such as NE2).In response to the paging,
Then, the connection of NE1 is arrived in initiation by UE2.
In step 1206, UE 2 determine link-quality and to NE1 reporting link qualities (for example, RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI,
CSI).In step 1208, NE1 determines whether to meet some D2D criterion, and whether such as (a) UE1 and UE2 is in mutual pre- spacing
From interior；(b) whether the quality for the reference signal that UE2 is received from UE1 is higher than predeterminated level；(c) whether allow UE1 and UE2
Will not have an adverse effect to public safety communication.
It being determined certainly if NE1 makes about these factors, processing continues to step 1210, in step 1210,
Resource (for example, distribution PUCCH resource block) of the NE1 distribution for D2D.If NE1 makes any one of these factors
Negative determines that then NE1 will not start the D2D patterns of UE.
In step 1211A and 1211B, order is emitted to UE1 and UE2 by NE1.The order order UE is led to each other using D2D
Letter, and the RB that they should use recognizes them.NE1 can be with for example, send out order on PDSCH or PDCCH/EPDCCH
It is mapped to UE.In step 1212, the resource that UE can be distributed via NE1 participates in handshake procedure.In step 1214, UE is in D2D patterns
Under be in communication with each other.It should be noted that step 1210 and step portion 1211A (or 1211B) can be carried out as independent step.Also answer
When note that in various embodiments, UE can be communicated on UL carrier waves, DL carrier waves or third Independent Carrier Wave.
The D2D communications that equipment is initiated
In equipment initiation scheme, request is emitted to network by one or more UE.The request include request UE it is expected with
Communication another UE identity.If network agrees to that the request, network are used by distributing resource appropriate and configuration UE
Those resources respond.
For example, it is assumed that the user of UE1 and UE2 knows each other (for example, they are adjacent to each other, uses such as Google
LatitudeTM" looking for friend " application or near-field communication (NFC) have been found that other side).The user of UE1 determines to transfer the file to
The user of UE2.If two UE, not yet on network, UE1 should be able to ask UE 2 to be connected to the network or public network of UE1
Network.Then, UE1 and UE2 can be operated on identical frequency band/carrier wave, and from as described above they operate on it
Network be assigned resource.
In an embodiment of the present invention, if UE is in idle mode, UE1 can be by being connected to NE1 and to NE1
Indicate that " D2D interest " enters connection mode.UE1 can provide the information in relation to UE2 to NE1.This information may include UE 2
IMEI or handlelike information, userid@network_name.d2d of UE2 etc..Network entity transmits this information
To core 106 (for example, bill processing server) (Fig. 1).One or more control elements check the subscription information of two UE, with
Determine whether the data plan of UE includes D2D abilities.Then, core provides success or failure instruction to NE1.
NE1 can obtain as the newer traverse measurements of each UE, and provide newer traverse measurement to UE, to allow
NE1 controls measure and mobility.
In the realization method for the D2D that equipment is initiated, UE1 (being in idle mode) is true using the frequency spectrum of special frequency band
Fixed its can execute D2D with UE 2 and communicate.Then, UE1 is connected to the network entity in the frequency band operation, and from network 100
Download the information (maximum work that such as reference signal power, reference signal identification information, D2D communications allow that can be used for D2D communications
Rate and other power contorl parameters) and network 100 allow UE1 for the subframe of D2D communications.Then, UE1 is (for example, pass through beginning
Transmitted reference signal) start D2D.UE2 executes similar step, and also starts D2D.After downloading D2D information, UE can be with
Discharge its connection (that is, moving back to idle mode) with network, and continue to communicate under D2D patterns, though they relative to
Network 100 is in idle mode.For in this realization method, network 100 also can indicate that related to the information for being related to D2D transmission
Join " effective duration ".Alternatively, can be that UE assumes predefined effectual time, and if D2D sessions it is lasting when
Between be more than effectual time, then whether still effectively or they are UE may need to reconnect to network to check D2D information
It is no to download new value.
UE is switched to another NE from NE1 to postpone, until the D2D sessions between UE are completed.
According to an embodiment of the invention, after determination can use D2D, UE 1 is in the frequency band comprising uplink carrier
In one group of uplink RB in automatically start D2D communication.UE1 can be determined based on the signaling received from NE1 in the group
Line link RB.NE1 can transmit (that is, the transmission of UE to network entity) to avoid routine UE is dispatched in those RB.If NE1 this
Sample is done, then the UE being in D2D patterns can be communicated with the D2D feasible maximum powers communicated.For example, when in public safety
In the case of use UE when, this is useful.For example, if public safety UE determines it for based on infrastructure-based communication
Except LTE network coverage area, then on one group of possible predetermined uplink RB, it can automatically fall back to D2D patterns.
Referring to Fig.1 3, the example that equipment initiates D2D communications will now be described.In step 1300, the user interface of user and UE1
Interaction, to indicate that user is desire to participate in D2D communications.In step 1302, UE1 via first carrier or UL carrier waves to NE1 transmittings with
UE2 carries out the request of D2D communications.In step 1304, NE1 determines whether UE2 connects.If UE2 is not connected, NE1 is to core
The heart 106 asks UE2 to be connected to NE1.If UE2 has been connected, or becomes to connect in response to the request from NE1, then NE1 is distributed
Resource (for example, from UL carrier waves or RB of DL carrier waves) is used for UE in D2D communications.In step 1306A and 1306B, NE1 via
Second carrier wave or DL carrier waves emit the information for identifying distributed resource to UE.In step 1308, UE uses the resource of distribution simultaneously
Handshake procedure is executed using D2D subframe structures.In step 1310, UE is communicated with one another using D2D subframes.
UE abilities and ability subregion
According to an embodiment of the invention, each UE has the set of one or more functions, that is, functional configuration.A kind of work(
Can configuration may include one of the following or multiple：
(1) data rate (for example, maximum data rate) that UE is supported；
(2) UE has how many transmittings and/or reception antenna；
(3) type for the transmission plan that UE is supported (table 3 and table 4 show the example of transmission plan)；
(4) the soft buffer configuration of UE；
(5) the MIMO abilities (for example, the number of plies that each frequency band is supported, support of UL MIMO) of UE；
(6) carrier aggregation capacity of UE；
(7) battery life of UE；
(8) the maximum transmission block bit rate for each TTI that UE is supported
(9) processing capacity of UE is (for example, the number for the processor that UE has, is handled while can once executing
Number).
In an embodiment of the present invention, each UE can divide its ability.The function set each divided will be referred to as
Ability zone configuration.
As indicated, UE can be its soft buffer configuration with one of the function of subregion.The soft buffer of UE configures
It is following one or more：(1) maximum number of the HARQ processing for receiving grouping (is needed buffer partition number by UE
Mesh)；(2) UE by for receive grouping soft buffer size；And (3) UE will be for receiving the soft channel bit number being grouped
Mesh.Therefore, the first set of one or more of these features will constitute the first soft buffer configuration, and second set will
Constitute the second soft buffer configuration.
For example, given first UE and the 2nd UE, the first buffer area zone configuration may include at least one of the following：
The maximum number that (1) the first UE handles the HARQ for being received from network entity；(2) the first UE will be used to connect from network entity
The size for the soft buffer received；And (3) the first UE by the number of the soft channel bit for being received from network entity.
The configuration of second buffer partition includes at least one of the following：1) the first UE will be for receiving from the 2nd UE
The maximum number of HARQ processing；2) the first UE is by the size of the soft buffer for being received from the 2nd UE；And 3) the first UE will
Number for the soft channel bit received from the 2nd UE.
The UE examples that its ability is divided into ability zone configuration are now provided.If there are two processor and two for UE tools
Antenna, then it these abilities can be divided into the first ability zone configuration being made of a processor and an antenna and by
The second ability zone configuration that one processor and an antenna are constituted.
In an embodiment of the present invention, for being communicated with distinct device, UE uses different ability zone configurations.Example
Such as, UE can use with 1 processor, 4 soft buffer partitions and the first ability zone configuration in transmission mode 1 with
Network entity is communicated.UE can use with 1 processor, 2 soft buffer partitions and in D2D transmission modes the
Two ability zone configurations are communicated with another UE.The configuration that UE changes its soft buffer is also shown in this example.First soft buffering
Device configuration will include 4 soft buffer partitions, and the second soft buffer configuration will include 2 soft buffer partitions.
In some embodiments, UE is simultaneously using the first ability zone configuration and the second ability zone configuration and other two
Equipment is communicated, such as another UE and network entity.In other embodiments, according to the equipment communicated with UE, UE from
It is switched to another ability zone configuration using an ability zone configuration, and in time division multiplexing mode, UE is from using one
A ability zone configuration is switched to another ability zone configuration.
Any type ability of UE configures, including is configured by those of above-mentioned one or more ability scores ability, can be with
It is divided into multiple ability zone configurations.
Referring to Fig.1, for example, UE1 can change its ability zone configuration (for example, reducing its data rate, the soft buffering of change
The number etc. of device subregion) so that its configuration is compatible with UE2, to allow UE1 and UE2 to communicate with one another, while also supporting UE1
Communication between network entity.UE2 can also change its ability zone configuration so that the ability zone configuration of UE1 and UE2's
Configuration compatibility.
For example, if UE1 per second can emit up to 100 megabits, and UE2 per second can receive up to only 50,000,000 ratios
Spy, then UE1 can change its ability configuration so that its it is per second only transmitting up to 50 megabits.
The different LTE UE that UE can have in embodiments of the present invention can it is shown in table 1 with the example of classification/ability (for
Downlink) and table 2 (for uplink).

7.1-6 finding.Table 3 shows the transmission mode for downlink.UE is configured by network entity in the transmission mode
One.The downlink of down link control information (DCI) format corresponding with transmission mode is monitored in the UE of given transmission mode
Link control channel, and PDSCH is received (for example, single antenna port, transmitting diversity, open loop space based on corresponding transmission plan
Multiplexing, Closed-Loop Spatial Multiplexing, Wave beam forming transmission (single antenna port, port 7) etc.).
Signalling capability and classification
According to LTE embodiments, UE is to informing network entities its publication, classification and additional capabilities.This allows network entity suitable
Locality configures the communication of itself and UE.UE can abandon (or ignoring) do not meet its publication/classification/ability it is any receive disappear
Breath/signal.The UE of particular category provides feature/ability as shown in Table 1 and Table 2 (in downlink and uplink).
In their D2D handshake procedures, UE can establish master-slave relationship.UE with optimum performance is (for example, UE is supported
Larger data rate, longer battery life etc.) will be typically host.For example, if two UE for participating in D2D belong to different
Classification, then the UE with larger classification can be main equipment.For example, if classification 3 and 7 equipment of classification participate in D2D, classification 7
It may be main equipment.Main UE it is expected regulation to be used for the resource that D2D is communicated from UE.It can be to indicate that it is this that it cannot be provided from UE
The message of resource makes a response.In case of such case, then main UE may need to reduce it for the expectation from UE.For example,
It may need to communicate with network entity using at least some of its soft buffer partition from UE.
Capabilities exchange example
Referring to Fig.1 5, will now be described UE how in order to the D2D purpose exchanging capability informations communicated example.In this example
In, it following assumptions will be made.Using structure shown in such as Fig. 8 B, UE1 will be sub by D2D carrier waves using the RB from UL carrier waves
Frame is emitted to UE2.UE1 in this example is the UE of classification 4, and UE2 is the UE of classification 2.As shown in Tables 1 and 2, classification 4
UE has the DL/UL ratios of 150Mbps/50Mbps, and the UE of classification 2 has the DL/UL ratios of 50Mbps/25Mbps.Cause
This, UE1 to UE2 links has maximum data rate 50Mbps (UE2-rx), and UE2 to UE1 has maximum data rate
25Mbps(UE2-rx).Although the two UE have decoding 50Mbps abilities, there is also this asymmetry.
It is communicated with the D2D of UE2 it is also supposed that network entity has permitted UE1 participations, and UE1 knows that (same, UE2 knows UE2
Road UE1).These are assumed the purpose being merely to illustrate and make.
In step 1500, UE1 establishes the communication with NE1.In step 1501, NE1, which distributes UE, to be used in D2D patterns
With another UE RB communicated and/or subframe.These RB can be the RB of the RB or UL carrier waves of DL carrier waves.In step 1510,
UE1 determines that UE will be for the RB and/or subframe of the first group of distribution to communicate with one another.In step 1520, UE1 from NE1 receive about
The information (for example, classification of UE2) of the ability of UE2.Alternatively, in step 1520', UE2 is via D2D carrier waves by its ability information
It is emitted to UE1.
Then, handshake procedure each other can be initiated in step 1530, UE1 and UE2, during shaking hands, establishes principal and subordinate pass
System, agreement UE1 are host.In step 1540, UE1 determines that UE enters the appropriately configured of communication, including which money UE should distribute
Source (for example, ability) is communicated for D2D.These configurations include data rate, encoding scheme and the configuration of harq buffer device.Show herein
In example, UE1 determines that UE2 should put into 3 soft buffer partitions 1416 (in Figure 14) for receiving transmission block from UE1.Then, example
Such as, UE2 can use remaining 5 soft buffer partitions 1418 for being communicated with NE1.In step 1550, UE1 can be to UE2
Notify desired resource or UE1 that can be communicated for D2D with the UE2 resources of configuration requirement.In step 1560, UE1 and UE2 can
So that determined by the RB/ subframes of NE1 distribution in the D2D carrier waves and using UE1 the internal resource that should be used in D2D patterns into
Row communication.In step 1560, UE1 and UE2 participate in D2D communications.
The revision of the process of Figure 15 is shown in FIG. 16.During Figure 16, in step 1600, the user of UE1
Initiate D2D communications.In step 1602, three kinds of replacements are depicted.NE1 can notify the ability of UE 2 to UE1, and UE1 can be direct
Receiving ability information or UE1 and UE2 from UE2 can exchanging capability information each other.The step class of remaining the step of and Figure 15
Seemingly.
In order to which the ability and classification that further illustrate D2D communication periods according to embodiment exchange, it is assumed that UE1 and UE2 is participated in
D2D communications and UE1 know publication/ability/classification of UE2.Then, UE1 will configure D2D links so that UE2 can be correctly
Coded message is emitted to UE1 and receives coding transmission from UE1.If UE is different classes of, UE1 can be based on UE2's
Classification selects its soft buffer configuration.In D2D connections, the other UE of higher-class can be configured as host.
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, when UE participates in D2D communications, UE can directly lead to its sorting signal signal
Know another UE.In addition, network entity or main equipment can configure the soft buffer point received for D2D in (a) the first UE
Match and/or the 2nd UE in for D2D receive harq buffer device distribution；B) HARQ of the D2D transmission from the first UE to the 2nd UE
The maximum number of processing and/or the maximum number handled for the HARQ from the 2nd UE to the D2D transmission configurations of the first UE.In addition,
Network entity can configure one or more of following limitation：
A) transmission mode limits
B) modulation limitation (being limited to QPSK/16-QAM)
C) (for example, if UE1 and UE2 is operated on different BW, UE1 is conventional UE, and UE2 is tool for bandwidth limitation
There is the MTC device of smaller Rx BW).
Network entity can signal the default configuration of D2D communications.The signaling of default configuration can be that cell is specific
Signaling or the specific signalings of UE, the default configuration of direct communication may include：Transmission mode for directly transmitting, for directly passing
Defeated transmission plan, demodulation RS configurations, for the component carrier etc. of direct communication.When enabling the direct communication with another UE,
Network entity can override/reconfigure some or all default configuration parameters.Is predefined for some, the configuration duration
UE is used for effective with other UE direct communications or session.In the predefined duration for receiving specific signaling from network entity
It is interior, be transformed into RRC idle modes, switching etc., configuration information can be reset to default configuration.
Control channel excessively provides
With reference to Fig. 7 A, it will now be described and how to distribute the RB examples that signal for reference uses according to an embodiment of the invention.
This example will focus on transmission bandwidth configuration first edge 722 nearby those of RB.However, identical RB allocation plans also may be used
Be applied to second edge 724 nearby those of RB.
This example it will be assumed, in the case where not being that D2D retains any RB, network entity would generally be distributed to UE
RB1 and RB1 on PUCCH for transmitting.However, being communicated for the ease of D2D, network entity distribution RB1 and RB2 is used for
PUCCH and retain RB0 for D2D reference signalings.It will be provided to UE about reference signal in D2D, network entity NE1
Signal configuration information (for example, via higher level signaling, such as RRC signaling).However, the network entity of distribution resource differs
Signal configuration information must be provided surely.The second network entity of such as NE2 can be done so.
In this example, reference signal signal configuration be RB1 and RB2 will be used for PUCCH and RB0 will be used for UE hair
Penetrate reference signal.This RB allocation plan allows the UE without D2D abilities to use PUCCH as they are original, but uses
RB1 and RB2, and other than using PUCCH, the UE with D2D abilities can use RB0 to be used for reference signaling.In addition, being permitted
In the case of more, it is expected that the transimission power for D2D communications is small, and contribute to reduction channel width for D2D using edge RB
Except interference.
Network entity notifies that a kind of mode that the signal of the reference signal of the 2nd UE configures is by first to the first UE
UE emits the information of the PUCCH RB distribution about modification.This information can be the form of the nRB-CQI values of modification.
In LTE embodiments, for example, nRB-CQI (or) can be according to the PUCCH format in each time slot of subframe
2/2a/2b transmits available resource block and indicates bandwidth.PUCCH format 2/2a/2b can be used for emitting periodical CSI report.
LTE UE can be provided the PUCCH for using PUCCH format 1/1a/1b to emit HARQ-ACK to determine using nRB-CQI values
Source.More specifically, LTE UE will emit HARQ- without using PUCCH format 1/1a/1b in the edge RB identified by nRB-CQI values
ACK。
In order to allow the edge RB configured in transmission bandwidth to carry out D2D communications, confidence is matched by the signal that network entity is sent
Breath can indicate additional RB offsets (for example, D2D-RB- is deviated), and using the offset, the UE with D2D abilities, which can be determined, to be used for
The edge RB of D2D communications.For example, if the RB of transmission bandwidth configuration is numbered as RB0, RB1, RB2, RB3, RB4..., wherein
Closest to transmission bandwidth edge, network entity can signal D2D-RB- and deviate 2 and nRB-CQI values 5 RB0.It is not configured
Preceding 5 RBs of the UE (and the UE of D2D communications can not be carried out) the edge configured since transmission bandwidth for D2D communications
(that is, RB0 to RB4) does not emit HARQ-ACK.The UE for being configured for D2D communications is used for using preceding 2 RB (that is, RB0 and RB1)
D2D is communicated.Other RB (that is, RB2, RB3, RB4) can be used for carrying out PUCCH format 2/2a/2b transmission by all UE.Such as from this
Example can be seen that the excessive PUCCH resource value that provides (that is, signaling than supporting PUCCH format 2/2a/2b to transmit needs
The n_RB_CQI values of bigger) allow network 100 by can not support D2D communicate UE be it is transparent in a manner of support D2D to communicate.
This transparent operation can improve the efficiency of whole network, the reason is that supporting that the UE of D2D communications can be with the UE that does not support D2D to communicate
Shared carrier wave.
In another example, it will be assumed that the letter for being adjacent to public safety channel (for example, channel 14) is used in carrier wave 700
Road (for example, channel 13), and network entity is not allowed to use RB0, RB1 and RB2.In these cases, network entity distributes
RB4 and RB5 is used for PUCCH for UE, and distributes RB3 for D2D reference signalings.
In another embodiment of the invention, network entity defines the first spectral emissions area 708 and the second spectral emissions area
RB (RB 730 and 718) in one or more of 710.Due to avoid the interference of adjacent channel to the signal in these regions
The limitation (being applied by such as law or industrial protocol) of power, therefore these regions are generally not used for data or control signaling.So
And because finding that the reference signal of purpose not necessarily must be strong as conventional control signals for D2D, UE can be used
Those RB are used for D2D reference signals.As long as the transmission power of signal is maintained at sufficiently low level, it is contemplated that D2D reference signals are drawn
The interference risen is fairly small.
In another embodiment of the present invention, it can be applied to the polymerization (figure of carrier wave 750 in conjunction with Fig. 7 A technologies described
7B).The edge RB0 of three component carriers 752,754 and 756 of carrier wave 750 is used for D2D reference signalings, and RB 1 and RB 2
For PUCCH.In conjunction with as described in Fig. 7 A, one or more RB 760 can be defined in spectral emissions mask, so that UE is used for
D2D reference signalings.
In another embodiment, specific PUCCH resource index is defined as indicating to can be used for giving the normal of PUCCH
Which of (for example, Rel-8LTE) control channel is partly preserved for D2D reference signaling channels.It should be noted that given
PUCCH support other normal control channels can be HARQ-ACK channels, SRS channels, SR channels and including rank information and in advance
The channel state information channel and channel quality feedback channel of encoder feedback.It can be by using one as system information block
The higher level signaling for distributing radio resource control (RRC) message sent signals (broadcast) this index.It can be by wide
Broadcast scheduling grant field determines PUCCH resource index or which D2D reference signalings channel for UE for executing D2D reference signalings.
This broadcast scheduling permits also can indicate that in subframe which is unscheduled/resource block that does not assign can be used for random access or D2D numbers
According to transmission.The allowance of this broadcast scheduling can also be referred to as competition and permit.Based on User ID (for example, such as IMSI, radio net
Terminal identifier) hash function and/or subframe, time slot or wireless frame index which D2D reference signaling channel can also be determined
For emitting given D2D reference signals.If used in the specific sub-frame or time slot or particular radio frames only in radio frame
For the PUCCH resource of D2D reference signalings, then subframe, time slot and/or radio frame indicator can also signal about
D2D reference signaling resources.It can useValue,Value orIdentify PUCCH resource index.It can also use
The combination identification PUCCH resource index of " scheduling request (SR) resource " value or SR resource values and above-mentioned one or more values, this
A little values can be signaled by network entity.The candidate collection of radio resource used in D2D reference signalings can be by
It is considered that one or more UE can be simultaneously in the public resource of transmitted on resources.
In some embodiments, the DL in the downlink operation frequency band of frequency division duplex (FDD) pattern operational frequency bands is carried
In wave, UE can receive the configuration information about reference signal from network entity.In the uplink work of fdd mode operational frequency bands
Make in the UL carrier waves in frequency band, UE can receive reference signal (coming from another UE).Although the UL in fdd mode operational frequency bands is carried
Reference signal is received in wave, but can be received in individual carrier wave with other relevant data of D2D transmission (for example, being object
Manage the application data of other UE of layer transmission formatting).Individual carrier wave may be at different operation frequency band.Alternatively, in FDD
In UL carrier waves in the uplink operation frequency band of pattern operational frequency bands, other data can be received.In some cases, UE can
With the transmitted reference signal in individual carrier wave.
After receiving reference signal from another UE (UE2), UE (UE 1) by measuring reference signals and can be used
The link-quality between UE1 and UE2 is determined with the relevant configuration information of reference signal.In order to determine link-quality, UE can be with
Measuring reference signals reception power (RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) or received signal strength indicator symbol (RSSI),
Or channel state information (CSI).UE can report the link-quality measured to network entity, wherein UE is from network reality
Body receives reference signal configuration information.In some cases, UE can report the link-quality measured to heterogeneous networks entity.
For example, UE can receive reference signal configuration information from first transmission point, but later to another transfer point report link matter
It measures (the D2D links between UE 1 and UE 2).
In general, UE receives reference signal and UE is happened to network entity reporting link quality in different subframes.For UE
Fdd mode operational frequency bands UL carrier waves receive reference signal in the case of, only it is expected UE only on identical UL carrier waves not by
Scheduling in those of transmitting subframe for receiving reference signal.
May include that identification it is expected that UE receives the information of the subframe of reference signal, knowledge with the relevant configuration information of reference signal
Not Qi Wang UE receive the information of resource element in the subframe of reference signal, UE can receive reference signal RB RB indexes,
UE can receive the RB offsets (for example, D2D-RB- deviate) of the RB of reference signal, identification reference signal sequence index or with reference
The information of the reference signal cyclic shift of the associated reference signal of signal.
In some embodiments, UE can must be received in UE on the carrier wave of transmitted reference signal and/or other D2D data
The information that maximum transmission power about communication limits.In some implementations, maximum transmission power limitation can be for
Maximum UE the output power PCMAX, c of the carrier wave of UE transmitted reference signals and/or D2D data configuration, wherein c is carrier index.
UE, which can also be received, is related to the letter that maximum power associated with D2D reference signals or other D2D data transmissions reduces (MPR)
Breath.When UE receptions are related to the information of MPR values, the maximum UE for D2D transmission that it can reduce its configuration based on MPR values is defeated
Go out power.UE can adjust the power of its reference signal and/or D2D transmission so that the power of those transmission is no more than configuration
Maximum UE output power for D2D transmission.
UE can be received and reference signal is relevant matches via broadcast signaling from network entity when UE is in idle mode
