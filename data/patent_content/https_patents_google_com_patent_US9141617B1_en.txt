- the refining may include either reordering or filtering of search results based on the weighted characteristics of the first social circle.
- the weighted characteristics may be maintained as a feature vector.
- the weighted characteristics of the first social circle may be based on the weighted characteristics of one or more members of the first social circle.
- the weighted characteristics of the one or more members of the first social circle may be based on web usage history of the respective one or more members.
- the search results maybe further refined based on receiving a second indication of a second social circle.
- the refining based on the first and second social circles may take either the union or intersection of two search results, where each circle is individually applied.
- the refining of search results based on the identified first social circle may include determining one or more sub-circles of the identified social circle, wherein the one or more sub-circles is based on other social circles of the one or more members of the identified first social circle and refining the search results by the determined one or more sub-circles of the identified first social circle.

- This document describes systems and techniques for refining search results based on information about one or more social groups of the user requesting the search results.
- social circles are categories to which a user can assign their social networking contacts and better control the distribution and visibility of social networking messages.
- a social circle may be represented as a data set defining a collection of contacts or individual members that are associated with one another.
- a social circle may be described from the perspective of an individual that is the center of a particular collection of socially interconnected people, or from the aggregate perspective of a collection of socially interconnected people.
- a social circle can have narrowly defined boundaries, all of the members of the social circle may be familiar with one another, and permission may be required for a member to join a social circle.
- a user of an electronic device may define a social circle, and the social circle, as a data set defining a collection of contacts or individual members, may reflect a real-life social circle of the user.
- a user of an electronic device may have different groups of friends, coworkers, and family, and there may be some overlap among those groups (i.e., a coworker who is also considered to be a friend, a family member who is also a coworker).
- groups i.e., a coworker who is also considered to be a friend, a family member who is also a coworker.
- the user can organize and categorize social networking contacts into various different groupings.
- the subject disclosure provides for search results refinement or customization based on information about the characteristics of one or more social circles, such as the preferences, interests, needs, likes and dislikes of the social circles.
- a group or a group of individuals or a social circle are interchangeable.
- characteristics of a social circle may be referred to as a group profile, group characteristics, social graph, virtual individual (comprising of the characteristics of a group or social circle) and may be represented as a group vector or group feature vector (as discussed below in more details).
- the characteristics of a group of individuals or social circles may be determined by various approaches. For example, the characteristics of a group of individuals may be based on accumulated history of web usage of the individuals in the group. As another example, the characteristics may be based on information provided by the individuals in the group, e.g., interests expressed by the individuals or interests that the individuals are following, etc. The characteristics of the group may be based on information about the group itself, e.g., the purpose, title, or motivation for which the group is formed. The source of the characteristics of groups of individuals may vary without deviating from the scope of this disclosure.
- a system for users to select a social lens to apply to their searches, referred to herein as a social lens-based search system.
- a “social lens” refers to a search filter, based on social circles of the user, to be applied to refine a search result.
- a social lens may be represented as a circle or a lens graphical element that corresponds to a depiction of the search filter, corresponding to a social circle of the user.
- each social lens available for selection is associated with one social circle of the user performing a search.
- a social lens may be associated with more than one social circle and of various individuals (e.g., see discussion below about sub-circles).
- a user searches for the query term “rainbow”, she may get results for all types of products and information related to the term “rainbow”.
- the user has a circle of friends whose search histories indicate a bias towards video games (e.g., the user's “gaming” friends group), and the user selects and applies a social lens of her “gaming” friends group to the same “rainbow” query, the results for a video game named “rainbow abc” may be ranked above other search hits resulting from searching the word “rainbow”. Applying a social lens for searches may make the search results more useful for a user performing the search.
- a user searches for the query terms “game cod”, she may get different results depending on a selected social lens (thereby identifying a respective group profile) applied to the query. For example, where the user selects and applies a social lens of her “video gaming” friends group to the query for “game cod”, then “game” may be interpreted as video games and the results may find synonyms for the term “cod” such as a game called “Centaur-Out-the-Door”. On the other hand, if the user selects a social lens for her “hunting” group of friends, then the results for the term “cod” may find synonyms such as “fish” and “trout”, etc.
- a user chooses at least one of his or her social circles to serve as a lens for the current search query or search session.
- the user issues a search query in the context of that social lens.
- the user is presented with search results based on the social lens applied to it.
- Applying a social lens may for example result in either the search results being filtered by the characteristics of the selected social group or may result in ranking the search results differently based on the characteristics of the selected social group.
- Users may be able to choose a different lens and have the search results modified to reflect the newly applied lens or selected social group. Users may also be able to apply multiple lenses, e.g., to get results as either the union or intersection of the results obtained from multiple lenses individually.
- a social lens-based search system presents a user with a search box and a list of their accessible social circles.
- a user may be provided with a list of UI icons, one for each social circle accessible by the user, to select from as a social lens filter to apply to a particular search query or session.
- the user may then be able to drag the provided UI icon, indicative of a social circle, over a search results' page or section, to indicate that a particular search or search session should be refined (e.g., ranked and/or filtered) by the particular social circle's characteristics.
- the search results then may reflect the biases, preferences and/or characteristics of the people in that social circle.
- a user's selection of a social lens to be applied to a search query or session results in the ranking of the search results based on the weighted characteristics of the group. For example, a particular group's characteristics may be determined to include interests in: sports, video games, and fashion. The weight of the characteristics may be determined to be: 50, 150, and 10 respectively. Then upon a user submitting a query, where that particular group is selected as the social lens to apply to the query, the resulting search hits may be ranked highest for search hits related to video games, second highest for search hits related to sports, third highest for search hits related to fashion, and all remaining search hits may trail this list.
- Characteristics and weights for a group or circle may be derived from members of the group. For example, weighted characteristics of a social circle may be determined by analyzing web usage history of members of the social circle or group. The analysis of the social circle may involve studying the accumulated search history and usage patterns for members of the social circle. Analysis of web usage history may include analyzing past click streams, search histories, user endorsements (e.g., “+1s” or likes), or other types of feedback received for members of the social circle to determine the aggregate set of features or characteristics of the group and their associated weight. Group member's biases or preferences may be based on analysis of any other data accessible about group members via a host of applications and sources.
- a social circle's characteristics may additionally be determined by studying web usage histories of sub-circles.
- Sub-circles are other groups that members, of the selected social group to be applied as the search lens, belong to or have access to (See discussion below about FIG. 4 for more details).
- the sub-circles may be examined upon a user requesting for a different level of social lens application to a search query or session. For example, when a user wants quicker results she may not want the social lens to take into account sub-circles of group members, so as to save on computation time.
- the user may request for a “highest” level of search refinement, which may drill down into many sub-circle levels to determine group characteristics.
- Sub-circle levels to traverse for refining search results may be system configured or based on user preferences.
- the aggregate features/characteristics of a group may also be weighted to indicate how strong any particular feature is for the group.
- the weight of a feature may be based on things like the number of times a particular feature surfaced in web usage history, such as based on search history or on the subsequent click streams of members of the circle (or sub-circles in the case of a “high” level search refinement).
- the weight may also take into account indications of liking a particular topic (e.g., when a “+1” is provided), etc. supplied by members of the group for a particular hit or search result.
- the weight of a feature may also be determined based on the strength of the relationship between the user and a member of the group.
- the strength of the relationship between the user and a member of the group may be based on the type of relationship (e.g., friend, acquaintance, spouse, family, academic, etc.), or based on how often the user interacts (e.g., via email, chatting, messaging, sharing content, etc.) with the member, etc.
- a social lens-based search system is based on a virtual individual.
- the virtual individual is based on the aggregate of the personalized information of members of a group (e.g., represented as an aggregate feature/characteristics vector.
- the personalized information for each member and the aggregated virtual individual characteristics may be weighted similarly to as described above.
- the virtual individual's characteristics are then applied to refine search results.
- the list of social circles or lenses that a user can select from may be determined from social networking platforms of the user, having specified groups or circles of the user.
- Social circles or groups of individuals may be retrieved from any other source that a user of the social lens-based search system has access to, e.g., professional networks, academic circles, interest groups, and any other affiliations that the user has access to.
- Circles to apply as a social lens may also be system generated and supplied to the user for selection.
- the system may generate a “science” circle and a “genius programmer” circle.
- the circles may be directly associated with weighted features (e.g., science circle may have certain words etc. associated with it).
- a science circle may have the features or categories of “chemistry”, “biology”, “physics”, “space”, “atom”, etc. with weights associated for each category or topic.
- System generated circles may provide a member list for the system generated group, that can be used to derive a weighted feature set (e.g., by analyzing the web usage pattern of the members to derive characteristics for the system defined groups), similar to social groups from social networking platforms applied as lenses for refining search results.
- the information about characteristics of groups may be maintained in various data models or software or mathematical constructs.
- an implementation of using known preferences or web search histories of members of a group is used to alter the search results for another user utilizing vectors to store information about group characteristics.
- characteristics of each member of a social circle may be described using a feature vector.
- a feature vector for a member may be one way of representing the member's profile.
- Each dimension of the feature vector may correspond to a vertical, e.g., a category in a taxonomy (“automotive”, “space travel”, “fashion”, “movies”, “video games”, etc.)
- the value of each dimension or the weight may correspond to a number of queries issued by that user that have been classified as belonging to the corresponding vertical.
- the feature vectors for multiple or all users in the circle may be combined to generate a single feature vector for the group, defining the characteristics of that group via verticals and combined values for each vertical.
- a feature vector, describing the group characteristics as discussed above, may then be used by a backend search engine to alter the ordering/ranking or filtering of the search results.
- a user's selection of a social lens to be applied to a search query or session returns those search results where members of the social circle provided a user endorsement for the search hit at some point in their web usage history.
- at least one member of the social circle provides a user endorsement (e.g., “+1”, “like”, etc.) for a search result to be included in the search results delivered to a requesting user.
- a social lens may be applied either after or before the query is issued.
- a user may provide one or more social lenses along with an initial search request.
- a user may initially perform a conventional search (e.g., without applying any social lens) and may subsequently apply one or more social lenses over the result set to refine the search results.
- Multiple social lenses may be applied to a search query or search session, resulting in the search being refined by the intersection or union of the multiple social lenses' characteristics, referred to herein as a “layering of social lenses” solution.
- the one or more social lenses applied to a query may be applicable only to a current query executed. In certain aspects, the social lenses applied to a query may continue to be applied for a particular query session. In certain aspects, a user may explicitly clear previously applied social lenses and start queries anew.
- the search query page or section may provide a visual indication of what social lenses have been or will be applied to the searches.
- a selected social lens may not be applied to refine search results based on either system or user configurations. For example, it may not be desirable to refine query search results, based on a selected social lens, for queries considered mature or queries relating to health or financial matters. As such, in some aspects, a selected social lens is not applied to refine query search results.
- One advantage of applying social lenses for search refinement is the benefit of accumulated web search behavior applied to search results, for example, to help make search results more meaningful to users searching for information on the World Wide Web.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a computer system 100 configured to refine or customize search results based on knowledge about the preferences, interests, likes and dislikes of a group of individuals.

For example, a user may submit a search for the term “rainbow”. Search module 210 then may communicate with data repository 110 , using search index 240 , to return hits for searches of the term “rainbow”. The example 1000 hits as discussed above may be delivered to the requesting user as partial results (e.g., 25 at a time) or may be delivered to the requesting user in one big batch. In either case, search module 210 may subsequently receive a request to refine a previous query (e.g., the “rainbow” query) by one or more social circles (e.g., “gaming” group). Social module 210 may be configured to communicate with refine module 220 to receive either a re-ordered or a filtered search results list, based on the received social lenses, to deliver to the requesting user.

- circle 420 may comprise of 1000 members, while the selected circle 410 may comprise of 100 members.
- Circle 420 , 430 , and 440 are represented inside circle 410 , thereby being smaller, merely to illustrate that they are circles accessed via members of the circle 410 and not due to the size of those sub-circles.
- a selected circle's (e.g., circle 410 ) characteristics may be combined with characteristics of sub-circles (e.g., circles 420 , 430 , and 440 ), as accessible via members of the selected circle 410 , to refine search results by.
- Sub-circles of sub-circles may also be accessed to further refine query results by, as illustrated by circles 442 and 444 .
- Sub-circles may be queried to as many levels as accessible by the user submitting a search results request.
- a user may provide some indication of the level of recursion to apply for refining a query. For example, a user may select a low or no level of recursion when looking for quick results. In another example, a user may select a highest level of recursion when looking for a more customized result, and where a quicker result in not required.
- FIG. 4 's sub-circles may be used to aggregate a feature vector as discussed in reference to FIG. 6 below.

- Section 510 depicts the intersection of the illustrated three social circles.
- the strategy chosen to apply is an intersection strategy, in which case, where multiple social lenses are provided for search refinement, then search results that result as an intersection of applying all three social lenses, as depicted by section 510 having lines in the area, are returned to a requesting user.
- a union strategy is employed where multiple social lenses supplied for search refinement.
- Sections 520 , 530 , 540 , and 510 illustrate areas represented by “x”s as the union of all three social circles.
- the results supplied to a requesting user in the union strategy are those search results that may result from applying either one of the lenses, 520 , 530 , or 540 .
- FIGS. 6 a - 6 e represent an example of a data construct to store information about characteristics of members of a group and of groups for a social lens-based search system.

- FIG. 6 a represents a vector for member 1 , having the first four categories of “video games”, “fashion”, “space”, and “arts”.
- the values for each respective category in FIG. 6 a are 10, 0, 5, and 2.
- FIG. 6 b represents a vector for member 2 , having the first four categories of “video games”, “fashion”, “travel”, and “cooking”.
- the values for each respective category in FIG. 6 b are 5, 5, 3, and 1.
- FIG. 6 c represents a vector for member 3 , having the first four categories of “video games”, “novels”, “movies”, and “cooking”. The values for each respective category in FIG. 6 c are 20, 2, 6, and 15.
- FIG. 6 d represents a vector for member 4 , having the first six categories of “video games”, “wine”, “arts”, “travel”, “math”, and “programming”. The values for each respective category in FIG. 6 d are 50, 1, 20, 3, 3, and 150.
- Feature vectors for individuals or members may have any host of categories and may be in any order.
- the categories for each vector may be supplied by a system or may be learned based on, e.g., web usage patterns of the user for whom the vector is representative.
- the values associated with a category in a feature vector may represent the number of queries issued, relating to that particular category, by the respective user for which the vector is holding characteristics information.
- the value may be representative of a user's preference, bias, or liking of a particular category.
- the value may be derived from a source other than the number of queries issued in the past for a respective category.
- the value may be based on information about events that a user has attended, or may be supplied by the user to indicate his or her own preferences and associated strengths for those categories or preferences, etc.
- the values may be user supplied or system generated using various analytics without deviating from the scope of this disclosure.
- FIG. 6 e represents a combined or aggregated feature vector for the members 1 through member 4 for group 1 .

- the values for each respective category in FIG. 6 e are 85, 5, 5, 22, 6, 16, 2, 6, 1, 3, and 150.
- the values for categories for a group feature vector, as in FIG. 6 e may be a sum of the values for each category from members in the group (e.g., as shown in FIG. 6E ).
- the value for a category in a group feature vector may be calculated by taking into account various other attributes, such as the strength of the relationship between a member and the requesting user. For example, if the relationship strength between member 2 to the requesting user, who supplied group 1 as his social filter, is determined to be four times as strong as the relationship of other members of group 1 , then the values from FIG. 6 b 's vector for member 2 may be given four times the value (e.g., resulting in 20, 20, 12, and 4 as the values for each respective category). Any other computation may be used to determine a group feature vector based on member feature vectors without deviating from the scope of this disclosure.
- FIGS. 6 a - 6 e end with dots to show that the list may continue with any number of features or categories or verticals to capture information about. Categories for any particular feature vector may be different for categories in other feature vectors. Categories may include both system generated categories and machine learned categories (e.g., based on web usage patterns of users).
- the represented group vector of FIG. 6 e may be used to refine a query search result upon a user selection of group 1 as its social lens. For example, a user may issue a query for the term “rainbow” and ask to apply group 1 as a social lens to refine query results. Based on the feature vector for group 1 provided in FIG. 6 e , results of querying the term “rainbow” may rank “video games” related search hits higher than other search hits due to a relatively high corresponding score of 85 for the “video games” category for group 1 . Search hits relating to a category of “programming” are provided at the top level, where group 1 is selected as the social lens, because the value for the “programming” category is the highest at 150 in the illustrated group search vector.
- FIGS. 6 a - 6 e are provided as one example of how to represent and hold information about characteristics of individuals and how to calculate and hold information about group characteristics (e.g., using feature vectors).
- group characteristics e.g., using feature vectors
- any other data model or mathematical construct may be used to store characteristics' information for individuals and their respective groups.
- any other computational technique may be used to combine characteristics' information from members of a group to derive characteristics' and associated strength of the characteristics for the group.
- Member's vectors may or may not be used in calculating a group vector, e.g., some members may be disregarded where the relationship with the requesting user and the member is determined to be too distant or infrequent in communication.
- group vectors' characteristics and strengths may be system supplied or a combination of system supplied and derived from user's web usage history.
- FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 are flow charts illustrating example processes for applying a social lens for search results.
- the processes may be performed, for example, by a system as described in FIG. 2 .
- the description that follows uses the system described in FIG. 2 as an example for describing the processes.
- another system, or combination of systems may be used to perform the processes.
- Process 700 of FIG. 7 starts at step 710 , upon receiving a client request to refine search results, wherein the request identifies a first group profile to apply for refining search results.
- the identified first group profile may correspond to a first social circle, a preset group of contacts of the requesting user within a social network service.
- the identified first group profile may represent the characteristics of the first social circle.
- the characteristics of the first social circle may be represented as a group feature vector for the first social circle and may be based on characteristics of one or more individual members of the first social circle, and/or based on sub-circles of the first social circle.
- a user on a client device may be on a search web page (for example as described for FIG. 3 ) and may issue a search request supplying with it one or more social circles available for user selection.
- the user may supply the selection by a drag-and-drop action or other selection mechanisms, e.g., select from a drop-down list of available social circles.
- a user may enter one or more search terms and select a group or social circle (thereby representing or identifying the first group profile) to refine the search results by and then submit the query, resulting in step 710 .
- Step 710 may be serviced by for example, search module 10 of FIG. 2 , that is configured to receive search requests, including social lenses for filtering or ranking search results.
- a user may conduct a conventional search, and subsequently issue a request to refine (the previous) search results by providing a social lens (representing or identifying the first group profile) to rank or filter the previous search results, at step 710 .
- step 720 search results are retrieved based on the received search request.
- step 720 may result in, e.g., search module 210 retrieving search results by querying a data repository 110 as discussed for FIG. 2 .
- step 720 may result in, e.g., search module 210 retrieving the search results for the previous query from, for example, a cache or memory 206 on server 120 .
- the retrieved (e.g., either from cache 206 or from data repository 110 ) search results of step 720 are refined based on the identified first group profile.
- the identified first group profile may be a result of a user selection of a social lens on a search page.
- search module 210 may communicate with refine module 220 to refine the search results for step 720 .
- the refining of search results at step 720 may either lead to a re-ordering or re-ranking of search results or may lead to a filtering of search results as described in more details for FIG. 2 .
- the refining of the retrieved search results uses weighted characteristics about the underlying circle or group, or the group profile, in order to re-order or filter the retrieved search results. (See discussion above).
- the refined search results as determined at step 720 are provided to a client device for display.
- the results may be displayed in the search results section as discussed in FIG. 3 .
- the results may be provided to the client device in a partial manner, 25 results at a time as discussed above or may be delivered all at once to the client device.
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart that shows another example of a process for a social lens-based search system.
- Process 800 starts at step 810 with providing for display an interface listing social lenses for user selection on a search page, wherein each social lens corresponds to a search filter to be applied to refine a search result, wherein the list of social lenses are displayed in a social lens section of the search page and query search results are displayed in a search results section of the search page.
- search module 210 of FIG. 2 may supply an HTML page, including JavaScript, that contains information to display a web page at a client device, such as described for FIG. 3 .
- Section 320 of FIG. 3 represents a section for displaying social groups or lenses for user selection and section 350 represents a search results section for displaying the refined search results.
- the list of social lenses displayed in the interface, discussed for step 810 may provide each social lens in the list of social lenses to correspond to a social circle.
- a social circle to which a social lens corresponds may include a preset group of individual members within a social network service or may comprise of individual members in a system generated social circle.
- an indication of a user selection of a first social lens from the list of displayed lenses is received.
- a user selection may be received, for example, by JavaScript in an HTML page provided to a client device, containing instructions for a user to be able to select one or more social circles for query refinement.
- the instructions may include instructions that allow a user to drag-and-drop displayed social circles.
- the instructions may provide other mechanisms for social circle selection, e.g., a drop-down list from which groups may be selected for refining queries.
- the instructions at step 820 may be provided for example by search module 210 of FIG. 2 .
- a search request wherein the search request is based on the received indication of the user selection of the first selected social lens, is received (e.g., by search module 210 of FIG. 2 ).
- search results are retrieved based on the search request. For example, if a search request is received for a term “rainbow”, search module 210 of FIG. 2 may query data repository 110 to obtain search results for the term “rainbow”. In some aspects, step 840 may require only retrieving search results from a local cache, e.g., where the search request is for a previously executed query.
- the retrieved search results are refined based on the received indication of the user selection of the first social lens, for example by search module 210 communicating with refine module 220 of FIG. 2 .
- at least a portion of the refined search results are provided for display in the search results section of the search page.
- Step 850 may provide the data to display for the search results and instructions on how to display the search results.
- the data provided at step 850 for display as search results may be a subset of all the data retrieved for a query search result (e.g., only 25 search hits may be provided at a time for display a client computing device).
- Receiving a subsequent request for, for example a next page may result in a next set of 25 search hits to be provided for display at the client computing device.
