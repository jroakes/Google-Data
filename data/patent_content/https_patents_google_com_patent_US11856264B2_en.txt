Definitions
- An application can cause a graphical user interface (“GUI”) to be displayed on a display of a client device.
- the application can cause primary content to be displayed in this manner.
- GUI graphical user interface
- user interactions with the graphical user interface of the application may trigger the application to initiate display of additional content, or content presented during a pause or break in primary content.
- additional content the content may appear before or after primary content as well as during primary content (and thus be interstitial to other primary content, for example).
- the additional content may need to be retrieved from a remote location for display.
- a client device can allow a user to terminate display of additional content and resume displaying primary content.
- a client device can display additional content and can locally store the additional content for later resumed display.
- one implementation of the present disclosure provides a method of reducing computer resource requirements for display of additional content on a client device configured for playback of media content, comprising: determining, by an application installed on a client device, that display of additional content has been triggered from a first context of the application; identifying, by the application, a context identifier corresponding to the first context; determining, by a content manager installed on the client device, that an item of additional content associated with the context identifier is stored in a cache of the client device; identifying, by the content manager, an elapsed display time associated with the item of additional content; and initiating, by the application, display of the additional item of content based on the elapsed display time.
- the client device can also store a playback time at which the additional content can be resumed.
- FIG. 1 A depicts additional content being triggered in a first context, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 1 B depicts additional content being displayed on a client device, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 1 C depicts additional content being triggered in the same first context, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 1 D depicts the same additional content being displayed on the client device, according to one implementation.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting some implementations of a system for reducing download requirements.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart depicting some implementations of a content display process.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart depicting some implementations of a content display process.
- the present application is generally directed to systems and methods for reducing download requirements.
- Some applications executed on a client device cause a display of the device to display content.
- user interactions with a GUI of the application may trigger the application to initiate display of additional content, such as pre-roll content, post-roll content, interstitial content or content during breaks, or other such additional content (all referred to generally herein and without limitation as “additional content”).
- Display of additional content may also be triggered in other ways, such as based on a schedule or based on particular processes of the application being executed a predetermined number of times. Display of additional content may unlock locked or additional content of an application.
- Initiating display of additional content can involve the client device retrieving the additional content from a local data store or from a remote data store via, for example, a network.
- a client device downloading a media file as additional content subsequent to initiating a display process can consume significant network resources. This may be disadvantageous, for example, for client devices that have limits on how much data can be downloaded while connected to the network, or for client devices in general in that significant computational resources may be used in such a process.
- the network's resources may be strained or may be unable to handle the demand.
- the application may cause the additional content to be displayed.
- the application may then receive an instruction to terminate display of the additional content after some initial portion of the additional content has been displayed.
- a “back” button can be presented to a user during display of additional content.
- the application may interpret the back button being tapped or clicked or otherwise selected or activated as an instruction to terminate display of the additional content. If a user then retriggers display of additional content, the user may be forced to download and watch an entire new item of additional content, or forced to download and rewatch a portion of the additional content that has already been displayed. This can be frustrating for a user.
- a user may be presented with primary content of the application, trigger display of additional content to unlock other primary content, and, deciding not to watch the additional content, tap a back button during display of the additional content, thus terminating the display.
- the application may then again present the user with the primary content.
- the user may change their mind and decide to complete watching the additional content in order to unlock content, and may again trigger the additional content from the same context.
- the user may then be forced to download and rewatch the already-watched portion of additional content.
- the triggering of additional content from a same context can indicate, for example, that a user has retriggered additional content within a short time frame. Being forced to download rewatch additional content in a short time frame can be frustrating to users.
- the systems and methods described herein help solve at least this problem by, for example, storing a portion of partially watched additional content on the client device, or an identifier to a portion of the partially watched content.
- the systems and methods described herein can involve initiating display of additional content from a first context, storing the additional content responsive to receiving an instruction to terminate display, and at a later time, again initiating display of the additional content from the first context, and continuing the display of the stored additional content.
- Continuing display of the stored additional content may involve retrieving the additional content from a local data store, rather than via a network, thus saving the client device from using computer resources to execute a download, and thus helping the client device and the network manage bandwidth and data download considerations.
- continuing display of the additional content can include setting a playback time of the additional content to a point where the display of the additional content was previously terminated. This provides a better user interface for a user interacting with or viewing the additional content and can help to ensure a better user experience to all users of such interface, no matter the background or context of such usage, in addition to reducing network and computing resources. This is because, it is unpleasant for a user to re-watch an initial portion of the additional content, and this is avoided using systems, devices and methods described in the present disclosure. Furthermore, in some implementations, continued display of the additional content may only be executed when the additional content is triggered from a same context as was the initial display of the additional content, and new additional content may be displayed when additional content is triggered from a different context. This can help to implement the computer-resource-saving process in situations most frustrating to users.
- Display of additional content may be triggered in a context of the application.
- the term context can refer to one or more conditions present when the display of additional content is triggered.
- a context can refer to particular content being displayed by the application, such as a particular web page being displayed by a web browser application, or a particular navigable screen being shown by a game application, such as a main menu screen, a level selection screen, or a level of the game through which an in-game object can navigate.
- a context can also refer to a particular manner in which the display of additional content is triggered.
- the application can receive an indication that a link or button on a webpage has been clicked, tapped, or otherwise selected or activated. The receipt of that indication may trigger display of additional content.
- an in-game accomplishment such as the completion of a level of the game
- an attempt to unlock locked or additional content available through the application can trigger additional content.
- Any of these manners of triggering additional content can constitute a context from which additional content is triggered.
- a context can be a combination of such conditions, such as a selection of a particular button on a particular navigable screen caused to be displayed by the application.
- a context can also include a timing condition, such as the application having been opened for a predetermined amount of time, or a level of a game application having been displayed for a predetermined amount of time.
- One or more contexts can be predefined for an application. Parameters or other information that can define a context may be stored on the client device and may be accessible to the application.
- a context can include a background context and an additional content trigger context.
- a displayed content context can be defined by particular primary content or a particular navigable screen being displayed when additional content display is triggered.
- An additional content trigger context can be defined by, for example, a manner in which additional content is triggered, such as a particular button or hyperlink of the primary content being selected. Defining a context in this manner can be useful, for example, for tracking a number of times that particular primary content has been displayed or navigated to separately from tracking a manner in which additional content is triggered. An example of this is described in more detail below in reference to FIG. 2 .
- FIGS. 1 A through 1 D depict retrieving and displaying content on a client device according to some implementations of the systems and methods described herein.
- FIG. 1 A depicts some implementations of additional content being triggered in a first context.
- a client device 102 can display a GUI 104 .
- the GUI 104 can show primary content 106 .
- the primary content 106 can be, for example, a level selection menu of a game application installed on the client device 102 . Although shown as an interactive application, in other implementations, the primary content 106 may be non-interactive content, such as a movie or television program, podcast, album, video web log (“vlog”), live multimedia stream, or any other such content.
- the GUI 104 can also show buttons, including a back button 108 .
- a user interaction 110 can select the Level 1 button displayed in the GUI 104 .
- the user may select the Level 1 button to unlock primary content related to level 1 of the game.
- the user interaction 110 can trigger the client device 102 to initiate a first display of the additional content 112 .
- FIG. 1 B depicts a first display of the additional content 112 according to some implementations.
- the additional content 112 can be, for example, interstitial video content, such as a video guide to beating Level 1 , or a tutorial for the game application, or a promotional offer.
- a user interaction 114 can select the back button 108 .
- the client device can then responsively terminate display of the additional content 112 , store the additional content 112 and store an elapsed display time of the additional content, and associate that information with a context, such as an activation of the Level 1 button from the level selection menu.
- FIG. 1 C depicts a display of the primary content 106 according to some implementations.
- the user did not complete display of the additional content 112 (e.g. did not display the content for a predetermined time period, did not allow a video to play for a predetermined duration, etc.), and thus did not unlock the level 1 content.
- the GUI 104 may not display the level 1 content.
- the GUI 104 can display the same primary content 106 that was displayed prior to the user triggering the first display of the additional content 112 .
- the user can perform a user interaction 116 to select the Level 1 button again. This can trigger a second display of the additional content 112 .
- the client device 102 can determine that the second display of the additional content 112 was triggered from the same context as the first display of the additional content 112 .
- FIG. 1 D depicts a continued display of the additional content 112 .
- the client device 102 can, responsive to determining that the second display of the additional content 112 was triggered from the same context as the first display of the additional content 112 , retrieve the stored additional content 112 and resume display.
- the client device 102 can resume display at a playback time based on the stored elapsed display time. In this way, the client device need not download another item of additional content, reducing bandwidth consumption, and the user need not rewatch an already-viewed portion of the additional content 112 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting an implementation of a system 200 for reducing download requirements using continued display of content.
- the system 200 may comprise one or more client devices 102 (which may be referred to herein as “the client device 102 ”), a content server 110 , and a content provider server 112 , each of which can communicate with one another via one or more networks, such as the network 114 .
- the network 114 may include a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wi-Fi network, a cellular network, a wide area network (WAN), a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a wireless link, an intranet, the Internet, or combinations thereof.
- PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network
- the client device 102 can include a display 206 .
- the display 206 may comprise a liquid crystal (LCD) display, plasma display, light-emitting diode (LED) display, electrostatic (eInk) display, thermochroic display, cathode ray tube (CRT) display, or any other type and form of display device.
- Display 206 may be internal to client device 102 , or external (e.g. a separate monitor, a wearable display such as a virtual reality or augmented reality display, etc.).
- the display 206 can be a touch display, such as a touch screen configured to receive tactile input and to convert the input to a signal.
- the display 216 can display, for example, a media file displayed by application 208 .
- the client device 102 can include one or more data processors 202 configured to execute instructions stored in a memory 204 to perform one or more operations described herein.
- the memory 204 may be one or more memory devices.
- the processor 202 and the memory 204 of the client device 102 may form a processing module.
- the processor 202 may include a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), etc., or combinations thereof.
- the memory 204 may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providing processor with program instructions.
- the memory 204 may include a floppy disk, compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), digital versatile disc (DVD), magnetic disk, memory chip, read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), flash memory, optical media, or any other suitable memory from which processor can read instructions.
- the instructions may include code from any suitable computer programming language such as, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java®, JavaScript®, Perl®, HTML, XML, Python®, and Visual Basic®.
- the processor 202 may process instructions and output data to effect presentation of one or more media files on the client device 102 .
- the memory 204 may include one or more applications, services, routines, servers, daemons, or other executable logics for executing applications and for requesting and displaying media files. These applications, services, routines, servers, daemons, or other executable logics may be integrated such that they may communicate with one another or be enabled to make calls to routines of each other. In some implementations, these applications, services, routines, servers, daemons, or other executable logics may include an application 208 , a content manager 210 , a content requestor 212 , and a media data store 214 .
- the application 208 can include one or more applications, including an application configured to initiate a content display process.
- the application 208 can include a web browser application, a game application, a map application, video display application, a product or services or business review application, or any other application that can initiate a content display process.
- the application 208 can initiate a display of additional content process by commanding the content manager 210 to retrieve content, such as content in the form of a media file from, for example, a local data store, such as media data store 214 , or from a remote server such as the content server 110 .
- the application 208 can initiate an additional content display process based on user input, such as user input via a keyboard (digital or analog), mouse, pointer, stylus, touch screen, other touch component, or any other input device.
- the application 208 can cause buttons or links to be displayed on a GUI 104 displayed on the display 206 , and can initiate an additional content display process responsive to the user clicking or otherwise selected one of the buttons or links.
- the application 208 can initiate an additional content display process based on, for example, a schedule for initiating additional content display. For example, the application 208 can initiate an additional content display process based on a predetermined amount of time having passed since the application was executed, or since a process of the application was executed, or based on a process of the application having been executed a predetermined number of times. The application 208 can initiate an additional content display process based on, for example, a primary content being displayed by the application for a predetermined amount of time. For example, the application 208 can be a video display application that, when executed, can display primary content, such as primary content selected by a user.
- the application 208 can display primary content, and can initiate an additional content display process after the primary content has been shown for a predetermined amount of time.
- the predetermined amount of time can be based on a total playtime of the primary content, or can be a fixed amount of time.
- the application 208 can initiate an additional content display process prior to a display of primary content, for example, immediately prior to the display of primary content, or can initiate an additional content display process following display of at least a portion of primary content.
- a context can be any individual condition or combination of conditions, such as a user interaction with an object of the GUI 104 , a timing of the user interaction, or a primary content displayed by the GUI 104 when the display process is initiated.
- a plurality of contexts can be pre-defined for the application, and can be stored, for example, in a library of contexts, or can be defined as a particular executable process or set of processes being triggered, possibly in a particular order.
- a context can be associated with a context identifier, such as a string of characters that uniquely identifies the context for the application 208 .
- a plurality of contexts can be in effect (e.g.
- a current state of the application 208 the GUI 104 , and/or the client device 102
- a most specific context is considered to be the sole context in effect by the application 208 for purposes of some of the methods and systems described herein, such as for the purpose of determining in which context a display of additional content was initiated.
- the application can be configured to determine that the second context is uniquely in effect. In other implementations, the application can be configured to determine that both the first context and the second context are in effect.
- the application 208 can increment an impression index that counts a number of times that the application 208 has satisfied a particular context.
- the impression index can be uniquely associated with the particular background context.
- the application 208 can increment the impression index every time the application 208 navigates to or displays a particular background context, which can be defined by, for example, particular primary content being displayed on a screen.
- the GUI 104 can display a level selection screen having clickable level selection buttons, as depicted in FIG. 1 A . This may satisfy the particular background context.
- an additional content trigger context can be defined for the application 208 .
- the additional content trigger context can include a same condition or set of conditions that defines the background context. For example, a particular additional content trigger context can be defined by the conditions of (i) the level selection screen being displayed and (ii) the Level 1 button being clicked.
- an additional content trigger identifier can be associated with the additional content trigger context. The additional content trigger identifier can be uniquely associated with the additional content trigger context.
- there the application 208 does not maintain an impression index that counts instances of the additional content trigger context being satisfied. This can be helpful, for example, in differentiating between additional content that is triggered by different mechanisms and in keeping a count of instances of in which the background context is satisfied.
- the application 208 can pass a context identifier and an associated impression index value to the content manager 210 .
- the context identifier can be a background context identifier that uniquely identifies the background context, and the impression index value can be a count that counts instances of the background context being satisfied.
- the application 208 can further pass a unique additional content trigger identifier to the content manager 210 .
- the application 208 can concatenate the background context identifier, the impression index value, and the additional content trigger identifier to generate a context token, and can pass the context token to the content manager 210 .
- the context token can be used by the content manager, for example, to determine a context in which additional content was triggered.
- the application 208 can display additional content on the display 216 as additional content.
- the application 208 can display the additional content responsive to receiving an instruction to do so by the content manager 210 .
- the application 208 can receive an instruction to display additional content from the content manager 210 , the instruction including a location at which the additional content can be retrieved.
- the instruction can indicate that the additional content is stored in the media data store 214 .
- the application 208 can display additional content that is stored in the media data store 214 and can set a playback time of the additional content to be equal to a stored playback time that is associated with the stored additional content. This can be used, for example, to allow a user to continue watching the additional content at a point where they left off.
- the instruction can indicate that the additional content has been retrieved by the content requestor 212 from the content server 110 .

- the application 208 can determine the required display time for additional content to be, for example, a fixed display time, such as 5 second, 10 second, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or any other fixed display time.
- the application 208 can determine the required display time to be, for example, a time at which the additional content may be skipped, as indicated by the additional content or by data related to the additional content, such as data received from the content server along with the additional content.
- the application 208 can store an indication that sufficient additional content has been displayed (e.g. sufficient additional content to satisfy a predetermined required display time) from a first context, and can associate that indication with a context identifier that identifies the first context. Subsequently, when a display of additional content is triggered from the first context, the application 208 can identify the indication that sufficient content has been displayed, and can responsively determine not to show additional content. In some implementations, the application 208 can delete or flush the indication that sufficient content has been displayed.
