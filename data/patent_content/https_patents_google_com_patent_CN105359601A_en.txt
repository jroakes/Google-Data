Embodiment
Hereafter with each conception of species for providing the method, apparatus and system of information relevant on the computer network and for providing the more detailed description of the execution mode of the method, apparatus and system of information on the computer network.Can in many ways in either type realize above introduce and each conception of species of discussing in more detail below, because described concept is not limited to any ad hoc fashion of execution mode.The example of embodiment and application provides mainly for illustrative object.
In some cases, location Based service can be provided for the user of client terminal device.Such as, such location Based service can comprise position (such as via social media website or application) from the client terminal device to other user's indicating users be associated with the user of client terminal device, to indicate in response to search inquiry the enterprise near the position of client terminal device as a result the page a part or send third party content item or reward voucher based on the position of client terminal device.Such location Based service may require that the exact position of client is sent to the system of third party (such as location Based service provider) by network (such as the Internet), to make such service available.
The GPS that can be used for most mobile client end device (such as smart phone, flat board etc.) can be used to determine the exact position of client terminal device.In other cases, WiFi access point position can be used to determine the exact position of client terminal device.Such as, if client terminal device is connected to the Internet by fixing WiFi access point and the exact position of this fixing WiFi access point is known, then the position of client terminal device can be defined as in about 100 feet.In addition, position-based history the position of client can be inferred.Such as, if the exact position of client terminal device is known recently, is such as pre-determined by GPS or be connected to known WiFi access point, then client terminal device is probably still near existing position.It is one or more that the exact position of client terminal device can be used to be supplied in the location Based service before client terminal device.
But, once data be sent to third party (such as, its can access location information, be used for what object etc.) system, provide the user of the client terminal device of such precise position data just may little or uncontrollable such data.In addition, such precise position data may be tackled on the route to third-party system by other people that the mode do not liked can be used this precise position data with user.Little user of client terminal device may be caused to utilize the location Based service of location Based service provider to providing such care of precise position data.
Therefore, but to make to determine that exact position still allows the exact position providing the secured fashion of location Based service to hide client terminal device may be useful.The region of the pseudo-position can determined through hiding relative to the exact position of client terminal device can based on one or more factor.Such as, the pseudo-position through hiding can be resized in region in the inner, position, makes it be not less than pre-sizing (such as, a square kilometre or other size) based on preference, standard, guide, local customs, local law etc.In other cases, pseudo-position through hiding can be resized in region in the inner, position, make the client terminal device of predetermined number based on preference, standard, guide, local customs, local law etc. in preset time section by this region (such as, monthly at least 1,000 client terminal device).Pseudo-position through hiding can also be resized in region in the inner, position, make still can effectively to provide location Based service (that is, the pseudo-position through hiding can region in the inner, position so large so that cause location Based service invalid or inapplicable).Such as, when with the third party content item providing the gas station of low oil price to be associated, the pseudo-position through hiding in two miles of the exact position of client terminal device can be the same with the exact position of client terminal device effective.But the pseudo-position through hiding in 100 miles may be invalid or inapplicable.
Although consideration above can region in the inner, position be useful relative to the pseudo-position through hiding, whether the pseudo-position that the mode being to provide the pseudo-position through hiding also may affect through hiding completes in a secure manner.In one embodiment, client terminal device use location module (such as, GPS module, Wifi access point position module etc.) can obtain the exact position of client terminal device.Client terminal device can calculate exact position and deviant and with the pseudo-position determining client terminal device.In some cases, can deviant be limited, make the region in the inner, position, pseudo-position through hiding meet region above consider in one or more.Pseudo-position can be used for location Based service by client terminal device.Although can provide applicable pseudo-position in many cases above, in some cases, deviant can be determined by third party.
Such as, if deviant is constant or constant during a time period, then deviant can be determined based on two or more pseudo-positions.That is, if be that location Based service (such as navigation application, social media application, location application etc.) is at very first time t
1the first exact position P is have sent to the first third party
1, and be that another location Based service is at the second time t
2the first pseudo-position SP is have sent to the second third party
1, wherein
SP
1＝P
2+Offset
Wherein the first exact position P
1with the second exact position P
2close toward each other, make | P
1-P
2| be minimized in (such as, in the region of about 10,000 square feet or about 1000 square metres), then Offset can be determined by following formula:
Offset＝SP
1-P
1
Wherein Ρ
1≈ P
2.If Offset remains unchanged and generates the second pseudo-position SP
2, wherein for another location Based service
SP
2＝P
3+Offset
Even if then P
3not near the first exact position P
1or the second exact position P
2, also can determine the exact position P of the latter
3.
And, even if employ random offset value, if the value of stochastic generation of skew has zero-mean and client terminal device keeps relatively fixing (such as, about 10, in the region of 000 square feet or about 1000 square metres), then also can determine the exact position of client terminal device.Such as, if the exact position P of client terminal device
xkeep relatively fixing during a time period and generate multiple pseudo-position for location Based service, such as,
SP
i＝P
x+Offset
i
And i=1...N, then exact position P
