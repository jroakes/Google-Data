- a problem with such prior art systems is that simply tagging information by location by itself does not support the unique needs of users who want to leave personal reminders to themselves that trigger only upon entering and/or exiting a particular area that is relationally associated with the reminder. For example, simply tagging information by location does not address the fact that a user may wish to author a reminder and specifically assign the triggering of that reminder to the act of entering a defined physical area. Similarly, simply tagging information by location does not address the fact that a user may wish to author a reminder and specifically assign the triggering of that reminder to the act of entering a defined physical area and resetting the reminder such that it will not trigger again until the user has exited the defined area and then entered again.
- simply tagging information by location does not address the fact that a user may wish to author a reminder and specifically assign the triggering of that reminder to the act of exiting a defined physical area.
- simply tagging information by location does not address the fact that a user may wish to author a reminder and specifically assign the triggering of that reminder to both the acts of entering and exiting a defined physical area.
- simply tagging information by location does not address the fact that a user may wish to leave a reminder that is only accessible by himself or herself and not accessible by other users.
- simply tagging information by location does not address the fact that a user may wish to leave a reminder that will alert him or her only once upon entering a particular area.
- simply tagging information by location does not address the fact that user may wish to have unique reminder options upon being presented to him or her upon the automatic triggering of a reminder. For example, a user may wish to be provided with the option of terminating the reminder upon automatic display such that it will be deleted and not trigger again. The user may also wish to be provided with the option of editing the reminder upon automatic display such that items can be added, removed, and/or changed. The user may also wish to be provided with the option of deferring the reminder such that it will trigger again after a defined amount of time if the user remains within the associated physical area.
- the user may also wish to be provided with the option of requesting a last chance with respect to the reminder such that it will automatically trigger again just as the user leaves the defined area and thereby give him or her a last chance to act on the reminder before leaving the area. Also, simply tagging information by location does not address the fact that a user may wish to leave a reminder that is relationally associated with a particular selected establishment or type of establishment.
- One embodiment exemplarily described herein can broadly be characterized as a spatially associated personal reminder method that includes receiving current locative sensor data, the locative sensor data identifying a physical location of a user's portable computing device; accessing a reminder database containing a personal reminder, wherein each personal reminder comprises reminder content and a trigger area relationally associated with the personal reminder, the reminder content identifying one or more tasks the user intends to complete in the future; comparing the physical location identified within the current locative sensor data with a boundary of the trigger area that is relationally associated with the reminder content of the personal reminder; determining whether a trigger event associated with the personal reminder has occurred based upon the comparing; and displaying the reminder content relationally associated with the trigger area to the user via a display of the portable computing device when the trigger event is determined to have occurred.

- the portable computing device 111 also includes software running upon a processor of portable computing device, the software operative to manage the personal digital reminders and trigger appropriate reminders based upon the changes in location of the user within the real physical world as detected by the locative sensor.
- the portable computing device 111 also includes a user interface 103 supported by hardware and software for enabling a user to create, edit, and manage personal digital reminders as well as for enabling a user to associate reminder content with particular spatial areas within the real physical world.
- portable computing device 111 includes within it a number of components including a local processor, a local memory, a locative sensor, a display 101 , a user interface 103 , hardware and software for generating alerts, and reminder circuitry adapted to manage and trigger reminders based upon the changes in physical location of the user as he or she moves the portable computing device 111 about the real physical world.
- the term “circuitry” refers to any type of executable instructions that can be implemented, for example, as hardware, firmware, and/or software, which are all within the scope of the various teachings described.
- the user interface 103 includes the aforementioned display 101 in addition to user input devices (e.g., buttons) 105 .
- At least a portion of the reminder database described above may be provided within the local memory of the portable computing device 111 . In another embodiment, at least a portion of the reminder database described above may be supported remotely (e.g., by a reminder server as will be discussed below).
- the reminder content of each personal digital reminder may be stored in the local memory of the portable computing device 111 . They may be entered directly into the portable computing device 111 by the user by manipulating the user interface 103 of the portable computing device 111 . They may be entered into another computer (e.g., a personal computer, not shown), and downloaded into the portable computing device 111 over a wired or wireless link. Or they may be downloaded from a remote server (not shown) over a wired or wireless link. In some embodiments, the user keeps a database of his or her personal digital reminders on a remote server and downloads them into his or her portable computing device 111 over a wireless link when the portable computing device 111 is active.
- personal digital reminders may be stored within the local memory of the portable computing device 111 .
- This data includes the content described above, including any text, graphics, audio, and/or video files associated with each personal digital reminder.
- associated trigger areas of each personal digital reminder may be stored in the local memory of the portable computing device 111 .
- trigger areas may be defined in a variety of ways—for example, by indicating a set of coordinates that describes the boundaries of the area. Alternately, trigger areas may be defined as a set of coordinates of a reference location and additional mathematical information that describes the boundaries with respect to the reference location. For example, if the trigger area is circular it may be defined as a set of coordinate describing the center of the circle and a radius that describes the size of the circle and a parameter indicating that the area is a circle.
- the boundaries of the physical area in the real physical world may be fully described.
- additional parameters may be required such as orientation information that describes how the shape is oriented as well as other parameters to describe the boundaries.
- orientation information that describes how the shape is oriented as well as other parameters to describe the boundaries.
- square, rectangle, ellipse, irregular polygon, and other shaped areas may be defined that described the spatial boundaries of an area within the real physical world.
- the trigger area may be a three dimensional volume, for example, a sphere region or a cube region.
- flags and other variables that describe how and when the reminder should be triggered (as well as the current status of the reminder) of each personal digital reminder may be stored in the local memory of the portable computing device 111 .
- the flags and other variables (collectively referred to as “parameters”) describe if the reminder should be triggered (i.e., if the trigger event should occur) upon the user physically entering the trigger area, exiting the trigger, or both entering and exiting the trigger area.
- parameters may be represented in many ways.
- One method is to include two fhag variables within the data store of the personal digital reminder, the flag variables including an Entry_Trigger_Flag and an Exit_Trigger_Flag.
- Each flag may be represented by a binary variable and thereby store the value 0 or 1. If the Entry_Trigger_Flag is set to 1, then the reminder will trigger upon the user physically entering the area. If the Entry_Trigger_Flag is set to 0 it will not. If the Exit_Trigger_Flag is set to 1, then the reminder will trigger up the user physically exiting the area. If the Exit_Trigger_Flag is set to 0 it will not. Thus, based upon how these two flag variables are set, the personal digital reminder may be set to trigger upon entering, exiting, or both entering and exiting the trigger area.
- a user interface 103 is provided upon the portable computing device 111 (or other computing device on which the reminder is authored) that enables the user to select the trigger status of the reminder.
- the user may select options from a displayed menu upon the portable computing device 111 .
- the reminder circuitry automatically sets the appropriate Exit_Trigger_Flag and Exit_Trigger_Flag values for that reminder stored in memory.
- the reminder circuitry will automatically set the Entry_Trigger_Flag to 1 and the Exit_Trigger_Flag to 1 in the store of data that represents the reminder.
- a personal digital reminder is thus a store of digital data that includes reminder content, one or more associated trigger areas, and a set of parameters that described how the reminder will be triggered (including information that indicates if it will trigger upon the user entering, exiting, or both entering and exiting the trigger area). Additional parameters may also be included that described the status of the reminder. For example, in many embodiments an Entry_Status_Flag is stored, the entry status flag indicating if the user is currently inside a trigger area that has been relationally associated with a particular personal digital reminder. For example, the system is often configured such that the Entry_Status_Flag is set to 1 when the user is physically present within a trigger area associated with the reminder, and set to 0 when the user is not physically present within a trigger area associated with the reminder.
- a Defer_Time parameter may be stored and associated with each reminder, the defer time parameter (also referred to herein as a “defer timer”) indicating the amount of time that must elapse before a deferred digital reminder may be triggered again.
- the Defer_Time is an integer variable that stores the number of seconds in the assigned Defer_Time.
- the Defer_Time may be set by the user engaging a user interface described in greater detail below. A default Defer_Time may also be used if not specifically set by the user. Because not all reminders will have the defer feature enabled, the parameters may include a flag that indicates if a particular reminder has been enabled with the Defer feature.
- a Defer_Status_Flag may be defined as a binary variable that indicates that the reminder has been deferred by the user. If the flag is set to 1, it indicates the feature has been enabled. If the flag is set to 0, it indicates that the reminder has not been deferred by the user.
- a personal digital reminder is a store of data that includes, reminder content that embodies the information that the user will be reminded of, one or more associated trigger areas that is relationally associated with the reminder content, and a set of parameters that described how the reminder will be triggered as the user enters and/or exits the one or more trigger areas, and additional parameters that indicate certain status information about each reminder.
- the personal digital reminder that is authored by the user may be stored in a variety of data structures.
- the data structure that stores the set of currently defined personal digital reminders along with their associated trigger areas and parameters is referred to herein as the reminder database.
- One example data structure for the reminder database is partially described below. This particular embodiment only allows for circular trigger areas and thus, does not include parameters and values for other shapes. This should not limit the scope of the invention to circular trigger areas for it is provided merely for simple illustrative purposes.
- the data structure is represented symbolically as follows:
- the exemplary data structure described above supports some number n of different personal digital reminders wherein ID is a unique identification index number between 1 and n for each reminder. Thus, if a user created 10 different reminders and stored them in memory, each can be accessed based upon the index number.
- Reminder[5] for example, refers to the data for the fifth reminder in the reminder database.
- Reminder[3] refers to the third reminder in the reminder database.
- the reminder of identification number ID can be accessed by referring to Reminder[ID].
- each reminder may be relationally associated to particular reminder content using a relational pointer.
- each reminder may have a plurality of associated trigger areas associated with it from 1 to i.
- each of these trigger areas is a circle with a center coordinate (as a longitude and a latitude) and a radius.
- reminder[ID].Entry_Status_Flag stores a binary value indicating if the user is currently within a trigger area associated with that reminder.
- reminder[ID].Defer_Status_Flag stores a binary value indicating if the user has recently deferred that reminder for some amount of time.
- reminder[ID].Defer_Time stores that amount of time (in seconds) if the reminder has been deferred by the user.
- reminder[ID].Last_Chance_Flag is a binary value indicating if the user has requested a last chance trigger for that reminder.
- additional parameters may be associated with each reminder, further restricting the conditions under which the reminder will trigger.
- a reminder may also be associated with a temporal trigger condition, the temporal trigger condition defining a range of times during which the reminder may trigger. This may be useful for reminders that are associated with establishments that have certain business hours. In this way, a temporal trigger condition may be used to restrict the triggering of such a reminder to time periods that fall within the business hours of the particular establishment.
- a reminder may be associated with a directional trigger condition, the directional trigger condition defining a direction of motion of the user, or range of directions of motion of the user, that must be met for the reminder to trigger.
- a reminder can be defined such that it triggers only when a user enters a particular trigger area while moving in a particular direction or moving within a particular range of directions.
- a reminder can be defined using such directional trigger condition parameters such that it triggers only when a user exits a particular trigger area while moving in a particular direction or moving within a particular range of directions.
- a reminder may be associated with a facing direction trigger condition, the facing direction trigger condition defining a direction or range of directions that the user must be facing for the reminder to trigger.
- the portable computing device generally includes and uses clock functionality to determine if a temporal trigger condition is met by the user upon entering or exiting a trigger area.
- the portable computing device generally stores a time history of locative values and uses this time history to determine if the user is moving in a required direction upon entering or exiting a trigger area.
- the portable computing device may employ a directional sensor, for example a magnetometer, that is incorporated within the device or in communication with the device that determines a facing direction for the user and employs this facing direction to determine if the user is facing in a required direction upon entering or exiting a trigger area.
- the reminders exemplarily described herein may be configured such that the user is alerted to the reminder based upon the spatial location of the user meeting certain locative requirements in combination with additional restrictive requirements being met such as temporal and/or directional requirements.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic representation of one embodiment of a spatially associated personal reminder system.

- the locative sensor is a GPS transducer.
- the GPS transducer determines spatial location by receiving data from a plurality of satellites 120 orbiting the earth. Based upon this data the GPS transducer quickly determines the current spatial location of the portable computing device 111 with a high degree of accuracy.
- portable computing device 111 includes a wireless transmitter and receiver for communication with an external server 100 .
- the reminder server 100 may support certain reminder functionality by storing personal digital reminders that may be downloaded by the portable computing device 111 and then stored locally and/or by storing other information that helps the user correlate reminders to particular locations within the real physical world.
- the reminder server 100 may store reference information that relates certain establishments and/or types of establishments to certain locations and/or areas within the real physical world.
- the reminder server 100 may store reference information that relates certain products or services to the location and/or area of certain establishments that provide such products or services. That said, the reminder database that is used by the portable computing device 111 is generally stored local to the portable computing device 111 and only uses the optional remote server 100 for occasional updates of reminder information.
- the spatially associated personal reminder system shown in FIG. 2 can be characterized as a computer moderated system that enables a portable computing device 111 to provide alerts to a user when he or she enters a physical area associated with a personal digital reminder and/or when he or she exits a physical area relationally associated with a personal digital reminder.
- a particular reminder may be configured such that it triggers an alert to a user only upon entering an associated area, only upon exiting an associated area, or both upon entering and exiting as associated area.
- the alert is provided to user 106 as an audible stimulus imparted through audio display hardware, and/or as a tactile stimulus imparted through tactile display hardware, and/or as a visual stimulus imparted through visual display hardware.
- the primary function of the alert is to gain the users attention such that he or she knows that a reminder has been triggered. Once the alert is imparted the user may look upon the screen and/or perform some other action to review the content of the reminder itself. Upon viewing the contents of the reminder, the user is automatically provided with reminder options by which the reminder may be terminated, deferred, reset, last chanced, and/or edited, as will be described in greater detail below.
- the reminder circuitry that is supported by the portable computing device 111 accesses the local reminder database, accesses the locative sensor, determines if alerts should be triggered, and provides the aforementioned reminder options to the user. In one embodiment, the reminder circuitry is provided as software that runs upon one or more processors local to the portable computing device 111 .
- the reminder circuitry is also operative to allow a user to create (author) new reminders and associate those reminders with user selected areas in the real physical world and indicate if the authored reminder should trigger upon entering the area, exiting the area, or both entering and exiting the selected area.
- the portable computing device 111 contains within it and/or is connected to one or more locative sensors.

- FIG. 5 illustrates one embodiment of a portable computing device incorporated within a spatially associated personal reminder system in which an exemplary personal digital reminder as well as an exemplary user interface is displayed.
- the illustration shows one embodiment of a portable computing device 111 displaying an exemplary personal digital reminder as well as a particular user interface 103 .
- a reminder reset button 502 is included as part of the user input devices 105 .
- the reset button 502 may be engaged (e.g., pressed) by the user to select a reset reminder option, wherein the reset reminder option is adapted to reset a reminder.
- the reset reminder option has a different effect depending upon whether the reminder is entry-triggered (i.e. configured to trigger upon entry to an associated are), is exit-triggered (i.e. configured to trigger upon exit of an associated area) or both entry-triggered and exit-triggered.
- the reset reminder option selected by the user causes the reminder circuitry to remove the reminder from the screen and reset the flags such that the reminder will not trigger again unless the user leaves the physical area that triggered the reminder and then enters an associated trigger area again. If the reminder is exit-triggered, the reset reminder option selected by the user causes the reminder circuitry to remove it from the screen and resets the flags such that the reminder will not trigger again unless the user again enters a physical area associated with the reminder again and then exits the associated trigger area again.
- the reset reminder option selected by the user causes the reminder circuitry to remove it from the screen and resets the flags such that the reminder will not trigger again until the user exits any areas associated with the reminder that the user may currently be located within or until the user again enters an area associated with the reminder. In this way, by selecting the reset option, the user can clear the reminder from the screen and be assured that it will not trigger again until an area boundary crossing happens again.
- a slightly different boundary may be used for determining a user's entry into an area as compared to the one used to determine a user's exit so as to avoid situations in which a user may be standing (or mulling about) on the boundary of a trigger area and thereby repeatedly trigger alerts.
- the boundary area used for determining user entry i.e., an “entry boundary”
- the boundary area used for determining user exit i.e., an “exit boundary”
- the boundary area used for determining user exit i.e., an “exit boundary” is slightly larger than (i.e., outside of) the nominal boundary.
- This process is applied herein to enable the reminder circuitry to provide for more robust and reliable determinations of user entry and/or user exit of a trigger area and thereby avoid situations wherein user entries and/or user exits are triggered as a result of sensor noise and/or as a result of a users mulling about on or near a boundary of a trigger area.
- a schematic representation of such boundary definitions are shown in FIG. 7 .
- an essentially circular trigger area is drawn (although other shapes may be similarly used).
- a nominal boundary 702 of the circular area is defined using a center coordinate and a radius r as described previously
- the entry boundary 704 of the circular area is defined as a radius r ⁇ d
- d is a trigger event adjustment distance
- the exit boundary 706 of the circular area is defined as a radius r+d (thus, the exit boundary 706 extends beyond the nominal boundary 702 by the trigger event adjustment distance d).
- the boundary used for determining user entry is smaller than the boundary used for determining user exit.
- the technique is achieved by defining in reminder circuitry the trigger event adjustment distance d such that the entry boundary is defined by a circle of the same center as the nominal boundary but with a smaller radius (r ⁇ d) and the exit boundary is defined by a circle of the same center as the nominal boundary but with a larger radius (r+d).
- GPS data and other locative sensor data signals may include some noise
- the values may vary slightly even when the user is not moving. In some situations, the noise may cause the reminder circuitry to determine that the user has crossed a boundary when he or she has not.
- the aforementioned method of using a different boundary for entry as compared to the boundary used for exit, the two boundary regions separated by some distance (in this case by twice the distance d), may be helpful in reducing and/or eliminating the erroneous crossing determinations caused by signal noise. Accordingly, the value of d can be selected such that it is larger than the noise level in the sensor signal. Because GPS data often has signal noise on the order of at least a few feet, a value d chosen as 6 to 8 feet is often sufficiently large to eliminate (or significantly reduce) such problems.
- embodiments exemplarily described herein provide additional reminder options (e.g., a terminate reminder option, a defer reminder option, a last chance reminder option, an edit reminder option, etc.) that are selectable by the user upon the display of a triggered reminder.
- additional reminder options may be enabled through a variety of different user interface elements and/or controls.
- the additional reminder options may be presented to the user via the display 101 .
- An exemplary presentation of such information is shown enlarged at 501 .
- a terminate reminder option 505 may be selected upon the user's engagement with the user interface 103 .
- each of these reminder options causes the reminder circuitry supported by the portable computing device 111 to take certain actions. These actions are described as follows:
- Terminate Reminder option Upon the selection of a terminate (or equivalent) reminder option 505 , the reminder circuitry clears the screen of the displayed reminder and removes the reminder from the reminder database and/or sets the reminder to an inactive state. In either case, the reminder is no longer active and will no longer trigger alerts and/or be displayed based upon the user's traversal of the physical world. Thus, a user who is displayed a reminder and acts on that reminder and/or determines that the reminder is no longer relevant or important can select the terminate reminder option. For example, the user returns home and upon entering a defined trigger boundary around his or her home, is alerted to a reminder.
- the user may be displayed text that says “Defrost Dinner.”
- the user Upon entering his or her home, the user is reminded to take his dinner from the freeze and defrost it. Upon performing this action, the reminder no longer has any future relevance or importance and so the user will likely cause it to be terminated from the reminder database.
- Defer Reminder option Upon the selection of a defer (or equivalent) reminder option 506 , the reminder circuitry clears the screen of the displayed reminder and sets a flag such that the reminder will be displayed again after a certain amount of time has elapsed, that certain amount of time being referred to herein as the “defer delay time.” In some embodiments, the reminder will only be displayed again to the user if two conditions are met (e.g., if the defer delay time has elapsed and the user is still within the area that triggered the reminder). Thus, in some embodiments, the reminder will only be displayed again if the defer delay time has elapsed and conditions satisfying the trigger event associated with the reminder are still satisfied after the defer delay time has elapsed.
- the reminder circuitry is operative to clear the screen and begin a process of determining if and when the defer delay time has elapsed. This is often achieved by setting a counter to the number of seconds in the defer delay time and decrementing the counter at repeated intervals that correspond with the elapsed number of seconds.
- the reminder is displayed again to the user.
- the reminder is only displayed if the counter decrements to 0 and if the user is still within the area that had triggered the alert. For example, the user drives to Wal-Mart and upon entering an area near the entrance to the store, is alerted to a reminder.
- the defer delay time may be a constant set in memory such as 600 seconds.
- the defer delay time is retrieved from the reminder database wherein a different value is stored for each reminder. The value may be stored in the reminder[ID].Defer_Time variable for that reminder ID. Thus, the reminder circuitry may retrieve this value from memory, update a counter to that value, and begin tracking elapsed time.
- the reminder is triggered again. In this example, this may happen 7 minutes after the defer reminder option was selected.
- the user may be well within the store, well into his or her shopping, and may still have forgotten to get Raisin Bran.
- the user is reminded again after the defer delay time and is thereby less likely to forget to the needed cereal.
- the user may elect to terminate the reminder by engaging the user interface 103 to select the terminate option 505 . This would be the likely selection if the user has already gotten the Raisin Bran.
- the user may engage the user interface 103 to select the defer option 506 again. In this case, the defer process is then repeated.
- Last chance reminder option Upon the selection of a last chance (or equivalent) reminder option 507 , the reminder circuitry clears the screen of the displayed reminder and sets a flag such that the reminder will be displayed again when the user leaves the area that triggered the alert. Thus, upon a user engaging the user interface 103 to select the last chance reminder option 507 , the reminder circuitry is operative to clear the screen and begin a process of determining if and when the user exits the boundary region of the area that he or she is currently within. This is useful because it gives the user a last chance to remember to perform the task or tasks in the reminder before significantly departing the establishment.
- the user drives to a local Safeway Grocery Store and upon entering an area around the perimeter of the store, is alerted to a reminder.
- the user Upon viewing the reminder, the user is played an audio voice reminder that says “Pick up your Prescription”. This message is also written in text upon the screen.
- the user upon entering the store, the user is reminded to stop at the pharmacy and pick up his prescription medication.
- the user engages the user interface 103 to select the last chance reminder option 507 , causing the display to be cleared and causing the reminder circuitry to configure itself such that the user will be reminded again upon exiting the defined trigger area. In this way, the user will be alerted again to the reminder upon leaving the store in case he forgot to pick up his prescription.
- Edit reminder option Upon the selection of the edit (or equivalent) reminder option 508 , the reminder circuitry enables the user to edit the content of the personal digital reminder.
- the user may, for example, add material, remove material, and/or change material.
- the user can update the reminder based upon whether or not a portion of the reminded task has been performed. For example, the user drives to a local Seven-Eleven and upon entering an area around the perimeter of the store, is alerted to a reminder.
- the user Upon viewing the reminder, the user is presented with a shopping list that includes numerous items that the user needs to purchase. The user may purchase some of those items, although not all of the items may be for sale at the store. The user may thus wish to update the reminder to-do list.
- reminder content within the personal reminder can be updated (i.e., altered) based on the user's engagement with the user interface 103 .
- FIG. 6 illustrates one embodiment of an exemplary process for facilitating execution of the reminder options selectable via the user interface shown in FIG. 5 .
- FIG. 6 one exemplary embodiment of a process for facilitating execution of the reminder options discussed above with respect to FIG. 5 is shown. It will be appreciated that the structure of the process shown in FIG. 6 is but one example and that the process can be performed in many alternate ways.
- the process starts at 600 wherein a trigger detection and processing routine is initiated or called.
- the process proceeds to 610 where reminder circuitry supported by the processor of the portable computing device 111 reads locative sensor data from the locative sensor (which in this example is a GPS sensor). This locative sensor data will indicate spatial coordinates representing where within the physical environment the user is currently residing (it is assumed the portable computing device 111 is kept local to the user during use).
- the process then proceeds to 620 where the reminder circuitry accesses the reminder database and determines, based upon the locative sensor data, whether the user has passed out of any trigger areas associated with any currently active reminders.
- the process at 620 may be skipped. If, on the other hand, it is determined from the flags in the reminder database that the user is currently within one or more trigger areas (e.g., as indicated by the Entry_Status_Flag values for all currently active reminders), the process at 620 is performed by checking (e.g., based upon the current location) if the user has passed out of the boundary of any of the trigger areas for which the user was previously determined to be within.
- the process proceeds to 625 .
- any reminders that are configured to trigger upon the user exit of any trigger areas that the user has just exited are triggered. This might include exit reminders and/or entry reminders for which a last chance reminder option has been set. The user is alerted to these reminders and the reminders are displayed to the user.
- the process then proceeds to 628 wherein any status flags that need updating are updated. For example, the Entry_Status_Flag for any reminders associated with trigger areas that the user just exited are changed in value from 1 to 0, thereby indicating that the user is no longer inside a trigger area associated with those reminders.
- the process then proceeds to 660 where the user is given the opportunity to provide input through the user interface. It is at this step that the reminder options are presented to the user and the user may, for example, elect to terminate the currently displayed reminder, edit the currently displayed reminder, defer the currently displayed reminder, or reset the currently displayed reminder. Depending upon what reminder options are selected by the user, the process proceeds to 670 and the reminder database is updated to reflect any terminations, edits, resets, or deferments, of reminders. The process then loops back to 610 where the GPS location is checked once again. In some embodiments, the checking of GPS location may be a background process that is performed in parallel with other processes described herein.
- the reminder circuitry accesses the reminder database and determines if the user, based upon the updated location data, has entered into any trigger areas associated with any currently active reminders. This may be performed by checking (e.g., based upon the current location) if the user is currently inside the boundary of any of the trigger areas for which the user was previously not determined to be within. This may be done by mathematically comparing the current location of the user with a defined nominal boundary area (or entry boundary if employing the technique shown in FIG. 7 ). If the user's location falls within the boundary of a trigger area that is not currently identified by an Entry_Status_Flag as being an area the user is currently in, he or she must have entered the trigger area since the last time the data was updated.
- any reminders that are configured to trigger upon the user entering are triggered.
- the user is alerted to these reminders and the reminders are displayed to the user.
- the process then proceeds to 638 wherein any status flags that need updating are updated. For example, the Entry_Status_Flag for any reminders associated with the trigger areas that the user just entered are changed in value from 0 to 1, thereby indicating that the user is now inside a trigger area associated with those reminders.
- the process then proceeds to 660 where the user is given the opportunity to provide input through the user interface. It is at this step that the reminder options are presented to the user and the user may, for example, elect to terminate the currently displayed reminder, edit the currently displayed reminder, defer the currently displayed reminder, last chance the currently displayed reminder, or reset the currently displayed reminder. Depending upon what reminder options are selected by the user, the process proceeds to 670 wherein the reminder database is updated to reflect any terminations, edits, last chances, resets, or deferments, of reminders. The process then loops back to 610 where the GPS location is checked once again.
- the reminder circuitry decrements any active defer timers that may have been previously set.
- the defer timers are decremented by a time delta t, equal to the amount of time that has elapsed since the last time the timers were decremented. In this way, the timers keep track of elapsed time.
- the timers are maintained in a background process that occurs in parallel with other processes described herein.
- the reminder circuitry can determine which reminders have defer timers associated with them by checking the Defer_Status_Flag, a binary value that indicates a reminder has a deferred presentation pending if set to 1.
- the process then proceeds to 650 where the reminder circuitry accesses the reminder database and determines if any defer timers have been decremented to 0, thereby indicating that the elapsed time of the deferment for that reminder has expired. If so, the reminder circuitry checks (e.g., based upon the current location) if the user has remained within a trigger area associated with that reminder. This may be performed by checking if the user (based upon the current location) is currently inside the boundary associated with that reminder. If so, the process proceeds to 655 . At 655 , any reminders that are configured to trigger upon the expiration of a deferment time interval are triggered. The user is alerted to these reminders and the reminders are displayed to the user.
- the reminder circuitry accesses the reminder database and determines if any defer timers have been decremented to 0, thereby indicating that the elapsed time of the deferment for that reminder has expired. If so, the reminder circuitry checks (e.g., based upon the current
- the process then proceeds to 658 where any status flags that need updating are updated.
- the Defer_Status_Flag for any reminders that the user was just presented with is changed in value from 1 to 0, thereby indicating that a deferred presentation is no longer pending for that reminder.
- the process would have proceeded to 660 instead of 655 .
- the user is given the opportunity to provide input through the user interface. It is at this step that the reminder options are presented to the user and the user may, for example, elect to terminate any currently displayed reminders, edit any currently displayed or selected reminders, defer any currently displayed reminders, last chance any currently displayed reminders, or reset any currently displayed reminders.
- the process proceeds to 670 wherein the reminder database is updated to reflect any terminations, edits, last chances, resets, or deferments, of reminders. The process then loops back to 610 wherein the GPS location is checked once again.
- the user may also be given the option of exiting the process shown in FIG. 6 , thereby ending the automated reminder process. If the user elects this option, the routine ends at 680 .
- a user may author a personal digital reminder directly via the portable computing device 111 .
- a user may author a personal digital reminder on an alternate computing device and then download it into the portable computing device 111 .
- the process of authoring a personal digital reminder i.e., an authoring process
- the authoring process may also include defining one or more trigger areas and associate the trigger areas with a reminder. Trigger areas may be defined and associated with a reminder in many ways, examples of which will be discussed below.
- the user creates a data store of known locations and/or establishments that are added to a menu, each location and/or establishment having data associated with it that defines the trigger area around or near it.
- the user may have within his or her data store trigger area data for his or her home, his or her work, his or her gym, his or her favorite grocery stores, his or her dry cleaners, his or her favorite gas stations, and other establishments for which the user regularly attends and/or acquires products or services.
- the user need not enter data to define the area each time the user authors a reminder.
- the user may create a grocery list and then associate the grocery list with the appropriate trigger areas by selecting the related establishments from the data store.
- the user may be provided with a menu of choices for establishments and/or types of establishments to link a reminder to.
- the user selects those establishments and/ or types of establishments from the menu and the reminder circuitry automatically links the reminder to the trigger areas linked to those establishments.
- the portable computing device 111 accesses a remote server (e.g., a reminder server 100 ) to find the trigger area information associated with a particular establishment and/or type of establishment. For example, if the user creates a reminder to get gasoline, the user may link that reminder to all BP Gas Stations by selecting that type of establishment. The portable computing device 111 then accesses the reminder server 100 which maintains the reminder database linking certain establishments to certain trigger areas and downloads one or more trigger areas associated with BP Gas Stations, each trigger area defining an area around the BP Gas Station. In this way, the reminder database may be automatically populated with trigger areas without the user needing to specifically define the location, shape, size, or other parameters associated with the area. Instead, the user may simply specify an establishment and/or type of establishment and thereby access the related trigger area information.
- a remote server e.g., a reminder server 100
- the user may indicate a particular type of product or service related to a reminder and the personal computing device will automatically populate the reminder database with trigger areas associated with that product or service by accessing a remote reminder server that stores such relations.
- the reminder server may store information relating each of a plurality of different types of products or services to each of a plurality of different types of establishments along with the trigger areas for those establishments.
- the user may wish to define a trigger area manually rather than access it from a pre-made data store as described above.
- the user may wish to define a trigger area related to his or her house, his or her work, his or her gym, or his or her favorite park, etc . . .
- graphical user interface may be provided to enable a user to define spatial areas with respect to the real physical world and store those spatial areas as trigger areas linked to reminders.

- Google Earth Such an application can be enhanced using direct coding or existing APIs to support additional features relevant to the present personal digital reminder as described herein.
- FIG. 8 illustrates one embodiment of information presented by the user interface, wherein the user interface and the presented information are adapted to enable users to define associated trigger areas with respect to the real physical world.
- the display of a computing device e.g., portable computing device 111 , portable computer 107 , or personal computer 109
- an application such as an enhanced version of Google Earth
- the imagery is depicted as satellite images and/or aerial photography taken from overhead.
- such imagery is enhanced with graphical elements such as boundary lines, landmark demarcations, and/or other graphical and/or textual overlays.
- the user can navigate the visual representation of the world by panning left, right, up, and down upon a spatially rotating globe as well as by zooming in and out upon specific areas of the earth. For example, by zooming and panning in appropriate directions a user can find very specific locations on the planet earth and view corresponding overhead imagery (e.g., satellite and/or aerial photography).
- the user interface of the spatially associated personal reminder system shown in FIG. 2 is adapted to enable the user to define an associated trigger area around the desired geospatial area and/or establishment being viewed from above.
- the user may engage the user interface (e.g., the mouse or other controller of the computing device) to draw the boundaries of the desired trigger area upon the overhead images being viewed.
- Such an operation may follow standard cursor-based drawing metaphors in which a user constructs standard shapes including circles, rectangles, and closed multi-sided polygons by wielding a mouse or other cursor control interface.
- the user When finished drawing a desired trigger area, the user engages the user interface to link a mathematical representation of the boundary to the reminder database. For example, as shown in FIG. 8 , the user may wish to define a trigger area around a golf course that he or she visits. To do this, the user finds the golf course and views it from above using Google Earth. The user then engages the user interface described hereinabove to graphically draw the desired boundary region around the golf course (an exemplary graphical boundary region drawn by the user is shown as the dotted white line superimposed over the image of the golf course).
- the reminder circuitry supported by the computing device e.g., the computing device running the adapted version of Google Earth or equivalent
- the reminder circuitry supported by the computing device then mathematically represents the drawn boundary region based upon the corresponding coordinates of the geo-spatial areas that the drawn boundary lines pass over.
- the boundary region may thus, be mathematically converted into a set of coordinates and exported to the reminder database.
- the reminder circuitry described herein enables a user to engage the user interface of his or her computing device to quickly and intuitively define a trigger area in the real physical world (e.g., by drawing the trigger area upon geospatial image that corresponds with the desired location or establishment).
- all that is required as output from the modified Google Earth application is a set of geo-spatial coordinates that define the boundaries of the user-drawn trigger area.
- the output may be stored as simplified mathematical forms. For example, a trigger area drawn as a circle may be represented a set of center coordinate and a radius as described previously.
- a plurality of trigger areas may be defined in this way and relationally associated with a single personal reminder.
- the user may be alerted to the personal reminder upon the determination of a trigger event occurring with respect to any one of said plurality of trigger areas.
- a trigger area may also include an elevation and/or other height related parameter.
- a trigger area may be associated with a particular elevation or range of elevations. In this way, a trigger area may be defined, for example, that identifies a particular floor or range of floors in a high-rise building.
