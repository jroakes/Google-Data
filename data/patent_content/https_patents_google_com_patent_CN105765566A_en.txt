Mode engine 220 includes can be performed to determine software and/or the logic of the grammatical pattern of one or more news agregator by processor 202.In some embodiments, news agregator can be carried out pretreatment, determine the entity being previously mentioned by each document in news agregator and determine entity relevant information for each in those entities by the sentence of each document in news agregator carries out graph representation by mode engine 220.Mode engine 220 can also determine entity (such as, based on threshold value, probability, heuristic etc.) relevant in news agregator；Determine the grammatical pattern relating to the entity type being associated with those entities in news agregator；And subsequently by equivalent grammer pattern clustering together.Such as, mode engine 220 can be grouped together generating at title and/or using during knowledge graph management from identical news agregator and the pattern handled by identical entity sets.
In some embodiments, for one or more news agregator, mode engine 220 can determine that equivalent grammatical pattern generates at training/study as discussed further herein, title and/or uses during knowledge graph management.Such as, mode engine 220 can connect k entity (such as given news agregator identification, k >=1) equivalent grammatical pattern, wherein pattern expresses event described by this news agregator, and can be used title as discussed in further detail below and generate.Training engine 222, inference engine 224 and/or knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 are coupled to mode engine 220 to provide news agregator data and/or to receive grammatical pattern data (such as, the cluster of equivalent grammatical pattern).In some instances, the syntactic model that it generates can be stored in data storage 210 and be accessed for by other entity of itself or system 116 and/or retrieve by mode engine 220, and other entity above-mentioned such as includes training engine 222, inference engine 224 and/or knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22.
For the one or more document recognition modes from given news agregator, one or more parts of the document including metadata, document body, embedded content etc. can be processed by mode engine 220.In some embodiments, mode engine 220 can only consider first sentence of exercise question and document body.This can improve performance by the process of each news agregator is limited to mostly concerned (multiple) event that this set reports, and above-mentioned mostly concerned event is reported in the two content area of being everlasting.Such as, being different from exercise question, first sentence generally not widely uses pun or other rhetoric, because they trend towards meeting grammar rule and having informedness and be not intended to noticeable.It should be appreciated that in various embodiments, mode engine 220 is not limited to use exercise question and first sentence, and can utilize any content included in (multiple) document according to application and demand.
In some embodiments, pattern can from one or more news agregator N1,...,N|N|StorehouseIt is determined.Each news agregator N={niCan be the unordered set of related news, each of which news can be counted as the ordered sequence of sentence, for instance n=[s0... s|n|].During training, this storehouse can include some news agregator and generates at title to provide can be used and/or carry out the expanded set of the basic schema mated during knowledge graph management.
Mode engine 220 can use following algorithmCome the storehouse from one or more news agregatorAnd use the set of parameter Ψ of control model identification process to identify one or more clusters of equivalent grammatical pattern:
In above-mentioned COLLECTIONTOPATTERNS algorithm, each document included in each news agregator can be carried out pretreatment by subroutine PREPROCESSDATA.In some embodiments, this pretreatment can knowledge based figure (such as, knowledge Figure 124) and use the NLP streamline including hyphenation and sentence boundary detection, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, reference resolution and entity link to perform.In some instances, mode engine 220 can utilize list that unique tags, this entity be mentioned in the document every time and from the list of the class label for this entity of one or more knowledge graphs, each entity being previously mentioned in each document in set be carried out labelling.Such as, using knowledge graph data set, mode engine 220 can utilize the knowledge graph type (such as, tag along sort) being applied to each entity that this entity is annotated.As other example, for entity B arackObama (the 44th president of the U.S.), mode engine 220 can utilize Freebase class label that its entity is annotated, and this label is such as applied and included president US；Politician；Political appointments person；Member of American congress；Investigation entity；Etc..As a result, for each entity being previously mentioned in each document, unique identifier can be produced by pretreatment, mention list and class list of labels, they can be stored and/or high-speed cache is follow-up to quote and/or to process (such as, store 210 in data, memorizer 204 etc. among).
These data are processed each sentence in (multiple) document being also directed in each news agregator the data set representing sentence structure is provided, for instance project (1) as illustrated in fig. 7.In this example, three different entities being mentioned in sentence are identified, for instance e1、e2, and e3, and determined entity type (such as, class label) carries out labelling during being used in the pretreatment of each entity.Such as, in the knowledge graph list of type (class label), e1It is people, e2It is actress and famous person, and e3It is state and position.
It follows that GETRELEVANTENTITIES subroutine can collect the set (such as, be often based on threshold value the most and be mentioned be center (such as, position-based/place etc.) the most) of entity E relevant in each news agregator N.For the set of entity E, the set COMBINATIONS (E) of the entity that this algorithm such as can not repeat by generating the nonvoid subset with E subsequently determines that sole entity combines.The number of entity to be considered in each set and the largest amount of entity subset to be considered be built-in among first parameter.Target is that in the embodiment of the brief exercise question of generation (such as, below 10 words), this system can only consider the combination in E up to certain number (such as, 3) key element in some cases wherein.As other example, set COMBINATIONS (E) can describe the sole mode being described each entity E by the sentence in (multiple) news agregator.
It follows that this algorithm may determine that the node of the sentence mentioning related entities, determines the grammatical pattern mentioning this entity, when necessary this grammatical pattern converted and make them be correct in the syntax and will mention same kind of equivalent grammer pattern clustering together.These grammatical patterns being clustered can reflect the event relating to the type.Especially, for instance, subroutine EXTRACTPATTERNS is then able to for the related entities E from the document n in each news agregator NiEach subset and to event schemaProcess.
In some embodiments, EXTRACTPATTERNS (n, Ei) following algorithm can be used to process and return equivalent grammatical pattern from document nSet, it is illustrated as project (2-4) in the figure 7 to graphically:
In algorithm above, subroutine GETMENTIONNODES can use subroutine DEPPARSE to identify first against sentence s and mention EiIn the node M of entityiSet, its return dependency resolve T.If T does not comprise EiIn just once the mentioning of each target entity, then this sentence is left in the basket.Otherwise, subroutine GETMINIMUMSPANNINGTREE can for node set PiCalculate minimum spanning tree (MST).PiIt is able to the set of node at forming types about, and minimum spanning tree reflects connection MiIn all nodes dependency tree in shortest path, illustrated in the project (2) in Fig. 7.
It follows that this algorithm can use APPLYHEURISTICS subroutine to determine whether application heuritic approach.In some cases, system is for node set PiThe MST that can calculate is likely to be not intended that the syntax of original sentence s or useful deduction.Such as, the entity pairing < e described with project (2) in Fig. 71；e2> MST the good description of event is not provided because it is both insufficient also smooth.For this reason, this system can apply the set of the heuristic transformation of the post processing of the minimal set being provided with meaning node.This conversion may be provided that, the two occurs in the theme among the root of clause and the pattern extracted, and conjunction between entity being not dropped, shown in the project (3) in Fig. 7.
This algorithm uses the subroutine COMBINEENTITYTYPES will from node set P subsequentlyiEntity type be combined, this can according to for participate in entity eiEntity type assign every kind be likely to combination and generate different mode P, shown in the project (4) in Fig. 7.Pattern that what mode engine 220 generated include and/or entity relevant information are (such as, entity information including ID and class label, the cluster of the equivalent grammatical pattern of entity dependent event is described, etc.) data can be stored in data storage 210 or be provided to other assembly of system 116, other assembly of system 116 such as includes training engine 222, inference engine 224 and/or knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 so that using.
As further diagram, Fig. 9 is the graphical representation of the instance processes 900 of the cluster for generating equivalent grammatical pattern.In the figure, about the marriage between personality JillPopular and JoeCelebrity of two examples news article set 902 by mode engine 220 based on context (such as, they positions in article, the number of times that they are cited, entity is pointed to the hyperlink of other relevant information about those entities, the search data for those entities from search engine 118, etc.) carry out processing to generate the dependency list 904 the highlighting property together with described entity of the entity 912 discussed by described article, dependency, the quantization of centrality etc. (referred to simply as dependency) measures 910.Together with by the word together of these entity link in news agregator (such as, exercise question, first sentence, first paragraph etc.) use this dependency list 910, mode engine 220 can generate the set of equivalent grammatical pattern 906 of the main matter reflecting this news agregator together.For these patterns, how relevant mode engine 220 can quantify described pattern has to news agregator and lists the corresponding entity of described pattern.As a comparison, mode engine 220 is it may also be determined which pattern is less relevant/uncorrelated and can get rid of them based on relevance score.List of entities handled by mode engine 220, relevance score and/or express and can generate at the training further described as described elsewhere herein, title and/or be used during knowledge graph management.
Training engine 222 includes can be performed automatically to learn to comprise software and/or the logic of the equivalent grammatical pattern of corresponding information by processing multiple news agregator by processor 202.Corresponding information can include mentioning and the expression of same or similar context-sensitive identical entity (such as, event).By processing the set of relevant documentation (such as, about the news article of current event), training engine 222 may learn the alternative mode expressing identical entity type and/or event.This is advantageous for, because it allows training engine 222 to consider to use the various words of each content originator and/or synonym to describe identical entity type and/or event.In some embodiments, training engine 222 can use probabilistic model and automatically recognize additional stealth mode from by the cluster of the determined equivalent grammatical pattern of mode engine 220.This is advantageous for, because its permission automatically generates title from the pattern not being explicitly included in the news agregator therefrom deriving pattern.
Exemplarily unrestricted, by processing the one or more news agregator relating to physical culture and marriage, training engine 222 carries out cooperating with mode engine 220 and can learn to following grammatical pattern, and all of which all have expressed athlete and adds the similar events of team:
[athlete] adds [team] ([player] joins [sportsteam])
[team] signing [athlete] ([sportsteam] signs [player])
[athlete] completes to transfer from a team to another to [team] ([player] completesmoveto [sportsteam])
Or following pattern is entirely the equivalent expressions of wedding event:
[personage] and [personage] have a wedding ([person] wed [person])
[personage] marries ([person] hasmarried [person]) with [personage]
[personage] and [personage] conclude engagement ([person] tiedtheknotwith [person])
It should be appreciated that above non-limiting example depicts the format surface of pattern in some cases, and the attaching metadata being associated with described pattern of information including being associated can be generated with described pattern.Such as, this metadata can include the dependent data of the grammer between the word of description scheme (such as, designator, label etc.).In some embodiments, this metadata can be stored in data storage 210 as training 212 for subsequent reference, study etc..
Training engine 222 can be used in certain time frame (such as, on the same day, several days, one week, one month etc.) news issued of period and/or there is public vocabulary (such as, mentioning identical entity, entity type etc.) news for training.This can advantageously improve the document in given news agregator and wherein included express the probability being correlated with the identical entity described in this news and/or event, and therefore improves the accuracy of the title that inference engine 224 generates.
In some embodiments, training engine 222 carries out with mode engine 220 cooperating and can use Context similarity and entity described by the document in news agregator determines context, and based on Context similarity, entity is carried out automatic cluster.In some cases, if word, phrase and/or Chinese idiom are used interchangeably and/or have same or similar implication by expressing (such as, synonym, known variant etc.), then training engine 222 and/or mode engine 220 can calculate measuring of the similarity level between the context reflecting those expression, and can be grouped by those cited entities of expression based on those intensity measured (such as, if met predetermined similarity threshold).This advantageously allow for training engine 222 according to type (such as, all-star, divorcee, business unsuccessfully etc.) automatically entity is grouped.
In some instances, the predetermined corpus of news documents that training engine 222 can be used in organizing in news agregator initializes, to produce to cover the reliable basis of the equivalent grammatical pattern of most commonly seen/popular entity type and/or event, and once training data/model 212 has been generated and has been stored in data storage 210, it just can be used for generating title such as what describe in further detail here for news agregator by mode engine 220 and/or training engine 222.Such as, in some cases, a large amount of news agregator can be undertaken processing the significant cluster that can be produced reliable title reasoning with study by inference engine 224 by training engine 222.As other example, training corpus of documents handled by engine can include the news article that span is a year or (such as, 1-10+) for many years.
In some embodiments, training engine 222 can use the probabilistic model being referred to as Noisy-OR network to learn equivalent grammatical pattern, but in addition to that or alternatively, training engine 222 and/or inference engine 224 can use other model, have, including producing different expression of instruction two, those models measured that possibly be present among two news mutually of the same period (being likely to describe similar events) more.Such as, in some embodiments, training engine 222 can use implicit Di Li Cray distribution (LDA) that pattern is clustered.
Using in the embodiment of Noisy-Or Bayesian network wherein, training engine 222 enables to training and jointly appears as basis with grammatical pattern.Each pattern that mode engine 220 identifies can be added as viewed variable, and implicit variable can be used to represent the hiding event of generation mode.Additional noise variable can be trained to engine 222 and link to one or more terminal node, and this allows the terminal linked to be generated by language setting's (noise) rather than actual event.
As other example, the pattern that mode engine 220 identifies can be trained to engine 222 for by estimating that the probability of each (viewed) mode activation one or more (hiding) event learns Noisy-OR model.Fig. 8 depicts two exemplary horizontal: is in the hiding event variable at top, and is in the viewed pattern variable of bottom.In the figure, additional noise variance links to each terminal node, and this allows all terminals all to be generated by language setting's (noise) rather than actual event.Implicit association between event and viewed pattern can be modeled by Noisy-OR door.
In the model, given viewed patternHide event eiConditional probability be calculated as:
Wherein πiIt is set (that is, the π of life eventi=Uj{pj}|pj, and q=1)ij=P (ei=1 | pi=1) it is viewed pattern piCan individually activate the estimated probability of event e.Item qi0It is so-called this model " noise " item, and it is contemplated that viewed event eiThe fact that be likely to by some mode activations being never observed.
By mode engine 220 from identical news agregator N and entity subset EiHandled all patterns can beIn carry out being grouped (for example, with reference to above).In some cases, these packet expressions can be used to ROM BOOT model parameter θij=-log (1-qij) the coarse cluster of equal model of optimization.Training engine 222 can pass through to receive the cluster set (such as, 100000) randomly choosed and by repeatedly expecting that maximum (EM) iteration (such as, 40) optimizes the weight of this model and initiates training process.
Data that are handled to training engine 222, mode engine 220 etc. and/or that generate can be stored in data storage 210 as training data 212 and use for mode engine 220 and/or inference engine 224 by training engine 222, or directly can provide such data to these assemblies.
Inference engine 224 include can by processor 202 performed with based on the main matter reported by news agregator and/or (multiple) document for given news agregator or the software of (multiple) document structure tree title wherein comprised and/or logic.As non-limiting example, the input set comprising one or more document can be processed (such as equivalent grammatical pattern by inference engine 224, use mode engine 220), and those patterns are mated with the corresponding pattern learnt during training.The pattern of coupling, interference engine 224 is used to be then able to select to represent in the best way by inputting the pattern of the event that set reflects and by utilizing the corresponding central entity from news agregator to fill this pattern and generate title.Inference engine 224 can carry out coupling to interact to determine (multiple) grammatical pattern of input set with mode engine 220.
In some embodiments, using the pattern handled by mode engine 220, inference engine 224 can estimate the posterior probability hiding event variable.Therefore, from the hiding event being activated, it is possible to estimate the probability of each pattern, even if they are not present among set.The single pattern with maximum of probability can be chosen and be used to generate new title.Outlining, and directly in news agregator compared with viewed phrase, the pattern that retrieves is it is more likely that objective and informational.Using this probabilistic method, inference engine 224 can reliably estimate that event (such as, being represented as such as the set of the equivalent expressions described about training) is of paramount importance event in collection of document (such as, news agregator).
In some embodiments, inference engine 224 can by selecting expression/pattern of supporting the most in input document and input set (such as, news agregator before) for one or more documents generates given title.Such as, if some equivalent word method patterns and the patterns match of given set from one or more documents, then these couplings can be passed through the event that offer reflects by these patterns and are the more evidentiary support of the main matter that this set is reported and strengthen mutually.Such as, if in identical input set, [X marries with Y], [X and Y haves a wedding] and [X and Y marriage] can be mated by inference engine 224, then compared with other event less with occurrence number, inference engine 224 has more evidences that this is the main matter reported.
As other example, it is assumed that inference engine 224 will be inputted, from (multiple), pattern [X marries with Y], [X and Y haves a wedding] and [X and Y marriage] that the pattern match handled by document extremely learns by mode engine 220.It is associated in addition, it is assumed that these express the expression [X and Y concludes engagement] learnt equivalent with another.Then inference engine 224 can use expression [X and Y concludes engagement] to generate title, even if the text of the title generated can or can not yet so be presented among (multiple) input document.
In some embodiments, in order to generate the title capturing the main matter reported by the news agregator N of one or more documents, inference engine 224 can select the individual event pattern p* especially relevant with N and utilize the actual name of viewed entity in N to substitute the entity type/placeholder in p*.In order to identify p*, this system assume that the important condition that some subsets of the related entities E in the most illustrative event description realized by N wherein N are involved.
Inference engine 224 can carry out pattern included in the news agregator cooperating to determine one or more document with mode engine 220.Such as, given entity sets E and sentence n, inference engine 224 can utilize EXTRACTPATTERNS (n, E) algorithm to collect the pattern relating to those entities.The frequency of institute's recognition mode can be standardized and determine observed probability distribution to variable in network by inference engine 224 subsequently.In order to summarize across event, inference engine 224 can travel through across implicit event node and mode node.
In some embodiments, inference engine 224 can be used in determining that here referred to as the algorithm of INFERENCE (n, E) mostly concerned event sets is to include among title, and this algorithm can include following process.
Being fixed on the entity sets E being previously mentioned in news agregator, this system can consider each entity subsetThis subset can include any number of entity.In some embodiments, in order to efficiency can use the entity of relatively low number (such as, 3,4 etc.) to keep the title generated relatively brief, and the problem limiting Sparse.For each Ei, inference engine 224 is able to carry out INFERENCE (n, Ei), its calculating relates to EiIn entity pattern on distribution ωi。
It follows that inference engine 224 can reuse forIn all mode invocation INFERENCE of extracting of each subset.This calculates the distribution ω in all patterns of all admissible subsets of entity relating to being previously mentioned in this set.
It follows that inference engine 224 can select approximate better overall distribution ω*=argmaxiCos (ω, ωi) the distribution specific to entity.In some instances, inference engine 224 is it can be assumed that corresponding entity sets EiBe center the most in this set entity and therefore any title all should in conjunction with all of which, although other change is also possible.This system can select the pattern p* in ω * with highest weighting as the model catching the main matter reported in news agregator better, as below equation reflect:
It is to be understood, however, that other weighted value can also provide approximate reliably.
Inference engine 224 is then able to by utilizing the entity in the document therefrom extracting pattern to substitute placeholder and produce title from p*.Although in some cases, being enough to reliably determine that the correct entity order for giving title is (such as, for entity sets { e for inference engine 224 about the information of entity typea=" Mr.Brown "；eb=" LosAngeles " } " [personage] [place] marry "), but in other cases, be correctly ordered be probably ambiguous (such as, for { ea=" Mr.A "；eb=" Mr.B " } " [personage] kills [personage] ") and be difficult to infer.Inference engine 224 can pass through to make mode engine 220 for entity sets { ea；ebExtract pattern time follow the trail of entity alphabet sequence and tackle these situations, this can allow for inference engine 224 and produces correct sequence, although other ordering mechanism can also be used.Such as, from the news agregator killing " Mr. A " about " Mr. B ", mode engine 220 can based on ea=" Mr. A " < ebThe hypothesis of=" Mr. B " and produce the pattern including " [personage: 2] kills [personage: 1] " or " [personage: 1] is killed by [personage: 2] ", but be not limited to that this.Then, when making inferences, inference engine 224 can be inquired about the model with such pattern and only activate its appointment task and the compatible event of viewed entity.This is advantageous for, and replaces because it can carry out direct and unambiguous entity.
The title that it generates can be stored in data storage 210 by inference engine, or can provide other entity to the system 116 including news portal 125 and/or knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 by title.
Knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 includes can be performed to determine the main matter reported in news and to use software and/or the logic of this event update knowledge graph by processor 202.The news issued can be automatically processed by cooperating with other entity of system 116 and remain up-to-date by the content of knowledge graph by knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22.Such as, this technology can utilize title to generate engine 120 and/or its composition assembly to automatically determine updating and using this renewal that the corresponding entry in knowledge graph is modified about dependent event included in news.In some cases, the attribute being used for generating renewal can be provided back (multiple) document to provide credible and/or traceability for this renewal by knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22.
Exemplarily, when famous person's death, knowledge graph is likely to need to be updated and indicates this famous person present dead and dead date and place.As other example, if from news, system determines that someone just marries, then this system can update knowledge graph to change about whom is the information of from date of the spouse of this people and their marriage.Similarly, if news report has changed his/her work about a people or another company has been purchased by a company, then these are able to the association that is updated in knowledge graph.No matter it is via the blog assembled, social networks, microblogging, news network, the Internet portal, website, news briefing or other electronic information source any etc., anything being actually likely in news to mention is required for being changed for the content of knowledge base, including political event, famous person's event, sport event, pop culture event, financial events etc..
For each cluster by mode engine 220 and/or the training determined equal model of engine 222, knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 can utilize the renewal based on the match pattern found in the new document assembled and/or collection of document that entry corresponding in knowledge graph is updated/explains.In some embodiments, this note can be automatically performed (such as, by by pattern viewed in past news with match for the passing editor among knowledge graph) etc..In some embodiments, this system can automatically attempt to be associated the relation in the cluster of pattern and knowledge graph, and have and manually guard step, wherein these associations is artificially verified.Such as, knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 by providing about the information of viewed cluster for human user and/or can provide the suggestion which project should be updated for confirmation, human assistance to be used to human user.
For each viewed news issued or news agregator (passing news or in real time news), this system may determine which pattern is referred between entities, and use be trained to engine 222 be stored in data storage 210 in mapping to which relation finding in knowledge base should be updated.Such as, if knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 carries out collaborative process with title generation engine 120 contains the news agregator of the expression such as including [X and Y marriage], [X and Y haves a wedding] and [X and Y concludes engagement], and knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 can determine that X and Y has conjugal relation (they are spouses each other) in knowledge base, then knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 can learn to arrive automatically, when it is when seeing these three pattern future, the relation that will update in knowledge base is man and wife.Such as, if knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 processes the news documents that refer to [X and Y marriage], and can determine that this pattern is associated with the conjugal relation in knowledge base, then knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 can update this knowledge base and indicate the spouse that Y is the spouse of X and X is Y.
Search engine 118, title generation engine 120 and composition assembly, knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 and the additional structure of news portal 125, action and/or function are discussed further with by other place here.
Fig. 3 is the flow chart of the exemplary method 300 for automatically generating title.Method 300 can pass through from corpus of documents automatically learn the set of 302 equivalent grammatical patterns as.Such as, training engine 222 can be equal to grammatical pattern for the various themes that multiple news agregator are reported and/or event study, and is stored in data storage 210 to quote during title generates and/or to mate using those patterns as training data 212.
It follows that method 300 can receive the set (such as, the news agregator of news article) of 304 input documents.The set (such as, news agregator) of input document can include one or more document.Described document can include the e-file with any format and content (such as, text, figure, embedded media etc.).Such as, document can include the content from the webpage realizing the news article aggregated by search engine 118.When more than one document, described document can be relevant (such as, based on the content of the document, describes same or analogous event, entity, from the same or analogous time period, etc.).
It follows that method 300 can be expressed for (multiple) of one or more set of the equivalent grammatical pattern of coupling and the set of input document is carried out process 306.Such as, inference engine 224 carries out with mode engine 220 cooperating and may determine that set for inputting document is (such as, news agregator) the cluster of pattern, and the set of the equivalent grammatical pattern that those patterns learn with training engine 222 can compare to identify the pattern mated by inference engine 224.
Method 300 can select 308 grammatical patterns subsequently from (multiple) coupling set of the grammatical pattern for title.Selected pattern can be the pattern of the corresponding patterns match handled with the set from inputted document, or can be the equal model learnt by training engine 222.Selected pattern can describe the central event (news that such as, news agregator is reported) of inputted collection of document.It follows that method 300 can use selected grammatical pattern to generate 310 titles.Such as, inference engine 224 can utilize the corresponding entity carrying out processing from the set of inputted document to substitute the entity type in this grammatical pattern.
Fig. 4 is for based on carrying out, from the set of inputted document, the entity that processes and the flow chart of exemplary method 400 that equivalent grammatical pattern is clustered by event.Method 400 can pass through the set (such as, the news agregator of related news article) receiving 402 relevant documentations as starting.In some embodiments, the set of relevant documentation can reflect that to describe user current or will the corpus of news agregator of various different event of the associated information of reception interested.
For each set, method 400 may identify which that 404 are mentioned maximum entities (such as, entity the most frequently occurs), and may determine that one or more clusters of 406 grammatical patterns including being mentioned maximum entities and the event corresponding with those entities.Such as, training engine 222 carry out with mode engine 220 cooperating may determine that and optimize be respectively described one or more entity type and relate to this entity type event grammatical representation (such as, equivalent grammatical representation), and they are stored 408 in data storage 210.As other example, the different modes of given for collection of document description event can be inferred as the set of equivalent grammatical pattern by training engine 222, use when there is ample evidence probabilistic model to determine one or more additional corresponding synonym grammatical pattern, and carry out storing as set using them and quote during title generates for by inference engine 224.Method 400 can then determine whether 410 all documents are processed, and if they are processed, then and may be repeated, proceed to other operation or terminate.If processed but without to all set, then method 400 can be back to frame 404 and process next set.
Fig. 5 A is the flow chart of exemplary method 500 generating title for the set for news documents based on equivalent grammatical pattern.Method 500 can pass through the set receiving 502 documents as starting.Such as, the set of described document can be to being reported by the current event that search engine 118 is aggregated and should generate the title set with the related news article of objective characterisation current event for it.It follows that the expression from the document in this set can be carried out process 504 by method 400, the entity from described expression is carried out process 506, and by the one or more predetermined cluster of described expression matching 506 to equivalent grammatical pattern.Such as, assume that news agregator includes describing five sections of related news articles of particular event, inference engine 224 carries out cooperation and can set about the different expression of the wording of this event in the exercise question and/or text of described article be processed from mode engine 220, and by one or more clusters of described expression matching to the equivalent grammatical pattern describing this event.
Whether method 500 can be passed through to determine that when existing more than one 510 which coupling cluster are relevant (such as, mostly concerned), or determine when only existing one this coupling cluster relevant or enough relevant and proceed.Fig. 5 B depicts for making this kind of exemplary method 550 determined.At frame 552, method 550 can select 552 clusters to use from coupling cluster and determine whether the coupling evidence of 554 these clusters meets predetermined threshold.Such as, if meet the predetermined threshold of the equivalent grammatical pattern from selected cluster respectively from the expression formula that multiple (such as, 2,3,4 etc.) wording of collection of document process is different, then method 550 can continue to frame 556.This is advantageous for, because it can determine whether selected cluster describes the main matter reported by collection of document.If the threshold value in 554 is not satisfied, then method 550 can return frame 552 to select different cluster to use, it is possible to processes from the additional expression of document and repeats this matching sequence, it is possible to terminating, etc..
At frame 556, method 550 may determine that 556 events corresponding with selected cluster are describe the main matter of described collection of document, and it is later determined that whether 558 exist the hiding grammatical pattern that any description is applied to the hiding event of described collection of document, for instance other place here is as described about training module 222.
Return Fig. 5 A, method 500 can continue by selecting 512 to utilize it to generate the grammatical pattern of title from mostly concerned cluster, and can carry out to by utilizing the entity carrying out processing from the expression processed from collection of document to fill grammatical representation and generate 514 titles.
Fig. 6 is the flow chart of the exemplary method 600 for automatically updating knowledge graph based on the set of equivalent grammatical pattern.Method 600 can be equal to the cluster of grammatical pattern as beginning by the determination 602 that such as other place here is discussed in more detail.Method 600 subsequently can by the corresponding project in each compound mapping 604 to knowledge graph of pattern.Such as, this knowledge graph can as one man describe each project (such as, event) of the entity for sharing similarity.Such as, for the people described in knowledge graph, this knowledge graph can include for people being unique Information base set.Such as, this knowledge graph can include the information about the critical event occurred in someone one's remaining years.As other example, this knowledge base can include the birth of child, date and place of birth, sex etc..For dead, name and with the relation (if not he or she) of the dead, dead situation etc..For marriage, object that this people marries, the number of times of marriage before, details etc. about wedding.These projects can be mapped to the corresponding set/cluster of the equivalent grammatical pattern describing these events by knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22.
It follows that method 600 may determine that the set of 606 input documents, and discussed as described elsewhere herein, the set inputting document described in 608 is processed for mating the expression of the one or more set being equal to grammatical pattern.Method 600 can be passed through to select 610 grammatical patterns to continue from the coupling set of equivalent grammatical pattern subsequently, and selected pattern reflects the central event of input document.In some instances, selected pattern can be hiding synonym pattern described as described elsewhere herein.
Method 600 can carry out to determining one or more entries corresponding with (multiple) entity described from the expression handled by input document in 612 knowledge graphs, and can update 614 the one or more entry to use selected grammatical pattern to reflect this event.Such as, for marriage project (such as, relation), knowledge graph supervisor engine 1 22 can utilize the API exposed by knowledge Figure 124 to update the marriage section of the entry corresponding with two famous persons, to include formally marrying between engaged or two famous persons stated recently as reported by news (such as, about engaged or wedding news article set).
Fig. 7 is the exemplary method that depicted example pattern determines process.This pattern determines that process can include annotation dependency discussed as described elsewhere herein and resolve.In (1), process MST for entity pairing e1, e2.In (2), node is heuristically added into MST to implement the syntax in (3).In (4), reconfigure entity type to generate final pattern.
Fig. 8 depicts the probabilistic model of example.In the model, by Noisy-OR door, the association between implicit event variable and observed pattern variable is modeled.Discussed as described elsewhere herein, it is independent that event is assumed with bottom line, and when given event, described pattern is independent conditionally.
