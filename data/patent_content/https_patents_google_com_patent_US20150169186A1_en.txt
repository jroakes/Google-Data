As discussed in more detail below, content surfacing system 132 may generate a digital signature(s), such as a feature vector, for the objects in the digital images. Based on the digital signature, content surfacing system 132 may search one or more databases for objects that match the generated digital signature(s).
- a digital signature(s) such as a feature vector
- content surfacing system 132 searches digital image index 136 .
- digital image index 136 stores culled information on real-world objects, along with corresponding digital signatures and one or more potential relevant items of data, such as social networking posts, relevant items of data utilized by microblogging systems, image descriptions, image captions, links, related posts, etc.
- the relevant items of data include data obtained from posts of users of one or more social networking systems 150 , where the posts include digital images that contain real world objects that match one or more of the real world objects in the digital image being uploaded by photo sharing application 114 .
- content surfacing system 132 may locate duplicative relevant items of data for a given digital image. In one embodiment, content surfacing system 132 utilizes the received sensor data to filter the surfaced data results to a set of relevant items of data with greater relevance to a given digital image. In one embodiment, the received sensor data it utilized to filter located relevant items of data based on one or more of time, location, identity of people in a digital image, etc. For example, if a StarbucksTM storefront is recognized in a digital image being uploaded to a social network system 150 , content surfacing system 132 may utilize sensor data, such as global positioning sensor data received from a mobile device, to locate a particular StarbucksTM and determine a set of more precise items of data relevant to the particular StarbucksTM in the digital image.
- sensor data such as global positioning sensor data received from a mobile device
- content surfacing system 132 may locate relevant items of data based on the additional data. Thus, content surfacing system 132 could suggest a more relevant topic identifier associated with the image when the image is to be posted to a microblogging website, such as #SantaMonica_Starbucks, locate social networking or microblogging posts by other users that posted pictures of the Santa Monica StarbucksTM, obtain reviews of the particular StarbucksTM from a user generated restaurant review website, etc.
- a microblogging website such as #SantaMonica_Starbucks
- content surfacing system 132 transmits the located relevant items of data, as suggested relevant items of data, to content surfacing client 112 .
- content surfacing client 112 triggers a notification for display by a graphical user interface of photo sharing application 114 .
- the notification displays the suggested relevant items of data to a user of mobile device 110 prior to completion of the upload of the digital image to one or more of social networking systems 150 .

- content surfacing system 218 may transmit a lower resolution version of the digital image, or a digital signature generated for the digital image by content surfacing client 212 .
- the digital image, lower resolution version, digital signature, etc. is transmitted to image recognition engine 240 in order to pre-fetch relevant content associated with a digital image.
- image recognition engine 240 receives the digital image from content surfacing client 212 .
- image recognition engine 240 analyzes the digital image to generate one or more digital signatures for real-world objects within the digital image.
- image recognition engine 240 calculates a feature vector from pixels of the digital image, where values in the feature vector correspond to relevant pixels within the image. This feature vector then becomes a digital signature for each of the real-objects within the digital image.
- Image recognition engine 240 utilizes the digital signature to search a digital image index 236 .
- the digital image index 236 is illustrated as a component of the content surfacing system 232 , the digital image index 236 may be maintained at a remote system (not shown).
- image recognition engine 240 finds a match between the digital signature generated for the digital image, and a digital signature within digital image index 236 , image recognition engine 240 informs content surfacing manager 238 .
- content surfacing manager 238 utilizes the matched index for the digital image to obtain one or more relevant items of data associated with the matched digital image.
- content surfacing manager obtains relevant items of data that are associated with the matched image in digital image index 236 .
- the relevant items of data include social networking posts that include an image that contains the real world object, microblogging posts that include an image that contains the real world object, a photo feed that includes images that contain the real world object, one or more photos, feeds, or posts relevant to a location of the matched real world object, one or more photos, feeds, or posts relevant to a time when the digital image of the real world object was captured, etc.
- content surfacing manager 238 filters located relevant items of data to obtain the most relevant items of data for a given digital image.
- content surfacing manager 238 utilizes metadata associated with a digital image, such as GPS data, time data, a user's social networking friends, circles, and/or contacts, etc. to narrow the results.
- content surfacing manager 238 selects one or more relevant items of data based on the filtered image matching results, and transmits the relevant items of data to content surfacing solicitor 218 .
- Content surfacing solicitor 218 provides the received suggested relevant items of data as a notification to photo sharing application 216 that content, relevant to the digital image being uploaded, has been found.
- photo sharing application 216 activates a user interface element to unobtrusively notify a user that content relevant to the image being uploaded is available.

- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 300 for transparently and automatically surfacing relevant content during a photo sharing process.
- the method 300 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), firmware, or a combination.
- the method 300 is performed by a content surfacing client and a content surfacing system (e.g., content surfacing client 112 or 212 , and content surfacing system 132 or 232 ).
- processing logic begins by initiating a social networking digital image upload/sharing process (processing block 302 ).
- a mobile device such as a cellular telephone, tablet computer, wearable processing system, etc., captures the digital image with a camera of the mobile device.
- the digital image may be a still digital image, video, live video feed, etc.
- the real-world object may be any object such as landmarks (e.g., the Eiffel Tower), artwork, buildings, corporate logos, people, movie posters, physical locations, etc.
- Processing logic transmits the digital image to a content surfacing system (processing block 304 ).
- the digital image is transmitted to the content surfacing system in response to the image being selected for upload to a social networking system.
- processing logic transmits, transparently to a user of a photo sharing application, the digital image to a content surfacing system.
- additional data such as global positioning system data, a user's comments typed to the point of uploading the image, etc. may also be transmitted to the content surfacing system.
- relevant content may be surfaced automatically and transparently, without altering the typical digital image sharing/uploading flow for a social networking system.
- the user need not initiate the request for relevant content during the photo sharing process, the user's attention is not diverted from the digital image or the circumstances that prompted the user to share the digital image.
- the digital image is transmitted to the content surfacing system in response to the image being captured, so that relevant content may be surfaced for the digital image prior to the initiation of a social networking photo sharing process, consistent with the discussion herein.
- a reduced resolution version of the digital image, a digital signature generated from the digital image, etc. is transmitted to the content surfacing system by processing logic.
- processing logic then generates a digital signature for the real-world object(s) within the digital image (processing block 306 ).
- processing logic of the content surfacing client computes the image signature on a mobile device.
- the content surfacing client transmits the image signature, and not the corresponding image, to the content surfacing system. Transmission of the digital signature, and not the image itself, consumes less bandwidth when transmitted, and thus can be uploaded faster by the content surfacing system.
- an intermediate form of the image such as a low resolution preview, could also be transmitted instead of, or with, a digital signature.
- both the content surfacing client and the content surfacing system generate digital signatures for the real-world object.
- the digital signature is a feature vector generated from the digital image of the real-world object and provides a unique identification of the real-world object.
- Processing logic utilizes the digital signature(s) to search an index of digital images (processing block 308 ).
- processing logic searches for relevant items of data associated with the image of the indexed real-world object (processing block 310 ).
- processing logic may search a database of social networking posts, microblogging posts, digital image feeds, etc. that contain digital images with the matched digital signature (i.e., relevant items of data from one or more social networking systems that include an image with a real world object that is also within the digital image selected to be uploaded to a social networking system).
- processing logic advances to processing block 312 to filter located relevant content based on one or more criteria (processing block 312 ).
- the one or more criteria include utilizing sensor data associated with a digital image as measures of relevancy to relevant items of data.
- GPS data may be utilized to narrow relevant items of data by location
- time data may be utilized to narrow relevant items of data by recent trends, common temporal usage.
- social networking data may be utilized to filter located relevant content, such as filtering for posts from members in a social networking circle, posts from social networking friends, posts linked to a user via a professional affiliation network, etc.
- processing logic Based on results of the search for relevant content and filtering, processing logic transmits one or more suggested items of relevant content to content surfacing client (processing block 314 ).
- processing logic displays a notification that relevant content has been found in a graphical user interface of a photo sharing application (processing block 316 ).
- the notification is rendered in an unobtrusive fashion, such as a clickable icon, slideable summary of results bar, etc. that occupies a small portion of the photo sharing application's graphical user interface.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 400 a content surfacing client processing surfaced content while images are being uploaded to a social networking system.
- the method 400 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), firmware, or a combination.
- the method 400 is performed by a content surfacing system (e.g., content surfacing system 132 or 232 ).
- processing logic begins by detecting the initiation of digital image upload to a social networking system (processing block 402 ).
- a digital image, video, or video feed is captured by a mobile device.
- processing logic may detect that an image has been selected for upload to a social networking system, or that the digital image upload has been initiated.
- Processing logic transmits digital image data to a content surfacing system (processing block 404 ).
- the digital image data may include the digital image itself, a low resolution version of the image, one or more digital signatures computed from the digital image, etc.
- the digital image data may also include additional data, such as global positioning system data, a user's comments typed to the point of uploading the image, etc.
- the additional data is transmitted with the digital image as image metadata.
- the additional data is transmitted to the content surfacing system separately from the digital image data.
- Processing logic then receives surfaced relevant content from a content surfacing system (processing block 404 ).
- the received content may include one or more items of data, such as social networking posts, microblogging entries, digital image captions, links to digital image feeds, etc. that are relevant to the digital image being uploaded to the social networking system.
- the items of data are relevant to the digital image being uploaded to the social networking system because the items of data each contain images with a real world object that is also within the digital image.
- each of the relevant items of data may be related to the digital image in another way, such as proximity to a real world location where an image was captured, when an image was captured, who captured the related image (i.e., social networking friends), etc.
- Processing logic determines whether any relevant content items have been surfaced by the content surfacing system (processing block 406 ). That is, in one embodiment, processing logic may receive a notification that no relevant content items were found by a content surfacing system. In this case, processing logic would proceed to processing block 416 to complete the upload of the digital image to a social networking system. Since notifications are not displayed to a user when relevant content cannot be located, a user's attention is not diverted during the image upload process. However, when processing logic receives one or more items of relevant data, such as relevant surfaced content items, processing logic proceeds to processing block 408 .
- Processing logic displays a first representation indicative of one or more items of surfaced content in a photo sharing graphical user interface (processing block 408 ).
- the first representation may be a notification displayed in the graphical user interface in an unobtrusive way.

Abstract
A method and apparatus for surfacing content during a photo sharing process is described. The method may include detecting the initiation of a social networking photo sharing process for a digital image. The method may also include transmitting digital image data corresponding to the digital image to a content surfacing server to locate content relevant to the digital image. The method may also include receiving one or more items of data relevant to the digital image from the content surfacing server. Furthermore, the method may include presenting a notification, before the digital image is uploaded to a social networking system by the social networking photo sharing process, to a user to indicate that content relevant to the digital image has been received.
Description
- Embodiments of the invention relate to the field of digital image processing, and more particularly, to enable the discovery of information relevant to a digital image during an image sharing process.
- The Internet provides a vast amount of knowledge about people, places, and things. The information available on the Internet was made more personal and socially interactive with the advent of social networking. With social networking, users are able to share chat sessions with each other, post comments to each other, share pictures, etc. When a user shares a picture on a social networking system, such as by posting the picture to a feed, the user must first take a picture, and then at a later time upload the picture to the feed. The user may further comment on the picture when uploading it to the social networking system. However, the user must operate different interfaces to create a post, and share a picture. As a result, the user's focus and attention must shift between different interfaces during the photo sharing process.
- A method and apparatus for surfacing content during a photo sharing process is described. According to an exemplary method, the initiation of a social networking photo sharing process for a digital image is detected. Digital image data corresponding to the digital image are transmitted to a content surfacing server so that content relevant to the digital image may be located. One or more items of data relevant to the digital image are received from the content surfacing server. A notification is then presented, before the digital image is uploaded to the social networking system by the social networking photo sharing process, to a user to indicate that content relevant to the digital image has been received.
- The present invention will be understood more fully from the detailed description given below and from the accompanying drawings of various embodiments of the invention, which, however, should not be taken to limit the invention to the specific embodiments, but are for explanation and understanding only.

It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.
- Some portions of the detailed description that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.
- It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as “detecting”, “transmitting”, “receiving”, “presenting”, “displaying”, “adding”, or the like, refer to the actions and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
- The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.
- The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram ofexemplary system architecture 100 for surfacing relevant content during image sharing. In one embodiment, thesystem 100 includesmobile device 110, acontent surfacing server 130, and one or moresocial networking systems 150. In one embodiment,mobile device 110 may be a mobile computing device, such as a mobile telephone, personal digital assistant, tablet computer, wearable computing device, etc. The content surfacingserver 130 andsocial networking systems 150 may also be computing devices, such as server computers, desktop computers, etc. - The
mobile device 110,content surfacing server 130, andsocial networking systems 150 may be coupled to anetwork 102 that communicates any of the standard protocols for the exchange of information. In one embodiment,mobile device 110 is coupled withnetwork 102 via a wireless connection, such as a cellular telephone connection, wireless fidelity connection, etc. Themobile device 110,content surfacing server 130, andsocial networking systems 150 may run on one Local Area Network (LAN) and may be incorporated into the same physical or logical system, or different physical or logical systems. Alternatively, themobile device 110,content surfacing server 130, andsocial networking systems 150 may reside on different LANs, wide area networks, cellular telephone networks, etc. that may be coupled together via the Internet but separated by firewalls, routers, and/or other network devices. In yet another configuration, thecontent surfacing server 130 may reside on the same server, or different servers, coupled to other devices via a public network (e.g., the Internet) or a private network (e.g., LAN). It should be noted that various other network configurations can be used including, for example, hosted configurations, distributed configurations, centralized configurations, etc. - The
mobile device 110 is responsible for capturing digital images of real-world objects with a digital camera (not shown) of the mobile device. A real-world object may be a person, place, thing, or activity. In one embodiment, the digital images of the real-world objects may include still photographs, digital video, a sequence of digital photographs, a live video feed, etc. In one embodiment, aftermobile device 110 captures a digital image,mobile device 110 may upload the digital image to a remote system for storage, for inclusion in a social networking system post, for inclusion in a web log, etc. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, the discussion will describe uploading digital images to one or more social networking systems, such associal networking systems 150, although digital images may be uploaded or otherwise transferred to other types of systems, and relevant content surfaced, consistent with the discussion herein. - In one embodiment, when
mobile device 110 initiates the upload process for a digital image to one or more ofsocial networking systems 150,content surfacing client 112 obtains one or more items of relevant content associated with the digital image fromcontent surfacing server 130. In one embodiment,content surfacing client 112 is part ofphoto sharing application 114 supported by one of thesocial networking systems 150. In another embodiment,content surfacing client 112 is a separate application that interfaces withphoto sharing application 114 during a photo sharing process. - As will be discussed in greater detail below, as digital images are uploaded by
photo sharing application 114 to one or moresocial networking systems 150 as part of a normal photo sharing process,content surfacing client 112 transparently and automatically obtains relevant content for the digital images being uploaded before completion of the image upload process. In one embodiment, the relevant content is obtained prior to completion of the digital image uploads, so that a user may include the relevant items of data as data associated with the uploaded digital images. Furthermore,content surfacing client 112 unobtrusively presents the data to the user via a graphical user interface generated byphoto sharing application 114, so that notifications for surfaced content and the presentation of the relevant surfaced content data items does not obscure elements of the photo sharing user interface. In one embodiment, the relevant content includes items of data, such as microblogging system entries, social networking posts, digital image feeds, etc. obtained from one or more social networking systems, which are relevant to real world objects within the digital image being uploaded. In one embodiment, the items of data are relevant when the item of data includes a digital image with the same real world object contained within the digital image being uploaded bymobile device 110. - In one embodiment, content surfacing system 132 of
content surfacing server 130 enables the automatic suggestion of relevant items of data associated with digital images during the upload process. In one embodiment, whenphoto sharing application 114 ofmobile device 110 begins the uploading process of a digital image to one or more ofsocial networking systems 150,content surfacing client 112 transmits the digital image to content surfacing system 132. In one embodiment,content surfacing client 112 may transmit a low resolution version of the digital image, or a digital signature generated from the image, to the content surfacing system 132 instead of the digital image itself. In one embodiment,content surfacing client 112 may further includes sensor data, such as global positioning system data, time, text to accompany a social networking post, etc., with the digital image. - In one embodiment, when content surfacing system 132 receives the digital image, content surfacing system 132 performs one or more image recognition processes on the digital image to identify one or more real world objects within the digital image. As discussed in more detail below, content surfacing system 132 may generate a digital signature(s), such as a feature vector, for the objects in the digital images. Based on the digital signature, content surfacing system 132 may search one or more databases for objects that match the generated digital signature(s).
- In one embodiment, content surfacing system 132 searches
digital image index 136. In one embodiment,digital image index 136 stores culled information on real-world objects, along with corresponding digital signatures and one or more potential relevant items of data, such as social networking posts, relevant items of data utilized by microblogging systems, image descriptions, image captions, links, related posts, etc. In one embodiment, the relevant items of data include data obtained from posts of users of one or moresocial networking systems 150, where the posts include digital images that contain real world objects that match one or more of the real world objects in the digital image being uploaded byphoto sharing application 114. - In one embodiment, content surfacing system 132 may locate duplicative relevant items of data for a given digital image. In one embodiment, content surfacing system 132 utilizes the received sensor data to filter the surfaced data results to a set of relevant items of data with greater relevance to a given digital image. In one embodiment, the received sensor data it utilized to filter located relevant items of data based on one or more of time, location, identity of people in a digital image, etc. For example, if a Starbucks™ storefront is recognized in a digital image being uploaded to a
social network system 150, content surfacing system 132 may utilize sensor data, such as global positioning sensor data received from a mobile device, to locate a particular Starbucks™ and determine a set of more precise items of data relevant to the particular Starbucks™ in the digital image. If content surfacing system 132 determines that the digital image was taken in Santa Monica, content surfacing system 132 may locate relevant items of data based on the additional data. Thus, content surfacing system 132 could suggest a more relevant topic identifier associated with the image when the image is to be posted to a microblogging website, such as #SantaMonica_Starbucks, locate social networking or microblogging posts by other users that posted pictures of the Santa Monica Starbucks™, obtain reviews of the particular Starbucks™ from a user generated restaurant review website, etc. - In one embodiment, based on results of the image recognition and relevant data searches, content surfacing system 132 transmits the located relevant items of data, as suggested relevant items of data, to content surfacing
client 112. In one embodiment,content surfacing client 112 triggers a notification for display by a graphical user interface ofphoto sharing application 114. In one embodiment, the notification displays the suggested relevant items of data to a user ofmobile device 110 prior to completion of the upload of the digital image to one or more ofsocial networking systems 150. In one embodiment, the graphical user interface ofphoto sharing application 114 displays the received relevant items of data in an unobtrusive way within the photo sharing graphical user interface while the digital images are being uploaded to one of thesocial networking systems 150. In one embodiment,content surfacing client 112 activates a clickable icon, a summary of results bar, etc. within the photo sharing graphical user interface to indicate to a user ofmobile device 110 that relevant content has been found. - In one embodiment,
content surfacing client 112 enables users, via the graphical user interface generated byphoto sharing application 114, to explore the relevant items of data, such as by clicking on icons, sliding a summary of results bar left or right, etc. In one embodiment, whencontent surfacing client 112 receives an icon click or a summary of results bar slide request,content surfacing client 112 transmits a request to content surfacing system 132 for additional details for selected items of data, or for additional items of data. In one embodiment, the clickable icons and the summary of results bar, displayed in the graphical user interface generated byphoto sharing application 114, occupy a small portion of a display ofmobile device 110, leaving the remaining portion of the display available for the typical flow of the photo sharing process and without obscuring the elements of the photo sharing application's graphical user interface. - In one embodiment,
photo sharing application 114 receives user selection of one or more suggested relevant items of data, and may additionally or alternatively receive one or more user-created relevant items of data. In one embodiment,photo sharing application 114 provides the user-selected and/or user-created relevant items of data tosocial networking system 150 when the digital image is uploaded to thesocial networking system 150. In one embodiment, the relevant items of data are embedded in metadata for the digital image, included in a description of the digital image, utilized in the title for the digital image, included in the text or title of a post that accompanies the digital image, included in the text of a post, etc. - In one embodiment, the automatically surfaced relevant items of data may be located, presented, and selected by a user during the photo upload process to a
social networking system 150. Furthermore, because the existence of data relevant to a digital image is presented to a user in an unobtrusive way, and in line with a typical photo sharing flow, the user's attention is not diverted away from the social networking aspects of the photo sharing process. Furthermore, at the moment the user is sharing a digital image on a social networking system, the user's attention is directly focused on the contents of the digital image, the circumstances that prompted the user to share the digital image, and the subject matter of the digital image. In one embodiment, information that is relevant to the subject matter (e.g. others' comments, photos, social networking or microblogging topic identifiers, etc. from social networking systems) is often of interest to the user, and can also influence the user's own comments during the photo sharing process. The user is thus able to make a more relevant selection of data, or is able to create more relevant user-generated data, to be included with the digital image when uploaded to a social networking system, by viewing and selecting other user's comments, other user's posts, other user's microblogging topic identifiers, etc. without diverting the user's attention away from the photo sharing process. Furthermore, when the images are associated with social networking or microblogging topic posts, the relevant content surfacing discussed herein presents the user with relevant and current topic identifiers. As a result, the user is enabled to select relevant social networking or microblogging topic identifiers that can be used to disseminate a post that includes the digital image with an appropriate topic identifier for better discovery by other users. - Although the discussion herein describes a
content surfacing client 112 for use by amobile device 110, in another embodiment consistent with the discussion herein, a content surfacing client may be utilized by a home computing system, such as a desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, etc. In this embodiment,mobile device 110 would transmit digital images to the home computing system for storage. Then, when digital images are uploaded tosocial networking systems 150 via the home computing system, either automatically by a photo sharing application of the home computer system or in response to a user request to upload the digital images, a content surfacing client of the home computing system would transmit digital image data, obtain notifications and relevant items of data, and present the notification and relevant items of data to a user in line with a photo sharing process at the home computing system, as discussed herein. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of oneembodiment 200 ofcontent surfacing client 212,content surfacing system 232, andsocial networking system 250.Content surfacing client 212 andcontent surfacing system 232 provide additional details for thecontent surfacing client 112 and content surfacing system 132 discussed above inFIG. 1 . Furthermore, although certain functions are described herein as occurring at thecontent surfacing client 112 or the content surfacing system 132, those functions can be shifted betweenclient 112 and system 132 consistent with the discussion herein. - In one embodiment,
content surfacing client 212 may include animage capture module 214, aphoto sharing application 216, acontent surfacing solicitor 218, adisplay 226, and a global positioning system (GPS)module 220. In one embodiment,content surfacing system 232 may include animage recognition engine 240, acontent surfacing manager 238, and adigital image index 236. In one embodiment, thecontent surfacing client 212 andcontent surfacing system 232 communicate with each other over various networks and network configurations as discussed above inFIG. 1 . - In the
content surfacing client 212,image capture module 214 is responsible for capturing digital images of real world objects. The digital images may include still digital photographs, a series of still digital photographs, a recorded video, a live video feed, etc. In one embodiment,image capture module 214 is a digital camera of a mobile device. In one embodiment, captured digital images are stored in a memory of a mobile device (not shown) coupled withcontent surfacing client 212. In one embodiment, sensor data, such as GPS data generated byGPS module 220, time data, etc. are stored as metadata of the digital image, or otherwise associated with the digital image. - In one embodiment,
photo sharing application 216 generates a graphical user interface ondisplay 226 that may include user interface elements for selecting digital images for upload tosocial networking system 250, entering social networking post comments, entering user-created relevant items of data, entering web links, etc. In one embodiment, whenphoto sharing application 216 receives user selection of a digital image to upload tosocial networking system 250, indicating that a user has initiated a social networking photo sharing process for the digital image,content surfacing solicitor 218 transmits the selected digital image to image recognition engine ofcontent surfacing system 232. As discussed above, instead of transmitting the original digital image,content surfacing system 218 may transmit a lower resolution version of the digital image, or a digital signature generated for the digital image bycontent surfacing client 212. In an alternative embodiment, in response to an image being captured byimage capture module 214, and prior to initiation of the photo sharing application, the digital image, lower resolution version, digital signature, etc. is transmitted to imagerecognition engine 240 in order to pre-fetch relevant content associated with a digital image. - In one embodiment,
image recognition engine 240 receives the digital image fromcontent surfacing client 212. In one embodiment,image recognition engine 240 analyzes the digital image to generate one or more digital signatures for real-world objects within the digital image. As is discussed below, in one embodiment,image recognition engine 240 calculates a feature vector from pixels of the digital image, where values in the feature vector correspond to relevant pixels within the image. This feature vector then becomes a digital signature for each of the real-objects within the digital image. -
Image recognition engine 240 utilizes the digital signature to search adigital image index 236. Although thedigital image index 236 is illustrated as a component of thecontent surfacing system 232, thedigital image index 236 may be maintained at a remote system (not shown). Whenimage recognition engine 240 finds a match between the digital signature generated for the digital image, and a digital signature withindigital image index 236,image recognition engine 240 informscontent surfacing manager 238. - In one embodiment,
content surfacing manager 238 utilizes the matched index for the digital image to obtain one or more relevant items of data associated with the matched digital image. In one embodiment, content surfacing manager obtains relevant items of data that are associated with the matched image indigital image index 236. In one embodiment, the relevant items of data include social networking posts that include an image that contains the real world object, microblogging posts that include an image that contains the real world object, a photo feed that includes images that contain the real world object, one or more photos, feeds, or posts relevant to a location of the matched real world object, one or more photos, feeds, or posts relevant to a time when the digital image of the real world object was captured, etc. - In one embodiment,
content surfacing manager 238 filters located relevant items of data to obtain the most relevant items of data for a given digital image. In one embodiment,content surfacing manager 238 utilizes metadata associated with a digital image, such as GPS data, time data, a user's social networking friends, circles, and/or contacts, etc. to narrow the results. In one embodiment,content surfacing manager 238 selects one or more relevant items of data based on the filtered image matching results, and transmits the relevant items of data to content surfacingsolicitor 218.Content surfacing solicitor 218 provides the received suggested relevant items of data as a notification tophoto sharing application 216 that content, relevant to the digital image being uploaded, has been found. - In one embodiment, in response to receipt of the suggested relevant items of data,
photo sharing application 216 activates a user interface element to unobtrusively notify a user that content relevant to the image being uploaded is available. As discussed herein, the notification is unobtrusive because it does not obscure existing elements of the photo sharing application interface. In one embodiment, the notification may be presented as a clickable icon added to the graphical user interface, a clickable icon modified within the graphical user interface, a summary of results bar displayed in area of the graphical user interface that does not already contain user interface elements, etc. Furthermore, in one embodiment the notification is configured such that it occupies a small portion of a photo sharing graphical user interface. - In one embodiment, display of the suggested relevant items of data enables a user to select which suggested relevant items of data are to be associated with a digital image when posted to
social networking system 250. Furthermore, display of the suggested relevant items of data enables a user to review and request additional relevant items of data. In one embodiment,photo sharing application 216 completes the upload of the digital image, along with one or more selected and/or user-created relevant items of data, tosocial networking system 250. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of amethod 300 for transparently and automatically surfacing relevant content during a photo sharing process. Themethod 300 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), firmware, or a combination. In one embodiment, themethod 300 is performed by a content surfacing client and a content surfacing system (e.g.,content surfacing client - Referring to
FIG. 3 , processing logic begins by initiating a social networking digital image upload/sharing process (processing block 302). In one embodiment, a mobile device, such as a cellular telephone, tablet computer, wearable processing system, etc., captures the digital image with a camera of the mobile device. The digital image may be a still digital image, video, live video feed, etc. In one embodiment, the real-world object may be any object such as landmarks (e.g., the Eiffel Tower), artwork, buildings, corporate logos, people, movie posters, physical locations, etc. - Processing logic transmits the digital image to a content surfacing system (processing block 304). In one embodiment, the digital image is transmitted to the content surfacing system in response to the image being selected for upload to a social networking system. In one embodiment, processing logic transmits, transparently to a user of a photo sharing application, the digital image to a content surfacing system. In one embodiment, additional data, such as global positioning system data, a user's comments typed to the point of uploading the image, etc. may also be transmitted to the content surfacing system. Thus, in one embodiment, relevant content may be surfaced automatically and transparently, without altering the typical digital image sharing/uploading flow for a social networking system. Furthermore, because the user need not initiate the request for relevant content during the photo sharing process, the user's attention is not diverted from the digital image or the circumstances that prompted the user to share the digital image.
- In another embodiment, the digital image is transmitted to the content surfacing system in response to the image being captured, so that relevant content may be surfaced for the digital image prior to the initiation of a social networking photo sharing process, consistent with the discussion herein. Furthermore, instead of the captured digital image being transmitted to the content surfacing system, in some embodiments, a reduced resolution version of the digital image, a digital signature generated from the digital image, etc. is transmitted to the content surfacing system by processing logic.
- In one embodiment, processing logic then generates a digital signature for the real-world object(s) within the digital image (processing block 306). In one embodiment, processing logic of the content surfacing client computes the image signature on a mobile device. In this embodiment, the content surfacing client transmits the image signature, and not the corresponding image, to the content surfacing system. Transmission of the digital signature, and not the image itself, consumes less bandwidth when transmitted, and thus can be uploaded faster by the content surfacing system. In one embodiment, an intermediate form of the image, such as a low resolution preview, could also be transmitted instead of, or with, a digital signature. In yet another embodiment, both the content surfacing client and the content surfacing system generate digital signatures for the real-world object. In the embodiments discussed above, the digital signature is a feature vector generated from the digital image of the real-world object and provides a unique identification of the real-world object.
- Processing logic utilizes the digital signature(s) to search an index of digital images (processing block 308). When a match is found in the digital image index, processing logic searches for relevant items of data associated with the image of the indexed real-world object (processing block 310). In one embodiment, processing logic may search a database of social networking posts, microblogging posts, digital image feeds, etc. that contain digital images with the matched digital signature (i.e., relevant items of data from one or more social networking systems that include an image with a real world object that is also within the digital image selected to be uploaded to a social networking system).
- When a match is not found at
processing block 308, the process ends. In one embodiment, when no relevant content items are found, a user is not presented with a notification icon, summary of results bar, etc. Thus, the user is not presented with an irrelevant notification that no results were found. - In one embodiment, after the content has been obtained at
processing block 310, processing logic advances to processing block 312 to filter located relevant content based on one or more criteria (processing block 312). In one embodiment, the one or more criteria include utilizing sensor data associated with a digital image as measures of relevancy to relevant items of data. In one embodiment, GPS data may be utilized to narrow relevant items of data by location, time data may be utilized to narrow relevant items of data by recent trends, common temporal usage. In one embodiment, social networking data may be utilized to filter located relevant content, such as filtering for posts from members in a social networking circle, posts from social networking friends, posts linked to a user via a professional affiliation network, etc. - Based on results of the search for relevant content and filtering, processing logic transmits one or more suggested items of relevant content to content surfacing client (processing block 314). Processing logic displays a notification that relevant content has been found in a graphical user interface of a photo sharing application (processing block 316). In one embodiment, the notification is rendered in an unobtrusive fashion, such as a clickable icon, slideable summary of results bar, etc. that occupies a small portion of the photo sharing application's graphical user interface.

FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method 400 a content surfacing client processing surfaced content while images are being uploaded to a social networking system. Themethod 400 is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), firmware, or a combination. In one embodiment, themethod 400 is performed by a content surfacing system (e.g., content surfacing system 132 or 232). - Referring to
FIG. 4 , processing logic begins by detecting the initiation of digital image upload to a social networking system (processing block 402). As discussed above, a digital image, video, or video feed is captured by a mobile device. In one embodiment, processing logic may detect that an image has been selected for upload to a social networking system, or that the digital image upload has been initiated. - Processing logic transmits digital image data to a content surfacing system (processing block 404). As discussed above, the digital image data may include the digital image itself, a low resolution version of the image, one or more digital signatures computed from the digital image, etc. Furthermore, the digital image data may also include additional data, such as global positioning system data, a user's comments typed to the point of uploading the image, etc. In one embodiment, the additional data is transmitted with the digital image as image metadata. In another embodiment, the additional data is transmitted to the content surfacing system separately from the digital image data.
- Processing logic then receives surfaced relevant content from a content surfacing system (processing block 404). In one embodiment, the received content may include one or more items of data, such as social networking posts, microblogging entries, digital image captions, links to digital image feeds, etc. that are relevant to the digital image being uploaded to the social networking system. Furthermore, the items of data are relevant to the digital image being uploaded to the social networking system because the items of data each contain images with a real world object that is also within the digital image. Furthermore, each of the relevant items of data may be related to the digital image in another way, such as proximity to a real world location where an image was captured, when an image was captured, who captured the related image (i.e., social networking friends), etc.
- Processing logic determines whether any relevant content items have been surfaced by the content surfacing system (processing block 406). That is, in one embodiment, processing logic may receive a notification that no relevant content items were found by a content surfacing system. In this case, processing logic would proceed to processing block 416 to complete the upload of the digital image to a social networking system. Since notifications are not displayed to a user when relevant content cannot be located, a user's attention is not diverted during the image upload process. However, when processing logic receives one or more items of relevant data, such as relevant surfaced content items, processing logic proceeds to
processing block 408. - Processing logic displays a first representation indicative of one or more items of surfaced content in a photo sharing graphical user interface (processing block 408). In one embodiment, the first representation may be a notification displayed in the graphical user interface in an unobtrusive way. For example, the notification may be displayed in a clickable icon, an existing icon may be modified and rendered, a summary of results bar may be added to the graphical user interface, etc. In one embodiment, the notification is displayed in an unobtrusive way within the photo sharing graphical user interface, such as by occupying a relatively small portion of the photo sharing graphical user interface and/or occupying a previously unused portion of the graphical user interface. In one embodiment, the rendering of an unobtrusive notification ensures that the notification does not distract the user's attention from the photo sharing and uploading process, while still providing the user a notification that content relevant to the image has been found.
- Processing logic receives a request from a user for a more detailed view of the one or more items of content (processing block 410). In one embodiment, the request may be receipt of a user's selection of a clickable icon. In one embodiment, the request may be receipt of a user's scrolling of a summary of results bar left or right. In either case, processing logic displays a second representation of the one or more items of surfaced content in the photo sharing graphical user interface (processing block 412). In one embodiment, the second representation may display additional details for surfaced content, such as transforming a clickable icon into a detailed summary of results. In another embodiment, the second representation may display additional items of content, such as when a user slides a summary of results bar left or right.
- Processing logic receives a user selection of one or more items of surfaced content (processing block 414), and completes the digital image upload with the selected items of content (processing block 416). In one embodiment, the selected items of content are to accompany the digital image on a social networking web site. In embodiments discussed herein, the selected items of content may serve as, or supplement user created, microblogging topic identifiers associated with the digital image, microblogging posts about or that contain the digital image, social networking posts about or that contain the digital image, a caption for a digital image, links associated with the digital image, etc.
