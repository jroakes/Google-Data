Definitions
- the invention relates generally to waveguides including bends, more especially but not exclusively to optical waveguides, such as planar waveguides, and to optical devices incorporating waveguides with bends.
- Planar waveguides are used extensively in optical communications for optical switching, multiplexing and demultiplexing. Many basic optical components and devices, such as modulators, couplers and splitters, incorporate waveguide bends. Moreover, to achieve high density of integration of optical devices on a single chip or substrate, it is often necessary to interconnect the devices with waveguide bends. The size and insertion loss of the waveguide bends ultimately determine the maximum density of devices that can be integrated into an optical circuit of finite size.
- FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows a prior art structure as envisaged by Kitoh et. al. [2] comprising a curved waveguide 10 with a constant radius of curvature ‘r’ coupled to a straight waveguide 20 .
- the centre line 14 of the curved waveguide 10 is laterally offset by a distance ‘d’ from the centre line 16 of the straight waveguide 20 , with the offset being towards the centre of curvature of the curved waveguide 10 .
- FIG. 2 of the accompanying drawings shows an S-shaped waveguide described by Kitoh et. al. [2] which may be considered as a combination of two of the elements shown in FIG. 1 .
- the S-shaped waveguide comprises an input waveguide 24 and an output waveguide 26 that extends parallel to and laterally displaced from the input waveguide 24 .
- the input waveguide 24 is coupled to a first curved waveguide section 28 which is laterally offset from the input waveguide by a distance ‘d’.
- the first curved waveguide section 28 is further coupled to a second curved waveguide section 30 of opposite curvature.
- the offset between the first and second curved waveguide sections 28 and 30 is ‘ 2 d ’.
- the second curved waveguide 30 section is further coupled to the output waveguide 26 .
- the offset between the second curved waveguide 30 and the output waveguide 26 is ‘d’.
- the first and second curved waveguide sections 28 and 30 have the same radius of curvature.
- FIG. 3 of the accompanying drawings shows a waveguide directional coupler described by Kitoh et. al. [2].
- the waveguide directional coupler has four arms 47 .
- Each arm 47 consists of a first straight section 44 coupled to a first curved section 45 which is further coupled to a second curved section 46 which, in turn, is further coupled to a straight central section.
- the curved sections 45 and 46 are offset by a distance ‘ 2 d ’ to each other.
- the straight sections 44 and 49 are offset to curved sections 45 and 46 respectively by distances ‘d’.
- Each curved section 45 and 46 has the same radius of curvature.
- Reference [2] describes how the waveguide junction offsets can be dimensioned to minimize transition losses. However, with this transition loss optimization, the offsets distort the optical field as it travels between the straight and curved sections and excite a small amount of radiative modes.
- a waveguide for guiding a field therealong, the waveguide comprising a bend bounded by an input end and an output end, wherein the field in the bend is describable by first and second bend modes which are in phase at the input end but propagate at different velocities through the bend, thereby coming out of phase and into phase with each other in beats, wherein the bend is structured having regard to its length and curvature to ensure that at the output end the first and second bend modes are substantially in phase with each other over a desired wavelength range of the optical field having completed approximately an integer number of beats.
- the bend of the first aspect of the invention differs from a conventional waveguide bend in that there is a special shaping and dimensioning of the bend that allows the optical modes to propagate through the bend substantially undistorted.
- the underlying idea behind the invention is to make a waveguide bend comprising one or more curved sections such that, at the end of the bend, the two orthogonal modes are in phase.
- the two modes are able to properly reconstruct the first mode of the straight waveguide and propagate on with a minimum of distortion, whether it be into a straight section, a further curved section of arbitrary curvature, into a free space propagation region or whatever.
- this is achieved by making a bend having a length ‘1’ equal to an integer number of beat lengths L b .
- a waveguide bend or single curved portion that satisfies this condition is hereinafter referred to as a matched bend or curved portion.
- the utility of the invention is considerably enhanced by the fact that a matched bend is well matched over a relatively large wavelength range. This is because the beat length changes only very weakly with wavelength. This is quite surprising, since the propagation constants, coupling integral and other relevant mode parameters all vary with wavelength relatively strongly. However, although the mode parameters vary with wavelength, they do so in a very similar manner so that the net result in terms of beat length variation is quite small. It is thus possible to provide close matching of a bend for a large range of wavelengths, which is of course a great advantage, for example for wavelength division multiplexed systems. For example, matching can be provided across the whole of the third telecommunications window.
- the proposed matched bend approach can be used to suppress mode distortion, transition losses and other negative effects of waveguide bends, without the need for inserting the small lateral offsets of the prior art [1-4].
- Waveguide bends can thus be inserted into optical circuits where desired, e.g. to optimize packing density, without concern for mode distortion or other negative effects on the components of the circuit adjacent to the bends.
- the first and second bend modes have a phase mismatch of less than one of 30, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 degrees at the output end of the curved portion over the desired wavelength range.
- the desired wavelength range may be any of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 350, 400 and 500 nm.
- These desired wavelength ranges may span any wavelength range at wavelengths of 300 nm to 2000 nm, more particularly any wavelengths of 1000 to 1800 nm, still more particularly any wavelengths of 1200 to 1700 nm.
- the waveguide is a planar waveguide, ridge waveguide, diffused waveguide, or any other waveguide fabricated using a substrate.
- the invention may also find application in optical fiber waveguides.
- the invention is applicable to multimode as well as monomode waveguides.
- the second bend mode may be leaky.
- the integer number of beats may vary. Example values are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
- the waveguide may be shaped to provide a U-bend or an L-bend. In general the bend may describe any desired angular deviation.
- a design rule for a bend of arbitrary curvature characterized by a radius of curvature R that is a function of angle ⁇ through the bend is such that the curved portion of the bend should substantially satisfy the following matching condition:
- the invention is applicable to waveguide bends not only with varying bending radius, but also to waveguide bends whose width varies along the bend.
- a design rule for one embodiment is valid in the case that the bend comprises an arcuate curved portion. Namely, where R is a constant over at least one arcuate part of the bend, the curved portion of the bend should substantially satisfy the following matching condition:
- the matching condition may be deemed to be substantially satisfied when N is within one of 10%, 8%, 6%, 4%, 2%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.25% of an integer value over the desired wavelength range.
- the matched bend may comprise multiple curves.
- the individual curves may each themselves satisfy the matching condition.
- the individual curves may be unmatched, but collectively form a matched bend.
- the bend is an S-bend comprising two curved portions of opposite curvature to provide a waveguide offset that connects two straight waveguide portions that extend parallel to each other.
- a lateral offset is useful for placement between two optical components aligned substantially in parallel with each other.
- a straight portion of waveguide can be defined as a waveguide having no bend with a radius of curvature of less than one of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 cm.
- the proposed matched bends may find application in a variety of devices.
- a Mach-Zehnder interferometer device comprising a first arm and a second arm, wherein at least the first arm comprises a matched bend waveguide according to the first aspect of the invention.
- a waveguide branch such as a Y-branch, comprising an input waveguide and at least two output waveguides, wherein the input waveguide comprises a matched bend waveguide.

- the waveguide comprises a core and cladding.
- the waveguide is made up of a first straight section 60 extending in direction ‘x’ followed by a curved section 58 followed by a second straight section 55 .
- the curved section 58 has a radius of curvature R.
- the radius of curvature R is measured to a centre line of the core, which is shown with a dashed line in the figure.
- the curved section 58 extends through an angle ⁇ having a circumferential length 1 , as measured along the centre line.
- the illustrated waveguide thus has an arcuate bend.
- the basic structure of a waveguide bend is of course well known.
- the bend according to the first embodiment of the invention differs from a conventional waveguide structure in that there is a special shaping and dimensioning of the bend that allows the optical modes to propagate from the first straight section into the second straight section 55 substantially undistorted.
- the design rules for shaping and dimensioning the bend are described in detail further below.
- FIG. 5 is a cross-section through A-A of FIG. 4 .
- the monomode waveguide is realized as a ridge waveguide with the core 52 arranged as a ridge on top of the cladding 54 .
- a cap layer 53 is also provided on top of the core 52 .
- the cap layer may also be referred to as a cover layer or upper clad layer).
- illustration of a ridge waveguide is by way of example only.
- the waveguide may be buried, diffused or of any other kind.
- the structure may be fabricated by any of several known techniques, for example sol-gel, ion-beam implantation, vacuum deposition, implantation, chemical or physical vapor deposition or ion diffusion.
- the materials chosen for the core and cladding may be of any dielectric material with refractive indices that will allow light to be guided through the waveguide.
- the design rules for shaping and dimensioning the bend of the first embodiment are now described. It has been shown [5, 6] that the modes of a bent waveguide can be approximated as a linear combination of the straight waveguides modes. For a monomode waveguide, it can be demonstrated that only the fundamental mode and the first leaky mode in the plane of the bend (both of the straight waveguide) are sufficient to describe the fundamental bend mode. Vice versa, the fundamental straight mode can be described as the linear combination of the fundamental bent mode and the first leaky bend mode. This is valid, separately both for TE and TM polarization.
- this mode When a straight fundamental mode enters in a bend you can imagine this mode as the sum of two modes, the two bend modes (fundamental+first leaky). These two modes are not coupled (because they are the modes of the bend waveguide) but propagate at different velocities in the bend.
- the two modes have different phase constants, ⁇ B0 and ⁇ B1 , related to ⁇ 0 and ⁇ 1 , the phase constants of the two straight modes, by some complex relations (see [5, 6]). This causes the total optical field to change shape as it travels through the curved waveguide section.
- the two modes At the beginning of the curve, the two modes are in phase with each other, but gradually dephase. At some point along the curve, provided it is sufficiently long, the two modes come back into phase with each other again.
- the phase difference reaches 2 ⁇ .
- the characteristic length of curved waveguide section over which a 2 ⁇ phase difference will occur is determined by the difference in the phase velocities of the two modes. This length is referred to here as the beat length L b .
- the two bend modes propagate along the curve, they will thus come into phase periodically, after each beat length of propagation. Therefore, at each integral number of beat lengths, the optical field in the curved waveguide section will momentarily reconstruct to have the form of the optical field of the fundamental modes in a straight waveguide section, provided that the radiation losses of the leaky bend mode are not too high, i.e. provided that the bending radius is not too small.
- the underlying idea behind the invention is to make a curve such that, at the end of the curve, the two orthogonal modes are in phase.
- the mode is able to properly reconstruct the first mode of the straight waveguide and propagate on with a minimum of distortion, whether it be into a straight section, a further curved section of arbitrary curvature, a free space propagation region or whatever.
- this is achieved by making a curve having a length ‘1’ equal to an integer number of beat lengths L b .
- a curved waveguide section that satisfies this condition is hereinafter referred to as a matched bend.
- the graph refers to a bend with a constant bending radius R and constant waveguide width W.
- the graph plots sets of values of the radius of curvature R in meters and angle of curvature ⁇ in degrees that satisfy equation (1) above.
- FIGS. 7 and 8 show calculated mode patterns for two single bends having the structure shown in FIG. 4 . More especially, the graphs show the intensity of the calculated optical field propagating in the bend.
- the bend conforms to the matched bend condition set out above.
- the bend of FIG. 8 is for an unmatched bend.
- the mode is seen to reconstruct immediately, substantially without distortion, in the second straight section.
- the field pattern in the second straight section reproduces the field pattern in the first straight section, as desired.
- the mode does not reconstruct after the end of the curved section, at least not for several hundred microns of propagation included in the plot.
- the mode can be expected to reconstruct eventually, provided that the second straight waveguide mode radiates away completely.
- the unmatched bend results in significant radiation losses.
- the radiation losses of the matched bend are equal to 0.5% (0.02 dB) while those of the unmatched bend are 9.2% (0.42 dB).
- the high mode distortion in and subsequent to the unmatched bend is associated with energy losses, which are of course highly undesirable for many applications.
- the low distortion of a matched bend is associated with low transition losses in the bend.
- the slow recovery of the mode after an unmatched bend can have a severe impact on the behavior or functionality of an optical component placed after an unmatched bend.
- Some types of optical component are highly sensitive to input mode distortion, for example splitters and components using splitters.
- To increase integration density it is desirable to pack components close together.
- slow recovery of the mode after a bend will mitigate against achieving high packing density, since a large distance needs to be maintained between the end of the bend and the next optical component, e.g. 500-1000 ⁇ m or even more.
- the rapid mode stabilization of a matched bend allows subsequent mode-sensitive optical components to be placed close to the bend, e.g. within 100 ⁇ m or 200 ⁇ m, or even less, without problems.
- an optimum bend, offset or other waveguide structure is well matched over a broad wavelength region of 100 nm or more in the second or third telecommunications windows (1.3 and 1.55 ⁇ m bands). For example, it is possible to provide good matching over the whole of the third telecommunications window.
- FIG. 9 shows a plan view of a monomode waveguide 50 according to a second embodiment of the invention.
- the waveguide 50 comprises a core 52 and cladding 54 .
- the waveguide 50 is made up of a first straight section 60 extending in direction ‘x’ followed by a first curved section 58 followed by a second curved section 56 of opposite curvature direction further followed by a second straight section 55 also extending in the direction ‘x’.
- the first curved section 58 has a radius of curvature R 1 .
- the curved sections 56 and 58 extend through the same angle ⁇ such the respective lengths of the curved sections 56 and 58 are equal. Together the curved sections 56 and 58 make up an S-bend 70 .
- the S-bend 70 provides a lateral offset ‘f’ in a direction ‘y’ perpendicular to ‘x’ between the two straight sections of waveguide 60 and 55 .
- f 20 ⁇ m, as measured between the respective centre lines of the waveguide straight sections 55 and 60 .
- S-bend 70 differs from a conventional waveguide structure in that there is a special shaping and dimensioning of the bend that allows the optical modes to propagate from the first straight-section 60 into the second straight section 55 substantially undistorted.
- the design rules for shaping and dimensioning the bend are described in detail further below.
- the waveguide may be a ridge waveguide as shown in FIG. 5 in relation to the first embodiment.
- FIG. 5 is a cross-section through A-A of FIG. 9 in one example.
- the same parameter values and variations are envisaged, as discussed in relation to the first embodiment.
- FIGS. 10 and 11 are graphs showing the intensity of the calculated optical field propagating in the two example offsets, FIG. 10 being the matched S-bend and FIG. 11 the unmatched S-bend.
- the results are similar to those for the first embodiment in that, for the offset in which the two bends of the S-bend are matched, the mode is seen to reconstruct immediately, substantially without distortion, in the second straight section. On the other hand, for the unmatched structure, the mode is severely distorted subsequent to the curved sections. Similar comments apply as made in relation to the first embodiment. In respect of radiation losses, the offset with matched bends has losses equal to 0.2% (0.009 dB) while the losses of the offset with unmatched bends are 6.2% (0.28 dB).
- a matched S-bend can be made up of two appropriately designed “unmatched” curves, instead of two matched curves, as described above.
- the two “unmatched” curves may be of different shape (eg. different bending radius) or width (e.g. each with variable widths that are different).
- the input and output straight sections need not be parallel to each other.
- a waveguide coupler may be fabricated by planar, ridge or diffused waveguides for example.
- FIG. 12 shows a four-port (2 ⁇ 2) waveguide coupler according to a third embodiment of the invention.
- the coupler comprises first and second waveguides 80 and 82 which approach each other and run alongside each other over a coupling region 84 of length L C over which modes in the adjacent waveguides can exchange power through evanescent field interaction.
- the length of the coupling region 84 determines what proportion of input light power P 0 travelling in the first waveguide 80 at the start of the coupling region 84 remains in the first waveguide P 1 or is transferred into the second waveguide P 2 at the end of the coupling region.
- a waveguide coupler fabricated on a substrate will require waveguide bends at each end of the coupling region.
- the coupling region is bounded by waveguide offsets 70 according to the second embodiment, there being four in total, two for each waveguide.
- the design of the offsets can follow the design rules set out for the second embodiment, even if the waveguide portions forming the offset are partially coupled to each other, as will be the case for the waveguide sections immediately adjacent to the coupling regions. (Alternatively, single bends or other multiple bend waveguide shapes could be used).
- the basic power division operation of the coupler is not strongly affected by the waveguide bends bounding the coupling region, since the coupling coefficient (ratio P 2 /P 0 ) is relatively insensitive to whether the waveguide bends of the offset are matched or unmatched.
- the higher losses and mode distortion discussed with reference to the previous embodiments will occur.
- mode distortion as discussed further above, and also in reference [6], an unmatched bend results in excitation of a leaky mode (first order mode) which propagates through the coupling region and into the output, causing distortion of the output mode. This will potentially cause problems with subsequent devices, such as a Y-branch, positioned after the coupler.
- FIG. 13 shows a device according to a fourth embodiment.
- the device is a Y-branch 86 preceded by a matched S-bend offset 70 , that is an S-bend that satisfies the above-described matching condition.
- a Y-branch is used for splitting the power P 0 carried in an input waveguide into two output waveguides which carry respective powers P 1 and P 2 .
- the bends of opposite curvature extend over a distance L and are followed by a straight waveguide portion 87 of length L 1 which in turn terminates in a waveguide split 88 from which two waveguides 81 and 83 emerge, each extending from the split 88 with an S-bend offset of length L.
- These offsets are dimensioned to result in the two waveguides emerging from the device separated by a lateral separation d.
- the offset lengths, bending radii and bend angles are shown to be the same (L, R and ⁇ ) for the various offsets and bends, but of course this will not generally be the case.
- FIG. 14 shows a calculated optical field pattern for an example of such a Y-branch.
- the vertical axis shows propagation direction x and the horizontal axis an orthogonal direction y, both axes being in units of microns.
- the optical fields in the matched S-bend and the subsequent straight waveguide section at the input are undistorted. This results in undistorted and equal optical fields in the two output waveguide sections.
- the results show that the output power coupled into each of the output waveguide sections is almost identical.
- full stabilization of the mode power occurs shortly after the Y-split.
- FIG. 15 is included for comparison with FIG. 14 .
- the splitting ratio is slightly asymmetrical and the losses are not zero, but relatively low.
- FIG. 16 shows a fifth embodiment of the invention comprising a 1 ⁇ 2 multimode interference (MMI) coupler 92 preceded by an S-bend 72 similar to that of the second embodiment.
- MMI multimode interference
- the purpose of this MMI coupler embodiment is to provide a specific example of a device that is sensitive to input mode distortion.
- a straight input waveguide section 94 interconnects the S-bend 72 with the 1 ⁇ 2 MMI coupler 92 .
- At the output side of the MMI coupler 92 there are provide first and second straight output waveguide sections 96 and 100 .
- The-coupling into the straight output waveguide sections 96 and 100 is realized by symmetric interference, as described in reference [7].
- the MMI coupler has a length ‘c’ and a width ‘b’.
- the refractive index difference between the core and cladding ⁇ n 0.69%.
- the first straight output waveguide section 96 is placed 8 ⁇ m above the centre line of the MMI coupler 92 (as defined by the input waveguide section 94 ).
- the second straight output waveguide section 100 is placed 8 ⁇ m below the centre line of the MMI coupler 92 .
- the S-bend 72 comprises two matched curves conforming to equation (1) above.
- the straight section 94 has a length 0 ⁇ m, i.e. the MMI coupler 9 follows immediately from the end of the waveguide bend 72 .
- Each curve has a radius of 10 mm and extends through an angle of 1.
- the output powers P 1 and P 2 coupled into the two output waveguide sections 96 and 100 were calculated, as well as the total transition loss through the coupler and preceding input waveguide sections.
- the respective output powers should be equal. In other words a 50:50 power split should be achieved at the output.
- results were also calculated for a device similar to that of FIG. 16 , but with a simple straight input section instead of an S-bend input section (control), and a device similar to that of FIG. 16 but with an unmatched S-bend in the input section (unmatched S-bend).
- the results are given in Table II below.
- the input power is equally divided between the two straight output waveguides, as expected.
- the splitting ratio between the two output waveguides sections is almost exactly 50:50.
- the presence of the matched S-bend on the input has not significantly affected the splitting ratio of the MMI coupler.
- the total loss is somewhat higher as a result of the S-bend.
- the power splitting ratio is greatly affected by the mode distortion at the input.
- the total loss is also somewhat higher than for the matched S-bend example.
- FIG. 17 is a calculated optical field intensity pattern for the example of the fifth embodiment.
- the mode is relatively undistorted at the input to the MMI coupler (0 ⁇ x ⁇ 500 ⁇ m).
- the mode pattern is rather complex within the MMI coupler (500 ⁇ x ⁇ 2100 ⁇ m).
- the modes are relatively undistorted already after only about 100 ⁇ m of propagation in the output channels.
- the power balance between the two channels is also even (although not immediately apparent from the figure). Namely, after a propagation distance of 2150 ⁇ m, i.e. a short distance into the straight output waveguides, the power split is nearly equal.
- FIG. 18 is a calculated optical field intensity pattern for an MMI coupler similar to that of the example, but preceded by an unmatched S-bend.
- the mode is somewhat distorted at the input to the MMI coupler (0 ⁇ x ⁇ 500 ⁇ m).
- the mode pattern is rather complex within the MMI coupler (500 ⁇ x ⁇ 2100 ⁇ m).
- the modes are highly distorted and a large power imbalance is also evident.
- the relative power imbalance is approximately 0.53/0.35.
- FIG. 19 is a block schematic drawing of a sixth embodiment of the invention.
- the sixth embodiment is a 1 ⁇ 4 power splitter realized by cascading three 1 ⁇ 2 MMI couplers 202 , 204 and 206 in two stages.
- a first MMI coupler 202 has a straight input waveguide 94 .
- the first MMI coupler 202 has two output waveguides in the form of matched S-bends 112 .
- the S-bends 112 extend to form respective inputs for second and third MMI couplers 204 and 206 .
- the second MMI coupler 204 has two straight output waveguide sections that carry output powers P 1 and P 2 in use.
- the third MMI coupler has two straight output waveguide sections that carry output powers P 3 and P 4 in use.
- the waveguide and MMI coupler dimensions are the same as for the fifth embodiment described above.
- the calculated power imbalance between the four output powers P 1 -P 4 is only 0.006 dB or 0.1%.
- the calculated power imbalance is much higher, namely 0.61 dB or 15.1%.
- power splitters based on MMI couplers are sensitive to optical field distortions so that the provision of matched bends greatly improves performance.
- the improvement becomes more significant as the number of stages of such a power splitter increases. For example, the benefit of providing matched bends becomes greater as one progresses from a three stage 1 ⁇ 8 splitter, to a four stage 1 ⁇ 16 splitter, a five stage 1 ⁇ 32 splitter or, more generally, to an n-stage 1 ⁇ 2 n splitter.
- FIG. 20 relates to a seventh embodiment of the invention showing a Mach-Zehnder filter comprising first and second MMI couplers 93 and 94 having straight input and output waveguides 91 and 95 interconnected by first and second waveguide sections 132 and 134 of different optical path length which constitute first and second arms of the Mach-Zehnder filter.
- the first arm 132 is bent to increase its optical path length and thus introduce the optical path difference between the two arms. More specifically, the first arm 132 comprises four curved waveguide sections.
- the waveguides and MMI couplers are as for the fifth embodiment.
- the extinction ratio of the device is 42 dB. Extinction ratio is a measure of goodness of a Mach-Zehnder filter.
- FIG. 22 is a schematic plan view of an active arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) according to an eighth embodiment of the invention.
- the device comprises an array of waveguides 142 interconnecting first and second free space propagation regions 148 and 146 , successive waveguides of the array having an incrementally increasing optical path length, as is known in the art, for example reference [4].
- the waveguides of the array 142 interconnecting the free space propagation regions are additionally matched according to the generalised form of the design equations given above for non-arcuate curves, it being understood that the waveguides of the array 142 will not be simple arcuate curves in an AWG.
- the waveguides of the array 142 are thus not only matched in terms of their optical path lengths, as in a conventional AWG, but additionally matched in terms of the beat length between the bend modes, according to the invention.
- input waveguide 140 couples into the first free space propagation region 148 and a plurality of output waveguides 145 couple out from the second free space propagation region 146 .
- the waveguide array 142 has arranged thereon a trapezoidal electrode 144 biased in use by a voltage V for imposing a linear phase profile on the waveguide array 142 , thereby to tune the device so that a given input wavelength from the input waveguide 140 can be coupled to different ones of the output waveguides 145 .
- the inclusion of the electrode 144 provides an active AWG. Omission of the electrode is also possible to provide a passive AWG.
- FIG. 22 is a schematic diagram of a mode converter according to an ninth embodiment of the invention.
- bent waveguides are not only applicable to designing matched waveguide bends, but also permits the design of a mode converter.
- the field of a monomode bent waveguide can be described as the linear combination of the fundamental mode and the first leaky mode of the straight waveguide.
- the field of a monomode straight waveguide can be described as the linear combination of the fundamental mode and the first leaky mode of a bent waveguide. This can be mathematically expressed by:
- ⁇ 0,1 are respectively the fundamental mode and the first leaky mode of the straight waveguide
- ⁇ 0,1 are respectively the fundamental mode and the first leaky mode of the bent waveguide.
- the complex coefficients ⁇ ij are the modal coefficients and are described further in reference [6].
- FIG. 22 there is shown a single bend structure, generally similar to that of FIG. 4 , comprising a first straight section 160 followed by a curved section 158 (defined by parameters R, ⁇ ) and a second straight section 155 .
- an optical signal is shown propagating towards the bend, the signal having components of both straight modes ⁇ 0 and ⁇ 1 .
- the bend is structured and dimensioned to provide mode conversion so that, after the bend, i.e. at the output of the device, only the fundamental straight mode ⁇ 0 is present.
- the device is thus a mode converter because it converts all the power of the ⁇ 1 mode to the ⁇ 0 mode.
- the bend is “unmatched” (but in a special way) in order to carry out the required mode conversion.
- the mode converter is a useful device, since it is generally important that substantially all the power of an optical signal is in the fundamental mode. Power in the first leaky mode is undesirable, because of the radiative losses associated with that mode.
- the mode converter can, for example, be used as a component of an optical integrated circuit. Suppose that at an arbitrary point along a waveguide in an optical integrated circuit, it can be predicted that a proportion of the optical signal power will be in the first leaky mode (e.g. at the output of a certain kind of device) and the phase is defined. It will then be possible to insert a mode converter according to this embodiment to convert all the power back into the fundamental mode.
- FIG. 23 shows an example of the use of a mode converter.
- the waveguide is a ridge waveguide similar to that shown in FIG. 5 but without an upper cladding).
- the input field in the input straight section 160 is ⁇ 0 and the output field after the unmatched bend 158 in the straight section 157 is 90.72% of ⁇ 0 and 9.24% of ⁇ 1 .
- the mode converter is very short.
- a mode converter may be made of multiple curved sections, not just the single curve shown.
- the waveguides are monomode.
- the proposed approach including the design rule formulae stated above are also valid if the waveguide is multimode in the vertical direction.
- the principle of the invention is also still valid more generally for multimode waveguides.
- the closed-form formulae for the optimum bend and offset are still valid.
- the principles are still valid, but closed-form formulae do not exist.
Abstract
Description
-
- β0 & β1 are respective phase constants of first and second straight modes;
- c10 is a coupling coefficient indicative of coupling induced by the bend between the first and second straight modes; and
- N is the integer number of beats.
as will be understood from references [5, 6] and where
-
- β0 & β1 are the phase constants of the first two modes of the straight waveguide; and
- c10 is the coupling coefficient between the first two modes of the straight waveguide induced by the curve.
To obtain a curve containing exactly N beat lengths, that is the matched bend condition, the condition is imposed that:
Rθ=NLb (3)
and taking into account equations (1) and (2) the optimum bending radius is found to be
-
- N is a positive integer that indicates the length of the curve in units of beat length.
In the more general case of a curve with variable bending radius R=R(θ), and/or a waveguide bend with varying width W=W(θ), the same procedure leads to an integral equation that relates R to θ:
- N is a positive integer that indicates the length of the curve in units of beat length.
where the dependency of C1 and C2 on θ follows from taking account of the possibility of variable waveguide width, since the coefficients β0, β1 and c10 are waveguide width dependent.
and the offset is long then L=2√{square root over (fR)}.
and the obtained offset is f=L2/4R.
