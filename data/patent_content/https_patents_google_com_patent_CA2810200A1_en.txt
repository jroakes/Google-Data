DETAILED DESCRIPTION
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0012] Advertisers, publishers, and service providers generally may wish to exchange data for purposes of implementing a meaningful way of providing information and/or services (e.g., advertising content) to online users. If specific content is determined to be meaningful to a particular user, then the user may wish to access the content, purchase the content, or otherwise interact with the content.
This interaction can provide revenue to the content provider (e.g., advertiser, publisher or service provider). If a particular content provider (e.g., advertiser, publisher, or service provider) can collect data about how specific content may or may not be meaningful to users (i.e., in the form of a user list), the collected data may be used by others in a variety of ways. One use relates to selecting targeted content. Other uses are possible, such as in adjusting bids in an auction based, for example, on user lists that indicate specific content is of interest to one or more users. User lists can be published, sold, licensed or otherwise accessed to assist in providing personalized content to the specific users and increasing revenue for a content provider.

Other uses are possible, such as in adjusting bids in an auction based, for example, on user lists that indicate specific content is of interest to one or more users. User lists can be published, sold, licensed or otherwise accessed to assist in providing personalized content to the specific users and increasing revenue for a content provider.
[0013] User lists can represent specific user information pertaining to predefined categories. The categories can be defined by the data owners. For example, a user list may include data about one or more users which characterizes the users to a category (e.g., homeowner, craftsman, DVD renter, etc.) to allow targeting of the users by, for example, publishers or advertisers. In some implementations, the user lists can be used to target relevant advertising content.
[0014] User lists can be generated and exchanged according to a number of rules, and those rules can be used to market particular user lists to specific consumers.
The rules can employ methods of assigning users to particular user lists. Such rules can provide a logical categorization of data, information, or services for the purposes of determining which data content in the user lists is particularly relevant to a number of users.
The rules can employ methods of assigning users to particular user lists. Such rules can provide a logical categorization of data, information, or services for the purposes of determining which data content in the user lists is particularly relevant to a number of users.
[0015] Methods are described for associating user specific information with one or more user lists that are owned or maintained by a data owner. An association between the user-specific data and the user lists is made. The association can be exploited, for example, for real-time bidding in response to requests for content or to customize content to be provided to a specific user. Other uses of the user list information and associations are possible.
[0016] FIG. 1A is a schematic diagram of a system 100 for providing and using shared data. The shared data can, for example, include user lists detailing a number of predefined categories pertaining to specific users. The categories can be defined by or relate to user information including, but not limited to, browser history, user selections, cookie information, user-provided preferences, purchase histories, web search data, or other data (i.e., where the user has provided permission for the storing and/or collecting of such data). In some implementations, a user list is owned by a data provider that gathered the information in a respective user list. In some implementations, the user lists can be shared with other entities, such as for example using a data exchange. For example, the user lists can be shared amongst advertisers, third-party service providers, or third-party advertisers, data aggregators, and other online users.
[0017] The user lists can be provided to the data exchange and maintained by the data exchange and/or by the data owners. User lists can be updated as appropriate to either refine the category/categories associated therewith or the users that are members of a given list. Management of user lists is described in greater detail below.
[0018] The system 100 includes a data exchange engine 102 for providing an interface for consumers (e.g., advertisers) and others to discover and/or license user lists 104. FIG. 1B shows an example user interface for a marketplace for presenting user lists (also referred to therein as "segments" or "audience segments").
The presented user lists can be all available, all that correspond to one or more filter criteria, those surfaced based on prior use or data provided from a potential consumer or other filter criteria. FIGs. 1C-H show example user interfaces for managing user list subscriptions. FIG. 1C shows a login page for accessing user lists associated with a subscriber account in the marketplace shown in FIG.
1B. FIG.
1D shows an example user interface that includes active and inactive segments associated with a subscriber account. FIG. lE shows an example of a user interface for managing segments. FIG. 1F shows an example of a user interface showing contract details for subscriptions. FIG. 1G shows an example of a user interface showing tools available for managing a subscription. FIG. 1H shows an example of a user interface for reports associated with a subscription account. The data exchange engine 102 can be configurable to maintain, update, present, license, sell or otherwise manage one or more user lists based on owned or permissioned data.
The generated user lists can include user-specific associations characterizing specific online user behavior. The associations can be used, for example, to provide personalized content from an advertising server 106, a third-party server 108, or other content provider. The data exchange engine 102 as described here may parallel the functionality of an online advertisement exchange system for active targeted online advertisers, for example.

The generated user lists can include user-specific associations characterizing specific online user behavior. The associations can be used, for example, to provide personalized content from an advertising server 106, a third-party server 108, or other content provider. The data exchange engine 102 as described here may parallel the functionality of an online advertisement exchange system for active targeted online advertisers, for example.
[0019] In some implementations, the data exchange engine 102 can create an exchange between owners of permissioned data and users of such data. Users of the permissioned data can include advertisers that seek to target particular categories of users. In some implementations, the data exchange engine 102 provides a mechanism for a provider of advertising placement services in targeted online advertising to make available additional third-party data sources to buyers of advertising space. In some implementations, the data exchange engine 102 can provide user lists to publishers, syndicates, and other data providers for various purposes, including the targeting of advertising content to users.
[0020] The data exchange engine 102 can provide an interface for data owners to securely view and manage their own data (i.e., manage a user list). For example, a data owner can generate and store information in a user list by entering data both manually and automatically. Other entities may be permitted to enter/maintain information in a user list. Publishers can also extract data for direct sales models or other marketing plans. Although computer hardware is not depicted in the data exchange engine 102, processors, memory, and other processing components may be included.
[0021] The advertising server 106 can provide advertising content to any number of browsers 110 via the data exchange engine 102 or directly. In addition, the advertising server 106 can be configurable for receiving advertising content requests and providing advertising content to requesting users. In operation, the advertising server 106 can select advertisements targeted based on one or more criteria and in view of data that is included in one or more user lists. The advertising server 106 can also provide access to other storage elements, such as ad repositories, in the example shown as ad repository 112. The ad repository 112 can be used to store advertising content associated with particular keywords, bidding criteria, advertisers, and targeting criteria. Data storage elements may include any one or combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays, hash tables, lists, and pairs. The advertising server 106 can access other similar types of data storage devices, such as user lists 104, for example.
[0022] In some implementations, advertisers can work with data providers to purchase or license user lists for purposes of targeting certain categories (e.g., demographic categories, interest categories, preference categories). The user lists can be analyzed for quality and other considerations. The advertisers can use the user lists for determining targeting criteria or to modify current bids, for example. In one example use case, an advertiser can subscribe for a period of time to a user list.
The user list itself may be defined as being associated with a certain category (e.g., Internet shoppers interested in buying a sports car) of users. Requests for advertisements can be received by the advertising system, and the data exchange can be used to determine for a given user to which user lists the user is subscribed.
In a real-time bid example, the advertisers that have subscribed to the user lists may be presented with the request (and necessarily information that the users satisfy the category(ies) associated with the user list(s)), and then may adjust/submit bids in consideration of such information. This is just one example of a use for the user list data.

This is just one example of a use for the user list data.
[0023] The third-party servers 108 can provide third-party services to any number of browsers 110 via the data exchange engine 102. For example, the third-party servers 108 can provide web services, advertising services, or external APIs (application programming interfaces) to connect to a third-party server. The third-party servers 108 can include, for example, one or more servers executing a search engine application program. In some implementations, the third-party servers can include a related information server or an advertising server. Third-party servers 108 can track user activity using, for example, cookies 114.
[0024] The browser 110 represents a user browsing the Internet. The browser can access any website available on a network belonging to a person, or any other type of entity such as a company, enterprise, etc. For example, in FIG. 1 browser 110 can access a service or website. The service or website can be hosted by the third-party server 108, or alternatively by another server associated with system 100.
A user can employ the browser 110 to search the Internet for services, information, or merchandise. The browser 110 can track user activity using cookies 116.
A user can employ the browser 110 to search the Internet for services, information, or merchandise. The browser 110 can track user activity using cookies 116.
[0025] In some implementations, the advertising server 106 includes one or more advertisement customizers (not shown) operable to customize advertising content according to one or more user lists. In particular, an advertisement customizer can customize the display criteria, language, or other content of an advertisement according to user list information. For example, if a particular user list includes user-entered searching pertaining to purchasing a vehicle, the advertising server 106 can use the user-entered searching information (e.g., a cookie stored from performing a web search in a browser) to customize the display or content of an advertisement.
The customization can, for example, provide the user with a more relevant advertisement.
The customization can, for example, provide the user with a more relevant advertisement.
[0026] In operation and for each generated user list, the system 100 can store, for example in a table-based repository, a list of user lists for which a particular user belongs. The table-based repository can, for example, be represented by a proprietary distributed storage system having a multi-dimensional sorted map as described in the paper entitled "Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data" by Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A.
Wallach, Mike Burrows, Tushar Chandra, Andrew Fikes, and Robert E. Gruber, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The table-based repository represents a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size (e.g., petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers). Each user list in the proprietary database can be included in one or more tables having multiple dimensions (one of which may be a field for time, allowing for versioning and garbage collection).

Each user list in the proprietary database can be included in one or more tables having multiple dimensions (one of which may be a field for time, allowing for versioning and garbage collection).
[0027] The system 100 can provide an index to the table-based repository. The index can be represented by, for example, a user cookie. For example, the table-based repository may be a set of rows and columns where the rows represent cookies corresponding to particular users and the columns represent a characterization associated with the user list, such as particular categories, keywords, websites, or other descriptive data.
[0028] At some point, the user browser 110 can make a request for advertising content from the advertising server 106 or the third-party server 108. The data exchange engine 102 can retrieve a list of user lists from the table-based repository associated with a received request and append or otherwise associate the list of user lists to the request. Any subsequent processing of the request can use the list, for example, for targeting, advertising customization and bid generation. The list of user lists or portions of the list can also be transmitted to a real-time bidder to provide the bidder with pertinent information about one or more users. Other uses are possible.
[0029] FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of user lists 104 stored in a table 200.
In this example, one or more entities (e.g., a web publishing entity that collected the user data) provided the user lists 104 to the data exchange engine 102. In some implementations, the user lists 104 in the table 200 are all provided by a same entity.
Alternatively, the user lists 104 in the table 200 can include user lists owned/associated with different entities. In some implementations, entities can create their own user lists and provide the lists to the data exchange engine 102.
For example, entities can format content in user lists according to preferences associated with users and offer the user list data to the data exchange engine for publication, management and use in targeting content to the users. The data in the user lists 104 is developed, for example, based at least in part on user-provided, searching and browser data or other user provided data. In this example, the data exchange engine 102 can manage the user lists 104 which details users 212 A-E.

Alternatively, the user lists 104 in the table 200 can include user lists owned/associated with different entities. In some implementations, entities can create their own user lists and provide the lists to the data exchange engine 102.

In this example, the data exchange engine 102 can manage the user lists 104 which details users 212 A-E.
[0030] In this example, each row represents a single user. A user identifier (not shown) can be used to identify a user. The user identifier can be a user identifier associated with a user in a domain associated with the entity that owns/provides the data (i.e., a local identifier). In some implementations, such as those where plural different entities provide user lists that are stored in a single table, the user identifier can be of the form of a global identifier associated with the user, such as an identifier that the advertising system assigns to the user. Global identifiers can be associated with "local" entity identifiers and mapped such that requests that include a local entity identifier can be associated with the global identifier and hence, can be associated with user lists associated with plural entities. Other techniques can be used to identify users, such as cookie-matching technology to allow for the mapping of local identifiers to global identifiers.
[0031] Each column represents a user list that includes a characterization (sometimes referred to as a definition), such as by way of a particular category(ies), keyword(s), website(s), demographic(s), interest(s), or other user classification.
Example characterizations in the table 200 include sports cars, washing machines, and scuba diving. The characterization can include descriptors, such as keywords, that describe a given category. Each characterization may embody the combination of plural separate categories or subject matter. For example, the characterization sports cars, may embody those individuals that visited a web site that were interested in cars and those that were particularly interested in sports cars (which themselves represent two different categories). In some implementations, logical combinations of categories or subject matter can be used to define the characterization for a given user list.

In some implementations, logical combinations of categories or subject matter can be used to define the characterization for a given user list.
[0032] In some implementations, each entry in the table (i.e., the intersection of a row and a column) represents whether the user is a member of a given list. For example, entry 210 indicates that user A is interested in or associated with a user list that has the characterization of sports cars. In some implementations, other data may be included in the entry. Other data can include geo-location data, cookie data, further personal data related to the user and known by the data owner, example web pages or example content (i.e., content surfed by the user), keyword searches, location data, website data, side vertical data, page vertical data, formatted text strings (where the data owner may include data related to the particular user in accordance with a definition set by the data owner (e.g., a series of bits that are set or not depending on the individual user's data for things like demographics, other interests, or other data that is different from the characterization but may be of use in targeting information to the particular user)) or other data. For example, entry 220 includes an indication that user C is not only a member of the user list associated with category C (scuba diving) but also that the user is located at a particular location (e.g., lives in Portland) and is a member of certain demographic groups (e.g., is male). Other information can be included so as to provide more relevant available information to potential consumers of a given list.
[0033] Identification of user lists to which a person belongs can be made by the data exchange engine 102 when a cookie or other user identifiable information is received. In some implementations, the data exchange engine 102 uses the cookie or user identifying information as an index to the user lists 104. For example, the data exchange engine 102 can cross reference received user identifier data with particular user list information to determine an association between user list data and the cookie data/user information. As shown in user lists 104, a user (A) showed an interest in user list A which is characterized by the keywords "sports cars".
For example, the user may, as part of a session with a given data provider, have provided a request to view sports cars made by Lexus such as providing a keyword search for "Lexus sports cars."
For example, the user may, as part of a session with a given data provider, have provided a request to view sports cars made by Lexus such as providing a keyword search for "Lexus sports cars."
[0034] FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for managing user lists.
The process 300 may be executed, for example, by the data exchange engine 102 shown in Figure 1.
The process 300 may be executed, for example, by the data exchange engine 102 shown in Figure 1.
[0035] At stage 302, one or more user lists are identified based on owned or permissioned data. The user lists may be user lists 104 and may be provided by one or more entities to the data exchange engine 102. The user lists may be generated by the data exchange engine 102, such as from data provided from data owners or users.
[0036] At stage 304, user-specific data is imported. Importing can be performed by the data exchange engine 102. Importing user specific data can include importing user- specific data from at least one of a browser, a third-party server, or an advertising database. While reference is made to importing data, in some implementations, the user specific data can be provided by a data owner or other entity. In some implementations, the user specific data can be provided by a redirect or a cookie. Examples of user specific data include data identifying the user in a local environment or a global environment (such as in an advertiser system).
In some implementations, the user specific data is of the form of a global identifier that can be used to identify the user as among plural users of an advertising system. In some implementations, the user specific data is of the form of a global identifier that is associated with a user by an advertising system. In some implementations, a local identifier associated with a user in a particular entity domain is mapped to a global identifier. The global identifier for a given user can be determined as part of the importing process.
In some implementations, the user specific data is of the form of a global identifier that can be used to identify the user as among plural users of an advertising system. In some implementations, the user specific data is of the form of a global identifier that is associated with a user by an advertising system. In some implementations, a local identifier associated with a user in a particular entity domain is mapped to a global identifier. The global identifier for a given user can be determined as part of the importing process.
[0037] In stage 306, one or more associations between one or more user lists and the imported user specific data are made. For example, the data exchange engine 102 can associate a global user identifier with a particular user that is included in a user list associated with a data owner. The associations define whether the user specific data correlates to one or more predefined characterizations associated with given user lists.
[0038] In stage 308, the associations in the one or more user lists are stored. For example, the data exchange engine 102 can store plural user lists and associate users in a formatted table-based repository where rows represent an individual user and columns represent a user list.
[0039] In stage 310, once a request (i.e., a request for content) is received from a user, one or more user lists to which the user is a member can be identified and then passed along with the request for further processing. For example, the request can be passed on to advertisers that are subscribers to (i.e., either purchased or licensed) of a given user list (e.g., for use in modifying/supplying a bid, or to customize data after an impression has been won).
[0040] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process for using user lists to assist in retrieving or customizing advertising content. The process 400 can be executed by, for example, the data exchange engine 102. More or fewer participants may be involved.
[0041] At stage 402, a request for content from a user is received. For example an advertisement server 106 executing on one or more processors receives a request for advertising content from a browser 110 executing on a client device and associated with a particular user.
[0042] At stage 404, a lookup is performed to determine associated user lists for a given user. For example, the data exchange engine 102 can receive the request from the advertising server 106 along with user-specific data (e.g., a cookie) that identifies the user. The data exchange engine 102 can look up the user lists in the table-based repository using the user specific data, wherein the look up identifies at least one user list that includes a characterization (e.g., targeting criteria) associated with the user specific data.
[0043] At stage 406, subscribers to the determined users lists are identified.
For example, the data exchange engine 102 can determine one or more entities that have purchased, licensed or subscribed to use a given user list.
