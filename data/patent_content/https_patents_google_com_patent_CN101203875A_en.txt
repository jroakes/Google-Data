Description
Technical field
The application relates to advertising, as online advertising.Especially, the present invention relates to improve how to determine advertising expenditure, as expense by advertisement presentation (impression).
Background technology
The advertising of traditional media such as use such as TV, broadcasting, newspaper and magazine is well-known.Regrettably, even used the demographic studies data and supposed that about the rational fully of each medium typical audience the advertiser finds that still a large amount of advertising budgets is waste purely.And, discern and eliminate this waste and also be difficult to.
Recently, become universal via the advertising of interactive media more.For example, along with the number of using the Internet is increased sharply, the advertiser begins to recognize that the medium and the service that provide via the Internet become potential strong advertising.
Interactively advertisement provides chance to the advertiser, makes them can throw in those glad audients who receives as target their advertisement.That is, there is the advertisement of target more likely useful, because these advertisements relevant with the demand of being inferred according to certain user's activity (for example, relevant with the user, relevant with the content in the document of user request etc.) to the search inquiry of search engine to the final user.Search engine is using searching keyword to determine that target is to send relevant advertisement.General headquarters are positioned at the AdWords ad system of the Google (Google) in California, USA Mountain View city, are that target is come delivering advertisements by the keyword in the inquiry inquiry.Similarly, having proposed with the content is the ad delivery system of target.For example, submit on Dec 6th, 2002, the invention people be Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Hank and Paul Buchheit, name to be called " METHODS AND APPARATUS SERVINGRELEVANT ADVERTISEMENTS ", sequence number be 10/314,427 U.S. Patent application (" 427 apply for " incorporated herein for your guidance and be called to its content by reference into); And submit in February in 2003 26, the invention people be Darrell Anderson, Paul Buchheit AlexCarobus, Claire Cui, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik, Deepak Jindal and Narayanan Shivakumar, name is called " SERVING ADVERTISEMENTSBASED ON CONTENT " sequence number is that 10/375,900 U.S. Patent application (" 900 apply for " incorporated for your guidance and be called to its content by reference into) has all been described the method and apparatus that the document content that is relevant to such as webpage provides advertisement.Such as the AdSense ad system of Google is that the ad delivery system of target has been used for providing advertisement with the content on webpage.
From the above, be relevant to text concept in the text document and advertisement be provided and be relevant to keyword in the search inquiry that advertisement is provided is useful, roughly meet active user's interest because of this advertisement.Therefore, such online advertisement becomes and becomes more and more popular.And, use other targets to determine that the advertisement of technology and aimless online advertisement have become and become more and more popular.But still there is room for improvement in such ad system.
For example, usually need human to judge to determine to by the paying price of advertisement presentation (as the possibility that usually may arrive the expectation audient) based on the audient's who attracted to certain website type and this advertisement.Usually, being worth by the advertisement presentation that ceiling price is paid is that those are considered to most possibly to be defined as the advertisement presentation that the audient of target sees by the advertiser.For example, the many contract requirement (CR) advertisements between advertiser and the web publisher are provided with on the computing machine of (as 640 * 690 or 800 * 600 etc.) screen position that can be seen by the user at influential position (above the fold) or in the standard screen size.Especially, the ad system that is used for big publisher is the such advertiser's " channel " of definition usually, and these channels or belong to " critical positions " marked price class of (A) high price perhaps belong to (B) " backseat " marked price class at a low price." backseat " marked price class or be meant under critical positions, perhaps being meant may be not and the mutual page (as the website log page) of advertisement the user.Usually, when the advertiser buys location advertising from big publisher, can show advertisement with the position that occurs to them, and sell and instruct department to come negotiated price according to the price list of being checked.In working as under the precondition of prior art, replace web publisher the position to be categorized into " well " and " generally " channel by personnel, and replace the advertiser to judge and negotiated price by personnel.Therefore, the advertiser need and specify different prices to different channel negotiations.
Above-mentioned have several shortcomings by the advertisement convention that manifests paying.The first and since simple defining two the very wide channels or the classification (" well " and " generally ") of location advertising, " well " marked price sector of breakdown may comprise the position of some " generally ", vice versa.The second, the advertiser must check each website assiduously and arduous negotiation work is carried out in each website, may set paying price to advertisement presentation to each position.This human get involved and be difficult to expand to by the channel price make and buy the shown advertisement putting point in catenet website (as 1000 to 2000 websites, the mean size of more current networks is 100 to 200 websites) by every impression prices.
For fear of this scaling concern, many macroreticulars are according to paying per click sale advertising.Regrettably, the advertisement that pays per click can not be satisfied so-called " brand " advertiser's demand, they may will allow message known (for example, " Watch Alias.Now on Wed.nights on ABC ", or " Diet Pepsi-Light! exactly under the situation that need not to click ")
In view of the problem in the above-mentioned existing advertisement practice,, improve advertisement as being useful by what manifest paid advertisement particularly by the problem that manifests in the paid advertisement practice.
Summary of the invention
Use advertisement with possibility viewed or perceived or that discover with the corresponding to embodiment of the present invention by other modes, or use this possibility based on one or more factors, adjust the paying price of advertisement presentation.Described paying price, possibility and/or factor are adjusted in event after can using this advertisement presentation.

Fig. 2 shows and can use environment 200 of the present invention therein.Subscriber equipment (being also referred to as " client " or " client device ") 250 may comprise that the browser facility is (such as the Explorer browser of Microsoft, the Opera Web Broswer of the opera software company of Norway, the Navigator browser of AOL/Time Warner etc.), e-mail (for example, the Outlook of Microsoft) etc.Search engine 220 can allow user's set 250 search collections of documents (for example, webpage).Content server 210 can allow user's set 250 access document.E-mail server (such as Hotmail, the Yahoo Mail etc. of Microsoft Network) 240 can be used for providing e-mail function to user's set 250.Advertisement Server 210 can be used for providing advertisement to user's set 250.Can provide advertisement explicitly with the Search Results that provides by search engine 220.Yet the Email that content that can provide with content server 230 and/or e-mail server 240 and/or subscriber equipment Email facility provide provides content relevant advertisement explicitly.
As discussing in 900 applications, can come advertisement delivery to the document that content server provided as target.Thereby an example of ad consumer 130 is general content servers 230, and this content server 230 receives document (for example, article, discuss and paste music, video, figure, Search Results, web page listings etc.) request, and respond this request or other services and retrieve the document of being asked clearly.Content server can be to the request of Advertisement Server 120/210 submission to advertisement.This ad-request can comprise some desired advertisements.Ad-request may also comprise document request information.These information can comprise: document itself (for example, the page), corresponding to the classification of document content or document request or theme (for example, art, commerce, computing machine, art film, arts-music etc.), some or all document request, content age, content type (for example, text, figure, video, audio frequency, mixed-media etc.), geographical location information, document information etc.
The other example of ad consumer 130 is search engines 220.Search engine 220 can receive inquiry and be used for Search Results.In response, search engine can retrieve relevant search results the index of webpage (for example, from).A kind of exemplary search engine is that article " TheAnatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine " and the sequence number of S.Brin and L.Page is 6 on the 7th international web-seminar of Australian Brisbane, describe (both contents being incorporated into for your guidance) in 285,999 the United States Patent (USP) at this.The text extract that this Search Results for example comprises the tabulation of web page title, extract from these webpages and to the hypertext link of these webpages, and Search Results can divide into groups every group of predetermined number (for example ten).
At last, usually, e-mail server 240 can be considered to content server, and wherein the document that is provided is exactly an Email.Further, email application (such as Microsoft Outlook) can be used for sending and/or the reception Email.Therefore, e-mail server 240 or application program can be considered to ad consumer 130.Thereby Email can be considered to document, and can provide the advertisement of targeted with this document explicitly.For example, can among the Email, under, on advertisement is provided, perhaps provide advertisement explicitly with Email by other means.
Though above-mentioned example has been described by server (i) request advertisement and (ii) combined advertisements and content, one or two of these operations can be carried out by client device (such as final user's computing machine).
§ 3 exemplary embodiments
Fig. 3 is the data flow diagram of the exemplary operation that is used to the expense of adjusting carried out according to mode according to the invention, and produce by these operations and/or by these information of manipulating.Expense determine operation 340 can be used for utilizing (a) user perception probability factor 320 and/or (b) user's perception estimate that (will be watched by the user or the possibility of perception otherwise as advertisement) determine or be adjusted into the price 350 of advertisement presentation payment, user's perception is estimated to estimate to determine that by user's perception operation 330 produces.For example, seen by the user because the advertisement that the advertisement putting point at the top of webpage provides is easier, concerning the advertiser, such advertisement presentation is just more valuable than manifesting of the advertisement that advertisement putting point provides of webpage bottom, especially originally cannot see, has only under situation about just can see during the roll screen curtain under the user when the bottom of webpage.As other example, advertisement that the advertisement putting point of content (temporarily shielding at least) provides is easier to be seen by the user owing to block on webpage, concerning the advertiser, such advertisement presentation is just than more valuable away from manifesting of the advertisement that advertisement putting point provides of main contents on the webpage.Also has other example, than blog web page, the user more is likely to scroll down to the webpage bottom on product review web page, therefore, than the advertisement that the advertisement putting point in the blog web page bottom provides, the advertisement that the advertisement putting point in the product review web page bottom provides more may be seen by the user.Like this, concerning the advertiser, more valuable than the advertisement presentation of blog web page bottom in the advertisement presentation of product review web page bottom.
Can use user's perception to estimate to carry out the expense adjustment, or use the one or more factors 320 that can be used for determining this estimation.These factors comprise following one or more: advertising message (for example, such as plain text, animation, audio frequency, video, the adline of image etc., advertisement size, the advertisement font size, advertisement color etc.), customer equipment information is (as browser type and version, screen size, display resolution, speaker volume, quiet opening/close, user input apparatus etc.), document information is (as Doctype, document size, the document age, the ratio of the relative content space of the advertisement putting space of points, user residence time etc.), the advertising service parameter, advertisement putting dot information (the absolute and relative position of advertisement putting point, selection rate by advertisement putting point, mouse-over by advertisement putting point, mouse-over by advertisement putting point, the propinquity of advertisement putting point and document content, advertisement putting point blocks document content, advertisement putting point is sheltered document content, the contiguous content of advertisement putting point, and the advertisement putting point separates with content, the advertisement putting point be embedded among the content (as by content around), advertisement putting point partly or entirely blocks or shelters content (or other advertisements), and advertisement putting point is partly or entirely blocked or sheltered by content (or other advertisements), and end user information is (as user's mouse-over information, the user advertising click information, user's information residence time, user's roll screen information, eyes of user mobile message etc.), enquiry data, focal group's data, reading rate data (determining as utilizing cookie) if its someone who has represented advertisement has been visited afterwards the website of mentioning or the webpage of advertisement.Therefore, user's perception probability factor 320 can comprise that information provides the advertisement will be by some indication of user's perception (as watching).
Can by user, class of user type, by document, by Doctype, by advertisement (or advertisement putting point) and/or by advertisement (or advertisement putting point) follow the tracks of, storage and/or user application perception probability factor.
User's perception estimate to determine that operation 330 can be from user's perception probability factor 320 acquired informations, and use this information according to advertisement with viewed, perception or determine the relative worth estimation of advertisement presentation with the possibility (probability) that other certain modes are discovered.Such estimation can be used for expense and determines operation 340, and this operation can use this to estimate to adjust advertisement presentation price 350.As an alternative or as additional, expense determines that operation 340 can be used user's perception probability factor 320 one or morely comes re-set price.
§ 3.1 exemplary methods
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram of the illustrative methods 400 of estimation that is used for determining the advertisement presentation relative worth according to the invention and corresponding adjustment advertisement presentation expense.
Especially, the estimation (frame 410) of the relative worth of advertisement presentation can be determined or receive to method 400.In case determine or receive described estimation, method 400 can be used this price of estimating to adjust advertisement presentation (frame 420) before leaving method 400 (node 430).Therefore, method 400 can be adjusted (improve or reduce) charge to advertisement presentation according to estimated advertisement relative worth (as the probability of being watched and discovering by the user).This can be used for releasing from advertisement is mainly specified different every impression prices to different advertisement putting points (or different channels) needs.
Referring to frame 410, determine that the action of estimation (relatively) value of advertisement presentation can comprise that whether this advertisement of estimation is with in sight or perception again.As discussing among the top § 3, determine that whether advertisement is with the responsible some factors of the action of in sight or perception.Especially, in these factors some can comprise: the position of advertisement presentation on webpage, whether advertisement is presented in initial visible position on the webpage, the possibility of browser roll screen (this dependence represents browser type, user's roll screen history and/or the scrolling of document history of this advertisement), or the like.
Referring to frame 420, the estimation adjustment that method 400 can use (relatively) of determined advertisement presentation to be worth will be paid the price of advertisement presentation.Understand from above-mentioned, the price of adjustment is relevant to advertisement with in sight and possibility that discover.For example, the eye-catcher that is presented in the initial visible part of webpage can be by price in full, and the unshowy advertisement that is presented in the initial invisible part of webpage (only when user's roll screen as seen) can be fixed a price by the discounting of usefulness in full.
Fig. 5 is the process flow diagram that at least one user's perception factor of use according to the invention is adjusted the illustrative methods 500 of advertisement presentation expense.
Especially, method 500 can receive or definite advertisement presentation relative worth can based at least one factor (frame 510).Then, before leaving method 500 (node 530), method 500 utilizes described factor adjustment to be used for the price of advertisement presentation (frame 520).Therefore, method 500 makes ad system to use to influence one or more factors of advertisement presentation relative worth to adjust the paying price to advertisement presentation.This can be used for the releasing from advertisement master specifies different every impression prices to different advertisement putting points (or different channels) needs.
Again referring to frame 510, influence advertisement whether will to be seen/factor of perception can be included in those factors of discussing with reference to figure 3 among the top § 3.These factors can come to determine differently.
Again referring to frame 520, method 500 can be used at frame 510 and receive or the described factor determined is adjusted paying price to advertisement presentation.And, to understand from above-mentioned, the price of being adjusted can be associated with the factor of the possibility of the in sight or perception of this advertisement of indication.For example, the eye-catcher that is presented in the initial visible part of webpage can be by price in full, and the unshowy advertisement that is presented in the initial invisible part of webpage (only when user's roll screen as seen) can be fixed a price by the discounting of usefulness in full.

§ 3.3 improves and replaces
But this system also data of end user's class definition helps definite adjustment paying price to advertisement presentation.For example, but the data of the end user of this system class definition, can be described as the website of eye-catcher and location advertising " (premium) at high price ", and website and location advertising with not showy advertisement of low user interactions are described as " (run ofsite) rotates " with high user interactions.For example, all " at high price " positions of human definable are not at log in page or chat page or leaf.In this case, not by the full price charge as in a log in page or a chat page advertisement that represents in " at high price " position.
According to manifest the actual information, historical information, research (as the market share, user interactions etc.) and/or the investigation information that are associated and wait to determine user's perception probability factor.Like this, for example, client terminal device information can relate to its actual device that particular advertisement is provided (as 21 inches monitors, 768 * 1024 pixel resolutions, 4.0 versions of operation Microsoft Explorer), or from the investigation or client terminal device (15 inches monitors as about 50%, 17 inches monitors of about 20%, 19 inches monitors of about 16% of historical data, about 85% Explorer browser, about 8% netscape browser, about 5% Firefox browser, be rolled into the bottom under the webpage of 78% time specific (type) ..., etc.).As other example, relevant advertisements (release position) position can be determined by server application.For example, server can be according to the representing engine and various screen settings come displaying web page of the most popular browser, and the various combinations (as Internet Explorer and 800 * 600) that browser and screen are provided with are determined whether advertisement is presented at the initial screen top (user does not need roll screen) of webpage.Marketing data and screen setting about the browser market share can be used for determining for the percentage of time of typical case's (or given type) user advertising at the initial visible part of webpage.Such number percent can be used as user's perception probability factor.
In some embodiment according to the invention at least, can use the Java code that is used for asking I frame (I-frame is for example referring to 900 applications) to determine the position of advertisement on the webpage (or advertisement putting point).
Type of webpage (as publisher's form and theme) also is useful.For example, each webpage or publisher can use different forms, and at least wherein some have quite predictable user interaction model.Can detect these forms and use interaction models to determine that advertisement presentation will be by the possibility of user's perception.For example, unlikely being seen by the user or otherwise perception of advertisement putting point bottom blog web page.On the other hand, just seen by the user easily or otherwise perception at the advertisement putting point of product review web page bottom.As other example, the advertisement meeting of showing in news web page (as the New York Times) bottom seen by all people that read whole article, and this system can use the investigation information of collection and behavioral data to estimate to read user's number percent of the article of this webpage end.Therefore, this system can use type of webpage and user interaction model to determine the possibility that advertisement will be seen by the final user.Can be used for relative worth that different web pages type estimating ad is manifested like this, again.
The example of document (as webpage) type that can the modeling user interactions comprises: business to business (B2B) ﹠amp; Special industry, business to consumer (B2C) ﹠amp; Online retailer, Bo Ke ﹠amp; Daily record, Liu Lanqi ﹠amp; Media player, chat ﹠amp; Forum, Cheng Shizhinan ﹠amp; Local information, classification ﹠amp; Tabulation, Mu Lu ﹠amp; Reference, the field channel is downloaded ﹠amp; Set of links, fan's Zhan Dian ﹠amp; Proposition community, expert's website, FAQ﹠amp; Technical information, recreation ﹠amp; Interaction, Zhu Ye ﹠amp; Landing page, picture compiles, login ﹠amp; Site information (publisher's quality), news content, Xiao Shengjing ﹠amp; Special-purpose door, online magazine, other, About You, Men Hu ﹠amp; ISP, Chan Pinpinglun ﹠amp; Consumer information, Rich Media's (audio/video), search, social networks and waste advertisements.
In addition, use special browser or javascript to come to collect the possibility that the roll screen data help also to determine that advertisement will be seen by the user from sample of users.Particular Web page can portraying by this sample of users and this webpage alternately.As an alternative or additional, certain web page type can be portrayed alternately by the webpage of this sample of users and general format.As an alternative or additional, one or more other group of web (as by the field, by the content author, by the content proposition etc.) can by this sample of users and intersection of sets portray mutually.The roll screen data can comprise relevant to the frequency and the number of times that roll and descend to roll on website (or by website form or type, or by the website group) or the webpage by the user.Therefore, server can use this roll screen data to help to determine in the advertisement of advertisement putting point (as sightless advertisement putting point on the screen originally) for given final user and/or can descried possibility for given webpage.
Also can use the selection history of (as clicking).For example, the click data from indivedual agate lines of can collecting is used for the possibility of determining that this advertisement is seen by the final user, sees because of deducibility has clicked its user of the advertisement meeting of high selectivity.Also can according to classification go out as shown quantity, advertisement and the webpage of the type of advertisement theme, webpage or website form (usually can be not selected as the advertisement on log in page, if but the website visible part on screen then in sight easily) wait the collected historical data of standardizing.To given webpage, may there be enough selection data to determine reliable result.Therefore, can assemble from the selection historical data of similar webpage and determine prediction the given webpage that is similar to (or belonging to) group of web of describing.As described conception expansion, also can determine the possibility that advertisement is seen by specific objective audient (as the teenager of playing video game).In the time of the assessed value determined advertisement presentation, can consider the probability and possibility that advertisement is seen by the final user.
It is also conceivable that perception preference (as from eye movement follow-up study mechanism).
Can use real data to replace or correction model information (as (as hover, selection etc.) alternately of actual user's mutual (as roll screen, rapid navigation), actual user and the advertisement of, the information that is actually used about browser, actual user and this webpage) is upgraded the predetermined possibility that the particular advertisement release position is observed.For example, if the user selects its browser " rollback " button fast, then deducibility advertisement probability in sight or perception will reduce.As other example, if the user selects this advertisement, then this advertisement of deducibility probability in sight or perception should be 1 or greater than 1.
The adjustment of paying price can be that lasting price adjustment (estimating as multiply by user's perception probability by initial price), ladder advance formula adjustment (originally invisible as advertisement putting point, as then to reduce half) etc.That price adjustment can be used is heuristic (as, then use first to adjust formula if specific factor occurs, otherwise and other factor occurs and then use second formula, otherwise and other factor does not appear then by the par charge).Didactic example can be:
If-this advertisement putting point is at the top of document, then by following charge
-animated advertising that has audio frequency is received valency,
-image ad is received 80%,
-the big font colour advertisement is received 60%, and
-common plain text advertisement is received 50%, and
-otherwise
If-type of webpage has at least 75% the following rate of rolling, then by following charge
-animated advertising that has audio frequency is received 85%,
-image ad is received 70%,
-the big font colour advertisement is received 55%,
-common plain text advertisement is received 40%,
If-this type of webpage has the following rate of rolling between 25% to 75%, then by following charge
Roll rate * (max[1, the heuristic selection rate of this advertisement putting point of 10*]) under-price *, and
If-this type of webpage has 25% or the lower following rate of rolling, charge 10%.
Be appreciated that to also have many possible modes that are consistent with the present invention from above-mentioned example, be used to use user's perception probability factor to come the adjustment expense.
Although many above-mentioned examples relate to probability or the factor relevant with user's perception of advertisement, embodiment according to the invention can use with the advertisement user of any kind and discover probability or the factor that is associated.
